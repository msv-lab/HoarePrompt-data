Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Kirill wants to pick mushrooms under the Wise Oak to make an elixir. Each mushroom has a magic power, and there are n mushrooms in total. The strength of the elixir is determined by the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. That makes sense. So, if he picks k mushrooms, the strength is k times the smallest magic power among those k mushrooms.

But there's a catch. There's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic power of the mushrooms with indices p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes zero. He can't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir. That means that for each k, certain mushrooms become unusable, and I need to account for that.

My task is to help Kirill pick mushrooms in such a way that he maximizes the strength of the elixir, and among all options that give this maximum strength, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the permutation p. It's a sequence that defines which mushrooms lose their magic power when Kirill picks a certain number of mushrooms. So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

I need to find the optimal k, the number of mushrooms to pick, such that the strength, which is k times the minimum magic power among the usable mushrooms, is maximized. And among all such k values that give this maximum strength, I should choose the smallest k.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to iterate through all possible k from 1 to n, calculate the strength for each k, and keep track of the maximum strength and the smallest k that achieves it.

But n can be up to 200,000, and t, the number of test cases, can be up to 10,000. So, iterating naively through all k for each test case would be too slow. I need a more efficient way.

Let's think about what happens when Kirill picks k mushrooms. The first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero, so he can't use them. That means he can only use mushrooms that are not among the first k-1 in the permutation.

So, the usable mushrooms are those that are not in the first k-1 positions of p. In other words, they are the mushrooms that are picked after the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation.

Wait, but Kirill picks mushrooms in a certain order, and the permutation p defines the order in which mushrooms lose their magic power.

Actually, it's a bit confusing. Let's rephrase.

When Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero. So, he can only use mushrooms that are not among the first k-1 in p.

Therefore, the usable mushrooms are those with indices not in p[1] to p[k-1].

But this seems tricky to handle directly. Maybe I can think about it differently.

Let's consider that for each k, the mushrooms that lose their magic power are p[1] to p[k-1]. So, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n], because they haven't lost their magic power yet.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, so he can choose any k mushrooms, but the first k-1 in the permutation have their magic power set to zero. So, the mushrooms that have non-zero magic power are those not among the first k-1 in p.

So, for a given k, the usable mushrooms are those not in p[1] to p[k-1].

So, to maximize the strength, which is k times the minimum magic power among the usable mushrooms, I need to choose k and the set of mushrooms such that the minimum magic power among the usable mushrooms is maximized, and among those, choose the smallest k.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power and then decide how many to pick.

Wait, but the permutation p affects which mushrooms lose their magic power, so I need to consider that.

Let me try to think about it step by step.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power. Let's say I have a sorted list of mushrooms: v_sorted[1] >= v_sorted[2] >= ... >= v_sorted[n].

Now, for each k, I need to choose k mushrooms such that the minimum among them is as large as possible, and also account for the fact that some mushrooms have their magic power set to zero.

But it's not straightforward because the permutation p defines which mushrooms lose their magic power based on k.

Maybe I can iterate over k from 1 to n, and for each k, determine which mushrooms have non-zero magic power, and then choose the k mushrooms with the highest magic power among those with non-zero magic power.

Wait, but that might not be efficient enough for large n.

Is there a smarter way to do this?

Let me consider that for a given k, the mushrooms that have not lost their magic power are those not in p[1] to p[k-1]. So, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n].

So, for each k, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n].

Then, the minimum magic power among these usable mushrooms is the smallest v among p[k] to p[n].

Wait, but Kirill needs to pick k mushrooms from these usable ones, and the strength is k times the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms.

So, to maximize the strength, he should pick the k mushrooms with the highest magic power from the usable ones.

But, since the minimum magic power will be the smallest among these k, to maximize k times the minimum, I need to balance between k and the minimum.

This seems like a classic problem of maximizing the product of the number of elements and the smallest element in the set.

I recall that for such problems, a binary search approach can be used.

Wait, but in this case, there's an additional constraint due to the permutation p.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the minimum magic power, say m, and then find the largest k such that I can pick k mushrooms with at least m magic power, considering the constraints from p.

Then, the strength would be k * m.

I can try to maximize k * m over all possible m.

But I need to find the optimal k and m.

This sounds a bit complicated.

Maybe I can sort the mushrooms based on their magic power and the order in the permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the permutation p based on the magic power of the mushrooms.

Let me try to think about sorting p based on v[p[i]].

Suppose I sort the permutation p in decreasing order of v[p[i]].

Then, p_sorted would have the mushrooms with the highest magic power first.

Then, for each k, the usable mushrooms are p_sorted[k:].

Wait, but I need to relate this to the original p.

This might not be directly applicable.

Let me consider the following approach.

I can iterate through the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

As I iterate, I can keep track of how many mushrooms I've considered so far, and their positions in the permutation p.

Then, for each mushroom, I can calculate the strength if I pick a certain number of mushrooms including this one.

This might be too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Then, for each position in this sorted list, I can find out their positions in the original permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I can use the idea of sorting v in decreasing order and then finding the optimal k based on their positions in p.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of v, let's say sorted_v.

Then, for each k, I pick the first k mushrooms from sorted_v, but I need to make sure that in the permutation p, the positions of these mushrooms are such that they haven't lost their magic power.

But this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the strength is k * min(v), where k is the number of mushrooms picked, and min(v) is the smallest magic power among them.

Given that some mushrooms lose their magic power based on k, I need to maximize k * min(v) over all possible k and the corresponding usable mushrooms.

I need to find the k that maximizes k * min(v_usable), where v_usable are the mushrooms that haven't lost their magic power.

Given that the mushrooms that lose their magic power are p[1] to p[k-1], so the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n].

So, for a given k, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n].

Among these, Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, but since he wants to maximize the strength, he should pick the k mushrooms with the highest magic power from p[k] to p[n].

Then, the minimum magic power among these k mushrooms would be the k-th smallest magic power in p[k] to p[n].

Wait, actually, to maximize k * min(v), he should pick the k mushrooms with the highest magic power from the usable ones, but the minimum among them would be the k-th largest in the usable set.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of choosing k and then selecting the k highest magic power mushrooms from p[k] to p[n].

So, for a given k, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n].

From these, he picks k mushrooms with the highest magic power.

The minimum magic power among these k mushrooms would be the k-th largest in p[k] to p[n].

So, the strength is k * (k-th largest in p[k] to p[n]).

I need to maximize this over k from 1 to n.

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest value in p[k] to p[n], multiply it by k, and find the maximum among all these products.

That seems manageable.

But n can be up to 200,000, and t can be up to 10,000, so I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to compute, for each k, the k-th largest value in p[k] to p[n].

Wait, p[k] to p[n] is a suffix of the permutation p.

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest value in the suffix p[k:].

But p[k:] has n - k + 1 elements.

Wait, but I need to pick k mushrooms from p[k:].

So, I need to find the k-th largest value in p[k:].

Wait, no.

Actually, when I pick k mushrooms from p[k:] with the highest magic power, the minimum among them would be the k-th largest in p[k:].

Wait, to clarify:

If I sort the magic powers in p[k:] in decreasing order, the k-th largest would be the value at position k.

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest magic power in p[k:], and then compute k * (k-th largest in p[k:]).

Then, among all these k * (k-th largest in p[k:]), I need to find the maximum.

That seems correct.

Now, how do I efficiently compute, for each k from 1 to n, the k-th largest value in p[k:].

n is up to 200,000, so I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider sorting the suffix p[k:] for each k, but that's too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the entire list v[p[k]:], but again, that's not efficient.

Wait, maybe I can sort all v[p[i]] for i from k to n, and then pick the k-th largest.

But sorting for each k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can sort the entire list v[p[1]] to v[p[n]], and then for each k, the k-th largest in p[k:] would be the k-th largest in the sorted suffix starting from p[k].

Wait, but I need to sort each suffix separately, which is still O(n log n).

But n is up to 200,000, and t is up to 10,000, so O(t * n log n) would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that p is a permutation, so p[1] to p[n] is a rearrangement of 1 to n.

But v[p[i]] is the magic power of mushroom p[i].

Wait, perhaps I can consider the magic powers in the order specified by p.

So, v[p[1]], v[p[2]], ..., v[p[n]] is the sequence of magic powers in the order defined by p.

Then, for each k, the suffix p[k:] has magic powers v[p[k]], v[p[k+1]], ..., v[p[n]].

I need to find, for each k, the k-th largest value in v[p[k:]].

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest value in the suffix starting at k.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can maintain a data structure that allows me to query the k-th largest value in a suffix.

One way to do this is to sort the entire list v[p[1]] to v[p[n]] in decreasing order, and then for each k, find the k-th value in this sorted list.

Wait, but that wouldn't account for the suffix starting at k.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, if I sort the entire list in decreasing order, that would give me the k-th largest value in the entire list, not in the suffix starting at k.

So, that's not directly useful.

I need a way to find, for each k, the k-th largest value in the suffix p[k:].

One way to do this is to reverse the list p, so p[n] to p[1], and then compute the k-th largest in the prefix of the reversed list starting from p[k].

Wait, perhaps I can sort the suffixes efficiently.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the entire list v[p[1]] to v[p[n]] in decreasing order.

Let's call this sorted list s.

Then, for each k, the k-th largest in p[k:] would be s[k + n - p[k:] length].

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a data structure that allows me to find the k-th largest value in a range.

But that sounds too slow for the constraints.

Wait, maybe I can sort the magic powers in decreasing order and then, using a two-pointer approach, find the optimal k.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I sort the magic powers in decreasing order: s[1] >= s[2] >= ... >= s[n].

Now, for each possible minimum value s[m], I can find the maximum k such that k * s[m] is maximized.

But I need to consider the positions of these s[m] in the permutation p.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think about maximizing k * min(v).

This is similar to maximizing the area of a rectangle with one side as k and the other as min(v).

I recall that in some problems, we sort the elements and then iterate to find the maximum product.

Wait, maybe I can sort the magic powers in decreasing order and then iterate through k from 1 to n, keeping track of the minimum value in the current subset.

But I need to account for the permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the permutation p based on v[p[i]] in decreasing order.

Then, for each k, the suffix p[k:] would have the lowest magic power as s[k], where s is the sorted list.

Wait, no, because p is a permutation, and I need to consider the actual positions.

This is getting too confusing.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix k and try to find the strongest possible elixir for that k.

For a given k, the usable mushrooms are p[k] to p[n], meaning the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero and cannot be used.

So, I need to pick k mushrooms from p[k] to p[n], and the strength is k times the minimum magic power among these k mushrooms.

To maximize the strength for this k, I should pick the k mushrooms with the highest magic power from p[k] to p[n].

Then, the minimum magic power among these k mushrooms would be the k-th largest magic power in p[k] to p[n].

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest magic power in p[k] to p[n], and then compute k times that value.

Then, among all these k times the k-th largest in p[k:], I need to find the maximum value.

That makes sense.

Now, how do I efficiently compute, for each k from 1 to n, the k-th largest magic power in p[k:]?

One way is to reverse the permutation p and then for each k, find the k-th largest in the first n - k + 1 elements.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the suffixes.

But that seems inefficient.

Wait, here's an idea.

If I sort the magic powers v[p[n]] to v[p[1]] in decreasing order, then for each k, the k-th largest in p[k:] would correspond to the k-th position in this sorted list, adjusted for the suffix.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of sorting the magic powers and then finding the appropriate k-th values.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider using a data structure that can efficiently find the k-th largest value in a subset.

In Python, there's a library called 'bisect' that can help with sorted lists.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a sorted list of v[p[k]] to v[p[n]] for each k, but that would be too slow for n up to 200,000.

Wait, but there's a class called 'SortedMultiset' in the given code, which seems to be a custom implementation of a sorted multiset.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to use this SortedMultiset to handle the sorted list efficiently.

Let me look at the code to understand what it's doing.

The code defines a SortedMultiset class, which is a generic class that can store elements of type T and perform operations like add, discard, bisect left, bisect right, etc., all in O(√N) time per operation.

Then, in the main function, it reads t, the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads n, the number of mushrooms, the list v of their magic powers, and the permutation p.

Then, it creates a list a, where a[i] = -v[p[i] - 1] for i from 0 to n-1.

Wait, p is 1-indexed, so p[i] is from 1 to n, and v is 0-indexed from 0 to n-1.

So, a[i] = -v[p[i] - 1], which is negating the magic power of mushroom p[i].

Then, it creates a SortedMultiset r from a.

Then, it initializes ans = -1 and idx = 1.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to floor(n/2), and for each i, it computes x = (i + 1) * -r[i], where r[i] is the i-th element in the SortedMultiset r.

If x > ans, it updates ans = x and idx = i + 1.

Then, it discards a[i] from r.

Finally, it prints ans and idx.

Wait, let's understand what's happening here.

First, it creates a list a where a[i] = -v[p[i+1]], with p being 1-indexed.

So, a[0] = -v[p[1] - 1], a[1] = -v[p[2] - 1], and so on.

Then, it creates a SortedMultiset r from a, which is a sorted collection of these negative magic powers.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to floor(n/2), computes x = (i + 1) * -r[i], which is (i + 1) times the (i)-th element in r, which is sorted in ascending order since r is a sorted multiset.

But a[i] is -v[p[i+1]], so r[i] is the i-th smallest negative magic power, meaning -r[i] is the i-th largest magic power.

So, x = k * min(v), where k = i + 1, and min(v) is the k-th largest magic power in the suffix p[k:].

Wait, is that correct?

Actually, since r is a sorted multiset of a, which is -v[p[1]] to -v[p[n]], sorted in ascending order, so r[i] is the i-th smallest negative magic power, which corresponds to the i-th largest magic power in v[p[1]] to v[p[n]].

Wait, no.

Let me clarify.

a[i] = -v[p[i+1]], so r is sorted in ascending order of a[i], which are negative values.

So, r[i] is the i-th smallest negative value, which corresponds to the i-th largest magic power in v[p[1]] to v[p[n]].

Wait, no.

If a[i] = -v[p[i+1]], and r is sorted in ascending order of a[i], which are negative, then r[i] is the i-th smallest negative value, which corresponds to the i-th largest magic power.

Wait, actually, in a sorted multiset in ascending order, the smallest elements come first.

So, r[0] is the smallest a[i], which is the most negative v[p[1]], assuming v[p[1]] is the smallest.

Wait, no, v[p[1]] could be any value.

Wait, v[p[1]] is the magic power of the first mushroom in the permutation p.

By negating it, a[0] = -v[p[1]], so in r, which is sorted in ascending order, the smallest a[i] (most negative) will be first.

So, r[0] is the smallest a[i], which is the most negative v[p[i]], meaning the largest v[p[i]].

Wait, yes.

So, r[0] corresponds to the largest v[p[i]], because a[i] = -v[p[i]].

Similarly, r[i] corresponds to the (i+1)-th largest v[p[i]].

Wait, no.

Wait, since r is sorted in ascending order of a[i], which are negative v[p[i]], then r[0] is the smallest a[i], which is the most negative v[p[i]], meaning the largest v[p[i]].

So, r[0] corresponds to the largest v[p[i]], r[1] to the second largest, and so on.

Therefore, for a given k, the k-th largest v[p[i]] is -r[k-1].

Wait, let's see.

For k=1, the largest v[p[i]] is -r[0].

For k=2, the second largest is -r[1], and so on.

So, in general, the k-th largest in v[p[i]] is -r[k-1].

But in our problem, for each k, we need the k-th largest in p[k:].

But in the code, it's computing x = (i + 1) * -r[i], which is k * -r[k-1], assuming i starts from 0 to floor(n/2).

Wait, in the code, i goes from 0 to floor(n/2), and k = i + 1.

So, it's computing k * -r[i], where -r[i] should be the (i+1)-th largest in v[p[1]] to v[p[n]].

But in our problem, for each k, we need the k-th largest in p[k:].

So, for k=1, p[1:] has n elements, and the 1st largest is -r[0].

For k=2, p[2:] has n-1 elements, and the 2nd largest in p[2:].

Wait, this seems tricky.

I think there's a mistake in the code's approach.

Wait, perhaps the SortedMultiset r is meant to represent the suffix p[k:] for each k.

But in the code, it's creating r from a, which is -v[p[1]] to -v[p[n]].

Then, for each k from 1 to floor(n/2) + 1, it computes x = k * -r[i], where i = k - 1.

But I'm not sure if this correctly captures the k-th largest in p[k:].

Wait, perhaps the SortedMultiset is being modified by discarding elements as k increases.

Looking back at the code, after computing x, it discards a[i] from r.

So, r starts with all a[0] to a[n-1], and then discards a[0], then a[1], and so on.

So, for each k from 1 to floor(n/2) + 1, it computes x = k * -r[i], where i = k - 1, and then discards a[i].

Wait, but a[i] = -v[p[i+1]], so discarding a[i] removes -v[p[i+1]] from r.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix k, and I need to pick k mushrooms from p[k:] with the highest magic powers.

The minimum magic power among these k mushrooms would be the k-th largest in p[k:].

To maximize k * min(v), I need to choose k and the corresponding min(v) such that their product is maximized.

So, for each k, I need to find the k-th largest v in p[k:].

Then, compute k * min(v), where min(v) is the k-th largest in p[k:].

Then, find the maximum over all k.

But I need an efficient way to compute the k-th largest in p[k:] for each k.

An alternative approach is to iterate over possible min(v) and find the maximum k for which min(v) is the k-th largest in p[k:].

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can sort the magic powers in decreasing order and then iterate through possible min(v).

Let me consider sorting the magic powers in decreasing order: s[0] >= s[1] >= ... >= s[n-1].

Then, for each possible min(v) = s[j], I need to find the largest k such that s[j] is the k-th largest in p[k:].

This is still confusing.

Let me consider that for a given min(v) = s[j], I need to find the largest k such that in p[k:], there are at least k mushrooms with magic power >= s[j].

Then, the strength would be k * s[j].

I need to maximize this over all possible j and k.

This seems similar to finding the maximum rectangle in a histogram.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the magic powers and then use a stack to find the optimal k for each possible min(v).

But I need to consider the positions in p.

This is getting too complicated.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting to compute the maximum strength and the corresponding k by iterating over k from 1 to floor(n/2) + 1, computing x = k * -r[i], where r is a SortedMultiset of -v[p[1]] to -v[p[n]], and then discarding a[i] after each iteration.

I suspect that this approach might not be correct, but I need to verify it with some examples.

Let's take the first test case from the example:

Input:

6

3

9 8 14

3 2 1

5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

6

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5 4 3 2 1

5

1 4 6 10 10

2 1 4 5 3

4

2 2 5 5

4 2 3 1

5

1 2 9 10 10

1 4 2 3 5

Output:

16 2

9 3

8 2

20 2

5 1

20 2

Let's take the first test case:

n = 3

v = [9, 8, 14]

p = [3, 2, 1]

So, p[1] = 3, p[2] = 2, p[3] = 1.

a[0] = -v[p[1]-1] = -v[2] = -8

a[1] = -v[p[2]-1] = -v[1] = -9

a[2] = -v[p[3]-1] = -v[0] = -14

So, r = SortedMultiset([-8, -9, -14])

Sorted in ascending order: [-14, -9, -8]

Then, it iterates i from 0 to floor(3/2) = 1:

For i=0, k=1, x = 1 * -r[0] = 1 * -(-14) = 14

If 14 > -1, set ans=14, idx=1

Then discard a[0] = -8 from r, so r = [-14, -9]

For i=1, k=2, x = 2 * -r[1] = 2 * -(-9) = 18

18 > 14, set ans=18, idx=2

Then discard a[1] = -9 from r, so r = [-14]

But according to the sample output, it should be 16 2, but here it's computing 18 2.

Wait, that doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Looking back, in the code, it's x = (i + 1) * -r[i]

So, for i=0, k=1, x=1 * -r[0] = 1 * -(-14) = 14

For i=1, k=2, x=2 * -r[1] = 2 * -(-9) = 18

But the sample output is 16 2.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is wrong.

Let me compute manually for the first test case.

n=3

v=[9,8,14]

p=[3,2,1]

So, p[1]=3, p[2]=2, p[3]=1

For k=1:

Usable mushrooms are p[1:] = p[1], p[2], p[3] = 3,2,1

So, mushrooms with indices 3,2,1 have v[2], v[0], v[1] = 14,9,8

Pick k=1 mushroom with highest magic power: 14

Strength: 1 * 14 = 14

For k=2:

Usable mushrooms are p[2:] = p[2], p[3] = 2,1

So, mushrooms with indices 2,1 have v[0], v[1] = 9,8

Pick k=2 mushrooms with highest magic power: 9 and 8, min=8

Strength: 2 * 8 = 16

For k=3:

Usable mushrooms are p[3:] = p[3] = 1

So, mushroom with index 1 has v[0] = 9

But k=3 requires picking 3 mushrooms, but only one is usable, which is not enough.

So, invalid.

Therefore, the maximum strength is 16 with k=2.

But according to the code, it's computing x=18 for k=2, which is incorrect.

So, the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, a[i] = -v[p[i+1]], so a[0] = -v[p[1]-1] = -v[2] = -8

a[1] = -v[p[2]-1] = -v[1] = -9

a[2] = -v[p[3]-1] = -v[0] = -14

Then, r = SortedMultiset([-8,-9,-14])

Sorted in ascending order: [-14,-9,-8]

Then, for i=0, k=1, x=1 * -r[0] = 1 * -(-14) = 14

Then, discard a[0] = -8 from r, so r = [-14,-9]

Then, for i=1, k=2, x=2 * -r[1] = 2 * -(-9) = 18

But according to manual calculation, for k=2, strength should be 16, not 18.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the code.

Wait, perhaps r is supposed to represent the usable mushrooms for each k.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the code more carefully.

Looking back, the code is iterating i from 0 to floor(n/2), computing x = (i + 1) * -r[i], and then discarding a[i].

But in the first test case, it computes x=14 for k=1 and x=18 for k=2, but the correct values are 14 and 16.

So, the code is wrong.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
