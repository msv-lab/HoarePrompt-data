Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n problems in a contest, each with a difficulty a_i, and each expected difficulty is b_i. Both arrays a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. The goal is to make sure that each a_i is less than or equal to b_i by proposing new problems with certain difficulties. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, it gets added to the a array, the array is sorted again, and then the most difficult problem is removed.

I need to find the minimum number of new problems to propose to achieve a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

First, I need to understand what's happening when I propose a new problem. I choose a difficulty w, insert it into a, sort a in non-decreasing order, and then remove the last element, which is the largest one. So effectively, I'm replacing the largest element in a with w, but w can be anything I choose.

Wait, no. Actually, I'm adding w to a, sorting it, and then removing the new largest element. So if w is less than the current largest element in a, then the largest element gets removed and w is incorporated into the sorted array. If w is greater than or equal to the current largest element, then w becomes the new largest element and gets removed immediately. So in this case, proposing a problem with difficulty w greater than or equal to the current largest in a doesn't change a at all, because w is added and then immediately removed.

Therefore, to make a_i ≤ b_i for all i, I need to ensure that after proposing and adjusting a certain number of times, the a array satisfies a_i ≤ b_i for each i.

Let me think about this step by step.

Given that a and b are both sorted in non-decreasing order, I can try to match each a_i with b_i directly. If a_i > b_i, I need to reduce a_i to be ≤ b_i. But since I can only propose new problems and adjust a as described, I need to find a way to reduce the largest elements in a by proposing problems with difficulties ≤ the current largest element in a.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. Since I can propose any w and add it to a, then sort a and remove the largest element, I can effectively replace the largest element in a with w.

But actually, it's not exactly replacing. Because when I add w and sort, then remove the largest element, if w is less than the current largest element in a, then the current largest element is removed and w is kept. If w is greater than or equal to the current largest, then w is removed immediately, and a remains the same.

Wait, no. If w is less than the current largest element in a, then after sorting, the largest element is still the old largest, which is greater than w, and then we remove that largest element, so the new largest element is the previous second largest, and w is now part of the array.

If w is greater than or equal to the current largest element in a, then after adding w and sorting, w becomes the new largest element and gets removed immediately, so a remains the same.

Therefore, proposing a w that is less than the current largest in a allows me to remove the current largest element and insert w into the array.

My goal is to make sure that after some number of such operations, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

I need to find the minimal number of such operations.

Let me consider the example provided:

First test case:

n = 6

a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]

Output: 2

Explanation:

1. Propose w=800

   - a becomes [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

   - Add 800: [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

   - Sort: [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

   - Remove the largest: [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]

2. Propose w=1800

   - a is [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]

   - Add 1800: [800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000, 2200]

   - Sort: [800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000, 2200]

   - Remove the largest: [800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i:

- 800 ≤ 800

- 1000 ≤ 1200

- 1400 ≤ 1500

- 1800 ≤ 1800

- 2000 ≤ 2200

- 2000 ≤ 3000

Second test case:

n = 6

a = [4,5,6,7,8,9]

b = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 3

Explanation:

1. Propose w=1

   - a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8]

2. Propose w=2

   - a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7]

3. Propose w=3

   - a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

From these examples, it seems that the number of operations needed is equal to the number of elements in a that are greater than the corresponding elements in b, starting from the end.

Wait, in the first test case, initially:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Comparing a_i and b_i:

- 1000 > 800 → need to reduce 1000 to ≤800

- 1400 > 1200 → need to reduce 1400 to ≤1200

- 2000 > 1500 → need to reduce 2000 to ≤1500

- 2000 > 1800 → need to reduce 2000 to ≤1800

- 2200 > 2200 → no, 2200 ≤ 2200

- 2700 > 3000 → no, 2700 ≤ 3000

Wait, 2700 > 3000? No, 2700 ≤ 3000.

Wait, 2700 ≤ 3000 is true.

Wait, but in the explanation, they proposed two problems: w=800 and w=1800.

After first operation:

a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

After second operation:

a: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, comparing with b:

- 800 ≤ 800

- 1000 ≤ 1200

- 1400 ≤ 1500

- 1800 ≤ 1800

- 2000 ≤ 2200

- 2000 ≤ 3000

All conditions satisfied.

But according to my earlier thought, I need to reduce a_i to be ≤ b_i for those a_i > b_i.

But in this case, initially:

- a1=1000 > b1=800 → need to reduce a1 to ≤800

- a2=1400 > b2=1200 → need to reduce a2 to ≤1200

- a3=2000 > b3=1500 → need to reduce a3 to ≤1500

- a4=2000 > b4=1800 → need to reduce a4 to ≤1800

- a5=2200 ≤ b5=2200 → no need

- a6=2700 ≤ b6=3000 → no need

So, I need to reduce the first four elements.

But in the solution, they only proposed two problems.

Wait, no. In the solution, they proposed two problems, but they reduced the largest elements effectively.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of elements in a that are strictly greater than the corresponding elements in b.

But in this case, it's not just the first four, because a5 and a6 are also compared with b5 and b6.

Wait, but a5=2200 ≤ b5=2200, so no need to reduce.

a6=2700 ≤ b6=3000, so no need.

So, only the first four need to be reduced.

But in the solution, they only proposed two problems.

Wait, perhaps it's not directly corresponding to individual elements.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following:

Since both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, I can use two pointers to iterate through a and b.

I can have one pointer for a and one for b.

I can iterate through a and b simultaneously and count how many a_i > b_j.

Wait, but they are both sorted, so perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach to count how many a_i > b_j for the same index i.

Wait, but in the first test case, there are four a_i > b_i, but only two operations are needed.

So, it's not directly equal to the number of a_i > b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n.

Wait, but in the first test case, four a_i > b_i, but only two operations are needed.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from n to 1.

Wait, let's try.

In the first test case:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Comparing from the end:

- a6=2700 ≤ b6=3000 → no need

- a5=2200 ≤ b5=2200 → no need

- a4=2000 > b4=1800 → need to reduce a4 to ≤1800

- a3=2000 > b3=1500 → need to reduce a3 to ≤1500

- a2=1400 > b2=1200 → need to reduce a2 to ≤1200

- a1=1000 > b1=800 → need to reduce a1 to ≤800

So, all a_i > b_i for i from 1 to 4.

But in the solution, only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps it's not simply counting the number of a_i > b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for the largest elements, considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from n down to 1, stopping when a_i <= b_i.

Wait, in the first test case, a4=2000 > b4=1800, a3=2000 > b3=1500, a2=1400 > b2=1200, a1=1000 > b1=800.

So, four elements need to be reduced.

But only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps there is some overlap or some way to reduce multiple a_i with one operation.

Wait, perhaps each operation can affect multiple a_i.

Wait, let's think about what one operation does.

When I propose a problem with difficulty w, I add w to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, effectively, I'm replacing the largest element in a with w, but only if w is less than the current largest element.

If w is greater than or equal to the largest element, then w is removed immediately, and a remains the same.

So, to reduce the largest element, I need to choose w less than the current largest element.

In the first operation, proposing w=800:

- a becomes [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700] + 800 → [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700] → sort → [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700] → remove the largest: 2700 → a = [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

So, the largest element 2700 is removed and replaced with 800.

Now, a is [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Comparing with b:

- 800 ≤ 800

- 1000 ≤ 1200

- 1400 ≤ 1500

- 2000 > 1800

- 2000 > 1800 (wait, b4=1800)

Wait, b is [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

a is [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

So:

- 800 ≤ 800

- 1000 ≤ 1200

- 1400 ≤ 1500

- 2000 ≤ 1800? No, 2000 > 1800 → need to reduce a4 to ≤1800

- 2000 ≤ 2200

- 2200 ≤ 3000

So, after one operation, only a4=2000 > b4=1800 needs to be reduced.

Then, propose w=1800:

- a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] + 1800 → [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200] → sort → [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200] → remove the largest: 2200 → a = [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, a is [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Comparing with b:

- 800 ≤ 800

- 1000 ≤ 1200

- 1400 ≤ 1500

- 1800 ≤ 1800

- 2000 ≤ 2200

- 2000 ≤ 3000

All conditions are satisfied.

So, with two operations, we reduced a4 from 2000 to 1800 and kept the rest.

Wait, but in the first operation, we reduced a6 from 2700 to 800, and in the second operation, we reduced a5 from 2200 to 1800.

Wait, but a5 was 2200, and after adding 1800, it becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200], then remove 2200, so a5 becomes 2000.

Wait, but in the explanation, they say a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000], and now a4=1800 ≤ b4=1800.

So, effectively, by proposing w=1800, we replaced the largest element that was greater than 1800.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many a_i are greater than b_j for the same i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for all i.

In the first test case, four a_i > b_i, but only two operations are needed.

Wait, maybe it's the number of a_i > b_i from the end of the array.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from n down to 1, until a_i <= b_i.

Wait, in the first test case, a6=2700 > b6=3000? No, 2700 ≤ 3000.

a5=2200 ≤ b5=2200.

a4=2000 > b4=1800.

a3=2000 > b3=1500.

a2=1400 > b2=1200.

a1=1000 > b1=800.

So, starting from the end:

a6 ≤ b6 → no need.

a5 ≤ b5 → no need.

a4 > b4 → need to reduce a4 to ≤1800.

a3 > b3 → need to reduce a3 to ≤1500.

a2 > b2 → need to reduce a2 to ≤1200.

a1 > b1 → need to reduce a1 to ≤800.

So, four elements need to be reduced.

But only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps each operation can reduce multiple elements.

Wait, when I propose a w and it replaces the largest a_i with w, if w is less than multiple a_i, then those a_i can be reduced in one operation.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times the current largest a_i is greater than the corresponding b_i, considering the sorted order.

Wait, maybe it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering the cumulative effect of operations.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but only counting the excess a_i over b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i that are still greater than b_i after considering the operations.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the second test case:

n=6

a=[4,5,6,7,8,9]

b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 3

Explanation:

1. Propose w=1 → a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8]

2. Propose w=2 → a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7]

3. Propose w=3 → a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

In this case, initially:

a1=4 > b1=1 → need to reduce a1 to ≤1

a2=5 > b2=2 → need to reduce a2 to ≤2

a3=6 > b3=3 → need to reduce a3 to ≤3

a4=7 > b4=4 → need to reduce a4 to ≤4

a5=8 > b5=5 → need to reduce a5 to ≤5

a6=9 > b6=6 → need to reduce a6 to ≤6

But with three operations, they reduced a4 to 1, a5 to 2, and a6 to 3.

Wait, no. In the operations, they proposed w=1, w=2, w=3.

Each time, w is added, the array is sorted, and the largest is removed.

After first operation:

a=[4,5,6,7,8,9] +1 → [1,4,5,6,7,8,9] → sort → [1,4,5,6,7,8,9] → remove the largest:9 → a=[1,4,5,6,7,8]

Now, a=[1,4,5,6,7,8]

Comparing with b:

1 ≤1

4 >2 → need to reduce

5 >3 → need to reduce

6 >4 → need to reduce

7 >5 → need to reduce

8 >6 → need to reduce

Still need to reduce four elements.

Then, propose w=2:

a=[1,4,5,6,7,8]+2 → [1,2,4,5,6,7,8] → sort → [1,2,4,5,6,7,8] → remove the largest:8 → a=[1,2,4,5,6,7]

Now, a=[1,2,4,5,6,7]

Comparing with b:

1 ≤1

2 ≤2

4 >3 → need to reduce

5 >4 → need to reduce

6 >5 → need to reduce

7 >6 → need to reduce

Still need to reduce four elements.

Then, propose w=3:

a=[1,2,4,5,6,7]+3 → [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] → sort → [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] → remove the largest:7 → a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Comparing with b:

1 ≤1

2 ≤2

3 ≤3

4 ≤4

5 ≤5

6 ≤6

All conditions satisfied.

So, with three operations, we reduced the array step by step.

But according to the first test case, it was only two operations.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of a_i > b_i for i from n down to 1, until a_i <= b_i.

Wait, in the first test case, starting from the end:

a6=2700 ≤ b6=3000 → no need.

a5=2200 ≤ b5=2200 → no need.

a4=2000 > b4=1800 → need to reduce.

a3=2000 > b3=1500 → need to reduce.

a2=1400 > b2=1200 → need to reduce.

a1=1000 > b1=800 → need to reduce.

So, starting from the beginning where a_i > b_i, which is a1 to a4.

But only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to k, where k is the point where a_i > b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering that each operation can reduce multiple a_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but stopping when a_i <= b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering the cumulative effect.

Wait, maybe it's the number of a_i that are still greater than b_i after considering the operations.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

Since a and b are sorted, I can use two pointers, one for a and one for b.

Initialize i=0 and j=0.

Iterate through a and b:

- If a[i] <= b[j], then it's fine, move both pointers.

- If a[i] > b[j], then I need to propose a new problem with difficulty w <= b[j], add it to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- This operation effectively reduces the largest element in a to w.

- Since w can be chosen optimally, I can choose w = b[j] to minimize the difficulty.

- After each operation, I need to update a by removing the largest element.

Wait, but in reality, when I propose w, I add it to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, it's not exactly replacing the largest element with w, but rather inserting w and removing the new largest element.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as replacing the largest element in a with w, but only if w is less than the current largest element.

If w is greater than or equal to the current largest element, then a remains the same.

So, to minimize the number of operations, I should choose w as small as possible to reduce the largest elements in a.

Wait, perhaps I can count the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n.

But in the first test case, it's four, but only two operations are needed.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from n down to 1, until a_i <= b_i.

Wait, in the first test case, starting from the end:

a6 <= b6

a5 <= b5

a4 > b4

a3 > b3

a2 > b2

a1 > b1

So, from a4 to a1 need to be reduced.

But only two operations are needed.

So, maybe it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to k, where k is the smallest index where a_i > b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering the cumulative effect.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but stopping when a_i <= b_i.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can effectively reduce the largest element in a to any value less than or equal to w, where w is the difficulty I propose.

But actually, it's not exactly that.

When I propose w, I add w to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, if w is less than the current largest element in a, then the current largest element is removed, and w is incorporated into the array.

If w is greater than or equal to the current largest element, then w is removed immediately, and a remains the same.

So, to minimize the number of operations, I need to choose w such that it reduces as many a_i as possible in each operation.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many a_i are greater than b_i, and group them in a way that can be reduced with fewer operations.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering that each operation can reduce the largest a_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but only counting the excess a_i over b_i in a certain way.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a pattern in the test cases.

In the first test case, four a_i > b_i, but only two operations are needed.

In the second test case, six a_i > b_i, but only three operations are needed.

So, it's not directly equal to the number of a_i > b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, divided by some factor.

Wait, in the first test case, four a_i > b_i, and two operations are needed.

In the second test case, six a_i > b_i, and three operations are needed.

So, perhaps it's ceil(n_operations = ceil(number of a_i > b_i / 2)).

Wait, in the first test case, ceil(4/2)=2, which matches.

In the second test case, ceil(6/2)=3, which matches.

Wait, but is that always the case?

Wait, no. Suppose n=5, and three a_i > b_i.

Then, according to this, ceil(3/2)=2 operations are needed.

But is that always sufficient?

Wait, let's consider an example.

n=3

a=[3,4,5]

b=[1,2,6]

Comparing:

3 >1 → need to reduce

4 >2 → need to reduce

5 <=6 → no need

So, two a_i > b_i.

According to the formula, ceil(2/2)=1 operation needed.

Is that possible?

Let's try:

Propose w=1:

a=[3,4,5]+1 → [1,3,4,5] → sort → [1,3,4,5] → remove the largest:5 → a=[1,3,4]

Now, a=[1,3,4]

Comparing with b:

1 <=1

3 >2 → need to reduce

4 <=6

So, only one a_i > b_i remains.

But according to the formula, only one operation is needed, but in reality, we still have one a_i > b_i.

So, in this case, ceil(2/2)=1 operation, but it's not sufficient to fix both issues.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

So, perhaps it's not ceil(number of a_i > b_i /2).

Wait, maybe it's simply the number of a_i > b_i.

In this case, two a_i > b_i, and in the previous thought, one operation is not sufficient.

But in the first test case, four a_i > b_i, and two operations are sufficient.

In the second test case, six a_i > b_i, and three operations are sufficient.

So, perhaps it's floor((number of a_i > b_i)/2).

Wait, in the first test case, floor(4/2)=2, which matches.

In the second test case, floor(6/2)=3, which matches.

In my example, floor(2/2)=1, but one operation is not sufficient.

Wait, but in the first test case, two operations are sufficient.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil((number of a_i > b_i +1)/2).

In the first test case, ceil((4+1)/2)=3, which doesn't match.

No, that doesn't work.

This approach seems flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal number of operations required to make a_i <= b_i for all i.

Each operation allows me to add a w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

I can choose w optimally each time.

I need to minimize the number of operations.

I need to find an efficient way to reduce the largest elements in a to be <= the corresponding b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach.

Initialize i=0 and j=0.

Iterate through a and b:

- If a[i] <= b[j], then it's fine, move both pointers.

- If a[i] > b[j], then I need to perform an operation to reduce a[i].

- Each operation can reduce one a_i.

- But perhaps one operation can affect multiple a_i.

Wait, in the first test case, with two operations, they reduced a4 and a5.

Wait, but a5 was reduced in the first operation.

Wait, no, in the first operation, w=800 was proposed, which reduced a6 from 2700 to 800.

Then, in the second operation, w=1800 was proposed, which reduced a5 from 2200 to 1800.

Wait, but a4 was already reduced to 2000 <= 1800? No, a4=2000 > b4=1800, but after the operations, a4=1800 <= b4=1800.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of a_i that are greater than b_i, starting from the largest a_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_j for i from n down to 1, accumulating until a_i <= b_j.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, but considering the operations can affect multiple a_i.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can reduce the largest a_i to any value less than or equal to w.

But actually, it's not exactly that.

When I propose w, I add w to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, if w is less than the current largest a_i, then the current largest a_i is removed, and w is incorporated into a.

If w is greater than or equal to the current largest a_i, then w is removed immediately, and a remains the same.

So, to minimize the number of operations, I need to choose w such that it reduces the largest possible a_i in each step.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as replacing the largest a_i with w in each operation, provided w < current largest a_i.

Each operation allows me to replace the largest a_i with w, and w can be chosen optimally.

So, to make a_i <= b_i for all i, I need to ensure that after k operations, all a_i <= b_i.

Each operation allows me to reduce the largest a_i to w, where w < current largest a_i.

But w can be chosen to be any value <= the desired b_j.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, divided by 2, but adjusted for ceiling.

But as seen in my earlier example, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1 to n, minus the number of a_i <= b_i in the first k elements, for some k.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

Initialize a counter cnt = 0

Initialize two pointers, i=0 and j=0

While i < n and j < n:

if a[i] <= b[j]:

i +=1

j +=1

else:

cnt +=1

j +=1

This would count the number of a_i > b_j, but in the first test case, it would be four, but only two operations are needed.

So, this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to increment j only when a[i] <= b[j], and increment both otherwise.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to merging two sorted arrays.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of elements in a that are greater than the corresponding elements in b.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i that are not yet <= b_j for some j.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can reduce the largest a_i to any value <= w, where w is the difficulty proposed.

But actually, it's not exactly that.

When I propose w, I add w to a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, effectively, I'm replacing the largest element in a with w, but only if w is less than the current largest element.

If w is greater than or equal to the current largest element, then a remains the same.

So, to minimize the number of operations, I need to choose w such that it reduces the largest elements in a to be <= the corresponding b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end of b, and ensure that a has elements <= b_i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_{n}.

Wait, in the first test case, b6=3000, and a6=2700 <=3000, so no need.

a5=2200 <=2200, no need.

a4=2000 >1800, need to reduce.

a3=2000 >1500, need to reduce.

a2=1400 >1200, need to reduce.

a1=1000 >800, need to reduce.

So, need to reduce a4, a3, a2, a1.

But only two operations are needed.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_{n - k +1}, where k is the number of operations.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a_i > b_j for some j.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can reduce the largest a_i to any value <= w, where w is chosen.

But actually, w is chosen, added to a, sorted, and the new largest is removed.

So, if w < current largest a_i, then the current largest a_i is removed, and w is incorporated into a.

If w >= current largest a_i, then w is removed, and a remains the same.

So, to minimize the number of operations, I should choose w to be as small as possible to reduce the largest a_i.

Wait, perhaps I can choose w to be the smallest b_j that is greater than some a_i.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of greedy algorithm.

At each step, choose the smallest possible w that can reduce the largest a_i to be <= b_j for some j.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of a_i > b_i for i from 1
