Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly n characters are "special." A special character is one that's equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in "AAABAACC," there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. If a character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, that means:

- If it's in the middle of the string, it should be equal to either the character on its left or the one on its right, but not both.

- If it's at the end of the string, it only has one neighbor, so it's special if it's equal to that neighbor.

So, for example:

- In "AAAB," position 1 ('A') is special because it's equal to its right neighbor ('A'), but not its left neighbor (since there is no left neighbor).

- Position 2 ('A') is not special because it's equal to both neighbors.

- Position 3 ('A') is special because it's equal to its left neighbor but not its right neighbor.

- Position 4 ('B') is special because it's equal to its left neighbor.

Wait, in "AAAB," position 4 ('B') is equal to its left neighbor ('A'), but 'A' and 'B' are different letters. So, it shouldn't be special. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "equal to exactly one of its neighbors." So, for position 4 in "AAAB," 'B' is only equal to its left neighbor if it's the same character. But 'A' and 'B' are different, so it's not equal to its left neighbor. Therefore, it has no equal neighbors, so it's not special.

Wait, but in the example given, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' (left: none, right: 'A') → equal to right neighbor → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left neighbor but not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left neighbor, equal to right neighbor → special

- Position 5: 'A' (left: 'B', right: 'A') → not equal to left neighbor, equal to right neighbor → special

- Position 6: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → equal to left neighbor, not right → special

- Position 7: 'C' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left neighbor, equal to right neighbor → special

- Position 8: 'C' (left: 'C', right: none) → equal to left neighbor → special

Wait, but according to the problem, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which matches what I just analyzed, except position 4: 'B' is special because it's equal to its right neighbor ('A'), but 'B' and 'A' are different. Wait, no, in the string "AAABAACC," position 4 is 'B', and its right neighbor is 'A', which is different, so it shouldn't be special. But according to the problem, position 4 is special. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, meaning that it must be equal to one neighbor and unequal to the other. In position 4 of "AAABAACC," 'B' is equal to neither neighbor ('A' and 'A'), so it shouldn't be special. But the problem says it is special. So, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement:

"Let's call a character special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

In "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal to one neighbor → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

Wait, but 'B' is equal to neither 'A' nor 'A'. So, why is it considered special? Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps "equal to exactly one of its neighbors" means that it is equal to one neighbor and not equal to the other, but in position 4, 'B' is not equal to either neighbor, so it shouldn't be special. There might be an error in the problem's example.

I need to clarify this. Let's consider another example.

Take "ABA":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'B') → not equal to neighbor → not special

- Position 2: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'B') → not equal to neighbor → not special

So, in "ABA," only position 2 is special.

Another example: "AA"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal to neighbor → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A') → equal to neighbor → special

So, both positions are special.

Wait, but according to the problem's definition, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. In "AA," both characters are equal to their only neighbor, so they are special.

In "ABA," position 2 is equal to one neighbor and not the other, so it's special.

In "AAABAACC," position 4 is 'B', which is equal to neither neighbor, so it shouldn't be special, but the problem says it is. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one neighbor, and in the case where a character has only one neighbor, it's special if it's equal to that neighbor.

So, in "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal to one neighbor → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'A' (left: 'B', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 7: 'C' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 8: 'C' (left: 'C', right: none) → equal to left neighbor → special

So, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which matches the problem's statement.

Wait, but position 4 is 'B', which is not equal to either neighbor, so it's not special, as I thought earlier. So, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the example, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the problem considers that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one neighbor, and in the case where a character has only one neighbor, it's special if it's equal to that neighbor.

In "AAABAACC," position 4 is 'B', which is not equal to its left neighbor ('A') or its right neighbor ('A'), so it should not be special. But the problem says it is special. Maybe the problem intended to say that a character is special if it is equal to at least one neighbor, but not both. But that doesn't make sense because in "AA," both characters are equal to both neighbors.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant "equal to exactly one neighbor," meaning that it is equal to one neighbor and not equal to the other, unless it's at the end, in which case it's equal to its only neighbor.

So, in "AAABAACC," position 4 is 'B', which is not equal to either neighbor, so it's not special.

But the problem says there are 6 special characters in "AAABAACC" at positions 1,3,5,6,7,8.

So, perhaps the problem made a mistake in including position 4 as special.

Anyway, moving on.

I need to find a string where exactly n characters are special as defined above.

Given that, I need to find a string of uppercase letters where exactly n characters are special.

Constraints:

- The string should consist of uppercase letters.

- The length of the string should be at most 200.

- For each test case, I need to output "YES" followed by the string if such a string exists, or "NO" if it doesn't.

Given that t is up to 50 and n is up to 50, I need an efficient way to generate such strings.

First, I need to understand for which values of n such strings exist.

Looking back at the examples:

- For n=6, "AAABAACC" is a valid string.

- For n=1, the problem says "NO," meaning no such string exists.

- For n=2, "MM" is a valid string.

So, for n=1, it's impossible because a single character in a string would be special if it's equal to its only neighbor, which doesn't exist, so it's not special. Wait, in a string of length 1, there are no neighbors, so no characters are special.

In a string of length 2:

- If the characters are equal, both are special, so n=2.

- If they are different, neither is special, so n=0.

So, for n=1, it's impossible.

For n=2, "MM" is valid.

For n=3, maybe "MMA"?

- Position 1: 'M' (right: 'M') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'M' (left: 'M', right: 'A') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'M') → not equal → not special

So, n=2, which is not 3. Not valid.

Another attempt: "MMAB"

- Position 1: 'M' (right: 'M') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'M' (left: 'M', right: 'A') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'M', right: 'B') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A') → not equal → not special

So, n=2.

Another attempt: " MMA"

- Position 1: ' ' (assuming space, but the problem says uppercase letters only)

Wait, only uppercase letters are allowed.

So, "MMA"

- Position 1: 'M' (right: 'M') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'M' (left: 'M', right: 'A') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'M') → not equal → not special

Again, n=2.

Another attempt: "MMABCC"

- Position 1: 'M' (right: 'M') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'M' (left: 'M', right: 'A') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'M', right: 'B') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'C' (left: 'B', right: 'C') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'C' (left: 'C') → equal to left → special

So, positions 1,2,5,6 are special: n=4.

So, for n=3, it seems difficult to get exactly 3 special characters.

Maybe it's impossible for odd n.

Looking back at the given program, it seems to print "YES" and a string only when n is even, otherwise "NO."

Wait, but in the example, for n=6 (even), it's "YES," for n=1 (odd), "NO," for n=2 (even), "YES."

So, perhaps it's only possible for even n.

But in my earlier attempt for n=2, "MM" works.

For n=4, "MMABCC" works.

For n=0, any string where no character is equal to its neighbor, like "ABCDEF," would have n=0.

For n=50, I need a string with exactly 50 special characters.

Given that, perhaps it's only possible for even n.

But why?

Let's think about how special characters pair up.

Consider that each special character is equal to exactly one neighbor.

In a sequence like "110," as in the given program, but the problem specifies uppercase letters, so let's think in terms of 'A' and 'B.'

Take "AAAB":

- Positions 1 and 4 are special (n=2).

Wait, earlier analysis showed positions 1,3,4 are special, but according to the problem's logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the special character definition.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of blocks.

Suppose I have a block like "AABBAABBAAA..."

Each "AAB" or "BBA" could contribute a certain number of special characters.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of runs of the same character.

Let's consider runs of 'A's and 'B's.

If I have a run of 'A's of length k, then:

- The first 'A' is special if k >=2 and the next character is not 'A.'

- The last 'A' is special if k >=2 and the previous character is not 'A.'

- The middle 'A's are special only if they are equal to one neighbor and not the other.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to note that each special character contributes to n, and we need exactly n of them.

Given that, perhaps it's possible to construct a string where n is even, and impossible when n is odd.

But in the example, for n=6 (even), it's possible, n=1 (odd), impossible, n=2 (even), possible.

So, maybe n must be even.

But let's check for n=0.

For n=0, a string like "ABCDEF" has no special characters, so n=0 is possible.

For n=2, "MM" works.

For n=4, "MMABCC" works.

For n=6, "AAABAACC" works.

For n=3, it's hard to find a string with exactly 3 special characters.

Let's try:

"AAAB" has positions 1,3,4 special (n=3). Wait, earlier I thought position 4 was not special, but according to the problem, it is.

Wait, maybe I need to accept the problem's definition.

In "AAABAACC":

- Positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special.

So, n=6.

In "AAAB":

- Positions 1,3,4 are special (n=3).

So, perhaps for some odd n, it's possible.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=1, it's "NO."

Wait, maybe it's only possible for n=0 and n>=2 and even.

But in "AAAB," n=3 is possible.

Wait, maybe my earlier analysis was wrong.

Let's re-examine "AAAB":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A') → not equal → not special

Wait, according to this, positions 1 and 3 are special (n=2), but earlier I thought position 4 was special, but according to this, it's not.

So, perhaps the problem made a mistake in saying that positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special in "AAABAACC."

Wait, no, in "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 5: 'A' (left: 'B', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 7: 'C' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 8: 'C' (left: 'C') → equal to left → special

So, positions 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 are special, which is n=7, but the problem says n=6. Maybe it's a typo.

Wait, perhaps position 4 is not special because 'B' is not equal to its neighbors 'A' and 'A,' so it's not equal to either neighbor, hence not special.

So, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special (n=6).

I think the problem might have mistakenly included position 4 as special.

Given that, for "AAAB," positions 1 and 3 are special (n=2).

So, perhaps only even n are possible.

But in "AAABAACC," n=6 is even.

Wait, 6 is even.

In "AAAB," n=2 is even.

In "MM," n=2 is even.

In "ABCDEF," n=0 is even.

So, perhaps n must be even.

But 0 is even.

Wait, but 6 is even, 2 is even, 0 is even.

So, perhaps n must be even.

But in "AAABAACC," n=6 is even.

In "AAAB," n=2 is even.

In "MM," n=2 is even.

In "ABCDEF," n=0 is even.

So, perhaps n must be even.

But in the problem's test cases, for n=1 (odd), it's "NO," for n=2 (even), "YES."

So, perhaps it's only possible for even n.

Given that, the program checks if n is even, and if so, prints "YES" and a string, otherwise "NO."

But in the problem's test cases, for n=1, it's "NO," for n=2, "YES."

So, the program seems to be following the pattern that only even n are possible.

But is that always true?

Let's think about n=3.

Is it possible to have a string with exactly 3 special characters?

Let's try to construct one.

Suppose "AAABC":

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'C' (left: 'B') → not equal → not special

So, n=2.

Another attempt: "AAABCC"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'C' (left: 'B', right: 'C') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'C' (left: 'C') → equal to left → special

So, positions 1,3,5,6 are special (n=4).

Another attempt: "AAABCD"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'C' (left: 'B', right: 'D') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 6: 'D' (left: 'C') → not equal → not special

So, n=2.

Another attempt: "AAABAC"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → equal to both → not special

- Position 3: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 5: 'A' (left: 'B', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 6: 'C' (left: 'A') → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,3,4 are special (n=3).

Wait, but according to the problem's definition, is position 4 special?

Position 4: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special.

Wait, but 'B' is not equal to 'A,' so it's not equal to its right neighbor. Wait, 'A' equals 'A,' but 'B' does not equal 'A.' So, 'B' is not equal to either neighbor. So, it's not special.

So, positions 1 and 3 are special (n=2).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Let's clearly define:

A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

So, for position 4 in "AAABAC":

- Left neighbor: 'A'

- Right neighbor: 'A'

- Character: 'B'

- 'B' == left neighbor? 'B' != 'A' → False

- 'B' == right neighbor? 'B' != 'A' → False

- So, 'B' is not equal to either neighbor → not special.

Therefore, positions 1 and 3 are special (n=2).

Another attempt: "AABBA"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 4: 'B' (left: 'B', right: 'A') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 5: 'A' (left: 'B') → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,2,3,4 are special (n=4).

Another attempt: "AABAC"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 4: 'A' (left: 'B', right: 'C') → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 5: 'C' (left: 'A') → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,2,3 are special (n=3).

Wait, but position 3: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A' → not special.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was special, but according to the definition, it's not equal to either neighbor, so not special.

So, positions 1 and 2 are special (n=2).

It seems challenging to get an odd n.

Another attempt: "AAB"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'B' (left: 'A') → not equal → not special

So, n=2.

Another attempt: "AABA"

- Position 1: 'A' (right: 'A') → equal → special

- Position 2: 'A' (left: 'A', right: 'B') → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 3: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 4: 'A' (left: 'B') → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,2,3 are special (n=3).

But according to the definition, position 3: 'B' (left: 'A', right: 'A') → 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A' → not special.

So, positions 1 and 2 are special (n=2).

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in considering whether a character is equal to one neighbor.

Let me restate the condition clearly: a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

So, for position k:

- If s[k] == s[k-1] and s[k] != s[k+1], or s[k] != s[k-1] and s[k] == s[k+1], then it's special.

- For the first character, only check s[1] == s[2].

- For the last character, only check s[n-1] == s[n-2].

Given that, in "AABA":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' != 'B' (right) → not special, because it's equal to left but not right, but since it's equal to both neighbors in terms of equality conditions, it's actually equal to left and not right → special.

- Position 3: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'B' != 'A' (right) → not special

- Position 4: 'A' != 'B' (left) → not special

Wait, position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' != 'B' (right) → equal to one neighbor and not the other → special.

Position 3: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'B' != 'A' (right) → not equal to either neighbor → not special.

Position 4: 'A' != 'B' (left) → not equal to neighbor → not special.

So, positions 1 and 2 are special (n=2).

It seems that for n=3, it's challenging to find a string.

Maybe it's impossible for odd n.

Given that, perhaps the program is correct in outputting "YES" for even n and "NO" for odd n.

But in the problem's test cases, for n=1, it's "NO," for n=2, "YES," for n=6, "YES."

So, it seems to follow that only even n are possible.

But let's check for higher n.

For n=4, "AABBA" works:

- Positions 1,2,3,4 are special.

Wait, in "AABBA":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'B' (right) → equal to left and right → not special

- Position 3: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (left) and 'B' == 'A' (right) → equal to left and not right → special

- Position 5: 'A' == 'B' (left) → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,3,4 are special (n=3).

Not n=4.

Another attempt: "AABBAABB"

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'B' (right) → equal to left and right → not special

- Position 3: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (left) and 'B' == 'A' (right) → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 5: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'B' (right) → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 7: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 8: 'B' == 'B' (left) → equal to left → special

So, positions 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 are special (n=7).

Not n=4.

Another attempt: "AABBC"

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'B' (right) → equal to left and right → not special

- Position 3: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (left) and 'B' == 'C' (right) → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 5: 'C' == 'B' (left) → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,3,4 are special (n=3).

Another attempt: "AABBA"

- As before, n=3.

Seems like it's hard to get exactly n=4.

Wait, maybe "AABBCD":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' == 'B' (right) → equal to left and right → not special

- Position 3: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (left) and 'B' == 'C' (right) → equal to left, not right → special

- Position 5: 'C' == 'B' (left) and 'C' == 'D' (right) → not equal to left, not equal to right → not special

- Position 6: 'D' == 'C' (left) → not equal → not special

So, positions 1,3,4 are special (n=3).

It seems that constructing a string with exactly n=4 special characters is difficult. Maybe it's not possible, or perhaps I need a different approach.

Let's consider a general approach.

Suppose I create a string consisting of repeating "AB" patterns.

For example, "ABABABAB":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'B' (right) → not special

- Position 2: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 3: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 5: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 7: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 8: 'B' == 'A' (left) → not equal → not special

So, positions 2,3,4,5,6,7 are special (n=6).

Not n=4.

Another attempt: "ABABAB"

- Position 1: 'A' == 'B' (right) → not special

- Position 2: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 3: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 4: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) → equal to right, not left → special

- Position 5: 'A' == 'B' (left) and 'A' == 'A' (right) → not equal to left, equal to right → special

- Position 6: 'B' == 'A' (left) → not equal → not special

So, positions 2,3,4,5 are special (n=4).

Yes, that works.

So, in "ABABAB," n=4.

Similarly, "ABAB" has positions 2,3,4 special (n=3).

Wait, in "ABAB":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'B' (right) → not special

- Position 2: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'B' == 'B' (right) →
