Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly n characters are "special." A special character is one that's equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in "AAABAACC," there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. If a character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, that means:

- If it's the first character, it's special only if it's equal to the second character.

- If it's the last character, it's special only if it's equal to the second-to-last character.

- For any character in the middle, it's special if it's equal to either the previous or the next character, but not both.

So, for the string "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), so special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so special.

- Position 3: 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), so special.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's re-examine.

Actually, in "AAABAACC":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), so special.

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so special.

- Pos 3: 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), wait, 'A' != 'B', so not special.

Wait, but the problem says positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special. Maybe I miscounted.

Let me list them out:

1: A

2: A

3: A

4: B

5: A

6: A

7: C

8: C

So:

- Pos 1: A == A (next), so special.

- Pos 2: A == A (previous), A != B (next), so special.

- Pos 3: A != B (next), A != A (previous)? Wait, A == A (previous), A != B (next), so special.

Wait, but according to the problem, pos 3 is special, which aligns with my initial thought, but according to my earlier logic, it shouldn't be special because A == A (previous). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the "exactly one of its neighbors." Let's think again.

For a character to be special, it must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

So, for position 3 in "AAABAACC":

- Previous neighbor: pos 2, 'A'

- Next neighbor: pos 4, 'B'

- So, 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so it's equal to exactly one neighbor (previous). Therefore, it's special.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's considered special. So my initial logic was incorrect.

I need to correct my understanding.

A character is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors, not considering the other neighbor's equality.

So, for position 3 in "AAABAACC":

- It's equal to the previous neighbor ('A' == 'A')

- It's not equal to the next neighbor ('A' != 'B')

- Therefore, it's equal to exactly one neighbor, making it special.

Similarly, for position 2:

- Equal to previous neighbor ('A' == 'A')

- Equal to next neighbor ('A' == 'A')

- So, it's equal to both neighbors, which means it's not special.

Wait, but earlier I thought position 2 was special, but according to this, it shouldn't be.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Let me check the example again.

The problem says: "there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 )."

So, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special.

Let's verify:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), so special.

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous) and 'A' == 'B' (next)? Wait, 'A' != 'B', so it's equal to only one neighbor, previous 'A'. So it should be special.

Wait, but the problem says positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which seems inconsistent with my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting positions.

Let me list the string with positions:

Pos: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Chars: A A A B A A C C

- Pos 1: A == A (next), so special.

- Pos 2: A == A (previous), A == A (next), so equal to both, not special.

- Pos 3: A == A (previous), A != B (next), so equal to one, special.

- Pos 4: B != A (previous), B != A (next), so not special.

- Pos 5: A != B (previous), A == A (next), so equal to one, special.

- Pos 6: A == A (previous), A != C (next), so equal to one, special.

- Pos 7: C == C (next), C != A (previous), so equal to one, special.

- Pos 8: C == C (previous), C has no next, so equal to one, special.

Wait, but according to this, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, which matches the problem's statement.

So, my initial understanding was incorrect. Let's correct my understanding:

A character is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

- For the first character, it's equal to the next one.

- For the last character, it's equal to the previous one.

- For middle characters, it's equal to one but not both neighbors.

In the example:

- Pos 2: A == A (previous) and A == A (next), so equal to both, not special.

- Pos 4: B != A (previous) and B != A (next), so equal to none, not special.

So, the special positions are indeed 1,3,5,6,7,8.

Now, the task is, given n, to build a string where exactly n characters are special.

I need to find a string of uppercase letters where exactly n characters are equal to exactly one of their neighbors.

First, think about the minimal string that can achieve this.

Let's consider small n and see patterns.

For n=1:

Is it possible to have a string where exactly one character is special?

Let's try:

- "AA": Pos 1: A == A (next), special. Pos 2: A == A (previous), special. Total specials: 2. Not good.

- "AB": Pos 1: A != B (next), not special. Pos 2: B != A (previous), not special. Total specials: 0. Not good.

- "AAA": Pos 1: A == A (next), special. Pos 2: A == A (previous) and A == A (next), not special. Pos 3: A == A (previous), special. Total specials: 2. Not good.

- "AAB": Pos 1: A == A (next), special. Pos 2: A == A (previous) and A == B (next)? A != B, so equal to one, special. Pos 3: B != A (previous), not special. Total specials: 2. Not good.

- "ABB": Pos 1: A != B (next), not special. Pos 2: B == B (next), special. Pos 3: B == B (previous), special. Total specials: 2. Not good.

- "ABC": Pos 1: A != B (next), not special. Pos 2: B != A (previous) and B != C (next), not special. Pos 3: C != B (previous), not special. Total specials: 0. Not good.

- "AABC": Pos 1: A == A (next), special. Pos 2: A == A (previous) and A != B (next), special. Pos 3: B != A (previous) and B != C (next), not special. Pos 4: C != B (previous), not special. Total specials: 2. Not good.

It seems challenging to have exactly one special character. In all the above cases, either 0 or 2 special characters.

Let's consider a longer string.

- "AAAB": Pos 1: A == A (next), special. Pos 2: A == A (previous) and A == B (next)? A != B, so equal to one, special. Pos 3: A == A (previous) and A == B (next)? A != B, so equal to one, special. Pos 4: B != A (previous), not special. Total specials: 3.

Still not exactly one.

It seems that to have exactly one special character, we might need a specific configuration that might not be possible with small strings.

Perhaps for n=1, it's impossible, hence we should output "NO".

Wait, but the sample input has n=1 and n=2, let's see what the expected output is.

In the sample input:

3

6

1

2

Output:

YES

AAABAACC

NO

YES

MM

Wait, for n=6: YES AAABAACC

n=1: NO

n=2: YES MM

So, for n=1, it's impossible, hence "NO".

For n=2: "MM" has positions:

Pos 1: M == M (next), special.

Pos 2: M == M (previous), special.

Total specials: 2.

Wait, but "MM" has two specials, which matches n=2.

Wait, but earlier when I tried "MM" for n=2, it seems correct.

But for n=1, there's no such string, hence "NO".

So, perhaps for odd n, it's impossible, and for even n, it's possible.

Looking at the sample, n=6: YES, n=1: NO, n=2: YES.

So, maybe n must be even.

Let me test this hypothesis.

Suppose n is even.

Then, we can construct a string where every pair of identical characters contributes exactly two special characters.

For example, "MM" has two specials.

"MMNN" has four specials.

"MMNNOO" has six specials, and so on.

So, for even n, it's possible to construct such a string by repeating pairs of different letters.

For odd n, it seems impossible, as adding a pair always adds two specials.

Hence, the answer is:

- If n is even, output "YES" and a string of length n/2 pairs of different letters, each pair contributing two specials.

- If n is odd, output "NO".

Wait, but in the sample, for n=6, they provided "AAABAACC", which has 6 specials.

But according to my current logic, for n=6, we can simply output "MMNNPP" or something similar.

But the sample output is "AAABAACC", which is longer than necessary.

But the problem allows strings up to length 200, and it's sufficient to provide any string that satisfies the condition.

So, in my approach, for even n, I can provide a string of n/2 pairs of the same letter, each pair contributing two specials.

For example, for n=2: "MM"

For n=4: "MMNN"

For n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

Each pair "MM" contributes two specials: the first M is special because it's equal to the next M, and the second M is special because it's equal to the previous M.

Similarly for "NN", "OO", etc.

So, this seems to work for even n.

For odd n, it's impossible to have exactly n specials, as adding pairs always adds two specials.

Hence, for odd n, output "NO".

This seems to align with the sample input and output.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = '110' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

Wait, this code checks if n is odd, output "NO", else output "YES" and a string s = '110' * (n // 2).

But the problem requires uppercase letters, not digits.

Also, '110' * (n // 2) doesn't make sense in this context.

It should be a string of uppercase letters.

Moreover, in the sample, for n=2, they output "MM", which is correct.

But in this code, for n=2, s = '110' * 1 = '110', which is not correct.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

I need to modify it to output a string of uppercase letters, with n specials, by using pairs of the same letter.

For example, for n=2: "MM"

n=4: "MMNN"

n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

Also, ensure that the string length doesn't exceed 200.

Given that n can be up to 50, and for even n, the string length would be n (since each pair has two characters), which is fine.

Wait, no. For n=2, string length is 2 ("MM"), n=4, length is 4 ("MMNN"), and so on.

But in the sample, for n=6, they provided "AAABAACC", which is length 8, but according to my approach, "MMNNOO" is length 6.

So, my approach provides shorter strings.

But the problem allows up to 200 characters, so it's fine.

Hence, the program should be modified to output a string of n/2 pairs of the same uppercase letter, each pair being different letters.

For example, "MMNNPP" for n=6.

Also, ensure that the letters are uppercase.

Moreover, in the given program, it uses '110' * (n // 2), which is incorrect because it contains digits, not uppercase letters.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
