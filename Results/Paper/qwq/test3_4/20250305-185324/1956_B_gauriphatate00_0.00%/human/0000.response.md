Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice. The cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

We take turns playing cards, starting with me, and we do this n times each, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player chooses one of their cards, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with that number on the table. If there is, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

Importantly, Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there's a tie in maximizing her score, she chooses the move that minimizes my score. So, I need to figure out, given my hand of cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, assuming Nene also plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. Since each number appears exactly twice, and we have n numbers, each number has exactly two cards: one in my hand and one in Nene's hand, or both in my hand, or both in Nene's hand.

Wait, no. The problem says that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire deck. So, in total, there are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. These 2n cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

Given that, in my hand, I have a list of n integers, each between 1 and n, and each integer appears at most twice in my hand. Since each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck, if it appears twice in my hand, then Nene doesn't have it, and if it appears once in my hand, then Nene has the other one.

Wait, no. If a number appears twice in my hand, then Nene doesn't have that number at all. If a number appears once in my hand, then Nene has the other card with that number. If a number appears zero times in my hand, then Nene has both cards with that number.

Wait, but the problem says: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,â€¦,an at most 2 times." Wait, no, a1 to an are the n cards I have, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand. But since there are only n cards in my hand, and integers range from 1 to n, and each integer appears at most twice, it's possible that some integers appear twice in my hand, meaning Nene doesn't have them, and others appear once or zero times.

Wait, but the total number of cards is 2n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. So, in my hand, I have n cards, and some integers may appear twice, meaning Nene doesn't have them, and for integers that appear once in my hand, Nene has the other card, and for integers that don't appear in my hand, Nene has both cards.

I need to keep track of which cards are in my hand and which are in Nene's hand to understand the game.

The game proceeds with me and Nene taking turns, n turns each, alternating, starting with me. On each turn, the player chooses one of their cards, checks if there's already a card with the same number on the table, and if there is, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The table starts empty, so the first time a number is played, no point is scored, but the second time, a point is scored.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of a tie in maximizing her score, she chooses the move that minimizes my score.

I need to find out the maximum number of points I can get, assuming I play optimally, knowing that Nene will play optimally against me.

This seems like a game theory problem, where I need to consider the optimal strategies of both players.

First, I need to understand what constitutes an "optimal" move for both players.

For me, I want to maximize my points, but Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, I need to consider the sequence of moves where both players are making decisions based on the current state of the table.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider that each number can be played twice, and the second time it's played, the player scores a point.

So, the key is to control which numbers are played first and second.

If I play a number first, then Nene can play the second one to score a point, unless I play the second one myself.

But I only have one card per turn, and I have to choose which one to play when.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of "pairs" of cards.

Since each number appears exactly twice, there are n numbers, each with two cards.

Some of these pairs are split between me and Nene, and some pairs are entirely in my hand or entirely in Nene's hand.

Wait, no. Wait, the total of 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

I have n cards, and Nene has n cards.

For each number from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then Nene has none.

- If I have one card, then Nene has the other.

- If I have no cards with that number, then Nene has both.

But wait, each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, for each number, there are two cards: one with that number.

Wait, no, it's stated that "each integer from 1 to n appears exactly on 2 cards", so there are 2n cards in total, each with an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice.

So, the deck consists of 2n cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.

These 2n cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

Given that, for each number from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then Nene has none of that number.

- If I have one card of that number, Nene has the other.

- If I have no cards of that number, Nene has both.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene taking turns, n turns each, starting with me.

On each turn, a player chooses one of their cards, lets x be the number on it, and places it on the table.

If there is already a card with number x on the table, the player scores a point.

Otherwise, no point is scored.

The table starts empty.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of a tie in maximizing her score, she chooses the move that minimizes my score.

I need to find the maximum number of points I can get, assuming I play optimally, knowing that Nene is also playing optimally.

This seems like a zero-sum game, where the total points scored by both players are determined by the choices made.

Let me try to see what determines the points scored.

For each number from 1 to n, there are two cards.

The first time a card with a number is played, no point is scored.

The second time a card with that number is played, a point is scored by the player who plays it.

So, for each number, there will be two plays: the first play doesn't score, and the second play does.

The question is, who plays the second card for each number?

If I play the second card for a number, I score a point.

If Nene plays the second card for a number, she scores a point.

So, I want to maximize the number of numbers for which I play the second card.

Nene, being smart, will try to minimize that.

Given that, I need to strategize to maximize the number of numbers where I play the second card.

Let me consider the distribution of the cards.

For each number, there are two cards, either both with me, both with Nene, or one with each.

Wait, no, the problem says that "each integer from 1 to n appears exactly on 2 cards", and "each of integers 1 through n appears exactly on 2 cards", so each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.

Given that, and that I have n cards and Nene has n cards, it's possible that for some numbers, I have both cards, for some numbers I have one card and Nene has the other, and for some numbers, Nene has both cards.

Wait, but since there are only n numbers, and I have n cards, it's possible that I have both cards of some numbers, but since each number appears only twice, and there are n numbers, the total number of cards is 2n.

Wait, no, wait: there are n unique numbers, each appearing exactly twice, so 2n cards in total.

I have n cards, and Nene has n cards.

For each number from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then Nene has none of that number.

- If I have one card, Nene has the other.

- If I have no cards, Nene has both.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, considering that, let's think about the game.

The game consists of 2n turns: n turns for me and n turns for Nene.

On each turn, a player chooses one of their remaining cards and places it on the table.

The key is to decide the order in which to play the cards to maximize the points I can get.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to consider her responses to my moves.

This seems complex, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to calculate the maximum points I can get.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on who has the cards.

Let's define:

- Let's say a number is "mine" if I have both cards of that number.

- A number is "ours" if I have one card and Nene has the other.

- A number is "hers" if Nene has both cards of that number.

Given that:

- For "mine" numbers, I have both cards.

- For "ours" numbers, I have one card and Nene has one.

- For "hers" numbers, Nene has both cards.

Now, let's think about how the game progresses.

For "mine" numbers, since I have both cards, I can choose to play them in my two turns.

If I play both in my turns, then I will score one point for the second one.

For "ours" numbers, I have one card and Nene has one.

So, one card is with me and one with Nene.

For "hers" numbers, Nene has both cards.

So, for "hers" numbers, Nene will play both cards, and she will score one point for the second one.

For "mine" numbers, I can choose when to play the two cards.

For "ours" numbers, me and Nene will each play one card.

Now, the question is, how can I maximize the points I get from these categories.

Let me consider the total possible points.

There are n numbers, and for each number, one point can be scored, for a total of n points in the game.

I want to maximize my score, given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Let me consider the "mine" numbers first.

For each "mine" number, I have both cards, so I can choose to play them in my turns.

If I play both in my turns, I will score one point for the second one.

Alternatively, I could play one in my turn and one in Nene's turn, but since Nene is playing optimally, she would choose to play the second one to score a point for herself.

Wait, no, Nene plays after me, so if I play one card in my turn, and then Nene plays the second one in her turn, she scores a point.

But if I play both in my turns, then I score one point.

So, for each "mine" number, I can choose to play both in my turns and score one point, or play one in my turn and one in Nene's turn, allowing Nene to score a point.

Therefore, for each "mine" number, I can choose to score one point for myself, or let Nene score one point.

Now, for "ours" numbers, I have one card and Nene has one.

So, one of the two cards will be played in my turn, and the other in Nene's turn.

Therefore, for "ours" numbers, Nene will score one point, because she plays the second card.

Wait, but Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, for "ours" numbers, if I play my card first, then Nene can play her card later and score a point.

Alternatively, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, then when I play mine, I score a point.

But Nene, being optimal, would want to play her card after I play mine, so she can score the point.

Wait, but the turns are alternating, starting with me.

So, the sequence of turns is: me, Nene, me, Nene, ..., me, Nene.

Given that, the timing of when cards are played matters.

Wait, perhaps it's too complicated to think in terms of the sequence of turns.

Maybe I can think in terms of which player plays the second card for each number.

For each number:

- If I play both cards, I score one point.

- If Nene plays the second card, she scores one point.

- If I play the second card, I score one point.

Given that, and considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to decide how to play my cards to maximize my points, knowing that Nene will counter me optimally.

Let me consider the number of "mine" numbers and "ours" numbers.

Let's define:

- Let p be the number of "mine" numbers.

- Then, the number of "ours" numbers is n - p, because there are n numbers in total.

Wait, no. Wait, there are n numbers, and p of them are "mine" numbers, meaning I have both cards for those p numbers.

For the remaining n - p numbers, since I have n cards in total, the number of "ours" numbers is n - p - q, where q is the number of "hers" numbers.

Wait, no, let's think again.

Total numbers: n.

- "mine" numbers: I have both cards, so Nene has none.

- "hers" numbers: Nene has both cards, so I have none.

- "ours" numbers: I have one card, Nene has one.

Given that, for "mine" numbers, I have both cards.

For "hers" numbers, Nene has both cards.

For "ours" numbers, I have one card and Nene has one.

Now, the total number of cards I have is n.

For "mine" numbers, each contributes 2 cards to my hand.

For "ours" numbers, each contributes 1 card to my hand.

For "hers" numbers, each contributes 0 cards to my hand.

So, if there are p "mine" numbers, then I have 2p cards from "mine" numbers.

Then, the remaining n - 2p cards in my hand are from "ours" numbers.

Therefore, the number of "ours" numbers is n - 2p.

And the number of "hers" numbers is n - p - (n - 2p) = n - p - n + 2p = p.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, total numbers: n.

Number of "mine" numbers: p.

Number of "hers" numbers: q.

Number of "ours" numbers: r.

We have:

- p + q + r = n (since there are n unique numbers).

- I have 2p cards from "mine" numbers and r cards from "ours" numbers.

- Total cards I have: 2p + r = n.

- Also, q = n - p - r.

But from 2p + r = n, we can express r = n - 2p.

Then, q = n - p - (n - 2p) = n - p - n + 2p = p.

So, q = p.

Therefore, the number of "hers" numbers is equal to the number of "mine" numbers.

Interesting.

So, if p is the number of "mine" numbers, then the number of "hers" numbers is also p, and the number of "ours" numbers is n - 2p.

Now, let's think about the points.

For "mine" numbers, since I have both cards, I can choose to play both in my turns, scoring one point per "mine" number.

For "hers" numbers, Nene has both cards, so she will play both, scoring one point per "hers" number.

For "ours" numbers, one card is mine and one is Nene's.

In this case, the player who plays the second card scores a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, for "ours" numbers, Nene will try to play her card after I play mine, so she can score a point.

Therefore, for "ours" numbers, Nene will score one point per "ours" number.

So, total points I can score are the number of "mine" numbers, because for each "mine" number, I can play both cards in my turns and score one point, and for "hers" numbers, Nene scores points, and for "ours" numbers, Nene scores points.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that:

- For each "mine" number, I can choose to play both cards in my turns, scoring one point.

- For each "hers" number, Nene will play both cards, scoring one point.

- For each "ours" number, one card is mine and one is Nene's.

- If I play my "ours" card before Nene plays her "ours" card, then when I play my card, there is no point, and when Nene plays her card, she scores a point.

- If Nene plays her "ours" card before I play my "ours" card, then when Nene plays her card, she scores a point (since my card is already played), and when I play my card, there is no point.

Wait, no.

Let's think carefully.

For "ours" numbers:

- Suppose I play my card first, then Nene can play her card later and score a point.

- If Nene plays her card first, then when I play my card later, I score a point.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, for "ours" numbers, Nene will choose to play her card after I play mine, so she can score a point.

Therefore, for "ours" numbers, Nene will score one point per "ours" number.

Similarly, for "hers" numbers, Nene will score one point per "hers" number.

For "mine" numbers, I can score one point per "mine" number by playing both cards in my turns.

So, total points I can score are equal to the number of "mine" numbers.

But, is there a way for me to manipulate the game to score more points?

Wait, perhaps there is.

Suppose I have some "mine" numbers and some "ours" numbers.

If I play a "mine" number's first card in a turn when Nene has an "ours" number's card, perhaps I can force Nene to play her "ours" number's card before I play my second "mine" number's card, thereby potentially affecting the scoring.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 4

a = [1,1,2,3]

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Therefore, p = number of "mine" numbers = 1 (since I have two 1's).

Number of "hers" numbers = p = 1.

Number of "ours" numbers = n - 2p = 4 - 2*1 = 2.

So, "mine": 1 (number 1)

"hers": 1 (some number that Nene has both cards of)

"ours": 2 (numbers 2 and 3)

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, q = p = 1, so one "hers" number.

But in this case, I have one "mine" number (1), one "hers" number (say, 4), and "ours" numbers are 2 and 3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1,1,2,3 . The integers written on Nene's cards are 2,3,4,4 ."

So, Nene has two 4's, and one each of 2 and 3.

Wait, but according to this, for number 2: I have one, Nene has one.

For number 3: I have one, Nene has one.

For number 1: I have two, Nene has none.

For number 4: Nene has two, I have none.

So, p = 1 ("mine": 1), q = 1 ("hers": 4), r = 2 ("ours": 2 and 3).

This matches my earlier calculation.

Now, in this case, the explanation shows that I can score 1 point.

How?

Well, if I play one of the 1's first, then Nene can play something else, and then I play the second 1 and score a point.

But, Nene can also choose to play her cards in a way that minimizes my score.

Wait, according to the explanation, the game proceeds as:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 4.

3. I play 1 and score 1 point.

4. Nene plays 4 and scores 1 point.

5. I play 2.

6. Nene plays 2 and scores 1 point.

7. I play 3.

8. Nene plays 3 and scores 1 point.

So, I scored 1 point, Nene scored 3 points.

Is there a better way for me to play to score more than 1 point?

Suppose I play 1 first, Nene plays 2, I play 3, Nene plays 4, then I play 1 and score 1 point, Nene plays 4 and scores 1 point, and so on.

Wait, but Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, she will choose to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

In this case, perhaps the best I can do is 1 point.

Another test case:

n = 8

a = [7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

So, p = number of "mine" numbers: I have two 8's and two 5's, so p = 2.

Then, q = p = 2 ("hers" numbers).

"ours" numbers = n - 2p = 8 - 4 = 4.

So, "mine": 5 and 8

"hers": two numbers that Nene has both cards of.

"ours": four numbers where I have one and Nene has one.

According to the output, in this case, I can score 2 points.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can score is equal to the number of "mine" numbers.

In the first test case, p = 1, and I can score 1 point.

In the second test case, p = 2, and I can score 2 points.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n = 8

a = [7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

So, p = number of "mine" numbers: I have two 4's, so p = 1.

Wait, no, wait: I have two 4's, so p = 1 ("mine": 4).

Then, q = p = 1 ("hers": one number that Nene has both cards of).

"ours" numbers = n - 2p = 8 - 2 = 6.

But wait, I have two 4's, and the rest are unique in my hand.

So, "mine": 4 (two cards)

"hers": one number, say 8, Nene has two 8's.

"ours": the remaining numbers: 1,2,3,5,6,7.

But according to the output, I can score 1 point.

Which matches p = 1.

Similarly, in the fourth test case:

n = 3

a = [1,2,3]

So, p = 0 ("mine": none), q = 0 ("hers": none), r = 3 ("ours": all numbers).

So, I can score 0 points.

And in the fifth test case:

n = 1

a = [1]

So, p = 0 ("mine": none), q = 0 ("hers": none), r = 1 ("ours": 1).

So, I can score 0 points.

Therefore, it seems that the maximum points I can score is equal to the number of "mine" numbers, which is the number of integers that appear twice in my hand.

In other words, in the list of my cards, the number of integers that appear twice.

So, in the first test case, p = 1 (number 1 appears twice).

In the second test case, p = 2 (numbers 5 and 8 appear twice each).

In the third test case, p = 1 (number 4 appears twice).

In the fourth test case, p = 0.

In the fifth test case, p = 0.

And the outputs are corresponding to p.

Wait, but in the second test case, p = 2, output is 2.

In the third test case, p = 1, output is 1.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can score is equal to p, the number of "mine" numbers.

Is that always the case?

Wait, but let's think if there are cases where I can score more than p points.

Suppose I have some "mine" numbers and some "ours" numbers.

Is there a way for me to manipulate the game to score points from "ours" numbers?

It seems difficult, because Nene can always play her "ours" cards after I play mine, thereby scoring points for herself.

Therefore, it's unlikely that I can score points from "ours" numbers.

Hence, the maximum points I can score is indeed p, the number of "mine" numbers.

Therefore, the solution is to count the number of integers that appear twice in my hand.

In Python, I can use a Counter to count the frequency of each number in my hand and count how many numbers appear twice.

Then, output that count for each test case.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], p=2 (numbers 5 and 8 appear twice), output is 2.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], p=1 (number 4 appears twice), output is 1.

So, it matches.

Hence, the program provided seems correct.

It defines a function func_1 that takes n and a (my cards), uses Counter to count the frequency of each number, and counts how many numbers appear exactly twice, and returns the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, why n//2?

In the first test case, p=1, n=4, n//2=2, so min(1,2)=1, which matches the output.

In the second test case, p=2, n=8, n//2=4, so min(2,4)=2, which matches.

In the third test case, p=1, n=8, n//2=4, so min(1,4)=1, which matches.

In the fourth test case, p=0, n=3, n//2=1, so min(0,1)=0, matches.

In the fifth test case, p=0, n=1, n//2=0, min(0,0)=0, matches.

So, why is n//2 there?

Is it to cap the maximum points I can score?

Wait, perhaps in some cases, p could be greater than n//2, but in this problem, since p is the number of "mine" numbers, and q is also p, and r=n-2p, and n is even because 2n cards, but n is the number of cards each has, which is n.

Wait, no, n is the number of cards each has, total cards are 2n.

But in the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4.

But in any case, p can be up to n//2, because if p > n//2, then r = n - 2p < 0, which is impossible.

Wait, yes, p cannot be greater than n//2, because r = n - 2p >= 0.

Therefore, p <= n//2.

Hence, min(p, n//2) is equal to p, since p <= n//2.

Therefore, the min function is redundant.

So, the function can be simplified to just return p, the number of "mine" numbers.

But in the code, it's written as min(p, n//2), which is correct but unnecessary.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can achieve in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are divided equally between us and Nene.
   - We take turns playing cards, and points are scored if a card played matches a card already on the table.

2. **Insight**:
   - For each number that appears twice in our hand, we can ensure to score a point by playing both cards at optimal times.
   - For numbers where we have only one card, Nene can control the scoring by playing her card optimally.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Count how many numbers appear twice in our hand. This count (`p`) represents the maximum points we can score because we can play both cards for these numbers at times beneficial to us.

4. **Constraints Handling**:
   - Ensure that the count of numbers appearing twice does not exceed `n//2` to maintain logical consistency, though in practice `p` cannot exceed `n//2`.

## Solution Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

## Explanation

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - We use a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in our hand.
  - We then count how many numbers appear exactly twice (`pairs`).

- **Optimal Points Calculation**:
  - The maximum points we can score is equal to the number of pairs we have (`pairs`).
  - We take the minimum of `pairs` and `n//2` to ensure it doesn't exceed logical bounds, though in practice `pairs` won't exceed `n//2`.

- **Reading Input**:
  - We read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Process each test case to extract `n` and the list of cards `a`, then compute and store the results.

- **Output**:
  - Print the results for each test case.

This approach ensures we achieve the maximum possible points given the constraints and optimal play from both players.
