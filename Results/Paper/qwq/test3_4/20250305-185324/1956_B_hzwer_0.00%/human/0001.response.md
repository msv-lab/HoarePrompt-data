Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, alternating, for a total of 2n turns. The goal is to maximize my points, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

First, I need to understand the scoring mechanism. Each time I play a card, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, I get a point. Same goes for Nene. So, it's about playing cards in such a way that maximizes the number of times you play a second card of a pair.

Now, since Nene is super smart, she'll always play optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize mine. That means I need to anticipate her moves and plan accordingly.

Given that, I need to find out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

Let's look at the input and output formats. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I get n and a list of n integers representing the cards I have. I need to output the maximum points I can get for each test case.

Constraints are that t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, and n is up to 2*10^5 per test case, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking at the example, in the first test case, n=4, and my cards are [1,1,2,3]. Nene's cards must be [2,3,4,4]. The explanation shows a possible sequence of moves and ends with me getting 1 point and Nene getting 3.

I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum points I can get across all test cases.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to know how many pairs of each number I have and how they are distributed between me and Nene.

Since each number appears exactly twice, for each number, it can be:

- Both cards in my hand.

- One card in my hand and one in Nene's.

- Both cards in Nene's hand.

Given that, I need to keep track of these distributions.

Let's define:

- For each number, count how many cards of that number I have.

- Then, for each number, determine if I have 0, 1, or 2 cards.

- Based on that, I can figure out how Nene's cards are distributed.

Wait, no. I know exactly how many cards I have for each number, but I don't know exactly how Nene's cards are distributed, only that she has the remaining cards.

But in terms of strategy, I need to consider the possible moves and how Nene will react.

Let me consider that each pair of identical cards can give at most one point to either me or Nene, because the second card played gets the point.

Wait, actually, the point is given to the player who plays the second card of a pair.

Wait, no: "The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table"

So, if I play a card with x and there's already an x on the table, I get a point.

So, it's about playing the second card of a pair to get a point.

Given that, for each pair, the player who plays the second card gets a point.

Since we alternate turns, and I play first, I need to strategize to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a pair.

But Nene is also playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where both players are trying to maximize their own scores.

I need to find the optimal strategy for both players.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider that for each pair, the player who plays the second card gets a point.

Since turns are alternating and I start, I need to decide the order in which to play my cards.

Nene, being optimal, will try to either play the second card of a pair herself or deny me the opportunity to play the second card.

Wait, more precisely, Nene will try to maximize her points first and minimize mine second.

So, she will prioritize playing the second card of a pair for herself, and if she has a choice, she'll choose moves that minimize my points.

This seems complex.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the number of pairs that I have both cards of, and the number of pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other.

From the problem, for each number from 1 to n, there are two cards. So, for each number, the distribution can be:

- Both cards are in my hand.

- One card is in my hand and one in Nene's.

- Both cards are in Nene's hand.

In the first case, I can potentially get a point by playing the second card.

In the second case, Nene has the other card, so whoever plays their card second for that pair will get a point.

In the third case, Nene can get a point from that pair.

So, I need to count:

- The number of pairs where I have both cards.

- The number of pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other.

- The number of pairs where Nene has both cards.

Let me denote:

- Let s be the number of pairs where I have both cards.

- Let t be the number of pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other.

- Let u be the number of pairs where Nene has both cards.

From the input, I can count s and t, since I know how many cards I have for each number.

u can be calculated as u = n - s - t, because there are n pairs in total.

Now, I need to find out how many points I can get, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Let's think about s and t.

For the s pairs where I have both cards, I can choose to play them in such a way that I play the second card to get a point.

For the t pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other, the player who plays their card second will get a point.

Nene will try to play her card second for these pairs to get the point herself.

Similarly, for the u pairs where Nene has both cards, she can choose to play the second card to get a point.

So, I need to strategize to maximize the points from my s pairs and the t pairs.

Let me consider the total number of points available.

For each of the s pairs, I can potentially get a point by playing the second card.

For each of the t pairs, either I or Nene can get a point, depending on who plays their card second.

For each of the u pairs, Nene can get a point.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, in the t pairs where one card is mine and one is Nene's, Nene will try to play her card second to get the point, unless it's beneficial for her to let me get the point.

Wait, but Nene is trying to maximize her points first, so she'll prefer to get the point in t pairs whenever possible.

But I need to consider the sequence of moves.

Let me think in terms of the number of pairs.

Total pairs: n.

Pairs where I can get a point: s (since I have both cards) plus t (if I play my card second).

But Nene will try to prevent me from getting points from t pairs.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is s plus some points from t, depending on Nene's behavior.

Wait, maybe it's s plus the floor of (t divided by 2), but I need to think carefully.

Actually, it's more involved.

Let me consider that in the game, me and Nene take turns, I start, and we each have n cards to play.

Let me think in terms of the sequence of moves.

I play a card, then Nene plays a card, and so on.

I need to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a pair.

Nene needs to maximize the number of times she plays the second card of a pair.

Given that, I need to strategize accordingly.

This seems like a complex game, perhaps I can model it using dynamic programming.

Let me consider dp[i][j], where i is the number of my remaining cards, and j is something else.

Wait, perhaps dp[i][j], where i is the number of my remaining pairs where I have both cards, and j is the number of remaining mixed pairs.

Wait, perhaps dp[s][t], where s is the number of pairs where I have both cards, and t is the number of mixed pairs.

Let me try to define dp[s][t] as the maximum points I can get given s pairs where I have both cards and t mixed pairs.

Let's see.

For each move, I can choose to play a card from my pairs (s) or from the mixed pairs (t).

If I play a card from my pairs (s), and Nene doesn't have a card that matches it, then I can play the second card to get a point.

But Nene might play in a way to interfere.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each of my pairs, I can choose to play both cards in my turns, and get a point, provided that Nene doesn't play a matching card in between.

But Nene can see the table, so she knows what's been played.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the example.

In the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

The explanation shows a sequence where I get 1 point and Nene gets 3 points.

Looking at the sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1 and get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

Is there another sequence where I can get more points?

Suppose I play 2 first:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

5. I play 1 and get 1 point

6. Nene plays 3

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

In this sequence, I get 1 point again.

Another sequence:

1. I play 3

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

5. I play 1 and get 1 point

6. Nene plays 2

7. I play 2

8. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

Again, I get 1 point.

It seems that in all sequences, I can get only 1 point.

Looking back, s=1 (pair 1), t=2 (pairs 2 and 3), u=1 (pair 4).

So, s=1, t=2, u=1.

From this, perhaps the formula is min(s, ceil(t/2)) or something similar.

Wait, in this case, min(1, ceil(2/2)) = min(1,1) =1, which matches the example.

Let me check another test case.

Second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: the remaining cards: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, counts:

1: me has 1, Nene has 1

2: me has 1, Nene has 1

3: me has 0, Nene has 2

4: me has 1, Nene has 1

5: me has 2, Nene has 0

6: me has 0, Nene has 2

7: me has 1, Nene has 1

8: me has 2, Nene has 0

So, s = number of pairs where I have both cards: 5 and 8 => s=2

t = number of mixed pairs: 1,2,4,7 => t=4

u = number of pairs where Nene has both cards: 3 and 6 => u=2

According to the previous formula, min(s, ceil(t/2)) = min(2, ceil(4/2)) = min(2,2)=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

Another test case:

Third test case:

n=8

My cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, counts:

1: me has 1, Nene has 1

2: me has 1, Nene has 1

3: me has 1, Nene has 1

4: me has 2, Nene has 1

5: me has 1, Nene has 1

6: me has 1, Nene has 1

7: me has 1, Nene has 1

8: me has 0, Nene has 2

Wait, wait, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, frequencies:

1:1

2:1

3:1

4:2

5:1

6:1

7:1

8:0

So, s=1 (pair 4), t=6 (1,2,3,5,6,7), u=1 (pair 8)

According to the formula, min(1, ceil(6/2))=min(1,3)=1, which matches the sample output of 1.

Another test case:

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

Nene's cards:1,2,3

s=0 (no pairs where I have both cards), t=3 (all pairs are mixed), u=0

According to the formula, min(0, ceil(3/2))=min(0,2)=0, which matches the sample output of 0.

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards:1

Nene's cards:1

s=0, t=1, u=0

min(0, ceil(1/2))=min(0,1)=0, matches the sample output of 0.

So, it seems that the formula min(s, ceil(t/2)) works for all the sample test cases.

Let me try to see if this makes sense.

s is the number of pairs where I have both cards. For each such pair, I can play the second card to get a point, provided that Nene doesn't interfere.

t is the number of mixed pairs, where I have one card and Nene has the other.

For each mixed pair, the player who plays their card second gets the point.

Nene will try to play her card second for these pairs to get the point.

But I can try to play my card second for some of these pairs to get the point.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will prioritize playing her card second for mixed pairs.

So, in the t mixed pairs, Nene can get floor(t / 2) points, and I can get ceil(t / 2) points, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that in t mixed pairs, Nene can get t points if she plays optimally, but I can try to get some points from these pairs.

But in the formula I derived, min(s, ceil(t / 2)), it seems that I can get s points from my pairs and ceil(t / 2) points from the mixed pairs.

But why min(s, ceil(t / 2))?

Wait, maybe it's s + floor((t - 2*s + 1)/2) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need a better understanding.

Let me consider that I can choose to play my pairs (s pairs) in such a way that I play the first card, then Nene plays something else, and then I play the second card to get a point.

But Nene can interfere by playing a mixed pair's card second to get her point.

So, perhaps for each of my s pairs, I can get a point, but Nene can block some of them by playing her cards appropriately.

Wait, perhaps for each of my s pairs, I can get a point, and for the t mixed pairs, Nene can get floor(t / 2) points, and I can get ceil(t / 2) points.

But in the first test case, s=1, t=2, so min(1,1)=1, which matches.

In the second test case, s=2, t=4, min(2,2)=2.

In the third test case, s=1, t=6, min(1,3)=1.

In the fourth test case, s=0, t=3, min(0,2)=0.

In the fifth test case, s=0, t=1, min(0,1)=0.

So, it seems consistent.

But is this always true?

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose n=2.

My cards:1,2

Nene's cards:1,2

So, s=0, t=2, u=0.

According to the formula, min(0,1)=0.

Is that correct?

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 1 and gets 1 point

3. I play 2

4. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

I get 0 points, Nene gets 2 points.

Another sequence:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 1

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

I get 0 points, Nene gets 1 point.

Wait, in the second sequence, Nene gets only 1 point, but in the first sequence, she gets 2 points.

But since Nene plays optimally to maximize her points, she would choose the first sequence, getting 2 points and minimizing my points (which are 0 in both sequences).

So, in this case, I get 0 points, which matches the formula min(0,1)=0.

Another test case:

n=3

My cards:1,1,2

Nene's cards:2,3,3

s=1 (pair 1), t=1 (pair 2), u=1 (pair 3)

According to the formula, min(1, ceil(1/2))=min(1,1)=1.

Is that correct?

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 2

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 3

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Another sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 3

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point

I get 1 point, Nene gets 2 points.

So, in both sequences, I get 1 point, which matches the formula.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=5

My cards:1,1,2,3,4

Nene's cards:2,3,4,5,5

s=1 (pair 1), t=3 (pairs 2,3,4), u=1 (pair 5)

According to the formula, min(1, ceil(3/2))=min(1,2)=1.

Is that correct?

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 2

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 3

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

7. I play 4

8. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

9. I play nothing (since I have only 5 cards)

10. Nene plays 5

11. I play nothing

12. Nene plays 5 and gets 1 point

I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

Another sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 3

3. I play 1 and get 1 point

4. Nene plays 2

5. I play 4

6. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point

7. I play 2

8. Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point

9. I play nothing

10. Nene plays 5

11. I play nothing

12. Nene plays 5 and gets 1 point

Again, I get 1 point.

So, seems consistent.

Therefore, the formula min(s, ceil(t/2)) seems to hold.

Hence, the solution is to calculate s and t for each test case and output min(s, ceil(t/2)).

Now, looking at the given program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

print(func_1())

def func_1():

n = int(input())

cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

dp[n - 1][0] = 0

dp[n - 2][0] = 0

for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):

for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:

dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]

elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)

else:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])

return dp[0][0]

This seems like a dynamic programming approach, but it's not clear what dp[i][j] represents in this context.

Given that, and considering that the formula min(s, ceil(t/2)) seems to work, perhaps this DP approach is overcomplicating things.

Alternatively, maybe the DP is implementing some other logic.

But given that my formula seems to work for all sample test cases and my additional test cases, I think the answer is to compute s and t for each test case and output min(s, (t + 1) // 2).

Hence, the program should be:

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = [0] * (n + 1)

for x in a:

count[x] += 1

s = sum(1 for c in count if c == 2)

t = sum(1 for c in count if c == 1)

print(min(s, (t + 1) // 2))

This is simpler and more efficient, running in O(n) per test case.

Given that, I think the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
