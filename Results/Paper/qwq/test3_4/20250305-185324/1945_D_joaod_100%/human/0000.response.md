Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to move up in the queue to be among the first m people. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places. Each swap has a cost, and there are also costs for passing people in between. I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first m.

First, I need to understand the rules of swapping. For the i-th person in the queue, if Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j where j < i and swap with the person at position j. The cost for this swap is a_j coins, and for each k between j and i (exclusive), Kirill has to pay b_k coins. He can do this any number of times.

My goal is to get Kirill from position n+1 down to position <= m with the least cost.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to model the queue. Let's number the positions from 1 to n+1, where 1 is the front of the queue and n+1 is Kirill's initial position.

I need to find a sequence of swaps that moves Kirill from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m, inclusive, spending the minimum possible coins.

I should consider that each swap involves jumping over several positions and paying costs for those jumps.

This sounds like a graph problem, where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with costs. Then, I could use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from position n+1 to any position <= m.

But given the constraints (n up to 2e5), a standard Dijkstra might be too slow because it would be O(n log n).

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me see if I can model this differently.

If I think about moving Kirill one position at a time, but each swap can cover multiple positions, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as dynamic programming.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum cost for Kirill to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

Now, how to compute dp[i]?

Kirill can reach position i by swapping with some j < i, and the cost is dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)

This seems correct.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I need to find a way to compute dp[i] quickly for all i.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me see.

If I iterate i from 1 to m, and for each i, iterate j from 1 to i-1, it would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 efficiently.

Wait, if I precompute the prefix sums of b, then sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])

Hmm.

Let me rearrange this:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

So, dp[i] = min_over_j (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

Now, if I keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i, then dp[i] is just that minimum plus prefix[i-1].

This is great because I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimum (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) as I iterate i from 1 to m.

So, I can do this in O(n) time.

That's efficient enough.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

First, I need to compute the prefix sums of b.

Let me define prefix[i] = sum of b[k] for k from 1 to i.

Wait, but in programming, it's often easier to have prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i].

Yes, I'll do that.

Then, for dp[i], using the formula above.

I need to initialize dp[1].

How can Kirill reach position 1?

Well, he can swap directly from position n+1 to position 1, paying a_1 plus sum of b_k from k=2 to k=n.

Wait, but in the dp formulation, dp[1] would be min over j <1, but j can't be less than 1.

So, dp[1] = cost of swapping directly from n+1 to 1.

Which is a_1 + sum of b_k from k=2 to n.

Wait, but in the dp formula, dp[1] would be 0 + prefix[0] if i=1.

Wait, I need to be careful with indices.

Let me redefine the positions to be from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position n.

That might make the indexing easier.

So, positions are 0 to n, Kirill starts at n.

He wants to reach positions 0 to m-1.

Now, for each i from 0 to m-1, he can swap with j < i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, adjusting indices.

Let me proceed with positions 1 to n+1, with Kirill at n+1.

I need to make sure the indices are consistent.

Actually, to simplify, I'll adjust the positions to be from 1 to n+1, with Kirill at n+1.

But in programming, arrays start at 0, so perhaps it's better to have positions 0 to n.

Let me try that.

Let positions be 0 to n, with Kirill at position n.

He wants to reach positions 0 to m-1.

Now, for each i from 0 to m-1, he can swap with j < i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, but j < i, and i is from 0 to m-1.

But Kirill is at position n, which is greater than m-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe it's better to stick with positions 1 to n+1, with Kirill at n+1.

I need to be careful with indices.

Let's try to implement the dp as per the earlier formula.

First, compute prefix sums of b.

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i]

Then, dp[1] = a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]

Wait, no.

Wait, in the dp formula:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j-1] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

Wait, I think I messed up the indices.

Let me think again.

Define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = b[1]

prefix[2] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix[k] = sum of b[1] to b[k]

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k = prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

In the dp formula:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k)

Which is dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])

Wait, but I want to group terms involving j.

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

So, define for each i, dp[i] = min_over_j (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

Now, as I iterate i from 1 to m, I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Let me initialize dp[1].

dp[1] = a[1] + sum from k=2 to n of b_k, because to go directly from n+1 to 1, he has to pay a[1] and pass all between 2 to n.

Which is a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]

Wait, no.

Wait, prefix[i] is sum from 1 to i.

So, sum from k=2 to n is prefix[n] - prefix[1]

Yes.

So, dp[1] = a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]

But according to the dp formula:

dp[1] = min over j <1 of (dp[j] - prefix[j-1] + a_j) + prefix[0]

But there is no j <1, so dp[1] should be a[1] + prefix[0]?

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I think I have an off-by-one error in indexing.

Maybe I should define prefix[i] as sum from 1 to i-1.

Let me try that.

Define prefix[1] = 0

prefix[2] = b[1]

prefix[3] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix[i] = sum from k=1 to i-1 of b_k

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k = prefix[i] - prefix[j+1]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i] - prefix[j+1])

Let me see.

Wait, but then dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i] - prefix[j+1]

I can write it as (dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j) + prefix[i]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j) + prefix[i]

Now, as I iterate i from 1 to m, I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j) for j < i.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to write a small example to verify.

Take the first test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix[i] for i=1 to 5:

prefix[1] = 0

prefix[2] = b[1] = 4

prefix[3] = b[1]+b[2] = 4+3=7

prefix[4] = b[1]+b[2]+b[3] =4+3+8=15

prefix[5] = b[1]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=4+3+8+5=20

Now, compute dp[1] and dp[2], then take the minimum.

dp[1] = min over j <1 of (dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j) + prefix[1]

But there is no j <1, so dp[1] = something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[1] = a[1] + sum from j=2 to n of b_j.

Which is a[1] + prefix[n+1] - prefix[2]

Here, n=4, so prefix[5] - prefix[2] =20 -4=16

So, dp[1] =7 +16=23

Similarly, dp[2] = min over j <2 of (dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j) + prefix[2]

So, j=1:

dp[1] - prefix[2] + a[1] =23 -7 +7=23

So, dp[2] =23 + prefix[2]=23+4=27

Wait, but according to the example, the answer is 14.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my dp formulation is incorrect.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe instead of moving from n+1 to i, I should consider the cost to move Kirill from n+1 to i, which involves swapping with j < i and paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of Kirill moving directly to some position i, paying a_i plus sum of b_k from i+1 to n.

Wait, perhaps that's simpler.

If Kirill moves directly to position i, he pays a_i plus sum of b_k from i+1 to n.

Then, he can perform swaps to move up to position <=m.

Wait, but he can perform any number of swaps.

Wait, maybe I need to consider all possible sequences of swaps.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the example and see how to get 14.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

According to the output, the minimum cost is 14.

How can we achieve that?

Option 1: Move directly to position 1, paying a[1]+sum of b[2 to 4]=7 +3+8+5=7+16=23

Option 2: Move to position 2, paying a[2]+sum of b[3 to 4]=3+8+5=16

Then, from position 2, swap with position 1, paying a[1]+sum of b[2]

Wait, but a[1] is 7, and sum of b[2] is 3, so total 16+7+3=26

That's worse than 23.

Option 3: Move directly to position 2, paying 16

Then, swap to position 1, paying a[1]+b[2]=7+3=10, total 16+10=26

Wait, that's still 26.

But the output is 14, which is less than both 23 and 26.

How is that possible?

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Option 4: Move directly to position 3, paying a[3]+sum of b[4]=6+5=11

Then, swap to position 2, paying a[2]+sum of b[3]=3+8=11, total 11+11=22

Still higher than 14.

Option 5: Move directly to position 4, paying a[4]=9

Then, swap to position 3, paying a[3]+sum of b[4]=6+5=11, total 9+11=20

Then, swap to position 2, paying a[2]+sum of b[3]=3+8=11, total 20+11=31

Worse.

Option 6: Move directly to position 3, paying 11

Then, swap to position 1, paying a[1]+sum of b[2 to 3]=7+3+8=18, total 11+18=29

Worse.

Option 7: Move directly to position 2, paying 16

Then, swap to position 1, paying a[1]+sum of b[2]=7+3=10, total 16+10=26

Same as before.

Wait, none of these reach 14.

Maybe I'm missing a better sequence.

Wait, perhaps moving directly to position 2, paying a[2]=3, and sum of b[3 to 4]=8+5=13, total 16

Then, swap to position 1, paying a[1]+sum of b[2]=7+3=10, total 16+10=26

Same as before.

Wait, but how to get 14?

Wait, maybe moving directly to position 1, paying a[1]=7 and sum of b[2 to 4]=3+8+5=16, total 23

Then, realize that's higher than 14.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the sum of b_k is not cumulative but something else.

Wait, reading the problem again:

"For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j . In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k ."

So, to swap from i to j, pay a_j and sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

In the example, n=4, m=2.

Kirill starts at position 5 (n+1=5).

He can swap to any position j <5, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to 4.

Wait, but according to the problem, he is at position i and swaps with j < i.

But in the example, he's at position 5, can swap with j <5, which are positions 1 to 4.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I considered positions 1 to n, but perhaps it's better to consider positions 1 to n+1.

Let me redefine positions as 1 to n+1, with Kirill at n+1.

Then, he can swap with any j < n+1, i.e., j from 1 to n.

The cost is a_j + sum of b_k for k from j+1 to n.

Wait, because i=n+1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in general, when Kirill is at position i, he can choose any j < i and swap with j, paying a_j + sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

In this case, i=n+1, so sum from k=j+1 to n.

So, to swap from n+1 to j, pay a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k.

Then, after swapping to j, he can repeat the process.

He wants to reach some position <=m.

So, the direct way is to swap from n+1 to some j <=m, paying a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k.

Alternatively, he can swap to some intermediate position and then to a position <=m.

I need to find the minimum cost among all possible sequences of swaps that lead to a position <=m.

In the first option, swapping directly from n+1 to j <=m, paying a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k.

In the second option, swapping from n+1 to some j >m, then from j to some position <=m.

But perhaps that's more expensive.

In the example, n=4, m=2.

So, he can swap directly from 5 to 1 or 2, paying a_1 + sum from 2 to 4 of b_k =7 +3+8+5=23, or a_2 + sum from 3 to 4 of b_k=3+8+5=16.

Alternatively, swap from 5 to 3, paying a_3 + sum from 4 to 4 of b_k=6+5=11, then from 3 to 1 or 2.

From 3 to 1: a_1 + sum from 2 to 2 of b_k=7+3=10, total 11+10=21.

From 3 to 2: a_2 + sum from 3 to 3 of b_k=3+8=11, total 11+11=22.

From 5 to 4: a_4=9, then from 4 to 2: a_2 + sum from 3 to 3 of b_k=3+8=11, total 9+11=20.

From 5 to 4:9, then from 4 to 3: a_3 + sum from 4 to 4 of b_k=6+5=11, total 9+11=20.

Then from 3 to 2:11, total 20+11=31.

Not better.

Wait, but the output is 14, which is less than all these.

How?

Maybe there's a better sequence.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 2: a_2 + sum from 3 to 4 of b_k=3+8+5=16.

Then from 2 to 1: a_1 + sum from 2 to 2 of b_k=7+3=10, total 16+10=26.

Still 26.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 1:23.

From 5 to 3:11.

From 5 to 4:9.

None of these seem to give 14.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Kirill can swap multiple times in a sequence.

For example, from 5 to 3, paying a_3 + sum from 4 to 4=6+5=11.

Then from 3 to 2, paying a_2 + sum from 3 to 3=3+8=11, total 22.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe there's a way to swap from 5 to 2 via some other position.

Wait, perhaps from 5 to 4: pay a_4=9.

Then from 4 to 2: pay a_2 + sum from 3 to 3=3+8=11, total 9+11=20.

Still higher than 14.

Wait, maybe from 5 to 3:11.

Then from 3 to 1:10, total 21.

Still higher.

Wait, perhaps from 5 to 2:16.

Then from 2 to 1:10, total 26.

Wait, still not 14.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe Kirill doesn't need to swap directly to position <=m.

He can swap to a position >m and then to a position <=m.

Wait, in the first step, he swaps from 5 to j <5, paying a_j + sum from j+1 to 4 of b_k.

Then, from j, he can swap to k <j, paying a_k + sum from k+1 to j-1 of b_k.

He can do this multiple times until he reaches a position <=m.

I need to find the minimum cost among all such sequences.

This seems like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with costs a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill swaps from n+1 to j, paying a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k.

Then, from j, he can swap to k <j, paying a_k + sum from l=k+1 to j-1 of b_l.

Wait, the sum from l=k+1 to j-1 is the same as sum from l=k+1 to n minus sum from l=j to n.

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can think of the total cost as a_j + sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k, plus a_k + sum from l=k+1 to j-1 of b_l, and so on.

This seems messy.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for each position k that is passed over in the swaps.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, we can model the queue as a graph where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with costs.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard graph algorithm like Dijkstra might be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a sliding window or some prefix sum optimization.

Let me consider that Kirill needs to reach position <=m, starting from n+1.

He can perform swaps that involve jumping to any position j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Wait, maybe I can iterate from position n+1 down to position 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Wait, but positions are from 1 to n+1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from position 1 to n+1, but that might not make sense.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in reverse.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a_i + sum from k=i+1 to j-1 of b_k)

Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position i.

He can do this by first moving to some position j > i, and then swapping from j to i, paying a_i + sum from k=i+1 to j-1 of b_k.

But this seems circular.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Kirill starts at n+1 and can swap to any j < n+1, i.e., j from 1 to n.

From there, he can swap to any k < j, and so on, until he reaches a position <=m.

This sounds like a tree structure, with n+1 as the root, and edges going to positions < i.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute the minimum cost.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the queue is linear, and process it in a certain order to compute the minimum cost.

Let me consider processing positions from 1 to m, computing dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

dp[i] = a_i + sum from k=i+1 to n of b_k  # direct swap from n+1 to i

Plus, for each j > i, dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k)

But this seems too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better way.

Wait, maybe I can compute the minimum over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j) + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k

This looks similar to computing a minimum over j of (dp[j] + a_j) plus a sum between j and i.

This seems like a range query problem.

Perhaps I can use a segment tree to keep track of the minimum (dp[j] + a_j) and the sum of b_k.

Wait, but I need to minimize (dp[j] + a_j - sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k)

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I process positions from n down to 1.

At each position i, I compute dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

dp[i] = a_i + sum from k=i+1 to n of b_k  # direct swap from n+1 to i

Plus, if I have already computed dp[j] for j > i, I can consider swapping from j to i.

Wait, but j > i, and I'm processing from n down to 1.

Wait, maybe it's better to process from 1 to n.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some dynamic programming problems, we can optimize the recurrence using sliding windows or other techniques when the recurrence involves a minimum or maximum plus some linear terms.

In this case, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k) + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k

Wait, that doesn't help.

Wait, going back to the earlier dp formula:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k)

I can think of sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k as sum from k=1 to i-1 of b_k - sum from k=1 to j of b_k

So, define prefix[i] = sum from k=1 to i of b_k

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k = prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])

Which is dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

Now, as I iterate i from 1 to m, I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Let me define a variable min_val, which is the minimum over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j)

Then, dp[i] = min_val + prefix[i-1]

And after computing dp[i], I can update min_val with dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i

Wait, but I need to make sure that I consider all possible j < i.

Wait, perhaps I can use a data structure to keep track of the minimum (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i.

But for n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate i from 1 to m, and maintain a sliding window minimum of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Given that, I can compute dp[i] = min_val + prefix[i-1]

Then, update min_val with dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i

This seems plausible.

Let me try with the first test case.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix[i]:

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=4+3=7

prefix[3]=4+3+8=15

prefix[4]=4+3+8+5=20

Now, iterate i from 1 to 2.

Initialize min_val to infinity.

For i=1:

dp[1] = min_val + prefix[0] = min_val + 0

But min_val is infinity, so dp[1] is infinity.

Wait, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I need to initialize dp[1].

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that to reach position 1, Kirill can swap directly from n+1 to 1, paying a_1 + sum from k=2 to n of b_k.

Which is a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]

So, dp[1] =7 +20 -4=23

Similarly, dp[2] = a[2] + prefix[n] - prefix[2]=3 +20 -7=16

Then, dp[1] = min(dp[1], dp[2] - prefix[2] + a[2]) + prefix[1]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize dp as an array of size m+1, filled with infinity, except dp[1] is set to a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to implement the dp as per the earlier formula.

Initialize dp[i] for i from 1 to m as dp[i] = a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i]

Then, iterate through i from 1 to m, and keep track of the minimum (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a[j]) for j < i

Then, dp[i] = min(dp[i], min_val + prefix[i-1])

And update min_val after that.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 1 to m, and for each i, compute dp[i] as the minimum between:

- direct swap cost: a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i]

- the minimum over j < i of dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

But this is similar to the earlier formula.

To make it efficient, I can keep track of the minimum (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Then, dp[i] = min(dp[i], min_val + prefix[i-1])

Then, update min_val = min(min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i)

Wait, I think I have it.

Let me try with the first test case.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=7

prefix[3]=15

prefix[4]=20

Initialize dp[1] =7 +20 -4=23

dp[2]=3 +20 -7=16

Initialize min_val = dp[1] - prefix[1] + a[1] =23 -4 +7=26

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps I should iterate i from 1 to m, and at each step, compute dp[i] as the minimum between its direct cost and min_val + prefix[i-1]

Then, update min_val = min(min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i] + a[i])

Wait, let's try.

Initialize min_val to infinity.

Set dp[1] = a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]=7+20-4=23

Then, min_val = dp[1] - prefix[1] + a[1]=23-4+7=26

Then, dp[2] = min(dp[1] - prefix[1] + a[1]) + prefix[1]=26 +0=26

Wait, that's not matching the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[i] to the minimum between its direct cost and the min_val + prefix[i-1]

So, dp[1] = a[1] + prefix[n] - prefix[1]=7+20-4=23

min_val = dp[1] - prefix[1] + a[1]=23-4+7=26

dp[2] = min( a[2] + prefix[n] - prefix[2], min_val + prefix[1] ) = min(3+20-7, 26+4)=min(16,30)=16

Then, min_val = min(min_val, dp[2] - prefix[2] + a[2])=min(26,16-7+3)=min(26,12)=12

Then, dp[3]=min(a[3]+prefix[n]-prefix[3], min_val + prefix[2])=min(6+20-15,12+7)=min(11,19)=11

Then, min_val = min(min_val, dp[3]-prefix[3]+a[3})=min(12,11-15+6)=min(12,2)=2

Then, dp[4]=min(a[4]+prefix[n]-prefix[4], min_val + prefix[3})=min(9+20-20,2+15)=min(9,17)=9

Then, min_val = min(min_val, dp[4]-prefix[4]+a[4})=min(2,9-20+9)=min(2,-2)= -2

But in this case, m=2, so I only compute dp[1] and dp[2], and take the minimum between them.

So, dp[1]=23, dp[2]=16

Minimum is 16, but the example output is 14.

So, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] = min( a[i] + sum from k=i+1 to n of b_k, min over j < i of dp[j] + a_j + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k )

Which is min( a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i], min over j < i of dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j] )

Then, dp[i] = min( a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i], min_over_j ( dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j ) + prefix[i-1] )

So, I can keep track of min_over_j ( dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j )

Then, dp[i] = min( a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i], min_val + prefix[i-1] )

Then, update min_val = min( min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i )

Wait, in the first test case:

Initialize min_val to infinity.

dp[1] = min( a[1] + prefix[4] - prefix[1], min_val + prefix[0] ) = min(7+20-4, infinity+0)=min(23,infinity)=23

Then, min_val = min( min_val, dp[1] - prefix[1] + a[1] )=min(infinity,23-4+7)=min(infinity,26)=26

dp[2] = min( a[2] + prefix[4] - prefix[2], min_val + prefix[1] )=min(3+20-7,26+4)=min(16,30)=16

Then, min_val = min(26,16-7+3)=min(26,12)=12

So, dp[1]=23, dp[2]=16, minimum is 16.

But the example output is 14.

So, perhaps this formula is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the dp transition.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that dp[j] includes the sum up to j, and when moving to i, I need to add the sum from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the prefix sums.

Wait, maybe I need to define prefix[i] as sum from 1 to i.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of ( dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j] )

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of ( dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j ) + prefix[i-1]

So, I can keep track of the minimum of ( dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j )

Then, dp[i] = min_direct + prefix[i-1]

Wait, no.

Wait, dp[i] = min( a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i], min_val + prefix[i-1] )

Then, min_val = min( min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i )

Wait, in the first test case:

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=7

prefix[3]=15

prefix[4]=20

Initialize min_val = infinity

dp[1] = min(7 +20 -4, infinity +0)=min(23,infinity)=23

Then, min_val = min(infinity, 23 -4 +7)=min(infinity,26)=26

dp[2] = min(3 +20 -7, 26 +0)=min(16,26)=16

Then, min_val = min(26,16 -7 +3)=min(26,12)=12

So, dp[1]=23, dp[2]=16, minimum is 16.

But the example output is 14.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Wait, perhaps prefix[i] should be sum from 1 to i-1.

Let me try that.

prefix[1]=0

prefix[2]=4

prefix[3]=4+3=7

prefix[4]=4+3+8=15

prefix[5]=4+3+8+5=20

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i] - prefix[j+1]

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of ( dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i] - prefix[j+1] )

Which is min over j < i of ( dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j ) + prefix[i]

So, I need to keep track of min over j < i of ( dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j )

Then, dp[i] = min_direct + prefix[i]

Where min_direct is a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i]

Wait, no.

Wait, a[i] + sum from j+1 to n of b_k = a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i]

Wait, but in this new formula, dp[i] = min over j < i of ( dp[j] - prefix[j+1] + a_j ) + prefix[i]

So, initialize min_val = infinity

For i=1 to m:

dp[i] = min( a[i] + prefix[n] - prefix[i], min_val + prefix[i] )

Then, min_val = min( min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i+1] + a_i )

Wait, in the first test case:

prefix[1]=0

prefix[2]=4

prefix[3]=7

prefix[4]=15

prefix[5]=20

dp[1] = min(7 +20 -0, infinity +0)=min(27,infinity)=27

Then, min_val = min(infinity,27 -4 +7)=min(infinity,30)=30

dp[2] = min(3 +20 -4,30 +4)=min(19,34)=19

Then, min_val = min(30,19 -7 +3)=min(30,15)=15

So, dp[1]=27, dp[2]=19, minimum is 19.

Still not matching the example 14.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula again.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that dp[j] already includes the sum up to j, so when moving from j to i, I need to add sum from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I compute dp[i].

Let me try to
