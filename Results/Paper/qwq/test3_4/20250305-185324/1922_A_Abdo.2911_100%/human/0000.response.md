Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which is also a string of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that at least one position i violates one of the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. I need to create a template t where:

- For each position i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Actually, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

But for a and b to match the template, they must satisfy the conditions for all positions.

I think I need to consider each position independently and see if I can set t[i] in such a way that a and b match, and c does not match at least one position.

Let me consider the possibilities for each position i:

1. a[i] == b[i]:

- If a[i] == b[i], then for both a and b to match the template, t[i] must be set in a way that accommodates this equality.

- If t[i] is lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i] (since a and b must both be equal to t[i]).

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

But since a[i] == b[i], setting t[i] uppercase would require that a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which would mean t[i] != uppercase(a[i]).

Wait, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of making t[i] lowercase or uppercase based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

2. a[i] != b[i]:

- If a[i] != b[i], it's trickier because a and b must both match the template, which imposes different constraints.

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] must equal t[i], and b[i] must also equal t[i], but since a[i] != b[i], this is impossible.

- Therefore, if a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase.

- In this case, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- Also, for c to not match, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, in this scenario, t[i] must be uppercase, and c[i] must equal the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. For c to not match, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Given that a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase, and for c to not match, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

But since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

So, t[i] must be chosen such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], but c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, but a[i] != b[i], and t[i] is uppercase, so a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

Additionally, for c to not match, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, lowercase(t[i]) must be different from a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

Therefore, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and t[i] is uppercase, then lowercase(t[i]) must not be equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

So, for a[i] != b[i], to have a valid t[i], c[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Wait, let's think again.

If a[i] != b[i], then t[i] must be uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Additionally, for c to not match, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

But if lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for a[i] != b[i], to have a valid t[i], c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible because there's no letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i].

Wait, but there are 26 letters, so usually, there are plenty of letters different from a[i] and b[i].

But in the case where a[i] and b[i] are different, and c[i] is also different from both, then we can set t[i] to be the uppercase version of c[i].

Wait, but t[i] must be uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

And c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

So, t[i] must be uppercase(c[i]), provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

But, if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then it's impossible because c[i] would equal lowercase(t[i]), which must be different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no. If c[i] == a[i], but a[i] != b[i], then setting t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], but c[i] == a[i], which is != lowercase(t[i]), which contradicts.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to summarize:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Set t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i].

- Or set t[i] to be uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] must be uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, for each position i, I need to check if there's a way to set t[i] such that:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase equal to a[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- t[i] must be uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, in the case where a[i] == b[i], option 2 seems similar to the a[i] != b[i] case.

But in the a[i] == b[i] case, option 2 requires c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) != a[i].

So, in this case, c[i] != a[i].

In the a[i] != b[i] case, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]), which is != a[i] and != b[i].

So, in both cases, for t[i] to be uppercase, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]), which must be != a[i] (and != b[i] if a[i] != b[i]).

Therefore, for t[i] to be uppercase:

- If a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

In the a[i] == b[i] case, there's also the option to set t[i] to lowercase equal to a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i].

So, to have a valid template t, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Either c[i] != a[i], in which case we can set t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i], or uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- Must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], in which case we can set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, but in the a[i] != b[i] case, a[i] and b[i] are different, so there are letters that are neither a[i] nor b[i]. We can set lowercase(t[i]) to be any letter not equal to a[i] or b[i], and set c[i] equal to that.

But only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, in summary:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], we can set t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i], or uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If c[i] == a[i], then we cannot set t[i] in any way that satisfies the conditions, because:

- If t[i] is lowercase equal to a[i], then c[i] != a[i] is required, which is not the case.

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]), which must be != a[i], but c[i] == a[i], so this is impossible.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- We must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], in order to set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then it's impossible to find such a t[i].

Therefore, to have a valid template t, for all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] must not equal a[i].

And for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must not equal a[i] and not equal b[i].

If these conditions hold, then we can construct such a template t.

Wait, but actually, for the positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], we can set t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i], or choose an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not a[i] and equals c[i].

But in the positions where a[i] != b[i], we must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, overall, if for all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, it's possible to construct such a template t.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but is that sufficient?

Let me think about it.

Suppose that for all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i], and for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Then, for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i], set t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i], since c[i] != a[i], which satisfies the condition.

- If a[i] != b[i], set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Since c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], we can set t[i] to be uppercase(c[i].upper()), ensuring that lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], which is != a[i] and != b[i].

Therefore, in this case, it's possible to construct such a template t.

On the other hand, if there exists any position where:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and (c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]),

then it's impossible to find a template t that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, the problem reduces to checking, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If all these conditions hold, then print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

Wait, but in the example provided:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's verify this.

First test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

Here, a[0] == "a", b[0] == "b", c[0] == "c"

Since a[0] != b[0], we need c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0], which holds (c[0] == "c" != "a" and != "b"). So, it's possible, hence "YES".

Second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

Position 1: a[0]=='a', b[0]=='b', c[0]=='a'

a[0] != b[0], so need c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0]. But c[0] == 'a' == a[0], so condition fails.

Position 2: a[1]=='a', b[1]=='b', c[1]=='a'

Same as position 1.

Hence, "NO".

Third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

Let's compare each position:

Position 1: a='m', b='l', c='a' -> a != b, need c != 'm' and c != 'l' -> 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' -> holds.

Position 2: a='a', b='u', c='d' -> a != b, need c != 'a' and c != 'u' -> 'd' != 'a' and 'd' != 'u' -> holds.

...

Position 10: a='e', b='e', c='r' -> a == b, need c != 'e' -> 'r' != 'e' -> holds.

Since all positions satisfy the conditions, it's "YES".

Fourth test case:

n=3

a="acc"

b="abd"

c="abc"

Position 1: a='a', b='a', c='a' -> a == b, need c != 'a' -> but c == 'a' -> fails.

Position 2: a='c', b='b', c='b' -> a != b, need c != 'c' and c != 'b' -> 'b' != 'c' but 'b' == 'b' -> fails.

Position 3: a='c', b='d', c='c' -> a != b, need c != 'c' and c != 'd' -> 'c' == 'c' -> fails.

Hence, "NO".

So, the logic seems to hold based on the example.

Therefore, the approach is to iterate through each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i], then check that c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then check that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If all positions satisfy these conditions, then print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

Now, looking at the given program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

possible = False

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Wait, this seems slightly different from what I deduced.

In my reasoning, to have "YES", all positions must satisfy the conditions.

But in this code, it's checking for at least one position where:

- If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], set possible = True.

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], set possible = True.

Then, if possible is True, print "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems to be checking if there exists at least one position where the conditions hold, but according to my earlier reasoning, we need all positions to satisfy their respective conditions.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

So, it's iterating through each position, and:

- If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], set possible = True and break.

- Else (a[i] != b[i]), if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], continue to the next position.

- Else, set possible = True and break.

Then, if possible is True, print "YES"; else, "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, we need all positions to satisfy their conditions, not just at least one.

This code seems to be checking if there exists at least one position where the conditions hold, which is not the same as all positions satisfying their conditions.

Therefore, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but let's see the example inputs and outputs.

First test case:

n=1

a="a"

b="b"

c="c"

Here, a[0] == "a", b[0] == "b", c[0] == "c"

a[0] != b[0], so it's the elif clause: c[0] == a[0] or c[0] == b[0]? "c" != "a" and "c" != "b", so no, go to else: set possible = True, break. Then print "YES", which is correct.

Second test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="bb"

c="aa"

Position 0: a[0]=="a", b[0]=="b", c[0]=="a"

a[0] != b[0], c[0] == a[0], so elif clause: c[0] == a[0] or c[0] == b[0], which is true, so continue to next position.

Position 1: a[1]=="a", b[1]=="b", c[1]=="a"

Same as position 0: c[1] == a[1], so elif clause: c[1] == a[1] or c[1] == b[1], which is true, so continue.

No position sets possible = True, so print "NO", which is correct.

Third test case:

n=10

a="mathforces"

b="luckforces"

c="adhoccoder"

For each position, a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], so for each position, else clause: set possible = True and break.

Hence, "YES", which is correct.

Fourth test case:

n=3

a="acc"

b="abd"

c="abc"

Position 0: a[0]=="a", b[0]=="a", c[0]=="a"

a[0] == b[0], c[0] == a[0], so don't set possible = True.

No break, proceed to next position.

Position 1: a[1]=="c", b[1]=="b", c[1]=="b"

a[1] != b[1], c[1] == b[1], so elif clause: c[1] == a[1] or c[1] == b[1], which is true, so continue.

Position 2: a[2]=="c", b[2]=="d", c[2]=="c"

a[2] != b[2], c[2] == a[2], so elif clause: c[2] == a[2] or c[2] == b[2], which is true, so continue.

No position sets possible = True, so print "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the code seems to be working correctly for all the examples.

But isn't the code checking for the existence of at least one position where the conditions hold, while I thought we need all positions to satisfy their conditions?

Yet, in the examples, it seems to be giving the correct output.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, if all positions satisfy their conditions, then there exists at least one position where the conditions hold.

Wait, no. If all positions satisfy their conditions, including positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then at least one such position would set possible = True.

Similarly, positions where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] would also set possible = True.

Hence, if all positions satisfy their conditions, there will be at least one position setting possible = True.

On the other hand, if there exists at least one position where the conditions fail, but other positions where they hold, it would still set possible = True.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's consider a case where all positions satisfy the conditions.

In such a case, the code would find the first position where the conditions hold, set possible = True, and break.

Hence, it would correctly print "YES".

If there exists at least one position where the conditions hold, and all other positions satisfy their conditions, it would still print "YES", which is correct.

If there exists a position where the conditions fail, and no position where they hold, it would print "NO", which is also correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, we need all positions to satisfy their conditions.

However, in the code, it's checking for at least one position where the conditions hold, and implicitly ensuring that there are no positions where the conditions fail.

Wait, but the way the code is structured, it's not explicitly checking that all positions satisfy their conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider a test case where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], and another position where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

According to the code, it would find the first such position, set possible = True, and break.

But what if there is another position where the conditions fail?

Well, in such a case, the code would still set possible = True and print "YES", even if another position fails.

But according to the problem, we need all positions to satisfy their conditions.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it doesn't check all positions; it stops at the first position where the conditions hold.

Wait, but in the examples, it seems to work correctly.

Let me think of a test case where the code would give the wrong answer.

Consider n=2

a="aa"

b="ab"

c="ab"

Position 0: a[0]=="a", b[0]=="a", c[0]=="a"

a[0] == b[0], c[0] == a[0], so don't set possible = True.

Position 1: a[1]=="a", b[1]=="b", c[1]=="b"

a[1] != b[1], c[1] == b[1], so elif clause: c[1] == a[1] or c[1] == b[1], which is true, so continue.

No position sets possible = True, so print "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, for position 0: a[0] == b[0], but c[0] == a[0], which violates the condition.

Hence, it should be "NO", which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n=2

a="aa"

b="ab"

c="ac"

Position 0: a[0]=="a", b[0]=="a", c[0]=="a" -> a[0] == b[0], c[0] == a[0] -> don't set possible = True.

Position 1: a[1]=="a", b[1]=="b", c[1]=="c"

a[1] != b[1], c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], so set possible = True and break.

Hence, print "YES".

According to my earlier reasoning, for position 0: a[0] == b[0], but c[0] == a[0], which violates the condition.

So, even though position 1 satisfies the conditions, position 0 fails, so overall, it should be "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, all positions must satisfy their conditions.

But in this test case, the code would print "YES", which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example test cases, it seems to work correctly.

Perhaps the test cases don't cover this scenario.

I need to think carefully.

In the code, it sets possible = True if there exists at least one position where the conditions hold, and ignores other positions.

But according to the problem, we need all positions to satisfy their conditions.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix it, we need to check that for all positions, the conditions hold.

Hence, we should set possible = True only if all positions satisfy their conditions, not just one.

Therefore, the code should iterate through all positions and ensure that no position violates the conditions.

Wait, but in the code, it's set up to find at least one position where the conditions hold, which is not the same.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

- Initialize possible = True.

- Iterate through all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] == a[i], set possible = False.

- Else, continue.

- Else (a[i] != b[i]):

- If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], set possible = False.

- Else, continue.

- After checking all positions, if possible is still True, print "YES"; else, "NO".

This would correctly ensure that all positions satisfy their conditions.

But the given code only checks for the existence of at least one position where the conditions hold, which is insufficient.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No}} \]
