Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The question is to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time. Since both installations start at the same time, their launch times will be multiples of 'a' and 'b' respectively.

For the first installation, the launch times are a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

For the second installation, the launch times are b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework launched at time x is visible from x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these fireworks are visible simultaneously.

Let me consider the visibility periods of the fireworks.

For the first installation, a firework launched at time ka (where k is a positive integer) is visible from ka to ka + m.

Similarly, for the second installation, a firework launched at time lb (where l is a positive integer) is visible from lb to lb + m.

I need to find a time t where the number of intervals (ka, ka + m) and (lb, lb + m) that include t is maximized.

This seems like a problem involving overlapping intervals.

One way to approach this is to consider the points in time where fireworks are launched or their visibility ends.

So, for each installation, I can list all launch times and end times, and then find the time with the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

However, since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all possible times.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a time t.

The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time t is the number of k such that ka <= t <= ka + m, which is equivalent to (t - m) / a <= k <= t / a.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's (t - m) / b <= l <= t / b.

But since k and l must be integers, I need to take the floor and ceiling appropriately.

But this seems complicated, especially with large values of a, b, and m.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the maximum possible number of fireworks visible at any time.

Since both installations are launching fireworks independently, the maximum number would be the sum of the maximum number from each installation, plus any overlaps where fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time.

Wait, but that might not be accurate.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Case 1: a and b are co-prime.

In this case, the launch times of the two installations don't coincide except at multiples of LCM(a, b), which could be very large.

So, in this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be the sum of the individual maximums.

But I need to consider the visibility periods overlapping.

Wait, but m could be large enough that multiple fireworks from the same installation are visible at the same time.

Wait, no, since the launch intervals are a and b, and m could be larger than a or b, it's possible to have multiple fireworks from the same installation visible at the same time.

Wait, no, actually, if a firework is launched every a minutes and each is visible for m + 1 minutes, then if m + 1 < a, only one firework from that installation is visible at any time.

But if m + 1 >= a, then multiple fireworks from the same installation can be visible at the same time.

Similarly for b.

So, the maximum number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any time is floor(m / a) + 1, if m >= a - 1.

Similarly for the second installation, it's floor(m / b) + 1, if m >= b - 1.

But I need to consider the simultaneous visibility from both installations.

Wait, but in the example given, for the first test case:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, m = 4

floor(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 for the first installation

floor(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 for the second installation

But the answer is 2, which makes sense because at some time, one firework from each installation can be visible simultaneously.

But according to my earlier logic, it should be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches.

Wait, but in the third test case:

a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

floor(56 / 7) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 for the first installation

floor(56 / 8) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 for the second installation

But the answer is 17, which is 9 + 8, again matching my earlier logic.

Wait, but in the second test case:

a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

floor(10 / 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 for the first installation

floor(10 / 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 for the second installation

Sum would be 7, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for the fourth test case:

a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896

floor(78123459896 / 5) + 1 = 15624691979 + 1 = 15624691980 for the first installation

floor(78123459896 / 6) + 1 = 13020576649 + 1 = 13020576650 for the second installation

Sum would be 15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is simply the sum of floor(m / a) + 1 and floor(m / b) + 1.

Wait, but why is that?

Let me think about it.

For a given installation with launch interval 'x' and visibility time 'm', the number of fireworks visible at any time is floor(m / x) + 1, provided that m >= x - 1.

If m < x - 1, then only one firework is visible at any time.

But in the problem, it's given that m can be up to 10^18, and a and b are at least 1, so m >= 0.

But in the problem statement, it's specified that each firework is visible from x to x + m inclusive, which means the duration is m + 1 minutes.

So, if a firework is launched at time x, it's visible from x to x + m inclusive, which is m + 1 minutes.

Now, if another firework is launched at time x + a, it will be visible from x + a to x + a + m.

If x + a <= x + m, then the two fireworks overlap.

So, the number of overlapping fireworks from the same installation is floor(m / a) + 1.

Similarly for b.

So, the total maximum number should be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

But in the sample input, for the first case:

m = 4, a = 6, floor(4 / 6) = 0, so 0 + 1 = 1 for the first installation

Similarly, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 1 = 1 for the second installation

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third case:

m = 56, a = 7, floor(56 / 7) = 8, so 8 + 1 = 9 for the first installation

floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 7 + 1 = 8 for the second installation

Total: 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the formula is correct.

But wait, in the fifth and sixth test cases:

Fifth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

floor(1 / 1) = 1, so 1 + 1 = 2 for each installation

Total: 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Sixth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1 = 1000000000000000001 for each installation

Total: 1000000000000000001 + 1000000000000000001 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, the formula seems to hold.

But let me consider if there are any overlaps between the installations that might increase the total.

For example, if a and b have a common divisor, their launch times might coincide at some points.

But in the sample inputs, a and b are co-prime in some cases and not in others, but the formula still holds.

Wait, but if a and b have a common multiple within m, then fireworks from both installations could be launched at the same time, but since each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes, starting from the launch time, the visibility periods would overlap.

But in the formula above, we are just summing the individual maximums.

Is there any overlap that would cause the total to be higher?

Wait, no, because the visibility periods are independent for each firework.

So, the maximum number should indeed be the sum of the maximum number of overlapping fireworks from each installation.

Hence, the formula floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 seems correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so total is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

If a and b are 1, and m is 1, floor(1 / 1) = 1, so 1 + 1 = 2 for each, total 4, which matches.

Similarly, for large m and small a and b, the formula holds.

Hence, I can conclude that the formula is correct.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time from two firework installations, given their launch frequencies and the visibility duration of each firework.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Visibility**: Each firework launched by an installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes, starting from the launch time.
2. **Calculating Overlapping Fireworks**: 
   - For installation A launching every `a` minutes, the number of fireworks visible at any time is given by `floor(m / a) + 1` (if `m >= a - 1`).
   - Similarly, for installation B launching every `b` minutes, it is `floor(m / b) + 1`.
3. **Summing Up Visibility**: The total maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the individual maximum visibilities from both installations.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index+1])
        m = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        print((m // a) + (m // b) + 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**: Read all input data at once for efficiency, split it into a list, and parse the number of test cases `t`.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case:
  - Extract values `a`, `b`, and `m` from the data list.
  - Calculate the number of fireworks visible from installation A: `m // a + 1`.
  - Calculate the number of fireworks visible from installation B: `m // b + 1`.
  - Sum these values to get the total maximum number of visible fireworks and print the result.

This approach ensures efficient computation even for large values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, as it avoids unnecessary iterations and directly computes the required values using integer division and simple arithmetic operations.

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index+1])
        m = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        print((m // a) + (m // b) + 2)

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**: Read all input data at once for efficiency, split it into a list, and parse the number of test cases `t`.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case:
  - Extract values `a`, `b`, and `m` from the data list.
  - Calculate the number of fireworks visible from installation A: `m // a + 1`.
  - Calculate the number of fireworks visible from installation B: `m // b + 1`.
  - Sum these values to get the total maximum number of visible fireworks and print the result.

This approach ensures efficient computation even for large values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, as it avoids unnecessary iterations and directly computes the required values using integer division and simple arithmetic operations.

**Final Solution Code**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time from two firework installations, given their launch frequencies and the visibility duration of each firework.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Visibility**: Each firework launched by an installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes, starting from the launch time.
2. **Calculating Overlapping Fireworks**: 
   - For installation A launching every `a` minutes, the number of fireworks visible at any time is given by `floor(m / a) + 1` (if `m >= a - 1`).
   - Similarly, for installation B launching every `b` minutes, it is `floor(m / b) + 1`.
3. **Summing Up Visibility**: The total maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the individual maximum visibilities from both installations.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index+1])
        m = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        print((m // a) + (m // b) + 2)
