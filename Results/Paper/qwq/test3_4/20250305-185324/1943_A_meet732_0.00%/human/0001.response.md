Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game mechanics:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but does not add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

- Both play optimally.

Okay, so the key here is to figure out what MEX Alice can achieve despite Bob trying to minimize it.

Let's think about what MEX means. MEX is essentially the smallest missing number in the array `c`. So, if `c` contains all numbers from 0 to k, then the MEX would be k+1.

Given that Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, their strategies will be opposed.

Alice needs to ensure that as many small numbers as possible are included in `c`, while Bob will try to prevent that by removing elements that Alice might need.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

4

0 0 1 1

Output:

2

Explanation:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0, 1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

Final c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Output:

1

Wait, but according to the example, output is 1.

Wait, let's see:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1, 2, 3]

- Bob picks 1, a = [2, 3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [0, 2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

Final c = [0, 2], MEX is 1, since 1 is missing.

Wait, but MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer.

In this case, 1 is missing, so MEX is 1.

Wait, but in the first example, c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

Wait, but in this case, c = [0,2], 1 is missing.

Wait, but according to the problem, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in c.

So, in the second example, c = [0,2,3], MEX is 1.

Wait, but in the example, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], and output is 1.

Wait, but if Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

c = [0,2], MEX is 1.

Wait, but if Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

c = [0,2], MEX is 1.

But if Alice picks 1 instead, c=[1], then Bob picks 0, c=[1,0], then Alice picks 2, c=[1,0,2], then Bob picks 3.

c=[1,0,2], MEX is 3.

Wait, but the output is 1, so maybe Bob can force it to be 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from getting a higher MEX.

In this case, if Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

c=[0,2], MEX=1.

If Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

c=[1,0,2], MEX=3.

But Bob can choose to pick 2 instead of 0, if allowed.

Wait, but Bob can choose any element to delete.

Wait, in the second case, perhaps Bob can pick in a way to minimize MEX.

Wait, perhaps in this case, Bob can pick in a way to ensure that c doesn't have all numbers from 0 to k.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think about the problem more generally.

So, Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, which means he wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

Given that Alice can choose to include elements in c, and Bob can choose to remove elements, including those that Alice might need.

Wait, but Bob doesn't add to c, he just removes from a.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice might need to achieve a higher MEX.

But Alice can also remove elements by adding them to c.

Wait, no, Alice both picks an element from a and adds it to c, and then deletes it from a.

Bob just picks an element from a and deletes it from a.

So, in each turn, one element is removed from a, but only Alice adds elements to c.

So, the total number of elements in c will be ceil(n/2), since Alice moves first.

Wait, no, Alice moves first, and in each turn, one element is removed from a.

So, if n is even, there are n/2 moves each.

If n is odd, Alice has one more move.

Wait, no, Alice moves first, but both players take turns deleting elements.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Alice picks an element, appends it to c, and deletes it from a.

- Bob picks an element, deletes it from a, but does not add it to c.

So, in each full turn (Alice and Bob), two elements are removed from a.

But since Alice moves first, if n is odd, Alice will have one more move.

So, the number of elements in c will be ceil(n/2).

Wait, no.

Wait, in each of Alice's turns, she adds one element to c.

Bob does not add anything to c.

So, the total number of elements in c will be the number of times Alice moves.

Since Alice moves first, and each turn removes one element from a, the number of times Alice moves is ceil(n/2).

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think.

- Total elements in a: n.

- Each turn, one element is removed from a.

- Alice moves first.

- So, if n is even, Alice and Bob each move n/2 times.

- If n is odd, Alice moves (n+1)/2 times, and Bob moves (n-1)/2 times.

- But only Alice adds elements to c, so the number of elements in c is equal to the number of times Alice moves, which is ceil(n/2).

So, size of c is ceil(n/2).

Now, the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in c.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, they are playing a game where they influence the contents of c, with Alice adding elements and Bob removing elements from a.

I need to find the final MEX when both play optimally.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in a.

Let's count how many times each number appears in a.

Let's say cnt[i] is the count of number i in a.

Now, Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each number i, if cnt[i] is greater than 0, Alice can try to include it in c.

But Bob can try to reduce cnt[i] by deleting elements.

Wait, but Bob can only delete elements from a, not specifically from c.

Wait, no, Bob deletes elements from a, which reduces the cnt[i] for that i.

So, Bob can choose to delete elements that Alice might want to include in c.

Alice, on her turn, chooses an element to add to c and deletes it from a.

So, Alice can choose to add any remaining element to c and delete it from a.

Bob can choose to delete any remaining element from a.

So, their choices affect which elements are available for Alice to add to c.

I need to model their optimal strategies.

Let me think in terms of MEX.

The MEX is determined by which numbers from 0 to k are present in c, where k is the largest number in c.

Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that by removing elements that Alice might need.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimum number that Alice can't guarantee to include in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears in a.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice and Bob can choose to delete those copies.

I need to consider how many times each number is available and how Alice can include them in c.

Let me consider the frequency counts.

Let's say cnt[i] is the count of i in a.

Alice and Bob will be playing turns, alternating, with Alice starting.

Each turn, Alice picks an element to add to c and deletes it from a.

Bob picks an element to delete from a.

So, in total, there are n turns, with Alice moving first.

Thus, Alice moves ceil(n/2) times, and Bob moves floor(n/2) times.

The goal is to maximize the MEX of c, which is the smallest missing number in c.

So, for each number i from 0 to k, where k is up to n, I need to see if Alice can guarantee that i is in c.

Bob will try to prevent that.

So, for each i, from 0 to n, I need to see if Alice can guarantee that i is in c, despite Bob's attempts.

If Alice can guarantee that i is in c, then MEX is at least i+1.

Otherwise, MEX is i.

So, I need to find the smallest i such that Alice cannot guarantee that i is in c.

To do that, I need to see how many times i appears in a, and how many times Alice can include them in c before Bob can prevent it.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include each i in c.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

But Bob can delete any elements, including those that Alice needs.

Wait, maybe I need to model it as a game where Alice tries to collect enough copies of each i to ensure that at least one is in c.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a simpler way.

Looking back at the examples:

First test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

Output:2

Second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Output:1

Third test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

Output:0

Let's see:

In the first test case, there are two 0s and two 1s.

Alice can include one 1 and one 0 in c, achieving MEX=2.

In the second test case, there is one of each from 0 to 3.

Alice can include two elements, say 0 and 1, giving c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the example, output is 1.

Wait, in the second test case, output is 1, so perhaps Bob can force a lower MEX.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0.

Wait, but according to the problem, output is 1.

So perhaps in this case, MEX is 1.

Wait, in this alternative, c=[1,2], MEX is 0, since 0 is missing.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, c=[1,2], MEX is 0, since 0 is missing.

But the problem says output is 1.

Wait, perhaps in this case, MEX is 1.

Wait, no, MEX should be 0, since 0 is the smallest missing.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is defined with respect to the final c.

In c=[1,2], 0 is missing, so MEX should be 0.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"The MEX of an array of integers is defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the array."

In the second test case, c could be [0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

So perhaps, in this case, Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from having 0 in c.

How?

Let's see:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose to pick 0 or not, depending on what Alice picks.

In the first scenario, MEX=1.

In the second, MEX=0.

But according to the problem, output is 1, so perhaps Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to pick elements in a way that minimizes the MEX.

So, in the first scenario, MEX=1.

In the second scenario, MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose the path that leads to MEX=1.

Wait, but according to the problem, the output is 1.

So, perhaps the final MEX is the minimum over all possible plays that Bob can force.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of game theory, where Bob is trying to minimize the MEX, and Alice is trying to maximize it.

So, the final MEX is the one that Bob can force, even if Alice tries to maximize it.

Wait, actually, it's the opposite: Alice wants to maximize MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the final MEX is the one that results when both play optimally.

In this case, it seems that Bob can force MEX to be 1.

How?

By ensuring that 0 is not in c.

Wait, but in the first scenario, c has 0.

In the second scenario, c doesn't have 0.

Wait, perhaps Bob can prevent 0 from being in c.

Wait, but in the first scenario, 0 is in c.

So, perhaps Bob cannot always prevent 0 from being in c.

Wait, in the second scenario, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is considered after all elements are chosen, and Bob can influence which elements are in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to delete elements that Alice needs.

But in this case, it's not clear.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include elements in c, and Bob can choose to delete elements from a.

So, Bob can choose to delete elements that Alice might need to achieve a higher MEX.

In other words, Bob can delete elements that Alice hasn't included in c yet.

So, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each element appears and how many times Alice can include them in c before Bob deletes them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include each number in c.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves, and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

For each number i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one i in c, because she has more moves than Bob can delete.

Wait, that might be a way.

Let me formalize it.

Let’s denote the number of times Alice can include i in c as max(0, cnt[i] - floor(n/2)).

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, so if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least cnt[i] - floor(n/2) elements of i in c.

But actually, Alice can choose which elements to include in c, so perhaps this approach is not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of times Alice can include each i in c, considering that Bob can delete elements.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for each i, the number of times Alice can include i in c is cnt[i] minus the number of times Bob deletes i.

Since Bob wants to minimize MEX, he would try to prevent Alice from including small i in c.

So, for each i, the number of times Alice can include i in c is cnt[i] - the number of times Bob deletes i.

Bob will try to minimize this for small i.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, and Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) elements in c.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least cnt[i] - floor(n/2) elements of i in c.

Since she can choose which ones to include.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] - floor(n/2) > 0, then Alice can include at least one i in c.

Therefore, for i from 0 to n, if cnt[i] - floor(n/2) > 0, then i is in c.

Otherwise, it's not.

So, the MEX would be the smallest i where cnt[i] - floor(n/2) <= 0.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Let me check with the examples.

First test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

floor(n/2)=2

For i=0: cnt[0]=2 - 2 =0, so no guarantee that 0 is in c.

For i=1: cnt[1]=2 - 2=0, so no guarantee that 1 is in c.

So, according to this, MEX should be 0.

But in the first test case, output is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose which elements to include.

In the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2.

Alice can include two elements in c.

Bob can delete two elements.

But in the example, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

Wait, according to my earlier logic, since cnt[0]-2=0 and cnt[1]-2=0, MEX should be 0, but it's 2.

So, my logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose which elements to include, and Bob can't necessarily prevent Alice from including both 0 and 1.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2.

Alice can include one 0 and one 1 in c, achieving MEX=2.

Bob can try to prevent this, but in the example, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) elements in c, which is 2 in this case.

And if she includes two different numbers, say 0 and 1, then MEX is 2.

But in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

floor(n/2)=2.

So, for each i from 0 to 3, cnt[i] - 2 = -1, which is less than or equal to 0.

So, according to my earlier flawed logic, MEX should be 0.

But in the example, output is 1.

Wait, but in reality, Alice can include two elements in c, say 0 and 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Or 0 and 2, MEX=1.

Or 1 and 2, MEX=0.

So, depending on Alice's choices, MEX can be 0,1, or 2.

But Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) elements, but Bob can choose to delete elements in a way that minimizes the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through possible MEX values and see if Alice can achieve them.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to find the smallest i such that Alice cannot include i in c.

That would be the MEX.

So, for each i from 0 to n, check if Alice can include i in c.

If she can, then MEX is greater than i.

If she can't, then MEX is i.

So, for each i, check if cnt[i] > number of times Bob can delete it.

Which is floor(n/2).

So, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one i in c.

Otherwise, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

Wait, but in the second test case, cnt[0]=1, floor(n/2)=2.

So, cnt[0] - floor(n/2)=1-2=-1, which is less than or equal to 0.

So, Bob can prevent Alice from including 0 in c.

Hence, MEX is 0.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

Wait, contradiction.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose which elements to include, and she can prioritize including smaller numbers.

Wait, but in the second test case, if Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

If she picks 0 and 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

If she picks 1 and 2, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, depending on her choices, MEX can be 0,1, or 2.

But Bob can choose to delete elements in a way that forces MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob can influence the game to ensure MEX is 1.

For example:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose to pick 1 in the first turn to force MEX=1.

Wait, but according to the problem, output is 1.

So, perhaps Bob can choose his moves to force MEX to be 1.

Hence, the final MEX is 1.

So, perhaps in this case, Bob can choose to pick elements in a way that prevents Alice from including 0 in c.

Wait, but in the first scenario, Alice includes 0 in c.

But in the second scenario, c does not include 0.

So, perhaps Bob can choose to pick 0 in one of his turns to prevent it from being in c.

Wait, but in the first scenario, Bob picks 1, and Alice still includes 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements in c.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

So, in total, n elements are deleted, which is the entire array.

So, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

But Bob can choose which elements are deleted, indirectly affecting which elements Alice can include in c.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can include them.

Let’s consider that for each number i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one i in c.

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, but cnt[i] is greater, so some copies will remain for Alice to include.

If cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can potentially prevent Alice from including i in c by deleting all cnt[i] copies.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, n=4, floor(n/2)=2.

So, cnt[0]-2=0, which is <=2, so Bob can prevent Alice from including 0 in c.

Similarly, cnt[1]-2=0, so Bob can prevent Alice from including 1 in c.

Hence, MEX should be 0.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include multiple copies of the same number, but MEX only cares about the presence of the number, not the count.

Wait, MEX only cares about which numbers are present in c, not how many times.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > 0, and cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one i in c.

Wait, no, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least cnt[i] - floor(n/2) copies in c.

But since MEX only cares about presence, we just need to know if Alice can include at least one i in c.

So, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one i in c.

If cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all cnt[i] copies, preventing Alice from including i in c.

Hence, the MEX is the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

But in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, floor(n/2)=2.

So, cnt[0]-2=0 <=2, cnt[1]-2=0 <=2.

Hence, MEX should be 0.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

So, my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose which elements to include, and she can prioritize including smaller numbers.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2.

Alice can include two elements in c.

She can include one 0 and one 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Bob cannot prevent this.

Hence, MEX is 2.

In the second test case, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

Alice can include two elements in c.

Possible c:

- [0,1], MEX=2

- [0,2], MEX=1

- [0,3], MEX=1

- [1,2], MEX=0

- [1,3], MEX=0

- [2,3], MEX=0

Bob can choose to make sure that c does not have 0 by deleting it.

Wait, in the first scenario:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose to pick 0 in his first turn to force MEX=0 or 1.

Wait, but according to the problem, output is 1.

So, perhaps Bob can choose to pick 1 instead of 0.

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 1 again? Wait, cnt[1]=1, so he can't pick 1 again.

Wait, in the first move, Bob picks 1, but cnt[1]=1, so a becomes [0,2,3].

Then Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[0,3]

Bob picks 0, a=[3]

Alice picks 3, c=[1,2,3], a=[]

c=[1,2,3], MEX=0.

Wait, but according to the problem, output is 1.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to delete elements in a way that minimizes the MEX.

So, in the first scenario, Bob picks 1, forcing c=[0,2], MEX=1.

In the second scenario, Bob picks 0, forcing c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose the path that leads to MEX=0 or MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 1.

So, perhaps in this case, Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if Alice can achieve a higher MEX in some paths, but Bob can choose paths where MEX is lower.

Hence, the final MEX is the minimum over all possible paths that Bob can force.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

Hence, for each i from 0 to n, Alice needs to have at least one i in c if possible.

Bob tries to prevent that.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and check if Alice can include i in c.

If she can, then MEX is higher; otherwise, MEX is i.

To check if Alice can include i in c, I need to see if cnt[i] > floor(n/2).

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one i in c.

Otherwise, Bob can delete all cnt[i] copies, preventing Alice from including i in c.

Hence, the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2) is the MEX.

Wait, but in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, floor(n/2)=2.

So, cnt[0]-2=0 <=2, cnt[1]-2=0 <=2.

Hence, MEX should be 0.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

So, this logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include multiple elements, and she can choose which ones to include.

Hence, perhaps I need to see how many times Alice can include elements in c, and ensure that she includes as many small numbers as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, check if cnt[i] > 0.

But that doesn't account for Bob's deletions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of deletions Bob can make.

Bob can make floor(n/2) deletions.

Alice can make ceil(n/2) selections.

So, perhaps I need to see how many small numbers Alice can include in c despite Bob's deletions.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include each i.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the counts and see how many small numbers Alice can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, check if cnt[i] > 0.

If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include one i in c, provided that Bob doesn't delete all cnt[i] copies.

Wait, but Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one i in c.

Otherwise, Bob can delete all cnt[i] copies, preventing Alice from including i in c.

Hence, the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2) is the MEX.

But in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, floor(n/2)=2.

So, cnt[0]-2=0 <=2, cnt[1]-2=0 <=2.

Hence, MEX should be 0.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

So, this logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include multiple elements, and she can choose to include different i's.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2.

Alice can include one 0 and one 1 in c, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Bob cannot prevent this because even if he deletes one 0 and one 1, Alice can still include one 0 and one 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, cnt[i]-floor(n/2)<=0, so Bob can prevent Alice from including i.

But in reality, Alice can include both 0 and 1.

Hence, my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) elements, and she can choose which ones to include.

Hence, she can choose to include different i's to maximize the MEX.

So, perhaps I need to sort the counts and see how many small i's she can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include one i in c, as long as she has selections left.

But she has ceil(n/2) selections.

So, she can include up to ceil(n/2) different i's in c.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest i that is not included in c.

So, if she includes i=0 to i=k, then MEX is k+1.

But Bob can try to prevent her from including some i's.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the largest k such that the sum of cnt[i] for i from 0 to k is greater than floor(n/2).

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

Hence, if sum(cnt[0..k]) > floor(n/2), then Alice can include all i from 0 to k in c.

Otherwise, Bob can prevent Alice from including some i <=k.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest k where sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2).

Wait, perhaps.

Let me check with the first test case.

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2.

sum(cnt[0])=2, floor(n/2)=2.

sum(cnt[0..1])=4.

So, sum(cnt[0])=2 == floor(n/2)=2.

Hence, MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Wait, but MEX=2 in the first test case.

Wait, perhaps if sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2), then Bob can prevent Alice from including all i from 0 to k in c.

Hence, MEX is the smallest k where sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2).

In the first test case, sum(cnt[0])=2 == floor(n/2)=2, so MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Hence, my logic is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include more than one copy of the same i, but MEX only cares about unique i's.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of unique i's Alice can include in c.

Wait, but c can have duplicates, but MEX only cares about unique i's.

Wait, no, MEX is defined based on the presence of each i, not the count.

Hence, duplicates don't matter for MEX.

So, perhaps I need to find how many unique i's Alice can include in c.

Given that she has ceil(n/2) selections, and Bob has floor(n/2) deletions.

Hence, the number of unique i's Alice can include is up to ceil(n/2).

But Bob can try to limit the number of unique i's Alice can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's opposition.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Hence, the final MEX is the one that results from both playing optimally.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements in c.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

Hence, total elements in c are ceil(n/2).

Now, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that.

Hence, perhaps I need to sort the unique numbers in a and see how many small ones Alice can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, check if cnt[i] > 0.

If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include one i in c, provided that Bob doesn't delete all cnt[i] copies.

Wait, but Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, but he can choose which ones to delete.

Hence, Bob can choose to delete elements that Alice needs to achieve a higher MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of each i and see how many i's Alice can include in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal k such that the sum of cnt[0..k] > ceil(n/2).

Because Alice needs to include at least one of each i from 0 to k in c.

If sum(cnt[0..k]) > floor(n/2), then Alice can include all i from 0 to k in c.

Otherwise, Bob can prevent Alice from including some i <=k.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest k where sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2).

Wait, perhaps.

Let me check with the first test case.

sum(cnt[0])=2 == floor(n/2)=2.

Hence, MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if sum(cnt[0..k]) > floor(n/2), then Alice can include all i from 0 to k in c.

Hence, MEX is the smallest k where sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2).

In the first test case, sum(cnt[0])=2 == floor(n/2)=2.

Hence, MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

So, perhaps I need to consider that if sum(cnt[0..k]) >= ceil(n/2), then Alice can include all i from 0 to k in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to use ceil(n/2) instead of floor(n/2).

Let me try that.

In the first test case, ceil(n/2)=2.

sum(cnt[0])=2 == ceil(n/2)=2.

Hence, MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if sum(cnt[0..k]) > ceil(n/2), then Alice can include all i from 0 to k in c.

In the first test case, sum(cnt[0])=2 == ceil(n/2)=2.

Hence, Alice can include all i from 0 to 0 in c.

Hence, MEX=1.

But according to the problem, output is 2.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements, and she can choose which ones to include.

Hence, she can choose to include multiple small i's.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the unique numbers in a and see how many of them Alice can include in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, check if cnt[i] > 0.

If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include one i in c, provided that she has selections left.

Hence, the number of unique i's Alice can include is up to ceil(n/2).

Hence, the smallest i that is not included in c is the MEX.

But Bob can choose to delete elements in a way that minimizes the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal k such that the number of unique i's Alice can include is less than k.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements in c, and she wants to include as many small numbers as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that by deleting elements that Alice needs.

Hence, perhaps the minimal MEX is the smallest k such that the number of unique i's in a from 0 to k is > ceil(n/2).

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is the smallest k such that the sum of cnt[0..k] <= floor(n/2).

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements, and if sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2), then he can delete all elements from 0 to k, preventing Alice from including any of them in c.

Hence, MEX would be k.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum(cnt[0..1])=4 > floor(n/2)=2, so Alice can include both 0 and 1 in c, achieving MEX=2.

Hence, perhaps the MEX is the smallest k where sum(cnt[0..k]) <= floor(n/2).

Hence, in the first test case, sum(cnt[0..1])=4 >2, so MEX is 2.

In the second test case, sum(cnt[0..1])=2 == floor(n/2)=2, so MEX is 1.

In the third test case, sum(cnt[0..0])=0 <=1 (floor(2/2)=1), so MEX is 0.

Hence, this seems to match the examples.

Hence, the
