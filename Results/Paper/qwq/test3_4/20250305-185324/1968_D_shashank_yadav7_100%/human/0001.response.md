Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Bodya and Sasha are playing with a permutation and an array. The goal is to determine who wins the game after a certain number of turns, based on their scores. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. There are two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at specific positions in a permutation. The game consists of several turns, and in each turn, both players can choose to stay in their current position or move to a new position as defined by the permutation. After a fixed number of turns, the player with the higher score wins.

Okay, so the inputs are:

- The number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- n: the length of the permutation and the array.

- k: the number of turns in the game.

- P_B and P_S: the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

- The permutation p as a list of integers.

- The array a as a list of integers.

I need to process multiple test cases, so I should probably read all the inputs first and then process each test case one by one.

Now, let's think about how the game progresses. In each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add the value of a[x] to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to either stay in their current position or move to p[x].

The players are trying to maximize their own scores, and I need to determine who has the higher score after exactly k turns.

This sounds like a game theory problem where both players are making optimal choices independently to maximize their scores.

Given that the permutation is a cycle, and players can choose to move or stay each turn, I need to find the optimal strategy for each player separately.

Wait, but permutations can have multiple cycles, not necessarily just one cycle. For example, a permutation of [2, 1, 4, 3] has two cycles: 1->2->1 and 3->4->3.

So, I need to consider the cycle structure of the permutation to determine the possible positions each player can be in after k turns.

But the problem allows players to choose whether to move or stay each turn, which complicates things because it's not just following the permutation cycle.

Wait, more carefully: each turn, they can choose to stay or move. So, it's not strictly following the permutation cycle; they have a choice each turn.

This makes it different from problems where movement is deterministic.

So, for each player, in each turn, they can choose to either stay in their current position or move to p[x].

Their goal is to maximize their score, which is the sum of a[x] over the k turns.

Given that they make decisions simultaneously, but their decisions don't affect each other directly (since they are on different positions), I can treat each player's decision independently.

Therefore, for each player, I need to find the maximum possible score they can achieve in k turns, given that they can choose to stay or move each turn.

Then, compare the two maximum scores to determine who wins.

So, the key is to compute the maximum possible score for each player independently.

Now, how do I compute the maximum score for one player in k turns, where each turn they can choose to stay or move to p[x]?

Let's consider one player. They start at position x. Each turn, they can choose to:

- Stay at x and add a[x] to their score.

- Move to p[x] and add a[p[x]] to their score.

But wait, no. According to the problem, the scoring happens at the current position before potentially moving.

So, in each turn:

1. Add a[x] to the score.

2. Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

Wait, but the problem says "his score increases by a_x" at the current position, and then "stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, it's clear: score increases by a_x, then choose to stay or move.

Therefore, in each turn, the player is adding a[x] to their score, and then choosing whether to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in terms of decision-making, the player chooses after adding a[x], whether to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

This is a bit different from what I initially thought.

So, in each turn:

- Score += a[x]

- Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x]

- The next turn, the new x is either the same x (if stayed) or p[x] (if moved)

So, over k turns, the player is choosing a sequence of positions, where each position is either the same as the previous one or p[previous one].

The player's total score is the sum of a[x] over the k positions visited.

The player wants to maximize this sum.

Similarly, the other player is doing the same independently.

So, to find out who wins, I need to compute the maximum possible score for Bodya and the maximum possible score for Sasha, and compare them.

Now, how do I compute the maximum score for one player?

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

First, observe that the permutation forms cycles, and within each cycle, the player can choose to stay or move along the cycle.

The key is to find, for each player, the optimal way to stay or move in order to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

One approach is to consider the cycle that the player is in and analyze the possible sequences of stays and moves.

However, since n is large and k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the cycle that the player is in.

Suppose the player is in a cycle of length m.

Then, in the cycle, the positions repeat every m turns if the player always moves.

But the player can choose to stay in any turn, which complicates the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that the player can choose to stay or move each turn.

So, for each turn, the player decides whether to stay or move.

Given that k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the maximum possible sum efficiently.

I recall that in some problems, when you have choices at each step and want to maximize the sum, dynamic programming can be used.

But with k up to 1e9, traditional DP won't work.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay for any number of consecutive turns and then move.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of times the player decides to move.

Letâ€™s say the player decides to move t times in k turns.

Then, the player stays in some turns and moves in others.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose the player chooses to stay in certain turns and move in others.

The sequence of positions the player visits can be modeled as a path where each step is either staying or moving to p[x].

This is similar to a graph where each position has two options: stay or move.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, building a graph isn't feasible.

I need a mathematical way to compute the maximum sum.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player adds a[x] to the score, and then chooses whether to stay or move.

So, the total score is the sum of a[x] over k positions, where each position is either the same as the previous one or p[previous one].

This resembles a weighted sum where the player can choose to repeat a position or move to the next one in the permutation.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k steps, with the choice to stay or move each step.

I recall that in some optimization problems, you can model the choices as different states.

In this case, the state is the current position, and the decision is to stay or move.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can find a pattern or a mathematical formula to compute the maximum sum.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay for any number of consecutive turns before moving.

Suppose the player stays for s turns, then moves once, stays for s' turns, moves again, and so on.

Each time the player moves, they go to p[x], and then can choose to stay there for some turns before moving again.

I need to find the optimal sequence of stays and moves to maximize the sum.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible contribution from each position.

Let me consider that for each position, the player can choose to stay there for any number of turns before moving.

So, for a given position x, if the player stays there for t turns, they add t * a[x] to their score, and then move to p[x].

But since k is up to 1e9, I need a way to handle large t efficiently.

Perhaps I can consider that the player will stay at each position as long as a[x] is greater than a[p[x]], because staying would give more score.

Wait, no. If a[x] > a[p[x]], staying is better for that turn, but moving might lead to higher scores in subsequent turns.

It's not straightforward.

Let me consider that the player should stay at a position if a[x] is greater than a[p[x]], and move otherwise.

But that might not always be optimal, because even if a[x] > a[p[x]], moving to p[x] might lead to a sequence of higher a values in the future.

So, it's not clear.

Maybe I need to find, for each position, whether it's better to stay or move, considering the future possibilities.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, but with k up to 1e9, I need a way to optimize it.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position the maximum possible contribution per turn, and then multiply by k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the permutation cycles.

Since the permutation is a set of disjoint cycles, I can consider each cycle separately.

For a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay or move within that cycle.

If the player stays, they remain in the same position; if they move, they go to the next position in the cycle.

So, in a cycle, the player can choose to stay for some turns and move for others.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns for each player.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a repeated addition of a[x] for stays and a[p[x]] for moves.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider a small example to get some intuition.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, positions are 1-based.

Let's map them to 0-based for easier indexing in code:

p = [3,0,1,2]

a = [7,2,5,6]

Bodya starts at position 2 (0-based), a[2]=5

Sasha starts at position 1, a[1]=2

In the first turn:

- Bodya: add a[2]=5, then choose to stay or move to p[2]=1

- Sasha: add a[1]=2, then choose to stay or move to p[1]=0

In the second turn:

- If Bodya stayed at 2, add a[2]=5 again

- If Bodya moved to 1, add a[1]=2

- Similarly for Sasha

So, possible scores:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10 (stay both turns)

- Bodya: 5 + 2 = 7 (stay first turn, move second turn)

- Bodya: 5 + 2 = 7 (move first turn, stay second turn)

- Bodya: 5 + 2 = 7 (move both turns)

- Sasha: 2 + 2 = 4 (stay both turns)

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9 (stay first turn, move second turn)

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9 (move first turn, stay second turn)

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9 (move both turns)

So, Bodya's maximum score is 10, Sasha's maximum score is 9.

Hence, Bodya wins.

From this example, it seems that for Bodya, staying put maximizes the score, while for Sasha, moving to position 1 and then staying or moving to position 0 gives a higher score.

So, in general, for each player, the optimal strategy seems to be to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in their cycle.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in the cycle that Bodya is in: position 2 -> position 1 -> position 0 -> position 3 -> position 2, and so on.

So, the cycle is 2-1-0-3.

Bodya starts at 2, a[2]=5

If Bodya stays at 2 for both turns: 5 + 5 = 10

If Bodya moves to 1 in the first turn: add 5 + a[1]=2, total 7

If Bodya moves to 1 in the first turn and then stays: 5 + 2 = 7

If Bodya moves to 1 and then moves to 0: 5 + a[0]=7, total 12, but wait:

Wait, in the first turn:

- Add a[2]=5

- Choose to move to p[2]=1

In the second turn:

- Add a[1]=2

- Choose to move to p[1]=0

- Add a[0]=7

Wait, but in the second turn, they add a[x] before choosing to move or stay.

So, in the second turn, after moving to p[1]=0, they add a[0]=7, then choose to stay or move.

If they stay at 0, total would be 5 + 2 + 7 = 14

If they move to p[0]=3, add a[3]=6, total 5 + 2 + 6 = 13

Wait, but in the example, it seems that Bodya's maximum is 10, which is staying at 2 for both turns.

So, perhaps in this case, staying at 2 is better than moving.

For Sasha, starting at 1, a[1]=2

Option 1: stay at 1 for both turns: 2 + 2 = 4

Option 2: move to 0 in the first turn: add a[1]=2, then move to 0

In the second turn: add a[0]=7, then choose to stay or move.

If stay at 0: total 2 + 7 = 9

If move to 3: add a[3]=6, total 2 + 6 = 8

So, maximum for Sasha is 9.

Hence, Bodya's maximum is 10, Sasha's is 9, Bodya wins.

So, in this case, Bodya's optimal strategy is to stay at position 2, while Sasha's optimal is to move to position 0 and stay there.

This suggests that the optimal strategy is to find the position in the cycle with the highest a[x] and stay there for as many turns as possible.

But with k up to 1e9, I need to handle large k efficiently.

So, perhaps for each player, I can find the maximum a[x] in their cycle and compute the score as max_a * k.

But wait, in the example above, Bodya's maximum a[x] is 5, so 5*2=10, which matches.

Sasha's maximum a[x] is 7, so 7*2=14, but in the example, Sasha can only achieve 9, because to get to position 0, they need to move in the first turn, which costs a[1]=2, and then stay at 0 to add a[0]=7, total 9.

So, in this case, Sasha cannot achieve 14 because they need to spend one turn moving to position 0.

Hence, my initial thought is incorrect.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is not just to stay at the position with the maximum a[x], but to move to the position with the maximum a[x] as soon as possible and then stay there.

In the example, Sasha starts at 1 (a=2), moves to 0 (a=7), and then stays at 0 to add a[0]=7 again, total 2 + 7 = 9.

If Sasha stays at 1 for one turn and then moves to 0 for the second turn: 2 + 7 = 9.

If Sasha moves to 0 in the first turn and stays at 0 in the second turn: 2 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 9.

If Sasha moves to 0 in the first turn and moves to 3 in the second turn: 2 + 6 = 8.

So, the maximum is 9.

But if k were larger, say k=3, then Sasha could move to 0 in the first turn and stay at 0 for the next two turns: 2 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) + 7 (third turn) = 16.

Alternatively, stay at 1 for one turn and then move to 0 for the next two turns: 2 + 7 + 7 = 16.

So, in this case, the maximum is 16, which is 7*(k-1) + max(a[1], a[0], a[3], a[2]).

Wait, no.

Wait, in k=3, Sasha can achieve 2 + 7 + 7 = 16, which is better than staying at the maximum a[x] for all turns.

But in k=2, it's only 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, but if k=2, 7*2=14, but Sasha can only achieve 9.

So, my initial idea of max_a * k is not correct.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me think about it differently.

For each player, I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns, where in each turn, x can be either the same as the previous x or p[x].

This is similar to choosing a path of length k in the graph where edges are either staying or moving.

Given that, it's similar to finding the maximum possible sum in a graph with two options per node.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the player can choose to move to p[x] at most once, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

But in the example above, Sasha moves once and then stays, achieving 2 + 7 = 9.

But actually, Sasha can move in the first turn and stay in the second turn: 2 + 7 = 9.

Alternatively, stay in the first turn and move in the second turn: 2 + 7 = 9.

Or move in both turns: 2 + 6 = 8.

So, moving once and staying thereafter seems optimal.

But in cycles with more positions, it might be different.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to move towards the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle and then stay there.

So, for each cycle, find the position with the maximum a[x], and then for each player, find the minimal number of moves required to reach that position, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

In the example, for Sasha, starting at 1, the cycle is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

The maximum a[x] in the cycle is a[0]=7.

To reach position 0 from 1, it takes one move.

Then, stay at 0 for the remaining turns.

So, for k=2: move in the first turn to 0 (add a[1]=2), stay at 0 in the second turn (add a[0]=7), total 9.

For k=3: move to 0 in the first turn (add 2), stay at 0 in the second and third turns (add 7 twice), total 16.

This seems a better approach.

So, generalizing:

For each player, find the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x].

Then, find the minimal number of moves required to reach that position from their starting position.

Then, in the remaining turns after reaching that position, stay there to accumulate the maximum a[x].

This way, the total score is:

- The sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving towards the maximum position.

- Plus the maximum a[x] multiplied by the number of turns spent staying at that position.

So, for each player, I need to:

1. Identify the cycle they are in.

2. Find the position in that cycle with the maximum a[x].

3. Determine the minimal number of moves required to reach that position from their starting position.

4. Compute the score as:

- Sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving towards the maximum position.

- Plus maximum a[x] multiplied by the remaining turns.

Wait, but in the example, Sasha starts at 1, moves to 0 in the first turn (adding a[1]=2), then stays at 0 in the second turn (adding a[0]=7), total 9.

If k=3, moves to 0 in the first turn (add 2), stays at 0 in the second and third turns (add 7 each), total 2 + 7 + 7 = 16.

But, according to the formula above:

- Maximum a[x] in the cycle is a[0]=7.

- Minimal number of moves to reach position 0 from position 1 is 1.

- Then, remaining turns are k - 1 = 2 turns to stay at position 0.

- So, score = a[1] (first move) + a[0] * 2 = 2 + 7*2 = 16, which matches.

For k=2:

- Moves to 0 in the first turn (add 2), stays at 0 in the second turn (add 7), total 9.

- According to formula: minimal moves to reach 0 is 1, remaining turns k - 1 = 1, score = a[1] + a[0]*1 = 2 + 7 = 9.

Perfect.

So, this seems correct.

Now, what if the player starts at the position with the maximum a[x]? Then, minimal moves is 0, and score is a[x] * k.

In the first example, Bodya starts at 2, a[2]=5, but the maximum in their cycle is a[0]=7.

Minimal moves to reach 0 from 2 is 2 (2 -> 1 -> 0).

So, score = a[2] (first turn) + a[1] (second turn moving to 1) + a[0] (third turn moving to 0) + a[0] * (k - 3).

But in the first example, k=2:

- Move from 2 to 1 in the first turn (add 5), then move from 1 to 0 in the second turn (add 2), total 7.

But in the example, Bodya's maximum is 10, which is staying at 2 for both turns (5 + 5).

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In the earlier analysis, Bodya's maximum was 10 by staying at 2 for both turns.

But according to this formula, moving to the maximum position (0) would give 5 (first turn) + 2 (moving to 1) = total 7, which is less than staying at 2 (10).

Hence, in this case, staying at the current position is better than moving to the position with the maximum a[x].

So, my previous assumption is not always correct.

Hence, I need to adjust my strategy.

Perhaps, the optimal strategy is not just to move directly to the position with the maximum a[x], but to consider the sequence of moves that maximizes the sum.

Another approach is to consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, and they should choose the option that leads to the maximum possible sum for the remaining turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where dp[x][t] is the maximum score at position x after t turns.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for as many turns as possible.

To do that, the player should reach that position as soon as possible and then stay there.

So, for each player:

- Find the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x].

- Find the minimal number of moves required to reach that position from their starting position.

- Then, stay at that position for the remaining turns.

- The total score is the sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving to the maximum position, plus the maximum a[x] multiplied by the number of turns spent staying there.

In the earlier example, for Sasha:

- Maximum a[x] in cycle is a[0]=7.

- Minimal moves to reach 0 from 1 is 1.

- So, for k=2: move to 0 in the first turn (add a[1]=2), stay at 0 in the second turn (add a[0]=7), total 9.

- For k=3: move to 0 in the first turn (add 2), stay at 0 in the second and third turns (add 7 each), total 2 + 7 + 7 = 16.

But in the first example, Bodya starts at 2, a[2]=5, and the maximum in the cycle is a[0]=7.

To reach position 0 from 2, it takes 2 moves: 2 -> 1 -> 0.

For k=2:

- Move to 1 in the first turn (add 5), move to 0 in the second turn (add 2), total 7.

But Bodya can choose to stay at 2 for both turns: 5 + 5 = 10, which is better.

Hence, in this case, staying at the current position is better than moving to the position with the maximum a[x].

So, the optimal strategy is to compare the score obtained by moving to the maximum a[x] and staying there versus staying at the current position.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, moving to the maximum a[x] gives 7, while staying at 2 gives 10.

Hence, the player should choose the option that gives the higher score.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

For each player:

- Option 1: Stay at the current position for all k turns: score = a[x] * k.

- Option 2: Move to the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle as soon as possible and stay there for the remaining turns: score = sum of a[x] for moves to reach the maximum position + maximum a[x] * (k - number of moves to reach).

- Choose the option with the higher score.

In Bodya's case:

- Option 1: stay at 2 for k=2 turns: 5*2=10.

- Option 2: move to 0 in 2 moves: add a[2]=5 in the first turn, move to 1; add a[1]=2 in the second turn, move to 0.

- Then, stay at 0 for the remaining turns (in this case, no remaining turns since k=2).

- So, total score for Option 2: 5 + 2 = 7.

- Hence, Option 1 is better: 10 > 7.

In Sasha's case:

- Option 1: stay at 1 for k=2 turns: 2*2=4.

- Option 2: move to 0 in 1 move: add a[1]=2 in the first turn, move to 0; stay at 0 in the second turn: add a[0]=7.

- Total score for Option 2: 2 + 7 = 9.

- Hence, Option 2 is better: 9 > 4.

So, for each player, I need to compute both options and choose the one with the higher score.

Hence, the plan is:

For each player:

1. Compute score for Option 1: a[x] * k.

2. Compute score for Option 2:

a. Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a[x].

b. Find the minimal number of moves to reach that position from the starting position.

c. Compute the sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving to that position.

d. Add maximum a[x] multiplied by (k - number of moves to reach).

3. Choose the maximum of Option 1 and Option 2 as the player's maximum score.

Then, compare the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

This seems correct based on the example.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9.

First, I need to find the cycle that each player is in.

But actually, since the permutation is a set of disjoint cycles, and each player is in one cycle, I can process each cycle separately.

But for the purpose of finding the minimal number of moves to reach the position with the maximum a[x], I don't necessarily need to find the entire cycle.

I can treat the permutation as a graph where each position points to p[x], and the player can choose to stay or move each turn.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the minimal number of moves efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

Then, find the shortest path to the position with the maximum a[x].

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move.

So, the distance to the target position is the minimal number of moves required to reach it.

But since the player can choose to stay, the actual minimal number of moves is the distance in the permutation cycle minus the number of times the player chooses to stay.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I can think in terms of BFS from the starting position, where each node has two options: stay or move.

But again, with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, BFS is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the player can reach any position in their cycle in a certain number of moves.

Given that, for each player, I can find the position in their cycle with the maximum a[x], and the minimal number of moves required to reach it.

To find the minimal number of moves to reach the maximum position, I can iterate through the cycle starting from the starting position, keeping track of the positions visited and the number of moves.

Wait, but since the cycle can be large, I need an efficient way to do this.

An alternative approach is to note that in a cycle, the minimal number of moves to reach any position is the minimum of the forward and backward distances in the cycle.

But since the player can choose to stay, it's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem as finding the minimal number of moves required to reach the position with the maximum a[x], considering that staying doesn't increase the move count.

This is still confusing.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose that for each player, I simulate the process of moving towards the position with the maximum a[x], choosing to move each turn until reaching it, and then staying there.

But since k can be up to 1e9, I need to handle large k efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each player the minimal number of moves to reach the position with the maximum a[x].

Then, if the number of moves is less than or equal to k, the player can reach it and stay for the remaining turns.

Otherwise, the player cannot reach it within k turns.

But in the earlier example, Bodya can reach position 0 in 2 moves, which is equal to k=2, but in that case, the score is 5 + 2 = 7, which is less than staying at position 2 for k=2 turns (5 + 5 =10).

Hence, the player should choose the option that gives the higher score.

So, perhaps for each player, I need to compute both options and choose the maximum.

Option 1: Stay at the current position for all k turns: score = a[x] * k.

Option 2: Move to the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle, accumulating a[x] for each move, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

To implement this efficiently, I need to:

- For each cycle, find the position with the maximum a[x].

- For each player in the cycle, find the minimal number of moves to reach that position.

- Then, compute the scores for both options and choose the maximum.

But finding the minimal number of moves for each player to reach the maximum position in their cycle needs to be done efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute the minimal moves.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the distance between two positions is the minimal of the forward and backward distances in the cycle.

So, for each cycle, I can find the positions in cycle order, compute the distances between positions, and then for each player, compute the minimal number of moves to reach the maximum position.

But this still seems time-consuming for n up to 2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each player, the minimal number of moves to reach the maximum position is the distance along the cycle, considering that the player can choose to stay.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a graph where each node has edges to itself (staying) and to p[x] (moving).

Then, the minimal number of moves to reach the maximum position is the minimal number of moves (not counting stays) to reach it.

In this case, the minimal number of moves is the distance in the permutation graph where the player chooses to move at each step, ignoring the option to stay.

Then, the player can choose to stay in any number of turns, but to minimize the number of moves, the player should move every turn until reaching the target position.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is the distance in the permutation graph where the player always moves.

Then, the player can choose to stay in any of the k turns, so the minimal number of moves is fixed, and the rest of the turns can be spent staying.

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal number of moves to reach the target is the distance in the permutation graph where the player always moves.

Then, the player can choose to stay in any of the k turns, but to reach the target as soon as possible, the player should move each turn until reaching the target.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is the distance in the permutation graph where the player always moves.

Then, the total score is the sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving, plus a[target] for the remaining turns.

But in the earlier example, this didn't give the correct result.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that staying doesn't increase the move count, so the player can stay in some turns to maximize the score.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Suppose that for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for as many turns as possible.

To do that, the player should reach that position as soon as possible and then stay there.

Hence, the score is:

- Sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving to the target position.

- Plus a[target] for the remaining turns.

But in the earlier example, for Bodya, moving to the target position gives a lower score than staying at the current position.

Hence, the player should choose the option that gives the higher score.

So, perhaps for each player, I need to compute both options and choose the one with the higher score.

Hence, for each player:

Option 1: Stay at the current position for all k turns: score = a[x] * k.

Option 2: Move directly to the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle, accumulating a[x] for each move, and then stay at the target position for the remaining turns.

Compute both options and take the maximum.

To implement this efficiently, I need to:

- For each cycle, find the position with the maximum a[x].

- For each player in the cycle, find the minimal number of moves to reach that position.

- Compute the score for Option 2: sum of a[x] for each move to reach the target, plus a[target] for the remaining turns.

- Compute the score for Option 1: a[x] * k.

- Choose the maximum of the two.

But I still need an efficient way to find the minimal number of moves for each player to reach the target position in their cycle.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and there can be multiple cycles, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider that for each cycle, I can represent the cycle as a list of positions in cycle order.

Then, for each player in the cycle, I can find the distance to the target position in both directions (forward and backward in the cycle), and take the minimal one.

Then, the minimal number of moves is the minimal distance.

But in the earlier example, for Bodya starting at 2, target is 0, cycle is 2-1-0-3-2.

The distance from 2 to 0 is 2 moves (2->1->0).

Hence, minimal moves is 2.

Then, score for Option 2: a[2] (first turn) + a[1] (second turn) + a[0] * (k - 2).

But in the first example, k=2, so score = a[2] + a[1] = 5 + 2 = 7.

But Bodya can choose to stay at 2 for both turns: 5 * 2 =10, which is better.

Hence, Option 1 is better.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 1, target is 0, distance is 1 move (1->0).

Score for Option 2: a[1] (first turn) + a[0] * (k -1) = 2 + 7*(1) =9.

Option 1: a[1] * k = 2*2=4.

Hence, Option 2 is better.

So, in code, for each cycle:

- Find the position with the maximum a[x].

- For each player in the cycle:

- Compute the minimal number of moves to reach the target position.

- Compute scores for Option 1 and Option 2.

- Choose the maximum score.

- Compare Bodya's and Sasha's maximum scores to determine the winner.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a way to find the minimal number of moves for each player to reach the target position in their cycle.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider that for each cycle, I can represent the cycle as a list of positions in cycle order.

Then, for each player in the cycle, I can find their position in the list and the target position, and compute the minimal distance in the cycle.

For example, in the cycle [2,1,0,3], target is 0.

For Bodya starting at 2, index of 2 is 0, index of 0 is 2.

Distance forward: 2 moves (2->1->0).

Distance backward: 2 moves (2->3->0).

Hence, minimal distance is 2.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 1, index of 1 is 1, index of 0 is 2.

Distance forward: 1 move (1->0).

Distance backward: 3 moves (1->2->3->0).

Hence, minimal distance is 1.

So, for each cycle, I can:

- Find the cycle.

- Find the position with the maximum a[x].

- For each player in the cycle, find the minimal distance to the target position.

- Compute the scores for both options and choose the maximum.

But finding cycles in a permutation can be done in O(n) time, which is acceptable.

Then, for each cycle, processing the positions and finding distances can be done in O(m) time, where m is the cycle length.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Hence, in code, I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, k, P_B, P_S.

- Read the permutation p.

- Read the array a.

- Find all cycles in the permutation.

- For each cycle:

- Find the position with the maximum a[x].

- For each player in the cycle:

- Compute the minimal distance to the target position.

- Compute scores for Option 1 and Option 2.

- Choose the maximum score.

- After processing all cycles for a test case, compare Bodya's and Sasha's maximum scores to determine the winner.

Implementing this requires careful handling of cycles and distances.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple cycles correctly and that I don't mix up indices across different test cases.

Also, need to handle 1-based vs 0-based indexing properly.

In the code provided, it seems that the implementation is trying to compute the maximum scores for both players by considering staying at the current position or moving to p[x], but it's not clear if it's following the approach I've outlined.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -= 1

s -= 1

sp = a[s]

bp = a[b]

bm = a[b] * k

sm = a[s] * k

for i in range(n):

k -= 1

if k == 0:

break

b = p[b] - 1

s = p[s] - 1

bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)

sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

sp += a[s]

bp += a[b]

if bm > sm:

print('Bodya')

elif bm < sm:

print('Sasha')

else:

print('Draw')

It seems that the code is trying to simulate the process for both players up to n steps, updating their scores and maximum possible scores.

However, I'm not entirely sure if this correctly implements the strategy I've outlined.

In particular, it seems to iterate up to n steps, updating the scores and maximums, but it's not clear if it's correctly handling the minimal number of moves to reach the target position.

Given that, I think my approach of finding cycles, identifying the target position with the maximum a[x], and computing the minimal distance for each player to reach it is more reliable.

Hence, I will implement that approach.

So, in summary, the correctness of the given program is uncertain to me, as I'm not sure if it correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program may not be correct.

Correctness: **False**
