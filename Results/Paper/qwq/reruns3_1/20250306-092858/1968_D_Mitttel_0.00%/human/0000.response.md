Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores after a certain number of turns. They start at specific positions in a permutation, and each turn they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation. The goal is to maximize their scores by collecting points associated with the positions they land on.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of the same length, where a[i] represents the points gained when landing on position i. Both players start at positions PB and PS respectively, and the game consists of k turns.

Each turn, both players simultaneously decide to either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation p. After k turns, the player with the higher total points wins. If they have the same points, it's a draw.

My task is to determine the winner or if it's a draw, assuming both players play optimally to maximize their scores.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since both players act independently and simultaneously, their strategies don't directly affect each other. So, I can calculate the maximum possible score for Bodya and for Sasha separately and then compare them.

The key is to find, for each player, the sequence of positions that maximizes their total points over k turns.

Now, the players can choose to stay or move each turn. If they stay, they remain at their current position and collect the points there. If they move, they go to the position indicated by p[current_position].

I need to model this decision process for each player over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic decision-making problem, but with the number of turns potentially up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute the optimal score for each player.

I recall that in problems involving sequences of moves where you can choose to stay or move, and the movement is determined by a permutation, there might be cycles involved. Permutations can be decomposed into disjoint cycles, and within each cycle, moving repeatedly according to p will cycle through the positions in that cycle.

So, perhaps I should analyze the permutation to find the cycles and then determine the optimal way for each player to stay or move within their respective cycles.

Let me consider how the permutation affects the movement.

Given that p is a permutation, starting from any position and repeatedly applying p will eventually lead back to the starting position, forming a cycle.

For example, if p = [2, 1, 4, 3], then there are two cycles: 1 -> 2 -> 1 and 3 -> 4 -> 3.

In such a case, if a player is at position 1, they can choose to stay or move to position 2 each turn. If they move, they go to position 2, and if they move again, they go back to position 1, and so on.

The optimal strategy would involve choosing to stay at the position with the higher a[i] value in the cycle, or possibly moving to another position in the cycle if the points are higher there.

Wait, but since it's a cycle of length 2 here, staying or moving would alternate between the two positions. So, the player can choose to stay at one position for multiple turns or switch between the two.

Given that, I need to model the player's choices over k turns to maximize the sum of a[i] over the chosen positions.

This seems complex, but maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical way to compute the optimal score without simulating each turn.

Let me think about the structure of the game.

Each player has a sequence of positions they can be in, based on their decisions to stay or move.

If a player stays at a position, they remain there for that turn. If they move, they go to p[current_position].

So, for each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, independently of previous choices.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each turn, the player decides whether to stay or move based on the current position.

However, with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently, probably in O(1) or O(log k) time per player.

I need to find a way to model the player's position over time and maximize the sum of a[i] over k turns.

Let me consider that the permutation decomposes into disjoint cycles.

Each cycle is independent, so I can analyze each player's cycle separately.

For a single cycle, suppose it has length m.

Within the cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position or move to the next position in the cycle.

The player's decisions are independent across turns, but the position in the cycle determines the available choices.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a Markov Decision Process, where the state is the current position, and the actions are "stay" or "move".

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need a smarter approach.

I recall that in such problems, the optimal strategy often involves finding the best position in the cycle and staying there for as many turns as possible.

But since the player can choose to stay or move each turn, they can potentially oscillate between positions to maximize their score.

However, to optimize time, I need a better way.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

So, effectively, the player can choose to stay at one position for multiple turns or switch between positions in the cycle.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to stay at the position within the cycle that has the maximum a[i].

Wait, but if the player stays at the position with the maximum a[i], they get a[i] each turn.

Alternatively, they could move to another position in the cycle, but since the cycle repeats, they would eventually return to the starting position.

So, perhaps the best strategy is to find the maximum a[i] in the cycle and stay there for all k turns.

But, they have to consider that moving to another position might give higher a[i] in some cases.

Wait, no. Since they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[i] every turn.

Wait, but moving costs them to go to p[i], which might have a higher or lower a[i].

Actually, since they can choose to stay or move each turn, independently, they can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[i] in the cycle every turn.

So, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[i] in their cycle for all k turns.

Is that correct?

Let me think about it.

Suppose a cycle is 1 -> 2 -> 1, and a[1] = 3, a[2] = 5.

If the player starts at position 1, they can choose to stay at 1 and get 3 each turn, or move to 2 and get 5, then choose to stay at 2 and get 5 each subsequent turn.

So, in this case, the optimal strategy is to move to position 2 and stay there for all remaining turns to get 5 each turn.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, the player can choose to stay at position 2 for all k turns directly, without moving.

Wait, no. The "stay" action means staying at the current position, and "move" means moving to p[current_position].

So, if the player is at position 1, they can choose to stay at 1 or move to 2.

If they choose to stay at 1, they get a[1] = 3.

If they choose to move to 2, they get a[2] = 5.

Then, at position 2, they can choose to stay at 2 and get a[2] = 5, or move back to 1 and get a[1] = 3.

So, the optimal strategy is to move to position 2 and stay there for all k turns, accumulating 5 * k points.

Alternatively, if a[1] > a[2], they should stay at position 1.

Wait, but in this example, a[2] > a[1], so moving to position 2 and staying there is better.

Wait, but according to the problem, the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, in the first turn, they can choose to stay at 1 and get 3, or move to 2 and get 5.

If they move to 2, in the next turn, they can choose to stay at 2 and get 5, or move back to 1 and get 3.

The optimal strategy is to move to position 2 and stay there for all k turns, accumulating 5 * k points.

Alternatively, if they stay at position 1 for all k turns, they get 3 * k points, which is worse.

So, in this case, the optimal strategy is to move to the position with the maximum a[i] in the cycle and stay there for all k turns.

Wait, but what if the cycle has more than two positions?

Suppose we have a cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1, with a[1] = 1, a[2] = 2, a[3] = 3.

The player can choose to stay at any position or move to the next in the cycle each turn.

The optimal strategy would be to move to position 3 and stay there for all k turns, accumulating 3 * k points.

Alternatively, if they choose to stay at position 2, they get 2 * k points, which is worse.

So, in general, in a cycle, the optimal strategy is to move to the position with the maximum a[i] in the cycle and stay there for all k turns.

This seems to be the best possible strategy, as staying at that position maximizes the points per turn.

Therefore, for each player, I can find the cycle they are in, find the maximum a[i] in that cycle, and assume they stay at that position for all k turns, accumulating k * max_a.

Then, I can compare the two players' total scores to determine the winner.

Wait, but in the first testcase of the example, n=4, k=2, PB=3, PS=2, p=[4,1,2,3], a=[7,2,5,6].

Let's see:

First, find the cycles.

Starting from position 1: 1 -> p[1]=4 -> p[4]=3 -> p[3]=2 -> p[2]=1, so the cycle is 1-4-3-2-1.

So, it's a cycle of length 4.

Bodya starts at position 3, which is in this cycle.

Sasha starts at position 2, also in the same cycle.

The maximum a[i] in this cycle is max(a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4]) = max(7,2,5,6) = 7.

So, according to my strategy, both players should move to the position with a[i]=7 and stay there for all k turns.

Thus, both should accumulate 7 * 2 = 14 points.

But in the example, Bodya ends up with 10 and Sasha with 9.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Let me look closer.

In the first turn:

- Bodya is at 3. He can choose to stay at 3 and get a[3]=5, or move to p[3]=2.

- If he stays, he gets 5.

- If he moves to 2, he gets a[2]=2.

So, he chooses to stay at 3 to get 5.

Sasha is at 2. He can choose to stay at 2 and get a[2]=2, or move to p[2]=1 and get a[1]=7.

He chooses to move to 1 and get 7.

So, after the first turn:

- Bodya: position 3, score 5

- Sasha: position 1, score 7

Second turn:

- Bodya is at 3. Again, choose to stay at 3 and get another 5, or move to 2 and get 2.

He chooses to stay at 3 and get 5.

- Sasha is at 1. Choose to stay at 1 and get a[1]=7, or move to p[1]=4 and get a[4]=6.

He chooses to stay at 1 and get 7.

So, total scores:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 7 + 7 = 14

Wait, but in the example, it says Bodya: 10, Sasha: 9.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

10

4 2 3 2

4 1 2 3

7 2 5 6

...

Output:

Bodya

Wait, but according to my calculation, Sasha has 14 and Bodya has 10, so Sasha should win.

But the output says "Bodya".

Wait, perhaps I misread the permutation or the array.

Wait, in the permutation p, p1=4, p2=1, p3=2, p4=3.

So, starting from position 3, p[3]=2, p[2]=1, p[1]=4, p[4]=3, forming a cycle of length 4.

In the first turn:

- Bodya at 3: stay at 3 and get a[3]=5, or move to p[3]=2 and get a[2]=2.

He chooses to stay at 3 and get 5.

- Sasha at 2: stay at 2 and get a[2]=2, or move to p[2]=1 and get a[1]=7.

He chooses to move to 1 and get 7.

Second turn:

- Bodya at 3: stay at 3 and get another 5, or move to 2 and get 2.

He chooses to stay at 3 and get 5.

- Sasha at 1: stay at 1 and get a[1]=7, or move to p[1]=4 and get a[4]=6.

He chooses to stay at 1 and get 7.

Total scores:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 7 + 7 = 14

But according to the example, Bodya wins with 10 vs. Sasha's 9.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Sasha's second move.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

Turn | Bodya's position | Bodya's score | Bodya's move | Sasha's position | Sasha's score | Sasha's move

---|---|---|---|---|---|---

first| 3 | 0 + a3=0 +5=5 | stays | 2 | 0 + a2=0 +2=2 | moves to p2=1

second| 3 | 5 + a3=5 +5=10 | stays | 1 | 2 + a1=2 +7=9 | stays

So, Sasha chooses to stay at 1 in the second turn, accumulating 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, but why doesn't Sasha move to p1=4 and get a4=6 instead of staying at 1?

Wait, moving to p1=4 would give a4=6, which is less than staying at 1 with a1=7.

So, Sasha should stay at 1 and get 7 each turn.

But according to the explanation, Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and then stays at 1 in the second turn, accumulating 2 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 9.

Wait, no, 2 + 7 = 9.

But in reality, Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn (getting a1=7), and in the second turn, stays at 1 and gets another a1=7, totaling 7 + 7 = 14.

But the explanation says 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the explanation:

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's score| Sasha's move

---|---|---|---|---|---|---

first| 3 | 0 + a3=0 +5=5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a2=0 +2=2 | moves to p2=1

second| 3 | 5 + a3=5 +5=10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a1=2 +7=9 | stays on the same position

final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 | |

Wait, this suggests that in the first turn, Sasha moves from 2 to 1, getting a1=7, and in the second turn, stays at 1 and gets a1=7 again, but the explanation says 2 + 7 = 9.

That doesn't make sense because 2 + 7 = 9, but if Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and stays at 1 in the second turn, he should have 7 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 14.

Perhaps there is a mistake in the explanation.

Alternatively, maybe the initial score is 0, and in the first turn, Sasha moves to 1 and gets a1=7, making the score 0 + 7 = 7, and in the second turn, stays at 1 and gets another a1=7, making the total 7 + 7 = 14.

But in the explanation, it says 0 + a2=0 +2=2, which suggests that in the first turn, Sasha is at position 2 and chooses to move to 1, getting a1=7, but the explanation says 0 + a2=2, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in how the scoring works when moving.

If a player moves to a new position, do they get the a value of the new position immediately in the same turn, or in the next turn?

I need to clarify the rules.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"On each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, the scoring happens before the movement.

In other words, the player is at position x, scores a_x, and then decides whether to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

So, in the first turn:

- Bodya is at 3, scores a3=5, then chooses to stay at 3 or move to p3=2.

- Sasha is at 2, scores a2=2, then chooses to stay at 2 or move to p2=1.

In the second turn:

- Bodya, if he stayed at 3, is at 3 and scores a3=5 again.

- If he moved to 2, he is at 2 and scores a2=2.

- Similarly for Sasha.

So, in the first turn, Sasha is at 2, scores 2, then moves to 1.

In the second turn, Sasha is at 1, scores a1=7, and stays at 1.

Total score for Sasha: 2 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 9.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and stays at 1 in the second turn, he should get a2=2 in the first turn and a1=7 in the second turn, totaling 9.

But in reality, since scoring happens before movement, in the first turn, Sasha is at 2, scores a2=2, then moves to 1.

In the second turn, he is now at 1 (after moving in the first turn), scores a1=7, and stays at 1.

Total: 2 + 7 = 9.

Similarly, Bodya is at 3, scores a3=5, chooses to stay at 3, scores another a3=5, total 10.

So, Bodya has 10, Sasha has 9, Bodya wins.

But according to my earlier strategy of moving to the position with the maximum a[i] in the cycle and staying there, both would accumulate k * max_a = 2 * 7 = 14, which doesn't match the example.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

The issue is that the scoring happens before the movement, not after.

So, if a player moves to a new position, they score the a value of their current position, and then move to the new position for the next turn.

In other words, the score is based on the position at the beginning of the turn, before deciding to stay or move.

Therefore, in each turn, the player scores a[x], where x is their current position at the beginning of the turn, and then chooses to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

Given that, the optimal strategy isn't simply to move to the position with the maximum a[i] and stay there, because the scoring is based on the position at the beginning of the turn, not the end.

So, in the first turn, no matter what, you score a[x], where x is your current position.

Then, you choose to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

Therefore, the decision to stay or move affects the position for the next turn's scoring.

This changes the strategy.

Let me think recursively.

For k turns remaining, and current position x:

- Option 1: Stay at x, score a[x], and in the next turn, still be at x.

- Option 2: Move to p[x], score a[x], and in the next turn, be at p[x].

So, the total score for staying is a[x] + score for staying at x for k-1 turns.

The total score for moving is a[x] + score for being at p[x] for k-1 turns.

So, the recursive formula is:

score(x, k) = a[x] + max(score(x, k-1), score(p[x], k-1))

With base case score(x, 0) = 0.

This is a standard dynamic programming problem, but with k up to 1e9, I need a smarter way to compute this.

I need to find a way to compute score(x, k) efficiently.

Looking at the recursive formula:

score(x, k) = a[x] + max(score(x, k-1), score(p[x], k-1))

This looks like a linear recurrence, but it's a bit more complicated because of the max function.

I recall that in some problems, the max function can be handled using dynamic programming over cycles.

Given that the permutation decomposes into disjoint cycles, perhaps I can analyze each cycle separately.

Let me consider a single cycle.

Suppose we have a cycle: x -> p[x] -> p[p[x]] -> ... -> x.

Let's say the cycle has length m.

For a player starting at some position in the cycle, I need to find the optimal sequence of stay and move decisions over k turns.

Given that the cycle is of length m, and k can be up to 1e9, I need to find a way to compute the optimal score efficiently.

One approach is to consider the cycle as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the maximum score without simulating each turn.

Another idea is to observe that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, and this choice affects the position for the next turn.

Given that, I can model this as a graph where each node has two options: stay or move.

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the maximum score in O(log k) time or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a matrix exponentiation problem.

In standard dynamic programming problems with transitions that can be modeled as graph edges, matrix exponentiation can be used to compute the state after k steps efficiently.

In this case, for each position x, there are two possible transitions:

1. Stay at x, leading to x in the next turn.

2. Move to p[x], leading to p[x] in the next turn.

So, for each position x, there are two possible next positions: x (stay) or p[x] (move).

Each transition adds a[x] to the score.

So, I can model this as a graph where each node x has two outgoing edges: one to x (stay) and one to p[x] (move), both with weight a[x].

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum path weight after k steps for each player's starting position.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Given that the graph is a collection of cycles (since p is a permutation), and each cycle has its own structure, perhaps I can handle each cycle separately.

Let me consider a single cycle of length m.

Without loss of generality, suppose the cycle is x -> p[x] -> p[p[x]] -> ... -> x.

In this cycle, the positions are x, p[x], p[p[x]], ..., and after m steps, it repeats.

Now, for each position in the cycle, I need to compute the maximum score over k turns, where each turn consists of scoring a[x] and then choosing to stay at x or move to p[x].

Given that, I can model this as a DP over the cycle.

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find that in each cycle, the optimal strategy is to choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for as many turns as possible.

But considering that scoring happens at the beginning of each turn, before choosing to stay or move.

So, if a player is at x and a[x] is the maximum in the cycle, they should stay at x for all k turns.

If a[x] is not the maximum, they should move to the position with the maximum a[x].

Wait, but they can only choose to stay or move each turn, and moving means going to p[x].

So, they might need to make a series of moves to reach the position with the maximum a[x] and then stay there.

But in reality, since they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle, as long as they decide to stay.

Wait, no. If they choose to stay at x, they remain at x for that turn, score a[x], and in the next turn, they are still at x.

If they choose to move, they go to p[x], score a[x], and in the next turn, they are at p[x].

So, to reach a different position in the cycle, they need to choose to move there, but they can only move to p[x], not directly to any position in the cycle.

So, to reach the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle, they might need to make a series of moves, but they have to score a[x] for each x they are at during each turn.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player scores a[x], and then chooses to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, over k turns, the player's path is a sequence of positions where each position is either the same as the previous one or p[previous position].

Given that, I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k positions, subject to the constraint that each position is either the same as the previous one or p[previous position].

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where for each turn, I keep track of the current position and choose to stay or move.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a smarter approach.

I recall that in such problems, the optimal strategy often involves finding a loop and repeating the optimal choices within the loop.

Given that the permutation decomposes into cycles, and within each cycle, the movement is cyclic, perhaps I can find the optimal path within each cycle and then handle the k turns accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a single cycle of length m: x1 -> x2 -> ... -> xm -> x1.

Each player is at some position in the cycle, and in each turn, they can choose to stay or move to the next position in the cycle.

They score a[x] at the beginning of each turn, based on their current position.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player scores a[x], and then decides to stay at x or move to the next position in the cycle.

So, the sequence of positions over k turns can be modeled as a path in the cycle, where at each step, the player chooses to stay or move to the next position.

Given that, I need to find the maximum sum of a[x] over any path of length k in this cycle, where each step is either staying or moving to the next position.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to consider that the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of consecutive turns.

So, effectively, the player can choose to stay at a particular position for several turns, accumulating a[x] for those turns, or move to another position and stay there for some turns, and so on.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to identify the position in the cycle with the maximum a[x] and stay there for as many turns as possible.

But there might be positions with lower a[x] that the player has to pass through to reach the position with the maximum a[x].

However, since the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they don't necessarily have to pass through intermediate positions; they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn.

Wait, no. They can only move to p[x] if they choose to move.

So, they can't directly jump to any position in the cycle; they have to follow the cycle path by moving step by step.

But in reality, since they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they can effectively choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of consecutive turns, as long as they can reach that position by a sequence of stay and move operations.

Wait, but moving is only to p[x], not directly to any position.

So, it's not entirely free; they have to follow the cycle.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position.

I need to compute the maximum possible sum of a[x] over k turns, where each turn consists of scoring a[x] and then choosing to stay at x or move to p[x].

I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying (leading back to x) and one for moving (leading to p[x]).

Each edge has a weight of a[x], since that's the score gained in that turn.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum path weight of length k starting from the player's starting position.

Given that, I can represent this as a graph where each position x has two outgoing edges: one to x (stay) and one to p[x] (move), both with weight a[x].

Then, the task is to find the path of length k starting from the starting position with the maximum total weight.

This is similar to computing the maximum path in a graph with multiple choices per node.

Given that the graph is a permutation, it's a collection of disjoint cycles.

Within each cycle, the graph is a cycle with self-loops at each node.

So, from each node x, there is a self-loop with weight a[x] (stay) and an edge to p[x] with weight a[x] (move).

Given that, I can model this as a graph where each cycle has m nodes, each with a self-loop and an edge to the next node in the cycle.

Now, I need to compute, for each player, the maximum path weight of length k in their cycle, starting from their starting position.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute this efficiently.

I recall that in such graphs, the optimal path can be found by considering the cycle and the self-loops.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, but moving to another position requires choosing to move in that turn.

So, effectively, the player can choose to stay at one position for several turns, or move to another position and stay there for several turns, and so on.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to spend as many turns as possible at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

But to reach that position, the player might need to spend some turns moving through the cycle.

However, since the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for all k turns, provided they can reach it.

Wait, no. They can't necessarily stay at a position unless they choose to stay there.

If they are at x and choose to stay, they remain at x.

If they choose to move, they go to p[x].

So, to stay at a particular position, they need to choose to stay there.

But to reach that position, they might need to move from the previous position.

Wait, but in reality, since the permutation is a cycle, the player can choose to move in a way to cycle through the positions.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute the maximum sum by considering the cycle and the self-loops.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, but moving to another position requires choosing to move in that turn.

So, in other words, the player can choose to stay at one position for several turns, or move to another position and stay there for several turns, and so on.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to spend as many turns as possible at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

To do that, the player should eventually reach the position with the maximum a[x] and stay there for the remaining turns.

But, reaching that position might take some initial turns, during which the player scores the a[x] of the positions they are at.

However, since k can be up to 1e9, and n is up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, but moving to another position requires choosing to move in that turn.

Given that, the optimal strategy is to find the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle and stay there for as many turns as possible.

To maximize the time spent at that position, the player should reach it as soon as possible and then stay there.

So, the total score would be the sum of a[x] for the positions visited while moving to the optimal position, plus the a[opt] for the remaining turns, where opt is the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

Now, to find the minimal number of turns needed to reach the optimal position from the starting position, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

But, since the cycle is cyclic, the minimal number of turns to reach the optimal position can be calculated as the minimal distance along the cycle.

However, since the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently, they can choose to move directly to the optimal position in one turn, provided that it's reachable from their current position by moving.

Wait, no. Moving to p[x] might not directly take them to the optimal position unless it's the next position in the cycle.

So, to reach the optimal position, the player might need to make a series of moves, each moving to p[x], until they reach the optimal position.

Given that, in a cycle of length m, the minimal number of moves to reach the optimal position from the starting position is the minimal distance along the cycle.

Let's say the starting position is s, and the optimal position is opt.

In the cycle, the distance from s to opt can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, and the player should choose the shorter distance.

So, the minimal number of moves to reach opt from s is min(d_clockwise, d_counterclockwise), where d_clockwise is the distance along the cycle in one direction, and d_counterclockwise is the distance in the other direction.

Once the player reaches opt, they can stay there for the remaining turns.

Therefore, the total score would be the sum of a[x] for the positions visited during the moves to opt, plus a[opt] for the remaining turns.

Wait, but in reality, since scoring happens at the beginning of each turn, before choosing to stay or move, the player scores a[x] for the current position each turn, regardless of whether they stay or move.

So, in each turn, they score a[x], and then choose to stay or move.

Therefore, the total score is the sum of a[x] for k turns, where x is the position at the beginning of each turn.

Given that, to maximize the score, the player should spend as many turns as possible at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

To do that, they should reach the optimal position as soon as possible and then stay there.

The number of turns needed to reach the optimal position is the minimal number of moves required to go from the starting position to the optimal position in the cycle.

Once there, they can stay for the remaining turns.

Therefore, the total score is:

sum of a[x] for each turn spent moving to opt + k' * a[opt], where k' is the number of turns spent at opt.

With k' = k - d, where d is the number of turns spent moving to opt.

Wait, but this might not be accurate, because during the moves to opt, the player is scoring a[x] for their current position, which may vary.

Moreover, the path to opt isn't fixed; the player can choose to stay at intermediate positions or move through them.

Given that, I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay at their current position or move to p[x].

So, effectively, from any position x, the player can choose to stay at x for any number of consecutive turns, or move to p[x] and repeat the process.

Given that, the optimal strategy is to find the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle and stay there for as many turns as possible.

To reach that position, the player might need to make a series of moves, but they can choose to stay at intermediate positions if a[x] is higher than a[opt].

Wait, but if a[x] > a[opt], then it's better to stay at x than to move to opt.

But in reality, a[x] might be less than or equal to a[opt], so the player should aim to reach opt as soon as possible and stay there.

However, if there are positions with a[x] > a[opt], that contradicts the assumption that opt has the maximum a[x].

So, in reality, opt has the maximum a[x], so
