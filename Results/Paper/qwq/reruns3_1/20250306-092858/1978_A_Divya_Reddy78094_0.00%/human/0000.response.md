Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n books, each with a certain number of pages, and she wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles. Then, she reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile, and she wants to maximize the total number of pages she reads.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. She has to divide the books into two piles, each pile must have at least one book, and then she reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile and sums those up. Her goal is to maximize this sum.

So, given the list of pages in each book, how can she best divide the books to maximize the sum of the two largest books, one from each pile?

Let me think about this. If she puts the two largest books into separate piles, then she would be reading those two largest books, which seems like it would give the maximum sum. Is that correct?

Let me consider an example. Suppose she has books with pages: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

If she puts the book with 5 pages in one pile and the book with 4 pages in another pile, then she reads 5 + 4 = 9 pages.

If she puts the book with 5 pages and the book with 3 pages in one pile, and the book with 4 pages in another pile, then she reads 5 + 4 = 9 pages again.

If she puts the book with 5 pages and the book with 1 page in one pile, and the books with 4, 3, 2 pages in another pile, then she reads 5 + 4 = 9 pages.

It seems like no matter how she divides them, as long as the two largest books are in separate piles, she gets the sum of the two largest books.

Is there a way she can get a larger sum? Well, the books she reads are the highest in each pile. So, if she puts the two largest books in separate piles, she's reading those two. If she puts both largest books in the same pile, then she only reads one of them, which would be less than reading both.

Wait, let's see: if she puts the two largest books in the same pile, she only reads the largest one in that pile, and the largest one in the other pile. So, she would read the largest and the next largest, same as before.

Wait, no. If she puts the two largest in the same pile, she reads only the largest one, and then the largest in the other pile. That would be the largest and the next largest. But if she puts them in separate piles, she reads both the largest and the next largest. So, it's the same.

Wait, no. If she puts the two largest in separate piles, she reads both of them. If she puts them in the same pile, she only reads the largest one, and the next largest in the other pile. So, it's the same.

Wait, no, actually, if she puts the two largest in separate piles, she reads both of them. If she puts the largest and the third largest in one pile, and the second largest in another pile, she still reads the largest and the second largest. So, it seems like the sum is always the two largest books.

Wait, but in the second case, if she puts the largest and the third largest in one pile, and the second largest in another pile, she reads the largest and the second largest. Same sum.

So, it seems like the sum is always the two largest books, regardless of how she divides them, as long as the two largest books are not in the same pile.

Wait, but if she puts both largest books in the same pile, she only reads the largest one, and the next largest in the other pile. So, in that case, she reads the largest and the next largest anyway.

Wait, no. Suppose she has books with pages: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Case 1: Put 5 and 4 in separate piles. Read 5 + 4 = 9.

Case 2: Put 5 and 3 in one pile, 4, 2, 1 in another pile. Read 5 + 4 = 9.

Case 3: Put 5 and 1 in one pile, 4 and 3 in another pile. Read 5 + 4 = 9.

So, it's always 9, which is the sum of the two largest books.

Wait, but what if she puts all books except the largest in one pile, and the largest in another pile. Then, she reads the largest and the next largest.

Wait, but in the pile with all books except the largest, the highest is the next largest.

So, it seems like no matter how she divides, as long as the two largest books are in separate piles, she reads both of them.

And if she puts both in the same pile, she only reads the largest one and the next largest in the other pile, which is still the same sum.

So, the maximum sum is always the sum of the two largest books.

Is there any scenario where she can get a larger sum?

Well, no, because the two largest books are the maximum she can get.

So, the strategy is to sort the books in descending order and pick the first two.

Wait, but what if there are duplicates? For example, all books have the same number of pages.

Suppose she has 4 books, each with 10 pages.

Then, she divides them into two piles, each with two books. From each pile, she reads the book with the highest number, which is 10 in both cases. So, total is 10 + 10 = 20.

If she puts all books in one pile, she reads only one book, which is 10, and the other pile has zero, but the problem says non-empty piles, so at least one book in each pile.

So, she has to have at least one book in each pile.

So, in this case, she can have one pile with three books and one pile with one book. Then, she reads the highest in the first pile, which is 10, and the highest in the second pile, which is 10. Total is still 20.

Or she can have two piles with two books each, total is 10 + 10 = 20.

So, again, it's the sum of the two largest, which are both 10.

So, seems consistent.

Another example: books with pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

She divides into two piles: one with 5, and one with 1,2,3,4. She reads 5 + 4 = 9.

Or one with 5 and 3, and one with 2,4. She reads 5 + 4 = 9.

Or one with 5 and 1, and one with 2,3,4. She reads 5 + 4 = 9.

So, always 9.

Wait, what if she puts 5 and 2 in one pile, and 3,4,1 in another.

Then, she reads 5 from the first pile and 4 from the second pile. Total is 9.

Same as before.

So, seems like the sum is always the two largest books.

Wait, but what if she has only two books? Like in the first test case: 1 and 1.

Then, she divides them into two piles, each with one book. She reads 1 + 1 = 2.

If she puts both in one pile, she reads only one book, which is 1, and the other pile has one book, which is 1. Total is still 2.

So, in that case, it's the sum of the two books.

So, in general, it seems like the maximum sum is always the sum of the two largest books.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the list of books in descending order and pick the first two.

Wait, but what if there are less than two books? Well, the problem says n >= 2, so it's fine.

So, in the program, it seems like they are doing exactly that.

They read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the list of a_i

- Sort the list in descending order

- Print the sum of the first two elements

So, this seems correct.

Wait, but in the example, for the first test case:

2

1 1

Sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

4

2 3 3 1

Sort descending: 3,3,2,1

Sum of first two is 3 + 3 = 6, but in the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the sample input, for the second test case, the output is 4, but according to this program, it should be 6.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Let me check the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

5

2

1 1

4

2 3 3 1

5

2 2 3 2 2

2

10 3

3

1 2 3

Sample Output:

2

4

5

13

5

Wait, according to the program, for the second test case, it should print 3 + 3 = 6, but the sample output is 4.

Hmm, that's inconsistent.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

Alice divides the books into two non-empty piles.

Then, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile.

So, in the second test case, n=4, a=[2,3,3,1]

According to the program, sort descending: [3,3,2,1], sum first two: 3+3=6

But sample output is 4.

Why is that?

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, in the problem statement, it shows:

Output

2

4

5

13

5

But according to the program, for the second test case, it should be 6, but it's 4.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to rethink the problem.

Let me look back at the note for the second test case.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile.

Then, she reads the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she reads a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

Wait, a_3 is 3 and a_4 is 1.

Wait, but in the list, a=[2,3,3,1], so indices are 1:2, 2:3, 3:3, 4:1

So, if she puts books 2 and 3 in the first pile (which are 3 and 3), and books 1 and 4 in the second pile (2 and 1), then she reads the highest from each pile: 3 + 2 = 5, not 4.

Wait, but according to the note, it says she reads a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4.

But a_3 is 3 and a_4 is 1.

But in this division, the first pile has books 2 and 3 (3 and 3), so she reads 3.

The second pile has books 1 and 4 (2 and 1), so she reads 2.

Total is 3 + 2 = 5, not 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the book numbers.

Wait, in the problem statement, the books are numbered from 1 to n.

So, book 1 has a_1 pages, book 2 has a_2 pages, and so on.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[2,3,3,1]

So, book 1: 2 pages

book 2: 3 pages

book 3: 3 pages

book 4: 1 page

In the note, it says:

Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile.

Then, she reads the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile (which is book 3 with 3 pages), and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile (which is book 1 with 2 pages), but wait, highest number 4 is book 4 with 1 page.

Wait, highest number means book number, not page count.

Wait, the problem says:

Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

So, in each pile, she reads the book with the highest book number, not the one with the highest number of pages.

Wait, no, let's read it again.

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

So, in each pile, she reads the book with the highest book number, not the one with the most pages.

Wait, but in the note, it says:

Then, she reads the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile.

Then she reads a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

So, it seems like "highest number" refers to the book number, not the page count.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

So, does "highest number" refer to the book's identifier (like book 1, book 2, etc.) or the number of pages?

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

I think it's ambiguous.

In the note, it seems like "highest number" refers to the book's identifier.

But in the problem statement, it's not clear whether "highest number" refers to the book's identifier or the number of pages.

Wait, looking back:

"Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

I think it's more likely that it refers to the book with the most pages, not the book with the highest book number.

Perhaps I misread it.

Wait, perhaps "highest number" refers to the number of pages.

So, she reads the book with the most pages in each pile.

If that's the case, then the program seems correct.

But in the second test case, according to the sample output, it's 4, but according to the program, it would be 3 + 3 = 6.

But the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps "highest number" refers to the book's identifier.

Wait, that doesn't make sense, because book 3 has 3 pages, and book 4 has 1 page, so 3 + 1 = 4.

But in the note, it says she reads a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

So, it seems like "highest number" refers to the book's identifier.

But that would be confusing, because "highest number" would usually refer to the largest value, which would be the most pages.

Wait, perhaps "highest number" refers to the book's identifier.

So, in each pile, she reads the book with the highest book number in that pile.

So, in the second test case, if she puts books 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books 1 and 4 in the second pile.

Then, in the first pile, the highest book number is book 3, which has 3 pages.

In the second pile, the highest book number is book 4, which has 1 page.

So, she reads 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

That matches the sample output.

So, "highest number" refers to the book's identifier, not the number of pages.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, because it's summing the two books with the most pages, regardless of their identifiers.

But according to the problem, she reads the book with the highest book number in each pile, not the one with the most pages.

So, the program is incorrect.

So, the correct approach is:

- For each test case, divide the books into two non-empty piles.

- In each pile, identify the book with the highest book number (i.e., the largest index).

- Sum the pages of these two books.

- Find the division that maximizes this sum.

Wait, but book numbers are from 1 to n, and the books are given in order.

So, book 1 to book n.

So, the book numbers are just their positions in the list.

So, to maximize the sum of the pages of the books with the highest numbers in each pile.

So, to maximize the sum of the pages of the books with the largest indices in their respective piles.

So, for example, if she puts book n in one pile and book n-1 in another pile, then she reads a_n and a_{n-1}.

But perhaps there are cases where putting lower-indexed books in separate piles could lead to a higher sum.

Wait, but since a_n and a_{n-1} are the books with the largest indices, and she reads the highest-indexed book in each pile, then putting a_n and a_{n-1} in separate piles would give the sum of a_n + a_{n-1}.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Wait, no, because a_n and a_{n-1} are the two books with the largest indices, and their pages are whatever they are.

Wait, but perhaps some books with lower indices have more pages, but she has to read the highest-indexed book in each pile.

So, she can't choose which book to read based on pages; she has to read the one with the highest index in each pile.

So, to maximize the sum, she should put the two books with the highest pages among the highest-indexed books in separate piles.

Wait, but she has to divide all the books into two piles.

So, she can't choose which books to put in which pile; she has to assign all books to one of the two piles.

So, the strategy should be to put the book with the highest index and the second-highest index in separate piles, and then assign the remaining books in a way that maximizes the sum.

But since she has to read only the highest-indexed book in each pile, and she can't choose which books to read, just which pile to put them in, she should arrange the piles such that the highest-indexed books in each pile have the maximum possible pages.

Wait, but since the indices are fixed, and the books are given in order, she can't change the indices.

So, perhaps the approach is to choose which pile to put each book, but she has to put all books into one of the two piles.

And in each pile, the book that is read is the one with the highest index in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, she should put the two books with the highest pages among the highest-indexed books into separate piles.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each pile, the book read is the one with the highest index in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to maximize the sum of the pages of the two books with the highest indices in their respective piles.

But since the indices are ordered, the highest-indexed book in a pile will be the book with the largest index in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to choose two books such that they are in different piles, and their indices are higher than all books in their respective piles.

Wait, but since the piles are non-empty, and each pile must have at least one book, and she reads the highest-indexed book in each pile.

So, to maximize the sum, she should choose the two books with the highest pages among the highest-indexed books in their piles.

But this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it is to select any two books to be the highest-indexed in their respective piles, but ensure that their indices are higher than any other book in their pile.

But since the books are ordered by their indices, which are just their positions in the list, from 1 to n.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in a pile, the highest-indexed book is the one with the maximum index in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to select two books, one for each pile, such that their indices are higher than all other books in their respective piles, and their pages sum to the maximum.

Moreover, the two selected books must have their indices in different piles.

So, effectively, we need to select two books, say book i and book j, where i != j, and ensure that in their respective piles, no book has a higher index.

But since indices are from 1 to n, and piles are divided such that no pile has a book with a higher index than the selected book in that pile.

So, in other words, in pile 1, the selected book is the one with the highest index in that pile, and similarly for pile 2.

Moreover, the two selected books must be in different piles.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to select two books such that their pages sum to the maximum, and their indices are such that no book in their respective piles has a higher index.

Wait, but since the piles are divided such that each pile has books with indices less than or equal to the selected book's index, but in different piles.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider that in pile 1, the highest-indexed book is book i, and in pile 2, it's book j, with i < j or j < i.

But since indices are from 1 to n, and the highest-indexed book in a pile can't have a higher index than another book in the same pile.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the books based on their indices and decide which pile to put them in, ensuring that in each pile, the highest-indexed book is the one read.

Wait, but the books are already numbered from 1 to n based on their indices.

So, perhaps the way to maximize the sum is to choose two books, one to be the highest in pile 1 and the other to be the highest in pile 2, and assign the remaining books to the piles such that no book in pile 1 has an index higher than the highest in pile 1, and similarly for pile 2.

Wait, but this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the highest-indexed book in a pile determines which book is read from that pile, and its index must be higher than all other books in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to select two books, one for each pile, such that their indices are not overlapping, meaning their piles don't contain books with higher indices than themselves.

Wait, perhaps another way is to fix the highest-indexed book in one pile and assign the rest accordingly.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the highest-indexed book in a pile can have any pages, but to maximize the sum, we need to select the two books with the highest pages, provided they can be in separate piles without violating the index constraints.

Wait, maybe I should iterate through the possible divisions.

Suppose we fix a book to be the highest in pile 1, and another to be the highest in pile 2, and ensure that their indices are such that no book in pile 1 has a higher index than the highest in pile 1, and similarly for pile 2.

Moreover, the two highest books must be in different piles.

So, perhaps the way to maximize the sum is to select the two books with the highest pages, provided their indices can be in different piles without overlapping.

Wait, but since the books are numbered from 1 to n, and piles are divided based on indices, this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the highest-indexed book in a pile determines the pile's "maximum index", and no other book in that pile can have a higher index.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to select two books, one for each pile, such that their indices do not overlap, meaning that one pile's highest index is less than the other's.

Wait, perhaps I need to select two books, book i and book j, where i < j, and assign all books with indices <= i to pile 1 and books with indices <= j to pile 2, but ensure that i and j are in different piles.

This seems messy.

Wait, maybe I need to consider dynamic programming or some other approach.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me look back at the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

5

2

1 1

4

2 3 3 1

5

2 2 3 2 2

2

10 3

3

1 2 3

Sample Output:

2

4

5

13

5

So, for the second test case, n=4, a=[2,3,3,1]

According to the note, she puts books 2 and 3 in one pile, and books 1 and 4 in another pile.

Then, she reads book 3 (a_3=3) from the first pile and book 4 (a_4=1) from the second pile, sum=4.

But according to the program, it sorts the array descending: [3,3,2,1], and sums the first two: 3+3=6, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

So, the program is incorrect.

So, I need to find the correct approach.

Let me consider that in each pile, the book read is the one with the highest index in that pile.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to select two books, one for each pile, such that their indices are higher than all other books in their respective piles, and their sum is maximized.

So, perhaps the way to do this is to iterate through the books and keep track of the maximum pages in each pile, ensuring that the highest indices are in different piles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider dividing the array into two parts, where in one pile, the highest index is i, and in the other pile, the highest index is j, with i != j.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the highest-indexed book in pile 1 as book k, then all books with indices less than or equal to k must be in pile 1.

Similarly, if I have pile 2 with highest-indexed book m, then all books with indices less than or equal to m must be in pile 2.

But since the piles are non-empty and must cover all books, and k and m must be different.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to iterate through the books and keep track of the maximum pages in each pile, ensuring that the highest indices are in different piles.

Wait, perhaps I need to use prefix and suffix maximums.

Let me try that.

Define prefix_max[i] as the maximum pages in books 1 to i.

Define suffix_max[i] as the maximum pages in books i to n.

Then, for each possible division point k from 1 to n-1:

- Pile 1: books 1 to k, read the book with highest index, which is book k.

- Pile 2: books k+1 to n, read the book with highest index, which is book n.

- Sum = a_k + a_n

- Or, wait, no. In pile 1, the highest-indexed book is book k, so read a_k.

In pile 2, the highest-indexed book is book n, so read a_n.

So, sum = a_k + a_n

Then, iterate k from 1 to n-1, and take the maximum over a_k + a_n.

Wait, but a_n is fixed, so to maximize a_k + a_n, we need to choose k such that a_k is maximized.

But k can be from 1 to n-1.

So, the maximum sum would be a_{n-1} + a_n.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=4, a=[2,3,3,1]

So, a_{n-1} + a_n = 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=2, a=[1,1]

So, a_{1} + a_{2} = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, n=5, a=[2,2,3,2,2]

So, a_{4} + a_{5} = 2 + 2 = 4, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, but according to this, it should be 4, but the sample output is 5.

Hmm, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the two piles can have different highest indices, not necessarily n and k.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose two different books, say book i and book j, where i < j, and assign books 1 to i to one pile, and books i+1 to j to the other pile, but this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible pairs of books to be the highest in their respective piles, ensuring that their indices are different, and find the maximum sum among those.

But that would be O(n^2), which for n=100 would be 10,000 operations, which is acceptable.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, in the third test case, n=5, a=[2,2,3,2,2]

According to the sample output, it's 5.

But according to the previous approach, a_{4} + a_{5} = 2 + 2 = 4, which doesn't match.

But in the note, it's not provided, so perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the two books with the highest pages, provided their indices are not consecutive.

Wait, but in the third test case, the two highest pages are both 3 and 2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, a=[2,2,3,2,2], so the highest is 3, and the next highest is 2.

But if I choose book 3 (pages=3) and book 5 (pages=2), sum=5, which matches the sample output.

So, how can I achieve this?

Wait, perhaps I need to select the two books with the highest pages, ensuring that their indices are not overlapping in a way that one pile's highest index is higher than the other's.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I need to select any two books, assign one to pile 1 and the other to pile 2, and ensure that in pile 1, no book has an index higher than the selected book, and similarly for pile 2.

So, for example, in the third test case, n=5, a=[2,2,3,2,2]

If I select book 3 (pages=3) to be in pile 1, and book 5 (pages=2) to be in pile 2.

Then, in pile 1, all books with indices <=3 are assigned to pile 1, which are books 1,2,3.

In pile 2, all books with indices <=5 are assigned to pile 2, which are books 1,2,3,4,5.

But this violates the pile assignment, because book 1,2,3 are in both piles, which is not allowed.

Wait, no, each book must be in exactly one pile.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign books to piles such that in pile 1, all books have indices <= k, and in pile 2, all books have indices >k and <=m, for some k and m.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in pile 1, the highest-indexed book is k, and in pile 2, the highest-indexed book is m, with k != m.

Then, all books with indices <=k are in pile 1, and all books with indices <=m are in pile 2, but this would mean that books with indices <= min(k,m) are in both piles, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps I need to have disjoint sets.

Wait, maybe I need to have k < m, and assign books 1 to k to pile 1, and books k+1 to m to pile 2.

But then, pile 1's highest index is k, and pile 2's highest index is m.

But this would mean that pile 1 has books 1 to k, and pile 2 has books k+1 to m.

But then, if m < n, some books might be left out.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that one pile goes up to k, and the other from k+1 to n.

But in that case, the highest indices are k and n.

But in the third test case, n=5, k=3, a_3 + a_5 = 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=4, k=3, a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4, which matches.

In the first test case, n=2, k=1, a_1 + a_2 =1 +1=2, which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=2, a=[10,3], k=1, a_1 + a_2=10 +3=13, which matches.

In the fifth test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3], k=2, a_2 + a_3=2 +3=5, which matches.

So, the general approach is to choose k from 1 to n-1, and sum a_k + a_n, then take the maximum over all such k.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=5, k can be from 1 to 4.

So, possible sums:

k=1: a_1 + a_5 =2 +2=4

k=2: a_2 + a_5 =2 +2=4

k=3: a_3 + a_5 =3 +2=5

k=4: a_4 + a_5 =2 +2=4

So, the maximum is 5, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=4, k from 1 to 3:

k=1: a_1 + a_4 =2 +1=3

k=2: a_2 + a_4 =3 +1=4

k=3: a_3 + a_4 =3 +1=4

Maximum is 4.

In the first test case, n=2, k=1: a_1 + a_2=1 +1=2.

So, the maximum is 2.

In the fourth test case, n=2, k=1: a_1 + a_2=10 +3=13.

In the fifth test case, n=3, k from 1 to 2:

k=1: a_1 + a_3=1 +3=4

k=2: a_2 + a_3=2 +3=5

Maximum is 5.

So, this approach seems to work.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the list a of n integers.

- Initialize maximum sum as 0.

- For k from 1 to n-1:

- Sum a_k + a_n.

- If this sum is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.

- After iterating through all k, print the maximum sum.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=5, and k goes from 1 to 4, so a_k + a_5.

So, a_1 + a_5=2+2=4

a_2 + a_5=2+2=4

a_3 + a_5=3+2=5

a_4 + a_5=2+2=4

Maximum is 5.

Similarly in other test cases, it works.

So, the correct program should be:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_sum = 0

for k in range(1, n):

current_sum = a[k-1] + a[n-1]

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

print(max_sum)

But in the given program, it's simply sorting the list in descending order and summing the first two elements.

Which is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort(reverse=True)

print(a[0] + a[1])

This is incorrect, because it doesn't consider the indices of the books.

In the sample input, for the second test case, n=4, a=[2,3,3,1]

Sorting descending: [3,3,2,1]

Sum of first two is 3 + 3 = 6, but the sample output is 4.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing her books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number in each pile. The highest number refers to the book's identifier, not the number of pages.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice has `n` books, each with a certain number of pages.
   - She divides these books into two non-empty piles.
   - She reads the book with the highest book number (identifier) from each pile.
   - Our task is to maximize the sum of pages of these two books.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The book with the highest identifier in each pile determines which book Alice reads from that pile.
   - To maximize the sum, we need to select two books such that they are the highest-numbered books in their respective piles.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - For each possible division of books into two piles where the highest book numbers in each pile are different, calculate the sum of pages of these two books.
   - The maximum sum across all such divisions will be our answer.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Iterate through possible division points `k` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `k`, consider the book with index `k` as the highest in one pile and the book with index `n` as the highest in the other pile.
   - Track the maximum sum of pages from these combinations.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_sum = 0
        for k in range(1, n):
            current_sum = a[k-1] + a[n-1]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
        print(max_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of books) and the list `a` (pages of books).

2. **Finding Maximum Sum**:
   - Initialize `max_sum` to 0.
   - Iterate `k` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `k`, calculate the sum of pages of book `k` and book `n`.
   - Update `max_sum` if the current sum is greater.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the maximum sum for each test case.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible valid divisions of the books into two piles and select the one that maximizes the sum of pages of the highest-numbered books in each pile.
