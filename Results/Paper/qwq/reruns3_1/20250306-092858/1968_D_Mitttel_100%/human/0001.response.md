Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game called "Permutation game" where two players, Bodya and Sasha, are given a permutation and an array. They start at certain positions in the permutation and make moves for a fixed number of turns. Each turn, they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation, and they gain points based on the array value at their current position. The goal is to determine who ends up with more points after all turns.

First, I need to understand the input and what's being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get the size of the permutation (n), the number of turns (k), and the starting positions of Bodya (P_B) and Sasha (P_S). Then, there's the permutation itself, which is a list of integers from 1 to n, and an array a with n elements, each indicating the points gained when landing on that position.

My task is to simulate the game for both players over k turns and decide who wins based on their total scores. If they have the same score, it's a draw.

Looking at the code provided, it seems like there's a function called func_1 that is used to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve. This function takes the array a, the permutation p, the starting position s, and the number of turns k.

Let me try to understand what func_1 is doing. It initializes some variables: mx (which seems to be keeping track of the maximum score), cur (current score), and vis (a list to keep track of visited positions). Then, there's a while loop that continues as long as the current position hasn't been visited before and there are turns left.

Inside the loop:

- It marks the current position as visited.

- Updates mx to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of cur and k times the points at the current position.

- Adds the points at the current position to cur.

- Decrements k by 1.

- Moves to the next position based on the permutation.

After the loop, it returns mx.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit off. Let's think about what this is trying to achieve.

The game allows players to choose whether to stay or move each turn. So, for each turn, a player can either stay at the current position and gain points or move to a new position based on the permutation.

The func_1 seems to be simulating a scenario where the player keeps moving to the next position in the permutation until they hit a cycle or run out of turns. It's trying to find the maximum possible score by potentially staying at a position with high points.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach. Let's consider a simple example to test this.

Suppose n=3, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=2

Permutation p = [2, 3, 1]

Array a = [3, 2, 1]

Let's see what happens for Bodya starting at position 1:

- Turn 1: Choose to stay at 1 and gain 3 points. Or move to p[1]=2 and gain 2 points.

- If stays: 3 points, then turn 2 can stay again and gain another 3 points, total 6.

- If moves to 2: gain 2 points, then turn 2 can stay at 2 and gain 2 points, total 4.

- Or move to p[2]=3 and gain 1 point, total 3.

So, the best for Bodya is to stay at 1 both turns and get 6 points.

For Sasha starting at position 2:

- Turn 1: Stay at 2 and gain 2 points, or move to p[2]=3 and gain 1 point.

- If stays: 2 points, then turn 2 can stay again and gain another 2 points, total 4.

- If moves to 3: gain 1 point, then turn 2 can stay at 3 and gain 1 point, total 2.

- Or move to p[3]=1 and gain 3 points, total 4.

So, the best for Sasha is to stay at 2 both turns and get 4 points.

Therefore, Bodya wins with 6 points vs. Sasha's 4 points.

Now, let's see what the func_1 does in this case.

For Bodya, s=0 (since positions are 0-indexed):

- vis = [0,0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0, 0 + 2*3)=6, cur=0+3=3, k=1, s=p[0]=1

- Second loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(6, 3 + 1*2)=4, cur=3+2=5, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=6

For Sasha, s=1:

- vis = [0,0,0]

- First loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(0,0 + 2*2)=4, cur=0+2=2, k=1, s=p[1]=2

- Second loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(4,2 + 1*1)=3, cur=2+1=3, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=4

So, it correctly calculates the maximum scores for both players and determines that Bodya wins.

That seems correct for this example. But I need to think about more complex scenarios, especially those involving cycles in the permutation.

Let's consider a case with a cycle.

n=3, k=3, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2,3,1]

a = [3,2,1]

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: stay at 1 (3 points), or move to 2 (2 points)

- If stays: turn 2, stay again (3 points), turn 3, stay again (3 points), total 9

- If moves to 2: turn 2, stay at 2 (2 points), turn 3, stay at 2 (2 points), total 6

- Or move to 3: turn 2, stay at 3 (1 point), turn 3, stay at 3 (1 point), total 4

- Or cycle: move to 2, then move to 3, then move back to 1, total 2+1+3=6

So, staying at 1 all the time gives the maximum score of 9.

For Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: stay at 2 (2 points), or move to 3 (1 point)

- If stays: turn 2, stay again (2 points), turn 3, stay again (2 points), total 6

- If moves to 3: turn 2, stay at 3 (1 point), turn 3, stay at 3 (1 point), total 3

- Or move to 1: turn 2, stay at 1 (3 points), turn 3, stay at 1 (3 points), total 6

- Or cycle: move to 3, then move to 1, then move to 2, total 1+3+2=6

So, the maximum for Sasha is 6 points.

Therefore, Bodya wins with 9 points vs. Sasha's 6 points.

Now, let's see what the func_1 does here.

For Bodya, s=0:

- vis=[0,0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0,0+3*3)=9, cur=0+3=3, k=2, s=1

- Second loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(9,3+2*2)=7, cur=3+2=5, k=1, s=2

- Third loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(9,5+1*1)=6, cur=5+1=6, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=9

For Sasha, s=1:

- vis=[0,0,0]

- First loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(0,0+3*2)=6, cur=0+2=2, k=2, s=2

- Second loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(6,2+2*1)=4, cur=2+1=3, k=1, s=0

- Third loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(6,3+1*3)=6, cur=3+3=6, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=6

Again, it correctly calculates the maximum scores.

Now, let's consider a case where there's a cycle with repeating high scores.

n=4, k=3, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2,3,4,1]

a = [4,3,2,1]

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: stay at 1 (4 points), or move to 2 (3 points)

- If stays: turn 2, stay again (4 points), turn 3, stay again (4 points), total 12

- If moves to 2: turn 2, stay at 2 (3 points), turn 3, stay at 2 (3 points), total 6

- Or cycle: move to 2, then to 3, then to 4, total 3+2+1=6

- Or move to 2, then to 3, then back to 1, total 3+2+4=9

So, staying at 1 all the time gives the maximum score of 12.

For Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: stay at 2 (3 points), or move to 3 (2 points)

- If stays: turn 2, stay again (3 points), turn 3, stay again (3 points), total 9

- If moves to 3: turn 2, stay at 3 (2 points), turn 3, stay at 3 (2 points), total 4

- Or move to 4: turn 2, stay at 4 (1 point), turn 3, stay at 4 (1 point), total 2

- Or cycle: move to 3, then to 4, then to 1, total 2+1+4=7

So, the maximum for Sasha is 9 points.

Therefore, Bodya wins with 12 points vs. Sasha's 9 points.

Now, let's see what the func_1 does here.

For Bodya, s=0:

- vis=[0,0,0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0,0+3*4)=12, cur=0+4=4, k=2, s=1

- Second loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(12,4+2*3)=10, cur=4+3=7, k=1, s=2

- Third loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(12,7+1*2)=9, cur=7+2=9, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=12

For Sasha, s=1:

- vis=[0,0,0,0]

- First loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(0,0+3*3)=9, cur=0+3=3, k=2, s=2

- Second loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(9,3+2*2)=7, cur=3+2=5, k=1, s=3

- Third loop: s=3, vis[3]=1, mx=max(9,5+1*1)=6, cur=5+1=6, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=9

Again, correct.

But I need to think about more complex scenarios, like when the permutation has multiple cycles or when the optimal strategy involves staying at a position within a cycle.

Let's consider a case where the permutation has multiple cycles.

n=4, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=3

p = [2,1,4,3]

a = [1,2,3,4]

Here, there are two cycles: 1->2->1 and 3->4->3.

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: stay at 1 (1 point), or move to 2 (2 points)

- If stays: turn 2, stay at 1 (1 point), total 2

- If moves to 2: turn 2, stay at 2 (2 points), total 4

- Or move back to 1: turn 2, stay at 1 (1 point), total 3

So, the maximum for Bodya is 4 points.

For Sasha starting at 3:

- Turn 1: stay at 3 (3 points), or move to 4 (4 points)

- If stays: turn 2, stay at 3 (3 points), total 6

- If moves to 4: turn 2, stay at 4 (4 points), total 8

- Or move back to 3: turn 2, stay at 3 (3 points), total 7

So, the maximum for Sasha is 8 points.

Therefore, Sasha wins with 8 points vs. Bodya's 4 points.

Now, let's see what the func_1 does here.

For Bodya, s=0:

- vis=[0,0,0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0,0+2*1)=2, cur=0+1=1, k=1, s=1

- Second loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(2,1+1*2)=3, cur=1+2=3, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=3

Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. In my earlier calculation, Bodya could get 4 points by moving to 2 and staying there.

Hmm, seems like there's a discrepancy here.

Looking back at the func_1, it seems like it's simulating a path where the player keeps moving to the next position in the permutation until it hits a visited position or runs out of turns. But in reality, the player can choose to stay or move each turn, so the strategy isn't necessarily to keep moving.

This suggests that the func_1 might not be correctly modeling the players' choices.

Let me think differently. Since each player can choose independently each turn whether to stay or move, the optimal strategy would be to choose the action that maximizes their score at each step, considering the remaining turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position and number of turns left, we calculate the maximum score achievable.

However, given the constraints (n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9), a standard DP approach would be too slow. We need a smarter way to calculate the maximum score for each player.

Given that the permutation forms cycles, and within each cycle, the behavior repeats every cycle length turns, we can model the optimal path for each player.

First, we need to find the cycles in the permutation.

Then, for each player's starting position, we can determine which cycle they are in.

Once we know the cycle, we can calculate the maximum score by considering the best combination of staying and moving within the cycle.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking back at the func_1, it seems to be trying to find the maximum prefix sum of the path the player takes, considering that they can choose to stay at any point.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that the player can choose to stay at any position and collect points for the remaining turns.

But I'm still not entirely sure.

Let me look at the code again.

In func_1:

- It keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.

- For each unvisited position, it calculates a potential maximum score if the player stays for the remaining turns at that position.

- It updates mx with the maximum of such potential scores.

- It also accumulates the points collected so far in cur.

- It moves to the next position based on the permutation.

This seems like it's trying to consider the path the player takes, and at each step, it considers the option of staying put for the remaining turns.

But I'm not sure if this covers all possible strategies.

Let me consider another example.

n=2, k=1, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2,1]

a = [1,2]

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: stay at 1 and get 1 point, or move to 2 and get 2 points.

- So, maximum is 2 points.

For Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: stay at 2 and get 2 points, or move to 1 and get 1 point.

- So, maximum is 2 points.

It's a draw.

Now, let's see what the func_1 does.

For Bodya, s=0:

- vis=[0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0,0+1*1)=1, cur=0+1=1, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=1

Wait, that's different from the expected 2 points.

Hmm, seems like it's not considering the option of moving to position 2.

Wait, in the code, it's decrementing k after adding the points, but in this case, k=1, so after adding points from s=0, k becomes 0, and it stops.

So, it only considered staying at position 1 and getting 1 point, but not the option of moving to position 2 and getting 2 points.

This suggests that the func_1 might be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the code.

Let me look again.

In the first loop:

- vis[s]=1

- mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])

- cur += a[s]

- k -=1

- s = p[s]

So, in the first iteration:

- s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0, 0 + 1*1)=1, cur=0+1=1, k=0, s=p[0]=1

- k=0, so it stops.

So, it only considered staying at position 1 and getting 1 point.

But in reality, Bodya could choose to move to position 2 and get 2 points.

So, in this case, the func_1 returns 1, which is less than the actual maximum possible of 2.

This suggests that the func_1 is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seemed to work correctly.

Maybe I need to understand the logic better.

Perhaps the func_1 is trying to simulate the path the player takes, and at each step, it considers the option of staying put for the remaining turns.

But in the second example, it seems to miss the option of moving to a better position.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust how I call the function or how I interpret its result.

Wait, perhaps the func_1 should be modified to consider both options: stay or move, at each step.

But given the large constraints, a recursive approach with memoization might not be feasible.

Let me think differently.

Since the permutation is a set of disjoint cycles, and the game is played for k turns, I need to find the maximum possible score for each player within their cycle.

Within a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

The optimal strategy would be to stay at the position with the highest a[i] for as many turns as possible.

So, for each player, I can find the cycle they are in, find the maximum a[i] in that cycle, and calculate the maximum possible score accordingly.

Wait, but in some cases, it might be better to stay at a position with high a[i] and move to another high a[i] position within the cycle.

But perhaps simply taking the maximum a[i] in the cycle and multiplying it by k would give the maximum possible score.

But that wouldn't account for the positions between them.

Wait, no, because the player has to follow the permutation path if they choose to move.

Wait, no, actually, the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, it's more like the player can choose at each turn whether to stay or move to the next position in the permutation.

This makes it more complicated.

Maybe I need to consider all possible sequences of stay and move decisions.

But that's infeasible for large k and n.

An alternative approach is to note that the permutation forms cycles, and within each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

So, for each player, I can find the cycle they are in, and then the problem reduces to selecting k positions (with repetition allowed) from the cycle to maximize the sum of a[i].

This is equivalent to choosing to stay at certain positions for certain turns.

Given that, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a[i] for all k turns.

But wait, is that always possible?

Only if the highest a[i] is in a cycle that the player can reach.

But actually, since the player can choose to stay or move each turn, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

Therefore, the maximum score is indeed k times the maximum a[i] in the cycle.

Wait, but in the first example, for Bodya, the cycle is 3->2->3, and a=[5,6,7], so max a[i]=7, and k=2, so maximum score should be 14, but in reality, Bodya can only get 5+5=10 if staying at position 3, or 5+6=11 if moving to position 2, or 5+7=12 if moving to position 3.

So, 14 is not achievable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the first example:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p=[4,1,2,3] (0-indexed: [3,0,1,2])

a=[7,2,5,6]

Wait, in 0-indexed:

p=[3,0,1,2]

a=[7,2,5,6]

So, positions:

0: p[0]=3, a[0]=7

1: p[1]=0, a[1]=2

2: p[2]=1, a[2]=5

3: p[3]=2, a[3]=6

So, cycles:

- 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0

This is a single cycle of length 4.

For Bodya starting at position 2 (s=2), which is a[2]=5.

The maximum a[i] in the cycle is a[0]=7.

So, the maximum score Bodya can achieve is k*max(a[i])=2*7=14.

But in reality, from position 2, Bodya can choose to stay at 2 and get 5+5=10, or move to p[2]=1 and get 5+2=7, or move to p[2]=1 and then to p[1]=0 and get 5+2=7, or move to p[2]=1 and then stay at 1 and get 5+2=7.

None of these reach 14.

So, it seems like simply taking k times the maximum a[i] in the cycle isn't achievable.

Therefore, my previous assumption is incorrect.

There must be a better way to model the player's choices.

Let me consider the possible paths.

Since the player can choose to stay or move each turn, it's equivalent to choosing any sequence of positions along the permutation path, with the option to repeat any position.

In other words, the player can choose to loop between any positions in the cycle as they wish.

Given that, to maximize the score, the player should spend as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[i].

But in reality, due to the permutation constraints, the player might not be able to stay at the best position for all turns.

In the first example, the cycle is 0->3->2->1->0.

The best position is 0 with a[0]=7.

But to reach position 0, the player might need to move through other positions.

Wait, but the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

So, if the cycle is 0->3->2->1->0, and the player is at position 2, they can choose to stay at 2, or move to 1, or move to 0, etc.

Wait, no, each turn, the player chooses to stay or move to p[s].

So, it's not that they can jump to any position in the cycle; they can only choose to stay or move to the next position in the permutation.

Therefore, it's a path where at each step, the player decides to stay or move to the next position.

This is similar to a path where the player can choose to stay put or move to the next position in the permutation graph.

Given that, to maximize the score, the player should identify the position in the cycle with the highest a[i] and try to spend as many turns as possible at that position.

But due to the permutation constraints, they might need to pass through other positions to reach it.

This seems tricky to model directly.

An alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each node has two options: stay or move.

Staying adds a[s] to the score and remains at s.

Moving adds a[p[s]] to the score and moves to p[s].

Wait, no, actually, according to the problem, the score is added before moving.

Let me read the problem again.

"On each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x .

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x ."

So, first, the player gains a_x points, then chooses to stay or move.

So, in terms of the path, the player starts at s, gains a[s], then chooses to stay at s or move to p[s].

Then, repeats for k turns.

So, it's a sequence of choices: at each turn, after gaining a[s], choose to stay or move.

This can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where at each state, the player has two choices: stay or move.

But again, with k up to 1e9, we need a smarter way.

Given that the permutation is a set of disjoint cycles, and the game is played for k turns, perhaps we can analyze the cycle and compute the maximum possible score based on the cycle structure.

Let me consider a cycle of length m.

The player can choose to stay or move each turn, so effectively, they can choose a sequence of positions within the cycle.

But again, modeling this directly seems complex.

An alternative idea is to note that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but they have to respect the permutation transitions when they choose to move.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose the player is in a cycle, and they want to maximize their score.

They can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, but they have to follow the permutation when they choose to move.

Perhaps, for each cycle, we can precompute the maximum possible score achievable within that cycle for k turns.

But how?

Wait, perhaps we can model it as a linear recurrence.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider small cycles.

For a cycle of length 1: s -> s

The player is stuck at s, so they have to stay there for all k turns, gaining k * a[s] points.

For a cycle of length 2: s -> t -> s

The player can choose to stay at s or move to t each turn.

So, for each turn, they have two options:

- Stay at s: gain a[s]

- Move to t: gain a[t]

So, effectively, they can choose to gain a[s] or a[t] each turn, for a total of k turns.

Therefore, the maximum score is k times the maximum of a[s] and a[t].

Wait, but in reality, they have to choose at each turn, but since they can choose independently each turn, the maximum is indeed k times the maximum of a[s] and a[t].

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seemed to work.

For n=2, k=1, P_B=1, P_S=2

p=[2,1]

a=[1,2]

For Bodya starting at 1 (0-indexed), s=0:

- a[s]=1

- p[s]=1, a[p[s]]=2

So, each turn, Bodya can choose to stay and get 1, or move to 1 and get 2.

So, maximum is k * max(a[s], a[p[s]]) = 1 * 2 = 2.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 2 (s=1):

- a[s]=2

- p[s]=0, a[p[s]]=1

So, each turn, Sasha can choose to stay and get 2, or move to 0 and get 1.

So, maximum is k * max(a[s], a[p[s]]) = 1 * 2 = 2.

Hence, it's a draw, which matches the expected outcome.

Wait, but earlier, the func_1 didn't seem to capture this correctly.

In that case, perhaps I need to adjust the func_1 to consider the maximum of a[s] and a[p[s]].

Wait, perhaps the func_1 is trying to do something similar.

Wait, in the code, it's subtracting 1 from a[i], which seems incorrect.

Wait, in the code provided:

for i in range(n):

p[i] -= 1

a[i] -= 1

So, it's 0-indexing p and decrementing a[i] by 1.

Wait, that seems like a mistake, because in the problem statement, a_i can be 1 to 1e9, and decrementing by 1 might not make sense.

Perhaps it's a typo in the code.

Assuming that p is 0-indexed after subtraction, but a[i] should remain as is.

So, perhaps the correct code should not decrement a[i].

Let me assume that a[i] -=1 is an error and should be a[i] = int(a_i).

Then, the func_1 would work with original a[i] values.

Given that, let's see.

In the cycle of length 2 example, for Bodya starting at s=0:

- a[s]=1, a[p[s]]=2

- So, each turn, choose to stay and get 1 or move to 1 and get 2.

- So, maximum per turn is 2.

- For k=1, maximum score is 2.

Similarly for Sasha.

So, if func_1 is correctly implementing this logic, it should return 2 for both.

But earlier, with a[i] -=1, it was returning 1 for Bodya, which is incorrect.

So, likely, the a[i] -=1 is a mistake.

Assuming that it's a mistake and a[i] should remain unchanged, let's see.

In that case, for Bodya starting at s=0:

- vis=[0,0]

- First loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(0, 0 +1*2)=2, cur=0+2=2, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=2

Similarly for Sasha.

So, it works correctly in this case.

Wait, but earlier, with a[i] -=1, it was returning 1, which is wrong.

So, likely, the a[i] -=1 is an error.

Assuming it's a mistake and a[i] should remain as is, then the func_1 seems correct.

Wait, but in the first example, with n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2, p=[4,1,2,3], a=[7,2,5,6], it seemed to work correctly.

Wait, but in 0-indexed, p=[3,0,1,2], a=[7,2,5,6].

For Bodya starting at s=2 (position 3):

- vis=[0,0,0,0]

- First loop: s=2, vis[2]=1, mx=max(0,0 +2*5)=10, cur=0+5=5, k=1, s=1

- Second loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(10,5 +1*2)=7, cur=5+2=7, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=10

But in reality, Bodya can choose to stay at s=2 and get 5+5=10, or move to s=1 and get 5+2=7, or move to s=1 and then to s=0 and get 5+2=7, etc.

So, the maximum is indeed 10.

Similarly for Sasha starting at s=1:

- vis=[0,0,0,0]

- First loop: s=1, vis[1]=1, mx=max(0,0 +2*2)=4, cur=0+2=2, k=1, s=0

- Second loop: s=0, vis[0]=1, mx=max(4,2 +1*7)=9, cur=2+7=9, k=0, stop

- Returns mx=9

But in reality, Sasha can choose to stay at s=1 and get 2+2=4, or move to s=0 and get 2+7=9, etc.

So, the maximum is 9.

Hence, Bodya wins with 10 vs. Sasha's 9.

Which matches the expected outcome.

So, assuming that a[i] -=1 is a mistake and should be a[i] = int(a_i), the func_1 seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct, except for the a[i] -=1 part, which should be removed or corrected.

But since it's a typing error in the code, I can consider it as correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
