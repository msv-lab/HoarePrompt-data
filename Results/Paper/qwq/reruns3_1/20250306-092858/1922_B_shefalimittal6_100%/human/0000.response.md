Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n sticks, each with a length of 2 raised to the power of a_i, where a_i is given for each stick. I need to choose exactly 3 sticks and form a non-degenerate triangle with them. A non-degenerate triangle means that the area is greater than 0, which in terms of stick lengths means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. That's the triangle inequality theorem.

So, my task is to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that satisfy the triangle inequality. The sticks are indexed from 1 to n, and their lengths are 2^{a_i}. The inputs are given in test cases, and I need to process each test case separately.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4.

- n (number of sticks in each test case) is up to 3*10^5.

- a_i ranges from 0 to n.

- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution because processing 10^4 test cases with up to 3*10^5 elements each requires careful optimization.

Let me think about the properties of the stick lengths. Since lengths are of the form 2^{a_i}, and 2 raised to any integer is a power of two, which means all lengths are powers of two.

I recall that powers of two are distinct and double each time. So, 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, and so on.

Now, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the two smaller lengths must be greater than the largest length.

Given that all lengths are powers of two, perhaps there is a smarter way to count the valid triplets without checking every possible combination, which would be too slow.

Let me consider sorting the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order. Since the lengths are 2^{a_i}, sorting a_i will sort the lengths accordingly.

So, let's assume I have a sorted list of exponents a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

For three sticks with exponents a, b, and c where a <= b <= c, to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two smaller sticks must be greater than the length of the largest stick:

2^a + 2^b > 2^c

Given that 2^a + 2^b is equal to 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait a minute, properties of powers of two: 2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}. And 2^a + 2^b, where a < b, is equal to 2^a * (1 + 2^{b-a}), which is less than 2^{b+1}.

But perhaps I can think differently. Let's consider that in sorted order, for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that 2^c is the largest, and 2^a and 2^b are smaller or equal to 2^c.

I know that 2^a + 2^b <= 2*c if a and b are less than or equal to c.

Wait, but I need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that 2^a <= 2^c and 2^b <= 2^c, their sum is <= 2*2^c = 2^{c+1}.

But I need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Let me see for small examples.

Suppose a=1, b=1, c=1: 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 > 2^1=2. So, this works.

a=1, b=1, c=2: 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 > 2^2=4. Wait, 4 > 4 is false. So, this doesn't work.

Wait, but in the problem, sticks can have the same a_i.

Wait, but in this case, a=1, b=1, c=2: lengths are 2,2,4.

2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4. So, it doesn't form a triangle.

So, a=1, b=1, c=1 works: 2+2>2.

a=1, b=1, c=2 doesn't work: 2+2=4, which is not greater than 4.

a=1, b=2, c=2: 2+2=4 > 4, no.

a=2, b=2, c=2: 4+4=8 > 4, yes.

So, in cases where all three exponents are equal, it works.

Wait, in the first test case of the example, where all a_i=1, and n=7, it says any three sticks can be chosen, and the answer is 35, which is C(7,3)=35.

So, in that case, all a_i are equal to 1, so all lengths are 2, and 2+2>2 holds, so it's a valid triangle.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[3,2,1,3], which correspond to lengths 8,4,2,8.

Possible triplets:

- 2,4,8: 2+4=6 > 8? No.

- 2,8,8: 2+8=10 > 8, yes.

- 4,8,8: 4+8=12 > 8, yes.

So, there are two valid triplets, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3], lengths 2,4,8.

2+4=6 > 8? No.

So, no valid triangle.

Fourth test case, n=1, a=[1], can't choose 3 sticks, so 0.

Okay, so from the sample, it seems that only certain combinations work based on the triangle inequality.

Now, to find an efficient way to count the number of valid triplets.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, I need an O(n log n) solution per test case or better.

First, I can sort the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order for each test case.

Then, for each combination of three exponents a <= b <= c, check if 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But even with sorting, checking all combinations would be O(n^3), which is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about properties of powers of two.

I know that 2^a + 2^b, if a != b, is equal to 2^max(a,b) + 2^min(a,b).

Wait, more specifically, 2^a + 2^b = 2^a * (1 + 2^{b-a}) if b > a.

But in terms of comparing to 2^c, perhaps I can work with exponents directly.

Let me consider that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to 2^a + 2^b - 2^c > 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, since all lengths are powers of two, perhaps there is a way to exploit the binary nature.

Alternatively, since the lengths are powers of two, maybe there is a way to count frequencies of each length and then compute combinations based on those frequencies.

Let me think about frequency counting.

Suppose I count the frequency of each a_i, since lengths are 2^{a_i}, and a_i can range from 0 to n.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, frequency counting per test case is feasible.

So, for each test case, I can create a frequency array freq where freq[k] represents the number of sticks with length 2^k.

Given that a_i can be up to n, and n can be up to 3*10^5, the frequency array can be of size up to 3*10^5, but since a_i <= n, it's manageable.

Wait, but n can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, so overall it's fine.

Now, with the frequency array, I need to count the number of valid triplets (i,j,k) where i < j < k, and 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible c (the largest stick), and for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b and a + b > c.

But since a and b are exponents, their sums relate to the exponents in a specific way.

Wait, but 2^a + 2^b can be tricky to handle directly.

Let me consider that for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that 2^b <= 2^c, and 2^a <= 2^b, I can think in terms of exponents.

Let me consider that if a < c, and b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c.

Wait, but that's only if a and b are both less than c.

But in reality, if a <= b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{b} + 2^{b} = 2^{b+1}.

If b < c, then 2^{b+1} <= 2^{c}, so 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c}.

Therefore, for 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, it must be that b == c.

Wait, but if b == c, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^c.

If a < c, then 2^a + 2^c = 2^a + 2^c, which is less than 2^{c+1}, but not necessarily greater than 2^c.

Wait, 2^a + 2^c > 2^c only if a == c.

Wait, if a == c, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^c + 2^b.

If b == c, then 2^c + 2^c = 2^{c+1} > 2^c.

So, in this case, if a == c and b == c, then it's valid.

Also, if a < c and b == c, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^c.

Is 2^a + 2^c > 2^c? Yes, because 2^a > 0.

Wait, but 2^a is positive, so 2^a + 2^c > 2^c.

So, in this case, as long as b == c, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, regardless of a.

But wait, in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: lengths 2,4,4.

2 + 4 = 6 > 4, which is true.

Similarly, a=1, b=1, c=1: 2+2>2.

a=1, b=1, c=2: 2+2=4 > 4? No, 4 is not greater than 4.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if b == c, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But in this case, a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 > 4, which holds.

a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4 > 4? No, 4 is not greater than 4.

Wait, so my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps it's not just sufficient that b == c.

There must be more to it.

Let me think again.

Given a <= b <= c, we have 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Case 1: a < c and b < c.

Then, 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c.

So, 2^a + 2^b <= 2^c, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Case 2: b == c.

Then, 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^c.

If a < c, then 2^a + 2^c = 2^c + 2^a < 2^c + 2^c = 2^{c+1}, but is it greater than 2^c?

Well, 2^c + 2^a > 2^c as long as a >= 0, since 2^a > 0.

But in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 = 6 > 4, which holds.

But when a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4 > 4? No, 4 is not greater than 4.

So, in this case, even though b == c, if a < c, it doesn't always hold.

Wait, so my earlier assumption is incorrect.

I need to refine this.

Let me consider that for b == c, we need a < c.

Wait, in the case where a < c and b == c, 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^c.

Is 2^a + 2^c > 2^c?

Yes, because 2^a > 0, so 2^a + 2^c > 2^c.

But in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 > 4, which holds.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4 > 4, which does not hold.

Wait, but according to the inequality, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, which is 2 + 2 = 4 > 4? No.

So, it only holds strictly when 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, not equal to.

Therefore, in the case where a < c and b == c, it's not always true that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Wait, but in this specific case, when a < c and b == c, 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^c.

Now, 2^a + 2^c > 2^c is true only if a >= c.

Wait, no, 2^a > 0, so 2^a + 2^c > 2^c.

But in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 = 6 > 4, which holds.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4 > 4, which does not hold.

Wait, but according to the inequality, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

In the second case, 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4.

So, it seems that when a < c and b == c, it's only valid if a + b > c.

Wait, but a and b are exponents, so perhaps I need to consider the exponents' values.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c if and only if b > c - a.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix c, and for each c, I need to find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b and a + b > c.

But a and b are exponents, so their sums relate to the exponents in a specific way.

Wait, but I'm dealing with 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

I can consider taking logarithms, but since all are powers of two, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, in binary numbers, 2^a + 2^b is like setting the a-th and b-th bits to 1.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to 2^a + 2^b - 2^c > 0.

But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over c, and for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b and a + b > c.

But since a and b are exponents, perhaps I can precompute prefix sums or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can count the frequency of each a_i, sort the a_i, and then for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b and a + b > c.

But finding all such pairs efficiently is still a challenge.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the lengths are powers of two, and thus, their sums have specific properties.

Let me consider that for any a <= b <= c, if b > c - 1, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to 2^a + 2^b - 2^c > 0.

But I need to find a way to count these efficiently.

Let me look at the sample input and output to verify my understanding.

First test case: n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

All a_i=1, so all lengths are 2.

So, 2 + 2 > 2 holds, so any three sticks form a triangle.

Number of ways: C(7,3)=35, which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=4, a=[3,2,1,3]

Lengths: 8,4,2,8.

Possible triplets:

- 2,4,8: 2+4=6 > 8? No.

- 2,8,8: 2+8=10 > 8, yes.

- 4,8,8: 4+8=12 > 8, yes.

So, two valid triplets, matching the sample output.

Third test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3], lengths 2,4,8.

2+4=6 > 8? No.

So, no valid triangles.

Fourth test case: n=1, only one stick, can't form a triangle.

Now, back to the general case.

I need an efficient way to count the number of triplets (a,b,c) with a <= b <= c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over c, and for each c, count the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b, a <= c, b <= c, and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Wait, but a and b can be up to c.

Wait, in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 > 4, which holds.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4 > 4, which does not hold.

So, for c fixed, I need to count pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for a given c, if b == c, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c becomes 2^a + 2^c > 2^c, which simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true since a >= 0.

But in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: valid.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: invalid.

Wait, so my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to 2^a > 2^c - 2^b.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a given c and b, a needs to be greater than some value.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the exponents in non-decreasing order.

For each c, I can find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c in terms of exponents.

Wait, but a and b are exponents, and their sums relate to the exponents in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to a + b > c in logarithmic scale, but since exponents are integers, perhaps there's a direct relation.

Wait, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Divide both sides by 2^c: (2^{a-c}) + (2^{b-c}) > 1.

Since a <= c and b <= c, 2^{a-c} and 2^{b-c} are fractions less than or equal to 1.

Wait, but a <= c and b <= c, so 2^{a-c} <= 1 and 2^{b-c} <=1.

So, their sum is >1.

This happens only if at least one of them is 1, i.e., a=c or b=c.

Wait, if a < c and b < c, then 2^{a-c} <1 and 2^{b-c}<1, so their sum is <2, but we need it to be >1.

So, in this case, 2^{a-c} + 2^{b-c} >1.

This can happen in two scenarios:

1. Both a=c and b=c, but since a <= b <= c, this means a=b=c.

2. One of a or b is equal to c, and the other is less than or equal to c.

Wait, but in the earlier example, a=1, b=2, c=2: 2^{1-2} + 2^{2-2} = 0.5 +1 =1.5 >1, which holds.

a=1, b=1, c=2: 0.5 +0.5=1, which is not greater than 1.

So, it seems that 2^{a-c} + 2^{b-c} >1 holds only if at least one of a or b is equal to c.

Wait, but in the case where a=b=c, 2^{c-c} + 2^{c-c} =1 +1=2>1, which holds.

When a < c and b = c: 2^{a-c} + 2^{b-c} = 2^{a-c} +1.

For this to be >1, 2^{a-c} >0, which is always true since a >=0.

But in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: holds.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: does not hold.

Wait, but according to this, it should hold, but in reality, it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Let me recast this.

Given a <= b <= c, 2^{a-c} + 2^{b-c} >1.

This is equivalent to 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Now, in the case a=1, b=2, c=2: 0.5 +1=1.5>1, holds.

a=1, b=1, c=2: 0.5 +0.5=1, which is not greater than 1, so does not hold.

a=2, b=2, c=2:1 +1=2>1, holds.

So, it seems that 2^{a-c} + 2^{b-c} >1 holds if:

- a < c and b = c, provided that a > c - b.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps a better way is to iterate over c, and for each c, count the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

But since a and b are exponents, perhaps I can precompute the frequency of each exponent and use that to compute the number of valid pairs.

Let me consider that.

First, sort the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order.

Then, for each c from n-1 downto 2, and for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

Wait, but a and b are exponents, so their sums are not directly additive in the same way as integers.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over c, and for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

Given that a <= b <= c, and a + b > c, I can use two pointers or binary search to find, for each c, the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b and a + b > c.

But with n up to 3*10^5, this could be too slow if done naively.

Wait, but perhaps I can optimize it.

Let me consider that for a given c, I can fix b and find the smallest a such that a + b > c.

Given that a <= b <= c, and a + b > c.

So, for a given b, a > c - b.

Since a <= b, I need a > c - b and a <= b.

So, a > max(c - b, a).

Wait, but a <= b, and a > c - b.

So, a > c - b and a <= b.

Given that a <= b, and a > c - b.

So, a > max(a, c - b).

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each b, the smallest a such that a > c - b.

Since a <= b, I can find a > c - b and a <= b.

So, a > c - b and a <= b.

Thus, a > c - b and a <= b.

Given that a <= b, and a > c - b.

So, a > c - b.

Therefore, for each b, a must be greater than c - b.

Given that a <= b, so c - b < a <= b.

Thus, a in (c - b, b].

Given that a <= b and a > c - b.

So, for each b, the possible a are in (c - b, b].

If I sort the exponents, I can use two pointers to count the number of a for each b.

Let me try to think of an algorithm:

1. Sort the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order.

2. For each c from n-1 downto 2:

a. For the current c, set b ranging from c-1 downto 1.

b. For each b, find the smallest a such that a > c - b.

c. Since a <= b, and a > c - b, I can use binary search to find the number of a in the sorted list that satisfy this condition.

But c - b could be negative, so I need to handle that.

Wait, c and b are exponents, and c >= b.

So, c - b can be zero or positive.

Wait, but exponents can be zero?

Given that a_i >=0 as per the problem statement.

Wait, a_i >=0, so c - b can be zero or positive.

Wait, but in the exponent world, c - b could be interpreted differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of exponents.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider that for a given c, I need to count the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

Given that a <= b <= c, and a + b > c.

I can iterate over b from 1 to c, and for each b, find the smallest a such that a > c - b.

Since a <= b, and a > c - b.

So, a > c - b and a <= b.

Thus, for each b, the number of valid a is the number of a in the range (c - b, b].

If I sort the exponents, I can use two pointers to efficiently count these.

Let me try to outline this algorithm step by step.

Algorithm:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and the list a of n integers.

b. Sort a in non-decreasing order.

c. Initialize ans = 0.

d. For each c from 2 to n-1:

i. For each b from c-1 downto 1:

- Find the smallest a such that a > c - b.

- Since a <= b, find the number of a in the sorted list that satisfy a > c - b and a <= b.

- Add this count to ans.

But this seems too slow for n=3*10^5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each c, I can fix c and find all pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

Given that a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

I can iterate over c from n-1 downto 2, and for each c, find the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

To optimize this, I can use two pointers.

First, sort the exponents a_i.

Then, for each c from n-1 downto 2, set left = 0 and right = c - 1.

Initialize a counter for the current c.

While left < right:

- If a[left] + a[right] > a[c], then all pairs from left to right-1 with right are valid.

- Add (right - left) to the counter.

- Decrement right.

- Else, increment left.

But wait, this seems similar to the two-sum problem.

However, in this case, a[left] + a[right] > a[c], and I need to count the number of such pairs.

Also, since a <= b <= c, I need to ensure that a <= b.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the two-pointer approach to account for a <= b.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over b from 0 to c-1, and for each b, find the smallest a such that a > c - b.

Wait, but c - b could be negative.

Wait, in terms of exponents, c - b is a_i - a_j, which could be negative.

I need to handle that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given c, and b <= c, a needs to be greater than c - b.

But c - b could be negative, so a > max(0, c - b).

Since a <= b, I can find the number of a in the range (max(0, c - b), b].

If I sort the a_i in non-decreasing order, I can use binary search to find the number of a > max(0, c - b) and a <= b for each b.

This way, for each c, I can iterate over b from 0 to c-1, and for each b, perform a binary search to count the number of a that satisfy a > c - b and a <= b.

This should be efficient enough, as it's O(n^2 log n), but with n=3*10^5, it's still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider frequency counting.

Since a_i can be up to n, which is 3*10^5, I can create a frequency array freq[0 to n].

For each a_i, increment freq[a_i].

Then, for each possible c (from 0 to n), iterate through possible b (from 0 to c), and find the number of a where a > c - b and a <= b.

This seems similar to the previous approach but with frequency counting, which might be faster.

Wait, but c - b could be negative, so a > max(0, c - b).

So, for each c and b, the number of a is freq[ max(0, c - b) +1 to b ].

I can precompute prefix sums to quickly compute the number of a in a range.

Let me try to outline this.

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and a[1 to n].

b. Create freq[0 to n], initialize to 0.

c. For each a_i, freq[a_i] +=1.

d. Create prefix[0 to n], where prefix[k] = sum(freq[0 to k]).

e. Initialize ans =0.

f. For each c from 0 to n:

- For each b from 0 to c:

- lower = max(0, c - b +1)

- upper = b

- if lower <= upper:

- count = prefix[upper] - prefix[lower -1]

- ans += count

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=3*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that since all lengths are powers of two, perhaps there is a mathematical formula to directly compute the number of valid triplets.

Let me consider that for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

This can be rewritten as 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Divide both sides by 2^a: 1 + 2^{b-a} > 2^{c-a}.

Now, since a <= b <= c, b - a >=0 and c - a >=0.

So, 1 + 2^{b-a} > 2^{c-a}.

This might not directly help, but perhaps I can think in terms of inequalities.

Alternatively, consider that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to 2^a + 2^b - 2^c >0.

But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can group the sticks by their lengths and use combinatorics.

Let me think about the frequency of each length.

Suppose I have frequencies freq[k] for k from 0 to n, where freq[k] is the number of sticks with length 2^k.

I need to count the number of triplets (i,j,k) where i < j < k, and 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can iterate over the largest stick and count the number of pairs of smaller sticks that sum to greater than the largest stick.

Wait, but this is similar to what I did earlier.

Let me consider that for each possible c (largest stick), I can count the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b <= c and a + b > c.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over c, and for each c, iterate over b from 0 to c, and for each b, find the number of a where a > c - b and a <= b.

Then, sum over all c and b.

But this seems too slow for n=3*10^5.

Wait, perhaps I can optimize it by precomputing prefix sums.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order.

Then, for each c from n-1 downto 2, set b from c-1 downto 1.

For each b, find the smallest a such that a > c - b.

Since a <= b, I can use binary search to find the number of a in the sorted list that satisfy a > c - b and a <= b.

But again, this seems too slow for n=3*10^5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a <= b <= c, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is equivalent to a + b > c in logarithmic scale.

Wait, but exponents are integers, so perhaps I can treat them as integers.

Wait, but 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is not exactly the same as a + b > c.

Wait, 2^a * 2^b = 2^{a+b}, but 2^a + 2^b is not equal to 2^{a+b}.

So, that doesn't help.

Let me consider that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

If a < c and b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c, which is not greater than 2^c.

So, in this case, a or b must be equal to c for the sum to be greater than 2^c.

Wait, but in the earlier example, when a=1, b=2, c=2: 2 + 4 =6 >4, which holds.

When a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 =4 >4, which does not hold.

When a=2, b=2, c=2:4 +4=8>4, which holds.

So, it seems that when b == c, and a > c - b, which in this case a > 0.

Wait, but c - b =0 when b=c.

So, a >0.

In the earlier example, a=1 >0, which holds.

But in a=1, b=1, c=2: a=1 > c - b =1 -1=0, which holds, but 2 +2=4 >4 does not hold.

Wait, so my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when b == c, then a must be greater than c - b.

Wait, but in this case, c - b =0, so a >0.

But in the earlier example, a=1 >0, but 2 +2=4 >4 does not hold.

Wait, but according to the inequality, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, which is 2 +2=4 >4, which is false.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when b == c, a must be greater than c - b.

Wait, but c - b =0, so a >0.

But in this case, a=1 >0, but it doesn't satisfy the inequality.

So, perhaps I need a stricter condition.

Wait, perhaps a must be greater than c - b.

In this case, c - b =0, so a >0.

But a=1 >0 holds, but the inequality doesn't hold.

So, perhaps I need a >= c - b +1.

In this case, c - b =0, so a >=1, which is a=1 holds, but still, the inequality doesn't hold.

Wait, but in reality, when a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 +2=4 >4 does not hold.

But when a=1, b=2, c=2:2 +4=6 >4 holds.

So, perhaps there's a different condition.

Wait, perhaps when b == c, and a > c - b.

Wait, c - b =0, so a >0.

But in the first case, a=1 >0 holds, but in the second case, a=1 >0 holds.

Wait, but in one case it holds and in the other it doesn't.

So, perhaps this condition is necessary but not sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for b == c, a must be greater than c - b.

But in the case where b == c, c - b =0, so a >0.

But in the earlier example, a=1 >0, but 2 +2=4 >4 does not hold.

Wait, but 2 +4=6 >4 holds.

So, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, perhaps when b == c, a must be greater than c - b.

But in the first case, a=1 >0 holds, but it doesn't hold for a=1, b=1, c=2.

Wait, perhaps a must be greater than c - b, and a >= some value.

I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I group the sticks by their lengths.

Let me consider that for three sticks with exponents a <= b <= c, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c holds.

I can iterate over all possible c, and for each c, iterate over b <= c, and for each b, find the number of a <= b such that a > c - b.

Wait, but c - b could be negative.

So, a > max(0, c - b).

Also, a <= b.

So, for each c and b, the number of a in (max(0, c - b), b].

If I precompute prefix sums of frequencies, I can compute this quickly.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Algorithm:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and a[1 to n].

b. Create freq[0 to n], initialize to 0.

c. For each a_i, freq[a_i] +=1.

d. Create prefix[0 to n], where prefix[k] = sum(freq[0 to k]).

e. Initialize ans =0.

f. For each c from 0 to n:

- For each b from 0 to c:

- lower = max(0, c - b +1)

- upper = b

- if lower <= upper:

- count = prefix[upper] - prefix[lower -1]

- ans += count

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need to optimize it.

Let me consider that for b == c, a must be greater than c - b.

Since c - b =0, a >0.

So, for b == c, the number of a where a >0 and a <= b is prefix[b] - prefix[0].

Similarly, for b < c, a must be greater than c - b and a <= b.

So, for b < c, lower = c - b +1, upper = b.

count = prefix[b] - prefix[lower -1]

But to optimize, perhaps I can iterate over c, and sum over b from 0 to c of (prefix[b] - prefix[lower -1]).

But I need to find a way to compute this without iterating over each b for each c.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b and c such that b <= c, and a > c - b and a <= b.

Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over a, b, c such that a <= b <= c and a > c - b.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that a > c - b is equivalent to a + b > c.

Yes, that's the same as a + b > c.

So, in terms of exponents, a + b > c.

Given that a <= b <= c, and a + b > c.

So, I need to count the number of triplets where a <= b <= c and a + b >
