Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. I need to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n, made from the first k lowercase English letters, are subsequences of s. And I have to make sure that s is as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities, any of them is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence because you can delete "b" and "d" to get it.

Okay, so for each test case, I have values of n and k. Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

1 2

2 1

2 2

2 3

Output:

ab

aa

baab

abcbac

Looking at the first test case:

n=1, k=2

Possible strings of length 1 from the first 2 letters (a,b):

a, b

The output is "ab". Both a and b are subsequences of "ab", which is correct.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Possible strings: "aa"

Output: "aa". "aa" is a subsequence of itself.

Third test case:

n=2, k=2

Possible strings: aa, ab, ba, bb

Output: "baab"

Let's verify:

- aa: positions 1 and 3: b(a)ab

- ab: positions 1 and 4: ba(a)b

- ba: positions 2 and 3: b(a)ab

- bb: positions 2 and 4: ba(a)b

Wait, actually, for bb, it's b(a)ab, but a is not b. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in "baab":

- aa: positions 2 and 4: ba(a)b

- ab: positions 1 and 4: ba(a)b

- ba: positions 1 and 3: b(a)ab

- bb: positions 1 and 4: b(a)b, but a is not b. So, is "bb" really a subsequence here? Oh, maybe not directly. Maybe in this specific output, "bb" is not correctly represented. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the note, it explains:

- aa: b(a)a(b)

- ab: b(a)a(b)

- ba: b(a)a(b)

- bb: b(a)a(b)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's look back at the note:

For the third test case, n=2, k=2:

- aa: b a a b

- ab: b a a b

- ba: b a a b

- bb: b a a b

Wait, in the note, it shows different positions. Maybe I need to look carefully.

Wait, in the note:

- aa: b a a b, using positions 2 and 3: a a

- ab: b a a b, using positions 1 and 4: b a b

Wait, but b is not a, so maybe it's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach to verify subsequences.

Let me think differently. I need to make sure that every possible combination of length n from the first k letters is a subsequence of s.

One way to approach this is to construct s in such a way that it includes all possible combinations in a minimal form. Perhaps using some kind of de Bruijn sequence, which is a sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a certain length exactly once.

But de Bruijn sequences are typically for substrings, not subsequences. Hmm, maybe I need to think of something else.

Wait, the problem specifies subsequences, not substrings. So, de Bruijn sequences might not directly apply here.

Let me think about the minimal s that contains all possible combinations as subsequences.

For n=1, k=2:

Possible strings: a, b

So, s just needs to contain both a and b, in any order, since n=1.

Hence, "ab" or "ba" would work.

For n=2, k=2:

Possible strings: aa, ab, ba, bb

I need s such that:

- aa is a subsequence

- ab is a subsequence

- ba is a subsequence

- bb is a subsequence

One way to ensure this is to have all possible pairs in some order.

For example, "baab":

- aa: positions 2 and 4: a a

- ab: positions 1 and 4: b a b (ab)

- ba: positions 1 and 3: b a a b (ba)

- bb: positions 1 and 4: b a a b (b and b)

Wait, but in "baab", for bb, positions 1 and 4: b a a b, so b and b, which is bb.

Similarly, for aa: positions 2 and 4: a and a.

For ab: positions 1 and 4: b and b, but that's bb, not ab. Wait, maybe I need to choose different positions.

Wait, for ab:

- Choose first a (position 2) and then b (position 4): a and b, which is ab.

Similarly, for ba:

- Choose b (position 1) and a (position 3): b and a, which is ba.

So, seems like "baab" correctly contains all the required subsequences.

Okay, so for n=2 and k=2, "baab" works.

Now, for n=2 and k=3:

Possible strings: aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, cc

The sample output is "abcbac".

Let's verify:

- aa: positions 1 and 5: a b c b a c → a and a

- ab: positions 1 and 2: a b

- ac: positions 1 and 6: a c

- ba: positions 2 and 5: b a

- bb: positions 2 and 4: b b

- bc: positions 2 and 6: b c

- ca: positions 5 and ...: a and a, but ca needs c and a, positions 3 and 5: c a

- cb: positions 3 and 4: c b

- cc: positions 3 and 6: c c

So, all are covered in "abcbac".

Now, the problem asks for the minimal length string that satisfies this condition.

I need to find such a string for any given n and k, with n up to 26 and k up to 26.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 676, which is 26*26, so probably all combinations of n and k from 1 to 26.

I need an efficient way to generate s for any n and k.

Let me think about the minimal length of s.

What's the minimal length required?

Well, for n=1, it's just k, since you need to include all k letters at least once.

For n=2, it's more interesting. You need to include all pairs as subsequences.

One way to minimize the length is to maximize the overlap between different pairs.

For example, in "baab":

- It has length 4

- Contains all 4 possible pairs for n=2 and k=2

Is there a shorter string? Let's see:

If I have "baa", length 3:

- aa: positions 2 and 3: a a

- ab: positions 1 and 3: b a → ab

- ba: positions 1 and 2: b a

- bb: positions 1 and 1: b (but you can't choose the same position twice). So, bb is not present.

Hence, "baa" doesn't contain bb as a subsequence.

So, "baab" is necessary here.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" has length 6, and it contains all 9 possible pairs.

Is there a shorter string for this case? Maybe, but it's not necessary for this problem, as long as I find a valid s that is minimal in length.

Now, how to generalize this for any n and k.

One approach is to model this as a graph problem, where each node represents a string of length n-1, and edges represent the addition of a new character.

Wait, that sounds similar to de Bruijn sequences, but again, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings, not subsequences.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that to include all possible sequences of length n as subsequences, I need to ensure that for any sequence of n characters, there exists a way to choose n positions in s such that the characters match the sequence in order.

This seems complex to handle directly.

An alternative approach is to use the greedy algorithm to build s by maximizing the number of covered sequences at each step.

But that might be too slow for n and k up to 26.

Wait, but the constraints are manageable since t is small (≤676), and n and k are small (≤26).

So, perhaps an exponential approach is feasible.

But I need something more efficient.

Let me think about the structure of s.

Suppose I have all possible sequences of length n-1, and I need to connect them in such a way that overlapping sequences are minimized.

Wait, again, this seems similar to de Bruijn sequences, but for subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that to include all sequences of length n, I can repeat the sequence of all possible characters in some order, repeated enough times.

But that seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for the minimal length.

I recall that for strings of length n over k letters, the total number of possible strings is k^n.

So, I need s to contain all k^n possible strings as subsequences.

I need to find the minimal s such that every possible string of length n over k letters is a subsequence of s.

This seems related to the concept of supersequences.

In particular, s should be a universal string for the set of all possible strings of length n over k letters.

I need to find the minimal universal string for these sequences.

I recall that for subsequences, the minimal length can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle or other combinatorial methods.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal length is n + k -1, but that seems too small for some cases.

Wait, no, for n=2 and k=2, n+k-1=3, but we saw that "baa" doesn't work, while "baab" with length 4 does.

So, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Let me consider that to include all possible sequences of length n, I need to have at least n repetitions of each character, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of characters required to cover all possible sequences.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of a de Bruijn sequence for subsequences.

But again, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings.

Wait, maybe there's a generalization for subsequences.

After some research, I find that for subsequences, the minimal length of a string that contains all possible subsequences of length n from a set of k symbols is given by the minimal supersequence for all possible sequences.

This is a well-studied problem in combinatorics and computer science.

In particular, the minimal length is known to be n + k -1, but only when considering distinct subsequences.

Wait, but in our case, subsequences can repeat characters.

Wait, more carefully, for subsequences, the minimal length of a string that contains all possible sequences of length n over k symbols is equal to k + n -1.

But in practice, it might be larger.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for n=1, the minimal s is just the string of all k letters.

For n=2, I need to arrange the letters such that all possible pairs are subsequences.

One way to do this is to take all possible pairs and find a minimal string that covers them.

This sounds like the problem of finding a path in a graph where each edge represents a pair.

Wait, but again, this is similar to de Bruijn sequences for substrings.

Maybe I need to think of a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that to include all possible subsequences of length n, I can arrange the letters in a way that maximizes the number of possible combinations.

Wait, perhaps recursively building s by appending letters in a specific order.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the sample input and output again.

For n=2 and k=2, output is "baab".

For n=2 and k=3, output is "abcbac".

Looking at these, it seems like the strings are constructed by interleaving the letters in a specific pattern.

Perhaps starting with the last letter and then appending the previous letters.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a greedy algorithm where at each step, I append the letter that allows me to cover the most new sequences.

But implementing a greedy algorithm might be too time-consuming for this problem.

Given the constraints, t ≤ 676, and n and k up to 26, I need an efficient way to generate s for each test case.

Perhaps there is a pattern or formula that can generate s directly.

Looking at the sample outputs:

- For n=1, k=2: "ab"

- For n=2, k=1: "aa"

- For n=2, k=2: "baab"

- For n=2, k=3: "abcbac"

It's not immediately obvious what the pattern is.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, s is constructed by taking all possible pairs and arranging them in a specific order.

But that still sounds too vague.

Alternatively, maybe s is constructed by repeating the sequence of k letters n times.

Wait, for n=2 and k=2, "baab" has length 4, which is 2*2.

For n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" has length 6, which is 2*3.

So, perhaps in general, the minimal length is n*k.

But let's check for n=1 and k=2: minimal length should be 2, which is 1*2.

For n=2 and k=1: "aa", length 2, which is 2*1.

For n=2 and k=2: "baab", length 4, which is 2*2.

For n=2 and k=3: "abcbac", length 6, which is 2*3.

So, it seems like the minimal length is n*k.

Is this always true?

Wait, let's consider n=3 and k=2.

Possible strings: aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb

If I take s of length 6: "baabab"

Does it contain all 8 possible strings as subsequences?

- aaa: positions 2,3,4: a,a,a

- aab: positions 2,3,5: a,a,b

- aba: positions 2,4,5: a,b,a

- abb: positions 2,4,6: a,b,b

- baa: positions 1,3,4: b,a,a

- bab: positions 1,4,5: b,a,b

- bba: positions 1,2,5: b,b,a

- bbb: positions 1,4,6: b,b,b

So, "baabab" with length 6 seems to cover all 8 possible strings for n=3 and k=2.

Is 6 the minimal length? Let's see if a shorter string is possible.

Suppose s="baaab":

Length 5.

- aaa: positions 2,3,4: a,a,a

- aab: positions 2,3,5: a,a,b

- aba: positions 2,4,5: a,a,b (not aba)

Wait, positions 1,3,5: b,a,b (bab)

Positions 1,4,5: b,a,b (bab)

Positions 2,4,5: a,a,b (aab)

So, "baaab" doesn't contain "aba" as a subsequence.

Hence, length 6 is necessary in this case.

So, for n=3 and k=2, minimal length is 6, which is n*k=3*2=6.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=2, minimal length is 4=2*2.

For n=2 and k=1, minimal length is 2=2*1.

For n=1 and k=2, minimal length is 2=1*2.

So, it seems like the minimal length is indeed n*k.

Therefore, a straightforward way to construct s is to repeat the sequence of the first k letters n times.

For example:

- n=1, k=2: "ab"

- n=2, k=1: "aa"

- n=2, k=2: "abab"

- n=2, k=3: "abcabc"

But in the sample input, for n=2 and k=2, the output is "baab", which is different from "abab".

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, the output is "abcbac", which is different from "abcabc".

So, perhaps the order matters in minimizing the length.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the minimal length is n*k, and any arrangement of the first k letters repeated n times should work.

But in the sample input, for n=2 and k=2, "baab" is used instead of "abab".

Let me check if "abab" works for n=2 and k=2.

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 3: a and a

- ab: positions 1 and 2: a and b

- ba: positions 2 and 4: b and a

- bb: positions 3 and 4: a and b (not bb)

Wait, "abab" does not contain "bb" as a subsequence because there are no two 'b's in sequence.

Hence, "abab" is invalid for n=2 and k=2.

Therefore, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, simply repeating the sequence of k letters n times does not guarantee that all possible sequences are subsequences.

Hence, I need a different approach.

Let me think about how to construct s to include all possible sequences of length n over k letters.

One way is to ensure that for every possible sequence of n-1 characters, it is followed by all possible k characters in some order.

This is similar to how de Bruijn sequences are constructed, but again, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings, not subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the sequences in a different way.

Let me consider that to include all possible sequences of length n, I need to have all possible sequences of length n-1, each followed by all possible k characters.

This suggests that the minimal length is the sum over all possible sequences of length n-1, each contributing an additional character.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have s for n-1 and k, and I want to extend it to n.

I need to append characters in such a way that all new sequences of length n are covered.

This sounds complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal length is k^n + n -1 or something similar.

Wait, for n=1, k=2: minimal length is 2, which is k.

For n=2, k=2: minimal length is 4, which is n*k.

For n=3, k=2: minimal length is 6, which is n*k.

For n=2, k=3: minimal length is 6, which is n*k.

Wait, but for n=2, k=1: minimal length is 2, which is n*k.

So, perhaps in general, the minimal length is n*k.

But earlier, I saw that for n=2 and k=2, "abab" doesn't work, while "baab" does.

Wait, maybe "abab" can be adjusted.

Let me try "abba":

- aa: positions 1 and 3: a and b (not aa)

- ab: positions 1 and 2: a and b

- ba: positions 2 and 4: b and a

- bb: positions 3 and 4: b and a (not bb)

So, "abba" doesn't contain "aa" and "bb" as subsequences.

Hence, "abba" is invalid.

What about "aabb"?

- aa: positions 1 and 2: a and a

- ab: positions 1 and 3: a and b

- ba: positions 2 and 3: a and b (not ba)

- bb: positions 3 and 4: b and b

So, "aabb" doesn't contain "ba" as a subsequence.

Hence, "aabb" is invalid.

What about "baab"?

- aa: positions 2 and 4: a and a

- ab: positions 1 and 4: b and a (not ab)

- ba: positions 1 and 3: b and a

- bb: positions 1 and 4: b and a (not bb)

Wait, similar to earlier, "baab" seems to work, but in my earlier verification, I thought it covered all, but now I see that for ab, it's positions 1 and 4: b and a, which is ba, not ab.

Wait, no, for ab, you can choose positions 2 and 4: a and b.

So, aa: positions 2 and 4: a and a

ab: positions 2 and 4: a and b

ba: positions 1 and 3: b and a

bb: positions 1 and 4: b and b

Yes, "baab" correctly contains all required subsequences.

So, perhaps repeating the sequence of k letters in a specific order works.

Wait, but in the earlier case of n=2 and k=3, the output is "abcbac".

Let me see the length: 6, which is n*k=2*3=6.

So, perhaps in general, constructing s by repeating the sequence of k letters n times in a specific order works.

But what is that specific order?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal length is indeed n*k, and any sequence that includes all possible sequences of length n as subsequences can be constructed by repeating the k letters n times in any order.

But in practice, some orders work and others don't, as seen in the earlier examples.

Hence, perhaps there is a systematic way to arrange the letters to ensure all sequences are covered.

Let me consider that for n=2 and k=2, "baab" works.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" works.

Is there a pattern here?

In "baab", it starts with 'b', then 'a', then 'a', then 'b'.

In "abcbac", it starts with 'a', then 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'c'.

It seems like it's interleaving the letters in a certain way to cover all pairs.

Perhaps a general approach is to arrange the letters in a way that each new letter is chosen to cover as many new pairs as possible.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm.

But implementing a greedy algorithm might be too time-consuming, especially for n and k up to 26.

Given the constraints, t ≤ 676, and n and k ≤ 26, perhaps precomputing all possible s for each n and k is feasible.

But that seems inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical formula or a known pattern for constructing such strings.

After some research, I find that the minimal length of a string that contains all possible subsequences of length n over k symbols is indeed n*k.

Moreover, such strings can be constructed using a method similar to the de Bruijn sequence for subsequences.

In particular, one can arrange the k letters in a specific order, repeating each letter n times, but ensuring that all possible combinations are covered.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, arranging the letters in a way that maximizes the overlap of subsequences.

But I need a concrete method to generate s.

Let me consider that for n=2 and k=2, "baab" works.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, "abcbac" works.

Looking at these, perhaps a way to construct s is to take all possible sequences of length n-1, and for each, append all possible letters.

But again, this is similar to the de Bruijn sequence approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that to include all possible sequences of length n, I need to have s such that every possible combination of n positions covers one of the k^n sequences.

This seems too abstract.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can accept that the minimal length is n*k and construct s by repeating the sequence of k letters n times in any order.

For example, for n=2 and k=2: "baab" or "abba" (though "abba" doesn't work, as seen earlier).

Wait, but "abba" doesn't work, so just repeating k letters n times doesn't guarantee correctness.

Hence, I need a systematic way to construct s.

Perhaps I can use a backtracking approach to build s, ensuring that all possible sequences are covered.

But with n and k up to 26, this might be too slow.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that constructing s in this way is acceptable, even if it's not the absolute minimal length, as long as it's correct.

But the problem specifies to print the string with the smallest length, so I need to aim for n*k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal length is n*k and construct s by arranging the letters in a specific pattern that ensures all sequences are covered.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange s such that every n characters contain all possible combinations.

But I'm still not sure.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that for n=1, s is just the sequence of k letters.

For n=2, s is a sequence of k letters repeated twice in a specific order that covers all pairs.

Similarly, for higher n, s is the sequence of k letters repeated n times in a specific order.

But again, without a clear pattern, this is difficult.

Given that, perhaps the provided program is correct.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)

So, for each test case, it takes the first k letters of the alphabet and repeats them n times.

For example, for n=2 and k=2:

'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

But earlier, we saw that 'abab' doesn't work for n=2 and k=2.

Hence, the provided program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
