Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of a sequence of numbers is. The bitwise OR operation takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3. So, if I have a sequence like [1, 2, 4], their bitwise OR would be 7 because 1 is 001, 2 is 010, and 4 is 100; OR'ing them gives 111, which is 7.

Now, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of this OR result. So, in the previous example, 7 in binary is 111, which has three 1s. That seems good.

Given that, I need to construct a sequence of n numbers that add up to k and whose bitwise OR has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I want the OR to have as many bits set to 1 as possible. To achieve that, I need to make sure that for each bit position, at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

Wait, no. Actually, the OR operation sets a bit to 1 if any of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1. So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bit positions as possible where at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

So, the goal is to have as many bit positions "covered" by at least one number having that bit set.

Given that, one way to maximize this is to have each number in the sequence contribute as many unique 1 bits as possible.

But I also have to ensure that the sum of all these numbers is exactly k.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 1, k = 5

So, sequence has only one number, which is 5. The OR is just 5, which in binary is 101, having two 1s. That's the only possibility, so it's straightforward.

Second example:

n = 2, k = 3

They provide the sequence [1, 2], which sums to 3, and the OR is 1 | 2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, having two 1s. They mention this is the maximum possible.

Is there another sequence that could give a higher number of 1s in the OR? Let's see:

- [0, 3]: OR is 0 | 3 = 3, which is 11 in binary, still two 1s.

- [1, 2]: same as above.

- [3, 0]: same as above.

- [1, 1, 1]: but n=2, so can't have three numbers.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is two.

Another example:

n = 2, k = 5

They give [5, 0], which sums to 5, and OR is 5 | 0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

Is there a better sequence? Let's see:

- [4,1]: OR is 4 | 1 = 5, which is 101, two 1s.

- [3,2]: OR is 3 | 2 = 3 | 2 = 3, which is 11, two 1s.

- [5,0]: as given, same as above.

So, again, the maximum is two 1s.

Wait, but in the note, they mention that in the fourth test case, they achieve five 1s in the OR. So, it's possible to have more 1s in some cases.

Let's look at the fourth example:

n = 6, k = 51

They provide [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51, and the OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = let's calculate that.

First, 3 is 00003 in binary, which is 000011.

1 is 00001, which is 000001.

1 is same as above.

32 is 100000.

2 is 000010.

12 is 001100.

Now, OR'ing them all: starting with 000011 | 000001 = 000011, then | 000001 = 000011, then | 100000 = 100011, then | 000010 = 100011, then | 001100 = 101111.

So, 101111 in binary is 47, which has five 1s.

They mention this is the maximum possible.

So, in this case, with n=6 and k=51, it's possible to have an OR with five 1s.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such sequences for given n and k, maximizing the number of 1s in the OR.

Let me think about the properties of the OR operation.

The OR of a set of numbers will have a bit set to 1 if at least one number in the set has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bit positions as possible where at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

In other words, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible with the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, one approach could be to distribute the 1s across different bit positions in the numbers.

But I also need to ensure that the sum of the numbers is exactly k.

This seems like a balancing act: I need to spread out the 1s across different bit positions while making sure the sum is k.

Let me consider the binary representation of k.

Suppose I have k in binary, say, k = 51 is 110011 in binary.

I need to distribute the 1s in the binary representation across the n numbers in such a way that as many bit positions are covered as possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers, and I want their OR to have as many 1s as possible.

Each number can contribute some 1s to the OR.

To maximize the total number of 1s in the OR, I should try to have each number contribute unique 1s in different bit positions.

In other words, I should try to set different bits in different numbers.

But there's a constraint that the sum of the numbers is k.

So, I need to set bits in such a way that their sum is k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider an approach where I try to set the lowest possible bits in each number, ensuring that their OR covers as many bits as possible.

Wait, but setting lower bits in more numbers might not allow me to reach the sum k, especially if k is large and n is small.

Alternatively, maybe I can start by setting the highest bits in some numbers and then fill in the lower bits in others.

I need a systematic way to approach this.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Identify the highest bit in k, say, bit position m (where m is the position of the highest 1 in k's binary representation).

2. To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bit positions as possible set to 1 in the OR.

3. To do that, I can try to assign numbers such that each number covers some unique bit positions, while ensuring the sum is k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of 1s in the OR.

The maximum number of 1s in the OR is the total number of bit positions that can be set to 1 in the OR, which is up to the highest bit in k.

For example, if k is 51, which is 110011 in binary (assuming 6-bit representation), the highest bit is the 5th bit (from the right, starting at 0).

So, the maximum number of 1s in the OR could be up to 6, but depending on n and k, it might not be achievable.

Wait, in the fourth example, they achieved five 1s in the OR for k=51, which is 110011 in binary, which has four 1s. Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1s, but their OR had five 1s. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in their sequence [3,1,1,32,2,12], the OR is 101111, which is 47, which has five 1s.

But 51 in binary is 110011, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

Wait, but 110011 is 51, which is indeed 1 in the 0th position, 1 in the 1st, 0 in the 2nd, 0 in the 3rd, 1 in the 4th, and 1 in the 5th position.

So, it has 1s in positions 0,1,4,5, which is four 1s.

But their OR is 101111, which is positions 0,1,2,3,5, which is five 1s.

So, how is that possible?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the OR can have more 1s than k itself, because the OR is of the numbers in the sequence, and those numbers can have 1s in positions that k doesn't have, as long as their sum is k.

Wait, but all numbers are non-negative integers, and their sum is k.

So, is it possible for the OR to have 1s in positions that k doesn't have?

Wait, no, because if a bit is set in any number in the sequence, it will be set in the OR, but the sum of the numbers is k.

Wait, but k is the sum, so if a bit is set in the OR, it doesn't necessarily mean that that bit is set in k, but the sum of the numbers must equal k.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of binary representations and how they contribute to the sum.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers, and I want their sum to be k and their OR to have as many 1s as possible.

One way to maximize the number of 1s in the OR is to have each number contribute a unique set of bits, so that the OR has all those bits set.

But, since the numbers sum to k, I need to distribute the bits across the numbers in such a way that their sum is k.

This sounds like I need to partition k into n parts, where each part has some bits set, and the OR of all parts has as many bits set as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as trying to maximize the number of bits that are set in at least one of the numbers.

So, perhaps I should try to spread the bits as much as possible across the numbers.

Wait, but in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51, and the OR is 101111, which is 47, having five 1s.

But 51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1s, but the OR has five 1s.

Wait, but 51 is 110011, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

But their OR is 101111, which is 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47.

So, how is the OR 47 when k is 51?

Wait, but the OR is of the numbers in the sequence, not of k itself.

So, the OR is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in the sequence.

So, even if k is 51, which is 110011, the sequence can have numbers with bits set in positions that are not set in k, as long as their sum is k.

Wait, but all numbers are non-negative integers summing to k.

So, their sum is k, which means that the bits they have set must combine to give k.

Wait, but in binary, when you sum numbers, carries can occur, so it's not just about the bits being set in the individual numbers.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider another approach.

Let me consider that the OR of the numbers is the bitwise OR, meaning that a bit is set in the OR if it's set in at least one of the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bits as possible set in at least one of the numbers.

Given that, perhaps I should try to have each number set a unique bit, if possible.

But, depending on n and k, this might not be feasible.

For example, if n is larger than the number of bits in k, I might need to have some numbers set higher bits to make the sum k.

Wait, but k can be up to 1e9, which is 30 bits.

So, for n up to 2e5, which is much larger than 30, I might have to deal with numbers that are zero or have higher bits set.

Wait, but numbers are non-negative, so they can have higher bits set as long as their sum is k.

But, if I have numbers with higher bits set, their OR will have those higher bits set, which might not be necessary for maximizing the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, actually, it is necessary if those higher bits aren't set in k.

Wait, but k is the sum, so if I have numbers with higher bits set, their sum must still be k.

Wait, but in binary addition, higher bits can be generated through carries.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the OR of the numbers is the bitwise OR, and I need to maximize the number of 1s in that OR.

So, I need to maximize the number of bit positions where at least one number has that bit set to 1.

Given that, perhaps I should try to have each number set a unique subset of bits.

But, again, with the sum constraint, it's tricky.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the OR to be some value with a certain number of 1s in its binary representation.

Then, I need to find if it's possible to have n numbers summing to k, whose OR is that value.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to find the maximum possible number of 1s such that there exists a sequence of n numbers summing to k with their OR equal to a value having that many 1s.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of bitmasks.

Let me consider that the OR of the numbers is a bitmask where each bit indicates whether at least one number has that bit set.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to maximize the number of bits that are set in at least one number.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the bit positions, trying to set as many unique bits as possible across the n numbers, while ensuring their sum is k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider starting with n numbers all set to zero, and then distribute the bits to set them in such a way as to maximize the number of unique bits set across all numbers.

But I also need to make sure that their sum is k.

This seems challenging.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program defines a function func_1(n, k):

- It initializes a list nums of n zeros.

- Sets nums[0] to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

- Subtracts nums[0] from k.

- Then, for each of the remaining n-1 numbers, sets them to the minimum of (nums[0] + 1) and the remaining k, and subtracts that from k.

- Finally, adds the remaining k to nums[0].

Wait, this seems a bit arbitrary.

Let me try to understand what it's doing.

First, it sets nums[0] to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.

So, k.bit_length() is the number of bits required to represent k in binary.

For example, if k=5, which is 101 in binary, k.bit_length() is 3.

So, 1 << (3 - 1) - 1 = 1 << 2 - 1 = 1 << 1 = 2, minus 1 is 1.

So, nums[0] = 1.

Then, k -= nums[0], so k = 5 - 1 = 4.

Then, for i in range(1, n):

nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k) = min(1 + 1, 4) = min(2,4) = 2

k -= nums[i] = 4 - 2 = 2

Then, since n=2, it's only one iteration.

Finally, nums[0] += k, so nums[0] = 1 + 2 = 3

So, the sequence is [3,2]

Wait, but in the second example, they have [1,2], but according to this, it's [3,2]

Does [3,2] satisfy the conditions?

Sum: 3 + 2 = 5, which matches k=5.

OR: 3 | 2 = 3 | 2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Same as [1,2], which also gives OR=3, two 1s.

So, both sequences are valid.

Hence, the program seems to be producing a correct sequence.

Another example:

n=2, k=5

According to the program:

nums = [0,0]

nums[0] = (1 << 3 - 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3

k -= 3, so k=2

nums[1] = min(3 + 1, 2) = min(4,2) = 2

k -= 2, so k=0

Then nums[0] += 0, remains 3

So, sequence is [3,2], which sums to 5, OR is 3 | 2 = 3, which is 11, two 1s.

But in the sample output, it's [5,0], which also sums to 5, OR is 5 | 0 = 5, which is 101, also two 1s.

So, both are valid.

Hence, the program seems correct for this case.

Let me check the fourth example:

n=6, k=51

According to the program:

nums[0] = (1 << 51.bit_length() - 1) - 1

51 in binary is 110011, which has 6 bits, so bit_length is 6.

So, 1 << (6 - 1) - 1 = 1 << 5 - 1 = 1 << 4 = 16, minus 1 is 15.

So, nums[0] = 15

k -= 15, so k=51-15=36

Then, for i=1 to 5:

nums[i] = min(15 + 1, 36) = min(16,36) = 16

k -= 16, so k=36-16=20

Then next iteration:

nums[2] = min(15 + 1, 20) = min(16,20) = 16

k -= 16, so k=4

Then nums[3] = min(15 + 1, 4) = min(16,4) = 4

k -= 4, so k=0

Then, since n=6, we have two more numbers, but k=0, so they remain 0.

Finally, nums[0] += 0, remains 15.

So, the sequence is [15,16,16,4,0,0]

Sum: 15 + 16 + 16 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 51, which matches k=51.

OR: 15 | 16 | 16 | 4 | 0 | 0 = 15 is 1111, 16 is 10000, 4 is 00100.

OR'ing them: 15 | 16 = 1111 | 10000 = 11111, which is 31, which has five 1s.

Which matches the sample output's OR of 101111, which also has five 1s.

Hence, the program seems to be producing a correct sequence.

So, how does this approach work?

It seems to set the first number to (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1, which is essentially the maximum number less than or equal to k with the highest bit set to 1.

Then, it sets the remaining numbers to the minimum of (nums[0] + 1) and the remaining k.

Finally, it adds any remaining k to the first number.

This seems to ensure that the first number is as large as possible without exceeding k, and the remaining numbers are set to nums[0] + 1 if possible, or to the remaining k if smaller.

This way, it tries to set as many bits as possible in the first number, and then in the other numbers, potentially covering more bits.

In the end, the OR will have the bits set in the first number plus any additional bits set in the other numbers.

This seems to be a valid approach to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a list of `n` zeros which will hold our sequence.
2. **Set the First Element**: Set the first element of the sequence to the largest possible value that is less than or equal to `k` and has the highest bit set to 1. This is calculated as `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`.
3. **Distribute Remaining Sum**: Distribute the remaining sum (`k - nums[0]`) among the remaining `n-1` elements. Each of these elements is set to the minimum of `(nums[0] + 1)` and the remaining sum.
4. **Adjust
