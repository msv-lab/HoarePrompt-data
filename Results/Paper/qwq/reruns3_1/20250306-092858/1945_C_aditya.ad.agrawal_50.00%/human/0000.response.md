Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left side (0) or the right side (1). This preference is given in a sequence a1 to an, where 0 means left and 1 means right.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. When the road is built, all houses to the left of it are on the left side, and all houses to the right are on the right side.

The goal is to choose the position for the road such that:

1. At least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side.

2. The road is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

And if there are multiple positions that satisfy these conditions, we should choose the one with the smallest position number.

First, I need to understand what it means for at least half of the residents on each side to be satisfied.

Let's say the road is built after house i. Then:

- Houses 1 to i are on the left side.

- Houses i+1 to n are on the right side.

For the left side (houses 1 to i):

- The number of residents who want to be on the left side (0) should be at least ceil(i/2).

Similarly, for the right side (houses i+1 to n):

- The number of residents who want to be on the right side (1) should be at least ceil((n-i)/2).

Ceil means rounding up to the nearest integer.

So, for a given i, we need to check:

- In the first i houses, the count of 0's is >= ceil(i/2)

- In the last n-i houses, the count of 1's is >= ceil((n-i)/2)

And among all i that satisfy these conditions, we need to choose the one where |i - n/2| is minimized.

If there are multiple such i with the same |i - n/2|, we choose the smallest i.

The problem also mentions that the answer always exists, which is good to know.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 2*10^4 and n up to 3*10^5, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, we need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

First, I need to process each test case independently.

For each test case:

- Read n and the string of 0's and 1's.

I need to consider all possible positions for the road: from 0 to n (i.e., before the first house, between houses, or after the last house).

For each possible position i (0 to n):

- Left side: houses 1 to i

- Right side: houses i+1 to n

For i=0:

- Left side: no houses

- Right side: all houses

For i=n:

- Left side: all houses

- Right side: no houses

We need to handle cases where one side has no houses, meaning that side automatically satisfies the condition since there are no residents to be dissatisfied.

Wait, but if one side has no houses, then there are no residents on that side, so the condition is trivially satisfied.

So, for i=0:

- Right side: n houses, need at least ceil(n/2) 1's

- Left side: 0 houses, which is fine

Similarly, for i=n:

- Left side: n houses, need at least ceil(n/2) 0's

- Right side: 0 houses, which is fine

Now, to find the position i that minimizes |i - n/2|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

I need to iterate through all possible i and check the conditions.

But iterating through all i from 0 to n for each test case would be too slow because t*n can be up to 2*10^4 * 3*10^5 = 6*10^9 operations, which is too much.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me think about precomputing the counts of 0's and 1's up to each position.

Let's define:

- prefix_z[i]: number of 0's in houses 1 to i

- prefix_o[i]: number of 1's in houses 1 to i

Then, for a given i:

- Left side (houses 1 to i):

- Number of 0's: prefix_z[i]

- Number of houses: i

- So, condition: prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Right side (houses i+1 to n):

- Number of 1's: prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i]

- Number of houses: n - i

- So, condition: (prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i]) >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

I need both these conditions to be true.

Now, to minimize |i - n/2|, I need to find the i where both conditions hold, and among such i's, choose the one with the smallest |i - n/2|, and if there are multiple, the smallest i.

To optimize this, I need a way to find the best i without checking all possible i's.

Let me consider that i can range from 0 to n.

I need to find the i where both conditions hold and |i - n/2| is minimized.

One way is to iterate through all possible i and keep track of the one with the smallest |i - n/2| where both conditions hold.

But given the constraints, this might be too slow if done naively.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Let me consider that as i increases, the left side grows and the right side shrinks.

I can precompute the prefix sums for 0's and 1's.

Let's say I precompute:

prefix_z = [0] * (n+1)

prefix_o = [0] * (n+1)

for j from 1 to n:

prefix_z[j] = prefix_z[j-1] + (1 if a[j-1] == '0' else 0)

prefix_o[j] = prefix_o[j-1] + (1 if a[j-1] == '1' else 0)

Then, for each i from 0 to n:

left_z = prefix_z[i]

left_n = i

right_o = prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i]

right_n = n - i

Check:

left_z >= ceil(left_n / 2)

right_o >= ceil(right_n / 2)

If both hold, calculate |i - n/2| and keep track of the minimum.

To optimize, maybe I can find the range of i where both conditions hold and then find the i within that range that minimizes |i - n/2|.

Let me think about how to find the range of i where both conditions hold.

First, find the range of i where left_z >= ceil(left_n / 2)

Second, find the range of i where right_o >= ceil(right_n / 2)

Then, find the intersection of these two ranges.

Finally, among the i in the intersection, find the one with the smallest |i - n/2|.

If multiple, choose the smallest i.

This seems promising.

Let me first find the range for left_z >= ceil(left_n / 2)

Let me find the smallest i such that prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

And the largest i such that prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly, for the right side:

Find the smallest i such that prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

And the largest i such that prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Then, find the intersection of these ranges.

Wait, actually, for the right side, as i increases, the right side shrinks.

I need to think carefully.

Let me define:

For the left side:

- Find the smallest i such that prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Find the largest i such that prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

For the right side:

- Find the smallest i such that prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

- Find the largest i such that prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Then, the range where both conditions hold is the intersection of these two ranges.

Once I have the intersection range, I can find the i within this range that minimizes |i - n/2|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

This seems efficient because finding the ranges can be done in O(n) time per test case.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, compute prefix_z and prefix_o.

Then, find the smallest i where prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly, find the largest i where prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly, for the right side:

Find the smallest i where prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Find the largest i where prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Then, find the intersection of these ranges.

If the intersection is non-empty, find the i within this range that minimizes |i - n/2|, and if multiple, choose the smallest i.

Otherwise, there is no valid i, but the problem says that a solution always exists, so it should be non-empty.

Wait, but I need to make sure that there is at least one i where both conditions hold.

Given that, I can proceed.

Let me try to implement this logic.

But I need to handle the cases where left_n or right_n is 0.

For example, if i=0:

left_n=0, which is fine (no residents on left side)

right_n=n, need at least ceil(n / 2) ones on the right side.

Similarly, if i=n:

left_n=n, need at least ceil(n / 2) zeros on the left side

right_n=0, which is fine.

So, I need to handle i from 0 to n inclusive.

Now, to find the smallest i where prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

I can iterate from i=0 to i=n and find the smallest i where this holds.

Similarly, find the largest i where this holds.

Similarly, for the right side, find the smallest and largest i where prefix_o[n] - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Then, find the intersection of these two ranges.

Then, among the i in the intersection, find the one with the smallest |i - n/2|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

This seems correct.

Let me try to verify this with the first example.

Example 1:

n=3

a="101"

So, arr=[1,0,1]

Compute prefix_z and prefix_o:

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=0 (a[0]=1)

prefix_z[2]=1 (a[0]=1, a[1]=0)

prefix_z[3]=1 (a[0]=1, a[1]=0, a[2]=1)

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=1

prefix_o[2]=1

prefix_o[3]=2

Now, for each i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

left_n=0, which is fine

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones on the right: prefix_o[3] - prefix_o[0]=2 >=2, which holds.

So, i=0 is valid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero on the left: prefix_z[1]=0 <1, does not hold.

Right side: right_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 one: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[1]=2-1=1 >=1, holds.

But left side does not hold, so i=1 is invalid.

i=2:

left_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 zero on the left: prefix_z[2]=1 >=1, holds.

Right side: right_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 one: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[2]=2-1=1 >=1, holds.

So, i=2 is valid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros on the left: prefix_z[3]=1 <2, does not hold.

Right side: right_n=0, which is fine.

But left side does not hold, so i=3 is invalid.

So, valid i's are 0 and 2.

Now, find the one with the smallest |i - n/2|.

n=3, n/2=1.5

|0 - 1.5|=1.5

|2 - 1.5|=0.5

So, i=2 has the smallest |i - n/2|=0.5, which is the answer.

According to the code, it prints 2, which matches.

Another example:

n=6

a="010111"

arr=[0,1,0,1,1,1]

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=1

prefix_z[2]=1

prefix_z[3]=2

prefix_z[4]=2

prefix_z[5]=2

prefix_z[6]=2

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=0

prefix_o[2]=1

prefix_o[3]=1

prefix_o[4]=2

prefix_o[5]=3

prefix_o[6]=4

Now, for i from 0 to 6:

i=0:

left_n=0, fine

right_n=6, need ceil(6/2)=3 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[0]=4 >=3, holds.

i=0 is valid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[1]=1 >=1, holds.

right_n=5, need ceil(5/2)=3 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[1]=4 >=3, holds.

i=1 is valid.

i=2:

left_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[2]=1 >=1, holds.

right_n=4, need ceil(4/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[2]=4-1=3 >=2, holds.

i=2 is valid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=2 >=2, holds.

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[3]=4-2=2 >=2, holds.

i=3 is valid.

i=4:

left_n=4, need ceil(4/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[4]=2 >=2, holds.

right_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 one: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[4]=4-2=2 >=1, holds.

i=4 is valid.

i=5:

left_n=5, need ceil(5/2)=3 zeros: prefix_z[5]=2 <3, does not hold.

right_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 one: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[5]=4-3=1 >=1, holds.

But left side does not hold, so i=5 invalid.

i=6:

left_n=6, need ceil(6/2)=3 zeros: prefix_z[6]=2 <3, does not hold.

right_n=0, which is fine.

But left side does not hold, so i=6 invalid.

So, valid i's are 0,1,2,3,4.

n=6, n/2=3.

Calculate |i - 3|:

i=0: |0-3|=3

i=1: |1-3|=2

i=2: |2-3|=1

i=3: |3-3|=0

i=4: |4-3|=1

So, the smallest |i - 3| is 0, which corresponds to i=3.

But according to the sample input, the output is 3 for n=6 and a="010111".

Wait, in the sample input, for n=6 and a="010111", the output is 3.

According to my calculation, i=3 is valid and has the smallest |i - 3|=0.

So, it matches.

Another sample input:

n=6

a="011001"

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=1

prefix_z[2]=1

prefix_z[3]=1

prefix_z[4]=2

prefix_z[5]=3

prefix_z[6]=3

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=0

prefix_o[2]=1

prefix_o[3]=2

prefix_o[4]=2

prefix_o[5]=2

prefix_o[6]=3

Now, for i from 0 to 6:

i=0:

left_n=0, fine

right_n=6, need ceil(6/2)=3 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[0]=3 >=3, holds.

i=0 valid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[1]=1 >=1, holds.

i=2 valid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=1 <2, does not hold.

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[3]=3-2=1 <2, does not hold.

i=3 invalid.

i=4:

left_n=4, need ceil(4/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[4]=2 >=2, holds.

right_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 one: prefix_o[6]-prefix_o[4]=3-2=1 >=1, holds.

i=5 valid.

i=6:

left_n=6, need ceil(6/2)=3 zeros: prefix_z[6]=3 >=3, holds.

right_n=0, which is fine.

i=6 valid.

So, valid i's are 0,1,2,4,5,6.

n=6, n/2=3.

Calculate |i - 3|:

i=0: |0-3|=3

i=1: |1-3|=2

i=2: |2-3|=1

i=4: |4-3|=1

i=5: |5-3|=2

i=6: |6-3|=3

So, the smallest |i - 3|=1, which corresponds to i=2 and i=4.

Among these, we choose the smallest i, which is 2.

According to the sample input, for n=6 and a="011001", the output is 2, which matches.

Another sample input:

n=3

a="000"

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=1

prefix_z[2]=2

prefix_z[3]=3

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=0

prefix_o[2]=0

prefix_o[3]=0

Now, for i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

left_n=0, fine

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[0]=0 <2, does not hold.

i=0 invalid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[1]=1 >=1, holds.

right_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 one: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[1]=0 <1, does not hold.

i=1 invalid.

i=2:

left_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[2]=2 >=1, holds.

right_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 one: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[2]=0 <1, does not hold.

i=2 invalid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=3 >=2, holds.

right_n=0, which is fine.

i=3 valid.

So, only i=3 is valid.

n=3, n/2=1.5

|i - 1.5| for i=3 is |3 - 1.5|=1.5

So, the answer is 3, which matches the sample input.

Another sample input:

prefix_o[2]=2

prefix_o[3]=2

For i from 0 to 3:

i=2 invalid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=1 <2, does not hold.

right_n=0, which is fine.

But left side does not hold, so i=3 invalid.

Wait, according to the problem, the answer always exists, but in this case, only i=0 is valid.

n=3, n/2=1.5

|i - 1.5| for i=0 is |0 - 1.5|=1.5

So, the answer is 0, which matches the sample input.

Another sample input:

n=3

a="001"

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=1

prefix_z[2]=2

prefix_z[3]=2

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=0

prefix_o[2]=0

prefix_o[3]=1

For i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

left_n=0, fine

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[0]=1 <2, does not hold.

i=0 invalid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[1]=1 >=1, holds.

i=1 valid.

i=2:

left_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[2]=2 >=1, holds.

right_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 one: prefix_o[3]-prefix_o[2]=1-0=1 >=1, holds.

i=2 valid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=2 >=2, holds.

right_n=0, which is fine.

i=3 valid.

So, valid i's are 1,2,3.

n=3, n/2=1.5

|i - 1.5|:

i=1: |1 - 1.5|=0.5

i=2: |2 - 1.5|=0.5

i=3: |3 - 1.5|=1.5

So, the smallest |i - 1.5| is 0.5, corresponding to i=1 and i=2.

Choose the smallest i, which is 1.

According to the sample input, for n=3 and a="001", the output is 1, which matches.

Last sample input:

n=4

a="1100"

prefix_z:

prefix_z[0]=0

prefix_z[1]=0

prefix_z[2]=0

prefix_z[3]=1

prefix_z[4]=2

prefix_o:

prefix_o[0]=0

prefix_o[1]=1

prefix_o[2]=2

prefix_o[3]=2

prefix_o[4]=2

For i from 0 to 4:

i=0:

left_n=0, fine

right_n=4, need ceil(4/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[4]-prefix_o[0]=2 >=2, holds.

i=0 valid.

i=1:

left_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 zero: prefix_z[1]=0 <1, does not hold.

right_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 ones: prefix_o[4]-prefix_o[1]=2-1=1 <2, does not hold.

i=1 invalid.

i=2:

right_n=2, need ceil(2/2)=1 one: prefix_o[4]-prefix_o[2]=2-2=0 <1, does not hold.

i=2 invalid.

i=3:

left_n=3, need ceil(3/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[3]=1 <2, does not hold.

right_n=1, need ceil(1/2)=1 one: prefix_o[4]-prefix_o[3]=2-2=0 <1, does not hold.

i=3 invalid.

i=4:

left_n=4, need ceil(4/2)=2 zeros: prefix_z[4]=2 >=2, holds.

right_n=0, which is fine.

i=4 valid.

So, valid i's are 0 and 4.

n=4, n/2=2.0

|i - 2.0|:

i=0: |0 - 2|=2

i=4: |4 - 2|=2

So, both have the same |i - 2|=2, choose the smallest i, which is 0.

According to the sample input, for n=4 and a="1100", the output is 0, which matches.

Okay, so my understanding seems correct based on the sample inputs.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

input_string = input()

arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]

z = arr.count(0)

o = arr.count(1)

z_r = z

o_r = o

z_l = 0

o_l = 0

(dist, ans, pos) = (abs(n / 2), 0, 0)

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:

b_d = dist

else:

b_d = 30001

for i in arr:

pos += 1

if i == 0:

z_l += 1

z_r -= 1

else:

o_l += 1

o_r -= 1

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)):

ans = pos

b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

print(ans)

t -= 1

So, the code is trying to iterate through the positions, keeping track of the counts of 0's and 1's on the left and right sides.

It initializes z_r and o_r as the total counts of 0's and 1's, respectively.

Then, for each position pos from 1 to n, it moves one house at a time, updating z_l and o_l based on the value of arr[pos-1], and correspondingly decrementing z_r or o_r.

Then, it checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2, and if the current |pos - n/2| is smaller than the previous best, it updates the answer.

Finally, it prints the answer.

Wait, but in the code, it initializes dist = abs(n / 2), which is |n/2|, but n is at least 3, so n/2 is positive.

Then, it sets b_d = dist if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2, else b_d = 30001.

Wait, 30001 is likely a large number to represent infinity.

This seems to handle the case when i=0.

But in the code, it's checking o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2 for i=0.

Wait, z_r + o_r is n, so (z_r + o_r)/2 is n/2.

So, o_r >= n/2, which is the condition for i=0.

But actually, for i=0, the condition is that the right side has at least ceil(n/2) ones.

But ceil(n/2) is not necessarily equal to n/2.

For even n, ceil(n/2) = n/2

For odd n, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2

But in the code, it's checking o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2, which is o_r >= n/2.

But for odd n, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2, which is greater than n/2.

So, for odd n, o_r >= n/2 may not be sufficient.

For example, n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, but o_r >= 1.5, which in integer comparison o_r >=2.

So, it's okay for n=3, but in general, it should use math.ceil(n/2).

But in the code, it's using (z_r + o_r)/2, which is n/2, and comparing o_r >= n/2.

But in Python, n/2 is a float, and o_r is integer, so it's comparing o_r >= n/2, which is correct for both even and odd n because o_r is integer and n/2 could be float, and >= will work correctly.

For example, n=3, n/2=1.5, so o_r >=1.5 means o_r >=2 since o_r is integer.

Similarly, n=4, n/2=2.0, o_r >=2.0 means o_r >=2.

So, it seems correct.

Then, it initializes ans=0, pos=0.

Then, iterates through arr, for each house, moving from right to left.

Wait, pos starts at 0, then for each i in arr, pos +=1.

So, pos goes from 1 to n.

For each house, if it's 0, z_l +=1 and z_r -=1.

If it's 1, o_l +=1 and o_r -=1.

Then, it checks:

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos):

ans = pos

b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

So, it's checking for each i from 1 to n.

Wait, but i=0 is also a possible position.

In the code, it seems to handle i=0 separately before the loop.

But in the loop, pos goes from 1 to n.

So, it's considering i from 1 to n.

But i=0 is also a possible position.

Wait, in the code, it sets b_d = dist if i=0 satisfies the condition.

But in the loop, it starts from i=1 to n.

Wait, perhaps the code is handling i=0 before the loop.

Looking again:

It sets b_d = dist if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2, else b_d = 30001.

This corresponds to i=0.

Then, in the loop, for i from 1 to n, it updates z_l and o_l based on arr[pos-1], and z_r and o_r accordingly.

Then, checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos):

If so, sets ans = pos and b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

So, it's considering i from 0 to n.

For i=0, it's already handled before the loop.

Then, in the loop, i goes from 1 to n.

Seems correct.

At the end, it prints ans.

Then, t -=1.

Now, I need to check if this code correctly implements the logic I described earlier.

In my earlier reasoning, I suggested finding the range of i where both conditions hold and then finding the i within that range that minimizes |i - n/2|.

But the code is iterating through all possible i from 0 to n and checking the conditions directly.

Given the constraints, with t up to 2*10^4 and n up to 3*10^5, with sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, this approach should be efficient enough, as it processes each test case in O(n) time.

Now, I need to verify if the code correctly checks the conditions.

For the left side, it checks z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2.

Wait, z_l is the number of 0's on the left side, and o_l is the number of 1's on the left side.

So, z_l + o_l = i.

So, z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2 is z_l >= i/2.

But ceil(i/2) is needed.

Wait, ceil(i/2) is equal to (i +1)/2
