Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's an integer k, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. 

Specifically:

- l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array (a1 to an).

- r should be a subset of the last n elements of the array (a(n+1) to a(2n)).

- The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging the remaining elements. So, it's not necessarily contiguous, and the order doesn't matter as long as the elements are from the specified half of the array.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from the first n elements for l and 2k elements from the last n elements for r, such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which I XOR the elements doesn't matter, and XOR-ing a number with itself cancels out to 0.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I'm selecting subsets from the first and second halves, I need to consider how the duplicates are distributed between the two halves.

My initial thought is to find pairs of identical numbers, one in the first half and one in the second half, and use them to form l and r.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in total for each l and r, not necessarily k pairs.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

4

2 1

1 2 2 1

Output:

2 1

2 1

In this case, n=2, k=1. So, l is [2,1] from the first half [1,2], and r is [2,1] from the second half [2,1]. The XOR of both is 3.

Another example:

Input:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

Output:

6 4

1 3

Here, n=6, k=1. So, l is [6,4] from the first half [6,4,2,1,2,3], and r is [1,3] from the second half [1,6,3,5,5,4]. The XOR of l is 6 XOR 4 = 2, and the XOR of r is 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

From these examples, it seems like I need to select elements such that their XORs match, but it's not necessarily that I pick the same elements from both halves.

I need a systematic way to select these subsets.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how I can ensure that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

One approach could be to select elements in such a way that the XOR of l and r together is zero, but since l and r are from different halves, I need to consider the distribution of duplicates.

Wait, since each number appears exactly twice, once in each half, perhaps.

Wait, no. The problem states that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, but it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves. They could be split in any way.

For example, for n=2, the array could be [1,2,2,1], where each number appears once in each half, or it could be [1,1,2,2], where both duplicates of each number are in the same half.

In the first case, it's easier to match XORs, but in the second case, it might be trickier.

Wait, but the problem says that at least one solution exists, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Given that, I need an algorithm that can find such subsets l and r for any valid input.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Compute the XOR of all elements in the first half (lft_xor).

2. Compute the XOR of all elements in the second half (rgt_xor).

3. The XOR of lft_xor and rgt_xor should be zero because overall, each number from 1 to n appears twice, and XOR-ing them all would cancel out to zero.

4. I need to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that the XOR of selected elements in the first half equals the XOR of selected elements in the second half.

5. Since the total XOR is zero, perhaps there's a relationship I can exploit here.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and r.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select 2k elements from each half, perhaps I can look for pairs of numbers that are duplicated across the halves.

Wait, but I need to select subsets, not necessarily pairs.

Another idea: Since XOR is involved, maybe I can consider the XOR of all possible subsets of size 2k from each half and find matching XOR values.

But that sounds computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 5*10^4 and k up to n/2.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and subsets.

I recall that the XOR of a subset can be thought of as a linear combination over GF(2) of the elements in the subset.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Let me think about smaller examples.

Take n=2, k=1, array=[1,2,2,1].

First half: [1,2], second half: [2,1].

Possible subsets of size 2:

l: [1,2], r: [2,1]. XOR of both is 3.

Another possible pair: l: [1,2], r: [1,2]. But [1,2] is not a subset of the second half, since in the second half, there is only one 1 and one 2.

Wait, no, in the second half [2,1,2,3], but n=2? Wait, in the first example, n=2, array has 4 elements: [1,2,2,1].

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=1, array=[1,2,2,1].

So first half: [1,2], second half: [2,1].

Possible subsets of size 2:

l: [1,2], r: [2,1]. XOR of l is 1 XOR 2 = 3, XOR of r is 2 XOR 1 = 3. Matches.

Another possible pair: l: [1,2], r: [2,1]. Same as above.

Only one unique pair in this case.

Another test case: n=6, k=1, array=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4].

Wait, no, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, array=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4].

Wait, but according to the problem, the array has length 2n, and it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

So, for n=6, array has 12 elements.

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3], second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4].

Need to select 2 elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

In the sample output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3]. XOR of l is 6 XOR 4 = 2, XOR of r is 1 XOR 3 = 2. Matches.

Another test case: n=4, k=1, array=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4].

First half: [1,2,3,4], second half: [1,2,3,4].

Possible subsets: l=[1,2], r=[3,4]. XOR of l is 1 XOR 2 = 3, XOR of r is 3 XOR 4 = 7. Not equal.

Another pair: l=[1,3], r=[1,3]. XOR of l is 1 XOR 3 = 2, XOR of r is 1 XOR 3 = 2. Matches.

Output in the sample is [1,2], [1,2]. XOR is 1 XOR 2 = 3, which should match, but in the sample output, it's [1,2] and [1,2], which would both have XOR 3.

Wait, but in the sample output for the third test case, it's:

Input:

4 1

1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

Output:

1 2

1 2

So, l=[1,2], r=[1,2]. XOR of both is 3.

But r=[1,2] is a subset of the second half [1,2,3,4], which is correct.

Another test case: n=6, k=2, array=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2].

First half: [5,1,3,3,5,1], second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2].

Need to select 4 elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

Sample output:

l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]. XOR of l is 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 = 4, then 4 XOR 3 = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4. Wait, 5 XOR 1 is 4, XOR 3 is 7, XOR 3 is 4.

XOR of r is 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 4 = 2, XOR 2 = 0, XOR 4 = 4.

So, both l and r have XOR 4.

Hence, it matches.

From these examples, it seems that selecting pairs of identical elements from each half can help in making the XORs equal.

But in some cases, I might need to select single elements and combine them to achieve the same XOR.

Let me think about a general approach.

I need to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that, I can think in terms of XOR properties.

Let me denote:

- lft_xor = XOR of elements in l

- rgt_xor = XOR of elements in r

I need lft_xor == rgt_xor.

I also know that the XOR of all elements in the first half is equal to the XOR of all elements in the second half because overall, each number from 1 to n appears twice, and XOR-ing them all results in zero.

So, XOR of first half XOR second half = 0, which implies that XOR of first half = XOR of second half.

Let me denote:

- total_xor_l = XOR of all elements in the first half

- total_xor_r = XOR of all elements in the second half

Then, total_xor_l == total_xor_r.

Now, if I select a subset l from the first half with XOR lft_xor, then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half would be total_xor_l XOR lft_xor.

Similarly, if I select a subset r from the second half with XOR rgt_xor, the XOR of the remaining elements in the second half would be total_xor_r XOR rgt_xor.

But since total_xor_l == total_xor_r, and I need lft_xor == rgt_xor, perhaps there's a relationship between the XORs of the selected subsets and the XORs of the remaining elements.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting subsets such that their XORs are equal to some value, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

I can iterate through the numbers from 1 to n and track where their duplicates are located.

For each number, if both duplicates are in the first half, or both are in the second half, or one is in each half.

Based on that, I can decide how to select elements for l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers based on where their duplicates are located.

Let me define:

- pairs: numbers where both duplicates are in the first half

- pairs: numbers where both duplicates are in the second half

- split: numbers where one duplicate is in the first half and the other is in the second half

Wait, but 'pairs' might not be the best term here. Let's say:

- lft_pair: numbers with both duplicates in the first half

- rgt_pair: numbers with both duplicates in the second half

- split: numbers with one duplicate in each half

Given that, I can consider selecting elements from these groups to form l and r.

For example, if I select a number from lft_pair, I can include both its duplicates in l, which would XOR to zero. Similarly for rgt_pair, include both duplicates in r, XORing to zero.

For split numbers, if I include one in l and one in r, their XORs would be equal since they are the same number.

But I need to select 2k elements in total for l and r.

Wait, 2k elements for l and 2k elements for r, so total 4k elements.

But n can be up to 5*10^4, and k up to n/2, so 4k could be up to 10^5, which is manageable.

I need to find a way to select these elements efficiently.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Identify numbers that appear twice in the first half (lft_pair).

2. Identify numbers that appear twice in the second half (rgt_pair).

3. Identify numbers that appear once in each half (split).

Then, I can select complete pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair, and match single elements from split.

But I need to ensure that the total XOR of selected elements in l equals the XOR of selected elements in r.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair to contribute XOR zero, and then use split elements to balance the XOR.

Let me think in terms of XOR contributions.

If I select a pair from lft_pair, say two identical elements, their XOR is zero. Similarly for rgt_pair.

For split numbers, if I select one in l and one in r, their XOR contributions are the same since they are identical.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

Perhaps I can start by selecting as many complete pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair as possible, since they contribute zero XOR, and then use split elements to adjust the XOR as needed.

But I need to make sure that the total XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Wait, maybe I can select some pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair, and then use split elements to make up the required number of elements.

But I'm not sure how to ensure that the XORs match.

Let me consider the total number of pairs available.

Each lft_pair and rgt_pair provides two elements that can be selected together, contributing XOR zero.

Each split number can be used to provide one element to l and one to r, contributing the same value to both XORs.

So, if I select m split numbers, I can add one to l and one to r, each time adding the same value to both l_xor and r_xor.

The remaining elements to reach 2k in total would be filled with pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and r.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let s be the number of split numbers I use.

- Each split number contributes one element to l and one to r, both with the same value, hence adding the same value to both l_xor and r_xor.

- Let p_l be the number of pairs I select from lft_pair, each contributing two elements to l with XOR zero.

- Similarly, p_r be the number of pairs from rgt_pair, each contributing two elements to r with XOR zero.

Then, the total number of elements selected for l would be 2*p_l + s, and for r would be 2*p_r + s.

I need 2*p_l + s = 2k and 2*p_r + s = 2k.

From these two equations:

2*p_l + s = 2k

2*p_r + s = 2k

Subtracting the two equations:

2*p_l - 2*p_r = 0 => p_l = p_r

So, p_l = p_r.

Let’s denote p = p_l = p_r.

Then, 2*p + s = 2k => s = 2k - 2*p.

Since s has to be non-negative, p <= k.

Also, p cannot exceed the number of available pairs in lft_pair and rgt_pair.

So, p <= min(number of lft_pair, number of rgt_pair, k)

Then, s = 2k - 2*p.

I need to select p pairs from lft_pair and p pairs from rgt_pair, and s split numbers.

Each pair from lft_pair contributes two elements to l with XOR zero.

Each pair from rgt_pair contributes two elements to r with XOR zero.

Each split number contributes one element to l and one to r, both with the same value, hence adding the same value to both l_xor and r_xor.

Therefore, the total l_xor would be the XOR of s split numbers, and similarly for r_xor.

Since each split number adds the same value to both l_xor and r_xor, the total l_xor and r_xor would be equal.

Hence, this seems like a valid approach.

So, the plan is:

1. Identify lft_pair: numbers with both duplicates in the first half.

2. Identify rgt_pair: numbers with both duplicates in the second half.

3. Identify split: numbers with one duplicate in each half.

4. Determine p, the number of pairs to select from lft_pair and rgt_pair, where p is as large as possible but not exceeding the minimum of available lft_pair, rgt_pair, and k.

5. Then, s = 2k - 2*p.

6. Select p pairs from lft_pair and add both elements to l.

7. Select p pairs from rgt_pair and add both elements to r.

8. Select s split numbers, and for each, select one element to add to l and one to add to r.

This should ensure that l_xor == r_xor.

Also, since s = 2k - 2*p, and p is maximized up to min(number of lft_pair, number of rgt_pair, k), s will be non-negative.

This seems correct.

Now, let's see if this aligns with the sample inputs.

Take the first sample:

n=2, k=1

array=[1,2,2,1]

First half: [1,2], second half: [2,1]

lft_pair: none, since 1 and 2 each appear once in the first half.

rgt_pair: none, since 1 and 2 each appear once in the second half.

split: both 1 and 2 are split since each appears once in each half.

So, p=0 (since no pairs available), s=2k - 2*p = 2*1 - 0 = 2.

Select 2 split numbers: 1 and 2.

For each, select one for l and one for r.

So, l=[1,2], r=[2,1]. XOR of both is 3.

Matches the sample output.

Another sample:

n=6, k=1

array=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Identify lft_pair:

- 2 appears twice in the first half.

- Others appear once.

rgt_pair:

- 5 appears twice in the second half.

- Others appear once.

split:

- 1,3,4,6 appear once in each half.

So, lft_pair: [2]

rgt_pair: [5]

split: [1,3,4,6]

Select p = min(number of lft_pair, rgt_pair, k) = min(1,1,1)=1

Select p=1 pair from lft_pair and rgt_pair.

Select 2k - 2*p = 2*1 - 2*1 = 0 split numbers.

So, select the pair [2,2] for l and [5,5] for r.

But in the sample output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

Wait, their XOR is both 2.

But according to my approach, selecting [2,2] and [5,5] would have XOR zero for both, but that's not matching the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I need to select different split numbers to achieve the same XOR.

In this case, selecting [6,4] for l (XOR 6 XOR 4 = 2) and [1,3] for r (XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2).

So, in this case, p=0, since I don't select any pairs from lft_pair and rgt_pair.

Then, s=2k - 2*0 = 2.

Select s=2 split numbers: [6,4] for l and [1,3] for r.

Their XORs are both 2.

This matches the sample output.

So, in this case, p can be zero.

Hence, I need to consider p from 0 up to min(number of lft_pair, rgt_pair, k), and choose the one that allows me to select the required number of elements.

In cases where p=0, I select s=2k split numbers, distributing one from each to l and r.

But in the third sample:

n=4, k=1

array=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First half: [1,2,3,4], second half: [1,2,3,4]

lft_pair: none

rgt_pair: none

split: all numbers [1,2,3,4]

Then, p=0, s=2*1 - 0 = 2.

Select 2 split numbers, say [1,2] for l and [1,2] for r.

XOR of both is 3.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

n=6, k=2

array=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First half: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

Second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

lft_pair: 3 and 5 (both appear twice in the first half)

rgt_pair: 4 and 6 (both appear twice in the second half)

split: 1 and 2 (each appears once in each half)

Select p = min(number of lft_pair, rgt_pair, k) = min(2,2,2)=2

Select p=2 pairs from lft_pair: [5,5] and [3,3]

Select p=2 pairs from rgt_pair: [4,4] and [6,6]

Then, s=2*2 - 2*2=0

So, l=[5,5,3,3], r=[4,4,6,6]

XOR of l: 5 XOR 5 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0

XOR of r: 4 XOR 4 XOR 6 XOR 6 = 0

Which matches.

But in the sample output, l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]

Wait, their XOR is both 4.

So, in this case, p=1 (select one pair from lft_pair and one from rgt_pair, s=2*2 - 2*1=2)

Then, select s=2 split numbers: say [1,2]

Add [1] to l and [2] to r.

But then l would be [5,5,3,3,1], which is more than 4 elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps I need to select p=1 pair from lft_pair and p=1 pair from rgt_pair, and s=2 split numbers.

Then, l would be [5,5,3,3,1,1] but that's 6 elements, but I need only 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to select p such that 2*p + s = 2k, with s >=0.

Wait, in this case, p=1, s=2*2 - 2*1=2.

Then, select 1 pair from lft_pair ([5,5]), 1 pair from rgt_pair ([4,4]), and 2 split numbers ([1,2]).

Then, l would be [5,5,1], r would be [4,4,2].

But I need 4 elements for each.

Wait, perhaps I need to select p=1 pair from lft_pair and p=1 pair from rgt_pair, and s=2 split numbers.

But then, l would be [5,5,1,2], r=[4,4,2,1].

XOR of l: 5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3 XOR 2 = 1

XOR of r: 4 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 3

Which do not match.

But in the sample output, l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]

XOR of l: 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 = 4, then 4 XOR 3 = 7, then 7 XOR 3 = 4

XOR of r: 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 4 = 2, 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 4 = 4

So, both are 4.

Hence, it works.

But in my previous attempt, it didn't match.

Perhaps I need to adjust how I select the split numbers.

Wait, maybe instead of selecting split numbers to add to l and r, I need to select them in a way that their XOR contributions balance out.

But according to the earlier reasoning, since each split number adds the same value to both l_xor and r_xor, their XORs should remain equal.

In the previous attempt, I selected [5,5,1,2] for l and [4,4,2,1] for r.

XOR of l: 5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR of r: 4 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 3

Which matches.

But in the sample output, they have l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4], which also matches with XOR 4.

So, multiple solutions exist.

Hence, the approach seems valid.

Therefore, I can proceed with this plan.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

1. Split the array into first half and second half.

2. Identify lft_pair: numbers that appear twice in the first half.

3. Identify rgt_pair: numbers that appear twice in the second half.

4. Identify split: numbers that appear once in each half.

5. Determine p = min(number of lft_pair, rgt_pair, k)

6. Set s = 2k - 2*p

7. Select p pairs from lft_pair and add both elements to l.

8. Select p pairs from rgt_pair and add both elements to r.

9. Select s split numbers and for each, select one element from the first half and one from the second half, adding them to l and r respectively.

10. Output l and r.

I need to make sure that I select the elements in a way that maintains the subset property, i.e., elements are from the respective halves and possibly rearranged.

Also, I need to handle the selection of pairs and split numbers efficiently, especially since n can be up to 5*10^4 and k up to n/2.

Time constraints are important here.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently.

First, I can count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves.

Using dictionaries or lists to keep track of counts.

Then, identify lft_pair, rgt_pair, and split based on the counts.

For selecting the pairs, I can iterate through the first p lft_pair numbers and select their elements from the first half.

Similarly for rgt_pair.

For split numbers, I can select the first s split numbers and choose one from the first half and one from the second half.

But I need to make sure that I have the indices or actual elements to pick from.

To optimize, I can store the positions of each number in both halves.

But storing positions for n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000 might be time-consuming if not handled properly.

I need an efficient way to store and retrieve these positions.

Perhaps I can use lists of lists, where the index represents the number, and the list contains the positions where it appears.

But with n up to 5*10^4, and t up to 5000, I need to make sure that the overall time complexity is acceptable.

Let me consider the following plan:

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array of 2n elements.

- Split the array into first half (lft) and second half (rgt).

- Count the occurrences of each number in lft and rgt.

- Identify lft_pair: numbers with count 2 in lft.

- Identify rgt_pair: numbers with count 2 in rgt.

- Identify split: numbers with count 1 in lft and 1 in rgt.

- Determine p = min(len(lft_pair), len(rgt_pair), k)

- Set s = 2k - 2*p

- Select p pairs from lft_pair and add both elements to l.

- Select p pairs from rgt_pair and add both elements to r.

- Select s split numbers and add one element from lft to l and one from rgt to r.

- Output l and r.

To implement this, I need to keep track of the positions of each number in both halves.

Let me think about how to store this information efficiently.

I can create two dictionaries, one for lft and one for rgt, where the keys are the numbers and the values are lists of positions where they appear in their respective halves.

Then, for lft_pair, I can select p numbers from the keys where the count is 2, and for each, add both positions to l.

Similarly for rgt_pair.

For split, I can select s numbers from the keys that appear once in both halves, and for each, add the element from lft to l and from rgt to r.

But I need to make sure that I don't run out of any of these categories.

Also, I need to handle the case where p can be zero, meaning I select only split numbers.

In the earlier sample where p=0, it worked.

Hence, this seems feasible.

Now, considering time constraints, since n can be up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, but the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^4, I need to ensure that my solution runs in linear or linearithmic time.

Implementing this in Python, I need to be careful with the time complexity of operations like sorting or searching.

To optimize, I can process each test case separately, and within each test case, perform operations that are O(n), which should be acceptable.

Now, let's consider implementing this plan in code.

But before that, I need to make sure that I handle all edge cases correctly.

Edge Cases:

1. All numbers are split, i.e., no lft_pair or rgt_pair.

In this case, p=0, s=2k.

I need to select s split numbers and add one from lft to l and one from rgt to r.

This should work as long as there are at least s split numbers available.

Given that k <= floor(n/2), and split numbers are from 1 to n, and each appears once in each half, there should be at least k split numbers available since at least n - 2*p numbers are split, and p <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but p can be up to floor(n/2), but in practice, p is limited by the number of lft_pair and rgt_pair.

Given that, and k <= floor(n/2), it should be manageable.

2. All numbers are in lft_pair and rgt_pair, i.e., no split numbers.

In this case, s=0, and p=k.

I select p pairs from lft_pair and p pairs from rgt_pair, each contributing two elements with XOR zero.

Hence, l_xor and r_xor would both be zero, which matches.

3. Mixed cases, where there are both pairs and split numbers.

As in the samples, this should be handled by selecting p pairs and s split numbers accordingly.

I need to make sure that I have at least p pairs available in both lft_pair and rgt_pair, and at least s split numbers.

Given the constraints, it should be possible.

Now, considering the implementation, I need to collect the elements for l and r in the required order.

Since subsets can be in any order, I can collect them in any sequence.

But for simplicity, I can collect them in the order I select them.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

lft = lst[:n]

rgt = lst[n:]

ldb = []

rdb = []

sng = []

lft.sort()

rgt.sort()

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

sng.append(lft[i])

for i in range(1, n):

if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:

rdb.append(rgt[i])

sz = 0

for elem in ldb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

sz = 0

for elem in rdb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

}

This code seems to be trying to implement the logic I described, but there are some issues and unclear parts.

First, it sorts both lft and rgt.

Then, it iterates through lft to find pairs (ldb) and single elements (sng).

Wait, in the loop:

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

sng.append(lft[i])

This seems to be trying to find pairs in lft (ldb) and single elements in lft (sng).

But actually, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, in lft, a number can appear 0, 1, or 2 times.

If it appears twice in lft, it's a lft_pair.

If it appears once in lft, it should appear once in rgt, making it a split number.

But in this code, sng seems to be collecting numbers that appear only once in lft and are not part of a pair.

But in reality, all numbers that appear once in lft are split numbers.

Similarly for rgt.

However, the code only appends to sng if i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1], which might not correctly identify all single elements.

This seems error-prone.

Moreover, it only looks for pairs in lft and rgt separately, but doesn't explicitly handle the split numbers correctly.

Then, it prints elements from ldb and sng for l, and from rdb and sng for r.

But sng is used for both l and r, which might not be correct.

Wait, sng is built from lft, but used for both l and r.

This seems problematic.

In the output section:

for elem in ldb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

sz = 0

for elem in rdb:

if sz >= k:

break

if k - sz >= 2:

print(elem, elem, end=' ')

sz += 2

for elem in sng:

if sz >= k:

break

print(elem, end=' ')

sz += 1

print()

This seems to be trying to select pairs from ldb and rdb, and singles from sng.

But there are a few issues:

1. It assumes that pairs from ldb and rdb can be selected directly, but it doesn't ensure that the same number of pairs are selected from both.

2. It uses sng for both l and r, which might not correctly pair the split numbers.

3. It doesn't ensure that the total number of elements selected for l and r are equal.

4. It doesn't handle the case where p is determined based on the minimum of available pairs and k.

Overall, this code seems flawed in its approach to selecting the subsets l and r.

Hence, I would say that the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
