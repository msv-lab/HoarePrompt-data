Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Alice has 'n' coins and wants to buy exactly 'k' jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel ranging from 1 to 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls with certain prices such that Alice ends up buying exactly 'k' jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to think about how Alice's buying behavior works. She starts with 'n' coins and visits each stall in order. At each stall, she buys as many jewels as she can with her current coins, given the price at that stall. She continues to the next stall until she has visited all stalls or doesn't have enough coins to buy any more jewels.

So, the key here is to figure out how to set the prices for the stalls such that the total number of jewels she buys is exactly 'k'.

Let me consider some simple cases to build my understanding.

**Case 1: n = k**

If Alice has 'n' coins and needs to buy exactly 'n' jewels, she can buy one jewel from each stall, provided each stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel. So, setting up one stall with price 1 should suffice.

Wait, but in this case, if she has 'n' coins and each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy 'n' jewels from a single stall. But the problem says she buys from each stall in order, as many as possible.

So, if I set up one stall with price 1, she will buy 'n' jewels from that single stall. That satisfies n = k.

But the code seems to handle this case correctly, outputting "YES", then 1, then 1.

**Case 2: n + 2 > k * 2**

The code has a condition that if n + 2 > k * 2, then it's possible to set up two stalls: one with price (n - k + 1) and another with price 1.

Let me see why this works.

Suppose she has 'n' coins and needs to buy 'k' jewels.

At the first stall with price (n - k + 1), she can buy floor(n / (n - k + 1)) jewels.

Let's compute n / (n - k + 1):

- If n = 7 and k = 3, then price = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5. So, she can buy floor(7/5) = 1 jewel, paying 5 coins, leaving her with 2 coins.

- Then, at the second stall with price 1, she can buy floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, paying 2 coins, leaving her with 0 coins.

- Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Another example: n = 6, k = 4.

Price1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3.

- Buy floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, paying 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Second stall price 1: can't buy anything.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=4.

Wait, but according to the condition, n + 2 > k * 2 → 6 + 2 > 4 * 2 → 8 > 8, which is false. So, it shouldn't enter this branch. Indeed, in the code, it would go to "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins using at most 60 stalls.

Wait, but in the example input, there's a "NO" case, which corresponds to n=6 and k=4.

So, the condition seems to be working correctly for this case.

Let me check another example.

n=10, k=5.

Check condition: 10 + 2 > 5 * 2 → 12 > 10, which is true.

So, output "YES", set up two stalls: price1 = 10 - 5 + 1 = 6, price2 = 1.

- Buy floor(10/6) = 1 jewel, pay 6 coins, left with 4 coins.

- Buy floor(4/1) = 4 jewels, pay 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Good.

Another example: n=5, k=3.

Condition: 5 + 2 > 3*2 → 7 > 6, true.

Set up two stalls: price1=5-3+1=3, price2=1.

- Buy floor(5/3)=1 jewel, pay 3 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Buy floor(2/1)=2 jewels, pay 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, matches k=3.

Good.

Another example: n=4, k=2.

Condition: 4 + 2 > 2*2 → 6 > 4, true.

Set up two stalls: price1=4-2+1=3, price2=1.

- Buy floor(4/3)=1 jewel, pay 3 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Buy floor(1/1)=1 jewel, pay 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, matches k=2.

Good.

Another example: n=3, k=1.

Condition: 3 + 2 > 1*2 → 5 > 2, true.

Set up two stalls: price1=3-1+1=3, price2=1.

- Buy floor(3/3)=1 jewel, pay 3 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Can't buy from second stall.

- Total jewels: 1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another example: n=2, k=1.

Condition: 2 + 2 > 1*2 → 4 > 2, true.

Set up two stalls: price1=2-1+1=2, price2=1.

- Buy floor(2/2)=1 jewel, pay 2 coins, left with 0.

- Can't buy from second stall.

- Total jewels: 1, matches k=1.

Good.

Another example: n=1, k=1.

Condition: 1 + 2 > 1*2 → 3 > 2, true.

Set up two stalls: price1=1-1+1=1, price2=1.

- Buy floor(1/1)=1 jewel, pay 1 coin, left with 0.

- Can't buy from second stall.

- Total jewels: 1, matches k=1.

Good.

Wait, but in this case, both stalls have the same price, which is acceptable.

Another example: n=1, k=2.

Condition: 1 + 2 > 2*2 → 3 > 4, false.

So, output "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to buy 2 jewels with 1 coin.

Good.

So, the condition n + 2 > k * 2 seems to be working for these cases.

But why this condition? Let's try to generalize.

In the two-stall approach:

- First stall: price p1 = n - k + 1

- Second stall: price p2 = 1

Then, jewels bought from first stall: floor(n / p1)

Jewels bought from second stall: floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2)

Total jewels: floor(n / p1) + floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2) = k

We need this to be equal to k.

Let me denote:

j1 = floor(n / p1)

j2 = floor((n - j1 * p1) / p2)

Total jewels: j1 + j2 = k

We set p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1.

So, j1 = floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Let me compute n / (n - k + 1):

Since n - k + 1 could be greater than, equal to, or less than n, depending on k.

Wait, k can be less than or equal to n, since she can't buy more jewels than she has coins, assuming all jewels cost at least 1 coin.

Wait, but in the problem, jewels can cost up to 10^18 coins, but in this approach, p2 is 1, and p1 is n - k + 1, which could be less than or equal to n.

Wait, in the first case, n=7, k=3, p1=5, p2=1.

j1 = floor(7/5)=1, j2=floor(2/1)=2, total=3.

n=6, k=4, p1=3, p2=1.

j1=floor(6/3)=2, j2=floor(0/1)=0, total=2 <4. So, it's invalid, and the condition fails, leading to "NO", which is correct.

n=5, k=3, p1=3, p2=1.

j1=1, j2=2, total=3.

n=4, k=2, p1=3, p2=1.

j1=1, j2=1, total=2.

n=3, k=1, p1=3, p2=1.

j1=1, j2=0, total=1.

n=2, k=1, p1=2, p2=1.

j1=1, j2=0, total=1.

n=1, k=1, p1=1, p2=1.

j1=1, j2=0, total=1.

n=1, k=2, condition fails, output "NO", which is correct.

So, in all these cases, when n + 2 > k * 2, setting up two stalls with p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 =1 works.

But why this condition n + 2 > k * 2?

Let's derive it.

We have j1 + j2 = k.

j1 = floor(n / p1)

j2 = floor((n - j1 * p1) / p2)

We set p2=1, so j2 = n - j1 * p1

Then, j1 + (n - j1 * p1) = k

Simplify:

j1 + n - j1 * p1 = k

Rearrange:

n - j1 * (p1 - 1) = k

But p1 = n - k +1

Substitute:

n - j1 * ((n - k +1) -1) = k

Simplify:

n - j1 * (n - k) = k

Then:

n - j1*(n - k) = k

Rearrange:

n - k = j1*(n - k)

Then:

j1 = (n - k)/(n - k) =1, if n -k !=0

But in the cases above, j1 is indeed 1 when n > k.

Wait, in n=7, k=3, j1=1

n=5, k=3, j1=1

n=4, k=2, j1=1

n=3, k=1, j1=1

Yes.

But in n=2, k=1, j1=1

n=1, k=1, j1=1

So, in all these cases, j1=1.

Then, j2 = n - p1*1 = n - (n - k +1) = n - n + k -1 = k -1

So, total jewels: j1 + j2 =1 + (k -1) =k

Perfect.

So, this works when j1=1, which requires that p1 <= n, and p1 > n - j1.

Wait, in this setup, p1 = n - k +1.

We need p1 <= n, which is true since k >=1.

Also, p1 should be at least 1, which is true since k <=n.

So, p1 is valid.

Then, j1 = floor(n / p1) =1, when p1 <=n < p1 + p1 (i.e., n < 2*p1)

Because if n >= 2*p1, then j1 would be at least 2, which would make j2 = n - 2*p1 + ..., leading to total jewels j1 + j2 possibly exceeding or not matching k.

Wait, in our earlier example, n=6, k=4, p1=3, p2=1.

j1 = floor(6/3)=2

j2 = 6 - 2*3 =0, so total jewels=2 <4, which is invalid.

Hence, the condition needs to ensure that j1=1.

So, to have j1=1, we need:

1 <= n / p1 < 2

Which implies:

p1 <= n < 2*p1

Given p1 = n - k +1, substitute:

n - k +1 <= n < 2*(n - k +1)

Simplify:

First inequality: n - k +1 <=n → -k +1 <=0 → k >=1, which is always true since k >=1.

Second inequality: n < 2*(n - k +1) → n < 2*n - 2*k +2 → 0 < n - 2*k +2 → n +2 > 2*k

Which is the condition in the code: n +2 > k *2

So, this condition ensures that j1=1, leading to j2=k-1, and total jewels=k.

Therefore, the two-stall approach works when n +2 > 2*k.

Otherwise, it's impossible with two stalls.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls. However, in the code, it only uses up to two stalls. Is that sufficient?

Looking back at the code, for n=k, it uses one stall with price 1.

For n +2 > 2*k, it uses two stalls: p1=n -k +1 and p2=1.

Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls. Maybe with more stalls, we can cover more cases.

Wait, in the example provided, for n=255 and k=8, it uses 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2: 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Let's see how that works.

With n=255 coins and k=8 jewels.

Stall1: price 128, buys floor(255/128)=1 jewel, pays 128, left with 127.

Stall2: price 64, buys floor(127/64)=1, pays 64, left with 63.

Stall3: price 32, buys 1, pays 32, left with 31.

Stall4: price 16, buys 1, pays 16, left with 15.

Stall5: price 8, buys 1, pays 8, left with 7.

Stall6: price 4, buys 1, pays 4, left with 3.

Stall7: price 2, buys 1, pays 2, left with 1.

Stall8: price 1, buys 1, pays 1, left with 0.

Total jewels: 8, which matches k=8.

So, using multiple stalls allows more flexibility.

But in the code, it only uses up to two stalls. Is that sufficient for all cases where it's possible with up to 60 stalls?

Looking back, in the example where n=255 and k=8, using two stalls might not be sufficient.

Let's try with two stalls for n=255 and k=8.

p1 = n - k +1 =255 -8 +1=248

p2=1

j1 = floor(255/248)=1

j2 = floor((255 -248)/1)=7

Total jewels:1 +7=8

Yes, it works.

Wait, but in the example, they used 8 stalls with decreasing prices, but according to the code, using two stalls would also work.

So, why use 8 stalls when two would suffice?

Well, the code seems to cover the cases where n +2 > 2*k with two stalls.

But perhaps there are cases where n +2 <= 2*k, but it's still possible with more than two stalls.

Wait, in the example where n=6 and k=4, n +2 =8, 2*k=8, so n +2 > 2*k is false, and it's impossible with two stalls, as shown earlier.

Is it possible to set up more than two stalls to make it possible?

Let's try for n=6, k=4.

If I set up three stalls:

Stall1: price p1

Stall2: price p2

Stall3: price p3

I need to choose p1, p2, p3 such that the total jewels bought are 4.

Let's try p1=2, p2=2, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, pay 6 coins, left with 0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:3 <4. Not enough.

Another try: p1=3, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/3)=2, pay 6, left with 0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 <4.

Another try: p1=2, p2=2, p3=2.

- Stall1: floor(6/2)=3, pay 6, left with 0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:3 <4.

Another try: p1=4, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/4)=1, pay 4, left with 2.

- Stall2: floor(2/1)=2, pay 2, left with 0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3 <4.

Another try: p1=5, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/5)=1, pay 5, left with 1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay 1, left with 0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2 <4.

Seems like with three stalls, it's still not possible to get exactly 4 jewels.

What about four stalls?

p1=2, p2=2, p3=1, p4=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/2)=3, pay 6, left with 0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Stall4: can't buy.

- Total jewels:3 <4.

Another attempt: p1=3, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/3)=2, pay 6, left with 0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Stall4: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 <4.

Another attempt: p1=4, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/4)=1, pay 4, left with 2.

- Stall2: floor(2/1)=2, pay 2, left with 0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Stall4: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3 <4.

Still not enough.

It seems that no matter how many stalls I set up, I can't make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins. Hence, the "NO" in the example is correct.

So, the condition n +2 > 2*k seems to correctly identify when it's possible with two stalls.

But is there a case where n +2 <= 2*k, but it's still possible with more than two stalls?

Let me think about n=6, k=3.

Check condition: 6 +2 > 6, which is true (8 > 6), so two stalls suffice.

Set p1=6-3+1=4, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(6/4)=1, pay 4, left with 2.

- Stall2: floor(2/1)=2, pay 2, left with 0.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3.

Good.

Another case: n=5, k=3.

Condition:5 +2 >6, which is true (7>6).

Set p1=5-3+1=3, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(5/3)=1, pay 3, left with 2.

- Stall2: floor(2/1)=2, pay 2, left with 0.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3.

Good.

n=4, k=2.

Condition:4 +2 >4, which is true (6>4).

Set p1=4-2+1=3, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/3)=1, pay 3, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2.

Good.

n=3, k=2.

Condition:3 +2 >4, which is true (5>4).

Set p1=3-2+1=2, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(3/2)=1, pay2, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2.

Good.

n=2, k=1.

Condition:2 +2 >2, which is true (4>2).

Set p1=2-1+1=2, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(2/2)=1, pay2, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1.

Good.

n=1, k=1.

Condition:1 +2 >2, which is true (3>2).

Set p1=1-1+1=1, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1.

Good.

Now, let's consider n=4, k=3.

Condition:4 +2 >6, which is false (6>6 is false).

So, according to the code, it should output "NO".

Is it possible to set up more than two stalls to make it possible?

Let's try with three stalls.

p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/2)=2, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 <3.

Another try: p1=3, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/3)=1, pay3, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2 <3.

Another try: p1=2, p2=2, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/2)=2, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 <3.

Another try: p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

Not equal to3.

Another try: p1=1, p2=2, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

No good.

Another try: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

No good.

Another try with four stalls: p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Stall4: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

Still not equal to3.

It seems impossible to get exactly3 jewels with4 coins using any number of stalls.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, the condition n +2 >2*k seems to correctly identify when it's possible with two stalls.

But is there a case where n +2 <=2*k, but it's still possible with more than two stalls?

Let me check n=5, k=4.

Condition:5 +2 >8, which is false (7>8 is false).

Is it possible to set up more stalls to make it possible?

Try with three stalls: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(5/2)=2, pay4, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 +1=3 <4.

- Stall1: floor(5/1)=5, pay5, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:5 >4.

No good.

Seems impossible to get exactly4 jewels with5 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=7, k=3.

Condition:7 +2 >6, which is true (9>6).

Set p1=7-3+1=5, p2=1.

- Stall1: floor(7/5)=1, pay5, left with2.

- Stall2: floor(2/1)=2, pay2, left with0.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3.

Seems like the condition n +2 >2*k covers all the cases where it's possible with two stalls.

But is there any case where n +2 <=2*k, but it's still possible with more than two stalls?

Let's consider n=5, k=4.

Condition:5 +2 >8, which is false (7>8 is false).

Is it possible with more stalls?

Try with three stalls: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(5/2)=2, pay4, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/1)=1, pay1, left with0.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 +1=3 <4.

Another try: p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(5/1)=5, pay5, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:5 >4.

No good.

Another try: p1=1, p2=2, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(5/1)=5, pay5, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:5 >4.

No good.

Another try: p1=2, p2=2, p3=2.

- Stall1: floor(5/2)=2, pay4, left with1.

- Stall2: floor(1/2)=0, pay0, left with1.

- Stall3: floor(1/2)=0, pay0, left with1.

- Total jewels:2 +0 +0=2 <4.

No good.

Seems impossible to get exactly4 jewels with5 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=4, k=3.

Condition:4 +2 >6, which is false (6>6 is false).

Is it possible with more stalls?

Try with three stalls: p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

No good.

Another try: p1=1, p2=2, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/1)=4, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:4 >3.

No good.

Another try: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- Stall1: floor(4/2)=2, pay4, left with0.

- Stall2: can't buy.

- Stall3: can't buy.

- Total jewels:2 <3.

No good.

Seems impossible to get exactly3 jewels with4 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, it seems that the condition n +2 >2*k is sufficient to determine whether it's possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels with at most two stalls.

Given that the problem allows up to 60 stalls, but in practice, two stalls are sufficient for the cases where n +2 >2*k.

Hence, the code seems correct in outputting "YES" with two stalls when n +2 >2*k, and "NO" otherwise.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
