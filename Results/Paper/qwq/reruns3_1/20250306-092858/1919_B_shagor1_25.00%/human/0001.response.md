Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each of these substrings, I have to calculate a penalty, which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-") multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to minimize the total penalty sum.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value and multiplying by the length means that the penalty is higher for longer substrings with a larger imbalance between "+" and "-".

I need to find the optimal way to split the string to minimize this total penalty.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

Only one way to split: [1]

Penalty = |1| * 1 = 1

Which matches the output.

Second test case:

n = 5

s = "-----"

a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

Split into individual elements: [ -1 ], [ -1 ], [ -1 ], [ -1 ], [ -1 ]

Each penalty is | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty = 5

Again, matches the output.

Third test case:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+ -"

a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

Split into [1, -1, 1, -1] and [1, -1]

For [1, -1, 1, -1]: sum is 0, so penalty is |0| * 4 = 0

For [1, -1]: sum is 0, penalty is |0| * 2 = 0

Total penalty = 0

That's interesting. So, if I can group elements in such a way that their sum is zero, the penalty for that group is zero.

Looking at the fourth test case:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++ -"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Not sure how to split this optimally. The output is 4.

Fifth test case:

n = 20

s = "+--- +++++ -+++++ --- ++ -"

a = [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]

Output is 4.

Hmm.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me think about the properties of the sum and the penalty.

For a substring, the sum is the number of "+" minus the number of "-".

The penalty is the absolute value of this sum times the length of the substring.

I need to minimize the total penalty.

I need to decide where to split the string to minimize this total.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I can consider the minimum penalty up to each position.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimum penalty for the first i characters.

Initially, dp[0] = 0

For each i from 1 to n:

dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty of substring s[j+1..i]

But n can be up to 5000, and t up to 1000, so this might be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me see if there's a smarter way to split the string.

Looking back at the examples, in the third one, splitting into two groups with sum zero gives total penalty zero.

In the second one, splitting into individual characters gives penalty 5.

If I had split into larger groups, what would happen?

For example, splitting into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ]

Sum is -5, penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25

Which is worse than 5.

So, in that case, splitting into individual characters is better.

In the third example, splitting into two groups with sum zero is better than splitting into individual characters with penalty 6.

So, it's about finding groups where the sum is zero or as close to zero as possible.

Wait, but in the third example, splitting into three groups with sum zero would still give total penalty zero.

So, it's not necessarily about the number of groups, but about making sure that each group has a sum of zero.

But in the first example, with only one "+", I have to take penalty 1.

Cannot make the sum zero.

Similarly, in the second example, all "-", cannot make sum zero in any group.

In the fourth example, n=10, s="--+++++++-"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Sum is -2 + 7 -1 = 4

If I split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First group sum is -2 + 7 = 5, penalty |5| * 9 = 45

Second group sum is -1, penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty 46, which is worse than the optimal 4.

So, splitting into more groups can be better.

Alternatively, splitting into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First group sum -2, penalty | -2 | * 2 = 4

Second group sum 7, penalty |7| * 7 = 49

Third group sum -1, penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty 4 + 49 + 1 = 54

Still worse.

What about [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1, -1 ]

First group: sum 0, penalty 0

Second group: sum 0, penalty 0

Third group: sum 4, penalty |4| * 4 = 16

Fourth group: sum -2, penalty | -2 | * 2 = 4

Total penalty: 0 + 0 + 16 + 4 = 20

Better, but still not 4.

What about [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First group: sum -2 + 4 = 2, penalty |2| * 6 = 12

Second group: sum 1 + 1 -1 = 1, penalty |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 15

Still not 4.

What's the optimal split?

Maybe [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1 ]

First: 0, penalty 0

Second: 0, penalty 0

Third: 0, penalty 0

Fourth: 3, penalty |3| * 3 = 9

Total: 9

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: sum -2 + 5 = 3, penalty |3| * 7 = 21

Second: sum 1 -1 = 0, penalty 0

Total: 21

Worse.

I must be missing something.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" characters minus the number of "+" characters, but considering the absolute value and multiplied by the length.

Wait, no.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

First: n=1, s="+", output=1

Second: n=5, s="-----", output=5

Third: n=6, s="+-+-+ -", output=0

Fourth: n=10, s="-- +++++ -", output=4

Fifth: n=20, s="+--- +++++ -+++++ --- ++ -", output=4

Wait, in the second test case, all "-", so no way to make sum zero in any group.

Hence, splitting into individual elements gives penalty 5.

But in the third test case, I can split into groups where each group has equal number of "+" and "-", so sum is zero.

Hence, penalty zero.

In the fourth test case, n=10, s="-- +++++ -"

Let me count the number of "+" and "-":

s = "-- +++++ -"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Number of "+": 7

Number of "-": 3

Total sum: 7 - 3 = 4

To minimize the penalty, I need to split in a way that minimizes the sum times length for each group.

I think the minimal penalty is n - 2 * number of "-".

Wait, in the second test case, n=5, number of "- "=5, so 5 - 2*5 = -5, but output is 5.

Wait, maybe it's n - 2*(number of "-") if n != number of "-", else n.

In the second test case, n=5, number of "- "=5, output is 5.

In the first test case, n=1, number of "- "=0, 1 - 2*0=1, matches output.

In the third test case, n=6, number of "- "=3, 6 - 2*3=0, matches output.

Fourth test case, n=10, number of "- "=3, 10 - 2*3=4, matches output.

Fifth test case, n=20, number of "- "=7, 20 - 2*7=6, but output is 4.

Wait, doesn't match.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in the fifth test case, number of "- "=7, n=20, 20 - 14 =6, but output is 4.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Looking back, perhaps the minimal penalty is 2 times the number of "- " minus the minimal between number of "- " and number of "+".

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's n minus 2 times the minimum of the number of "- " and the number of "+".

In the first test case, n=1, number of "- "=0, number of "+ "=1, so 1 - 2*0=1, matches.

Second test case, n=5, number of "- "=5, number of "+ "=0, 5 - 2*0=5, matches.

Third test case, n=6, number of "- "=3, number of "+ "=3, 6 - 2*3=0, matches.

Fourth test case, n=10, number of "- "=3, number of "+ "=7, 10 - 2*3=4, matches.

Fifth test case, n=20, number of "- "=7, number of "+ "=13, 20 - 2*7=6, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 2 * min(number of "- ", number of "+").

In the fifth test case, min(7,13)=7, so 20 - 14=6, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n - 2 * min(number of "- ", number of "+", consecutive patterns).

I need to think differently.

Let me look at the fourth test case again.

n=10, s="-- +++++ -"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Sum is -2 +7 -1 =4

To minimize penalty, perhaps I need to split where the sum changes in a way that balances the groups.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is 2 times the absolute difference between number of "+ " and number of "- ".

In the first test case, |1-0|=1, 2*1=2, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

Second test case, |0-5|=5, 2*5=10, but output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Third test case, |3-3|=0, 2*0=0, matches.

Fourth test case, |7-3|=4, 2*4=8, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Fifth test case, |13-7|=6, 2*6=12, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

This isn't working.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of splits needed to balance the string.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is the difference between n and twice the number of "- ".

Wait, in the second test case, n=5, number of "- "=5, 5 - 2*5= -5, but output is 5.

Wait, maybe it's the absolute value: |n - 2 * number of "- "|.

In the first test case, |1 - 0|=1, matches.

Second test case, |5 - 10|=5, matches.

Third test case, |6 - 6|=0, matches.

Fourth test case, |10 - 6|=4, matches.

Fifth test case, |20 - 14|=6, but output is 4.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of splits to make each subgroup have equal number of "+ " and "- ".

But in the fifth test case, with 13 "+" and 7 "-", it's not possible to have all groups with equal number of "+" and "- ".

Wait, perhaps it's n minus 2 times the number of "- " when number of "- " is less than or equal to number of "+ ", else n.

In the first test case, number of "- "=0 < 1, so 1 - 0 =1, matches.

Second test case, number of "- "=5 >0, but 5 >0, and n=5, output=5.

Third test case, number of "- "=3 <=3, 6 - 6=0, matches.

Fourth test case, number of "- "=3 <=7, 10 - 6=4, matches.

Fifth test case, number of "- "=7 <=13, 20 -14=6, but output is 4.

Still not matching.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 2 * min(number of "- ", number of "+ ") when number of "- " != number of "+ ", else n.

But in the fifth test case, min(7,13)=7, 20 -14=6, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n - 2 * number of "- " when number of "- " <= number of "+ ", else n.

In the fifth test case, number of "- "=7 <=13, so 20 -14=6, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

I need to find another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when the sum of each subgroup is as close to zero as possible.

Which means, for each subgroup, the difference between number of "+ " and number of "- " should be minimized.

Hence, the total penalty would be the sum of absolute differences times the length of each subgroup.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider the entire string and find a way to group "+" and "- " in a way that balances each subgroup.

But I'm not making progress this way.

Let me look at the code provided and see if it makes sense.

The code is:

t = int(input())

while t:

func_1()

t -= 1

def func_1():

n = int(input())

s = input()

neg = 0

for i in s:

if i == '-':

neg += 1

print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)

So, it counts the number of "- " in the string, and then computes n - 2 * neg, unless n == neg, in which case it prints n.

In the first test case, n=1, neg=0, 1 - 0 =1, matches.

Second test case, n=5, neg=5, since n == neg, prints 5, matches.

Third test case, n=6, neg=3, 6 - 6 =0, matches.

Fourth test case, n=10, neg=3, 10 - 6=4, matches.

Fifth test case, n=20, neg=7, 20 -14=6, but output is 4.

Doesn't match.

Hence, the code is incorrect for the fifth test case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the output for the fifth test case is 4, but according to this code, it would output 6.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
