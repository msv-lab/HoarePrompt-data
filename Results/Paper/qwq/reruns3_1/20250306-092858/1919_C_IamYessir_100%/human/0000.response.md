Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called "penalty". The penalty for a subsequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, if in s, s_i < s_{i+1}, that's one penalty. Same for t. I need to find the minimum total penalty possible by optimally splitting the array into s and t.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, s and t are subsequences of the original array a, and together they include all elements of a.

My goal is to split a into s and t in such a way that the sum of penalties in s and t is minimized.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

5

1 2 3 4 5

An optimal split is s = [2,4,5], t = [1,3]. Penalty for s: 2 (2<4 and 4<5), penalty for t: 1 (1<3). Total penalty = 3.

Another possible split: s = [1,2,3,4,5], t = []. Penalty for s: 4 (1<2,2<3,3<4,4<5), t: 0. Total penalty = 4, which is worse.

So, by splitting, I can reduce the total penalty.

In the second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

An optimal split is s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3]. Penalty for s: 0 (no increasing pairs), penalty for t: 1 (1<7). Total penalty = 1.

In the third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

An optimal split is s = [], t = [3,3,3,3,3]. Penalty for s: 0, penalty for t: 0 (no increasing pairs since all are equal). Total penalty = 0.

From these examples, it seems that the optimal strategy is to distribute the elements in such a way that increasing sequences are broken into different subsequences.

I recall that in sequence splitting problems, especially those involving minimizing penalties related to increasing or decreasing sequences, a useful approach is to use a greedy algorithm, possibly maintaining multiple sequences and deciding where to place each new element.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, and minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of p(s) and p(t), where p is the number of increasing adjacent pairs in each subsequence.

One way to minimize the total penalty is to maximize the number of non-increasing adjacent pairs across both subsequences. Wait, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as assigning elements to s or t in a way that minimizes the number of times an element is smaller than its successor in the same subsequence.

I need to decide for each element whether to put it in s or t, given the previous elements in s and t.

Let me consider the algorithm provided in the program and see if it makes sense.

The program iterates through each element in the array and decides whether to append it to s (a) or t (b) based on certain conditions.

Looking at the code:

for each element lit[i]:

if len(a) == 0:

x = float('inf')

else:

x = a[-1]

if len(b) == 0:

y = float('inf')

else:

y = b[-1]

Then, it has conditions based on the relationship between x, y, and lit[i].

Specifically:

if x > y:

if y >= lit[i]:

b.append(lit[i])

elif lit[i] > x:

b.append(lit[i])

elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:

a.append(lit[i])

elif x == y:

a.append(lit[i])

elif x < y:

if x >= lit[i]:

a.append(lit[i])

elif lit[i] > y:

a.append(lit[i])

elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:

b.append(lit[i])

After processing all elements, it calculates the penalties for s and t and sums them up.

I need to verify if this logic correctly minimizes the total penalty.

Let me try to understand the logic:

- It maintains two subsequences, a and b.

- For each new element, it decides whether to append it to a or b based on the last elements of a and b.

- The conditions seem designed to place the element in a or b in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

Let me consider a simple example:

n = 3

a = [1,2,3]

According to the algorithm:

Initialize a and b as empty.

i=0, lit[0]=1

a is empty, so x=inf

b is empty, so y=inf

Since x > y (inf > inf is False), we go to the elif x == y:

x == y, so append 1 to a.

Now, a = [1], b = []

i=1, lit[1]=2

x = a[-1] = 1

y = b[-1] = inf

Since x < y (1 < inf), we check:

if x >= lit[i]:

1 >= 2 is False

elif lit[i] > y:

2 > inf is False

elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:

inf >= 2 and 2 > 1 → True, so append 2 to b.

Now, a = [1], b = [2]

i=2, lit[2]=3

x = 1, y = 2

x < y, so same conditions:

if x >= lit[i]:

1 >= 3 is False

elif lit[i] > y:

3 > 2 is True, so append 3 to a.

Now, a = [1,3], b = [2]

Calculate penalties:

p(a) = 1 (1 < 3)

p(b) = 0

Total penalty = 1

But, an optimal split could be a = [1,2], b = [3]

p(a) = 1 (1 < 2)

p(b) = 0

Total penalty = 1, same as above.

Another optimal split: a = [1,3], b = [2], which also gives total penalty = 1.

But is there a better split?

If a = [1,2,3], b = []

p(a) = 2 (1<2 and 2<3), p(b)=0 → total penalty = 2

Not better.

Or a = [1,3], b = [2], which is what the algorithm did.

Alternatively, a = [1], b = [2,3]

p(a)=0, p(b)=1 (2<3) → total penalty = 1, same as above.

So, in this case, the algorithm produces an optimal split.

Let me try another example:

n=4

a=[1,2,3,4]

Following the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=1 → append to a (a=[1], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=2 → x=1, y=inf → since x < y, check if 1 >= 2? False

elif 2 > inf? False

elif inf >= 2 and 2 > 1 → True, append 2 to b (a=[1], b=[2])

i=2, lit[2]=3 → x=1, y=2

x < y, so if 1 >= 3? False

elif 3 > 2? True, append 3 to a (a=[1,3], b=[2])

i=3, lit[3]=4 → x=3, y=2

x > y, so if 2 >= 4? False

elif 4 > 3? True, append 4 to b (a=[1,3], b=[2,4])

Penalties:

p(a): 1 (1<3)

p(b): 1 (2<4)

Total penalty = 2

Is there a better split?

Consider a=[1,2,4], b=[3]

p(a): 2 (1<2 and 2<4)

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 2, same as above.

Another split: a=[1,3], b=[2,4]

p(a): 1 (1<3)

p(b): 1 (2<4)

Total penalty = 2

Another split: a=[1,2], b=[3,4]

p(a): 1 (1<2)

p(b): 1 (3<4)

Total penalty = 2

Seems like 2 is the minimal possible.

Another split: a=[1,3,4], b=[2]

p(a): 2 (1<3 and 3<4)

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 2

Same as above.

So, the algorithm seems to produce an optimal split in these cases.

Let me check the third test case:

n=5

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=3 → append to a (a=[3], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=3 → x=3, y=inf

x < y, so if 3 >= 3? True, append to a (a=[3,3], b=[])

i=2, lit[2]=3 → x=3, y=inf

x < y, if 3 >= 3? True, append to a (a=[3,3,3], b=[])

Similarly, all elements go to a.

Penalties:

p(a): 0 (no increasing pairs)

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 0

Which matches the optimal split mentioned in the example.

Wait, but in the example, it says an optimal split is s=[], t=[3,3,3,3,3], which also has total penalty 0.

So, both ways are optimal.

The algorithm in this case chose to put all elements in a, which is also optimal.

Another test case:

n=1

a=[1]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=1 → append to a (a=[1], b=[])

Penalties:

p(a): 0

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 0

Which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[2,1]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=2 → append to a (a=[2], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=1 → x=2, y=inf

x < y is False, since x=2, y=inf

Wait, in the code, it's:

if x > y:

...

elif x == y:

...

else: # x < y

...

So, x=2 < y=inf, so x < y is True.

Then, if x >= lit[i]: 2 >= 1? True, append to a.

So, a=[2,1], b=[]

Penalties:

p(a): 0 (1 is not greater than 2)

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 0

Which is optimal.

Another split could be a=[2], b=[1], penalties: 0 + 0 = 0, same.

So, again, the algorithm produces an optimal split.

Now, let's consider a more tricky case:

n=4

a=[3,1,4,2]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=3 → append to a (a=[3], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=1 → x=3, y=inf

x < y, if 3 >= 1? True, append to a (a=[3,1], b=[])

i=2, lit[2]=4 → x=1, y=inf

x < y, if 1 >= 4? False

elif 4 > inf? False

elif inf >=4 and 4 >1 → True, append to b (a=[3,1], b=[4])

i=3, lit[3]=2 → x=1, y=4

x < y, if 1 >=2? False

elif 2 >4? False

elif 4 >=2 and 2 >1 → True, append to b (a=[3,1], b=[4,2])

Penalties:

p(a): 0 (1 is not greater than 3)

p(b): 1 (2 >4 is False, but 4 <2 is not considered since it's 4,2)

Wait, how is p(b) calculated? It's the number of times b_i < b_{i+1}.

So, b=[4,2]: 4 < 2? No, so p(b)=0

Total penalty = 0

Is there a better split? Let's see.

Another split: a=[3,4], b=[1,2]

p(a): 1 (3<4)

p(b): 1 (1<2)

Total penalty = 2

Worse than the algorithm's split.

Another split: a=[3,1,2], b=[4]

p(a): 1 (1<2)

p(b): 0

Total penalty = 1

Another split: a=[3,4,2], b=[1]

p(a): 1 (3<4)

p(b): 0

Total penalty =1

So, 1 is better than the algorithm's 0.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, it produced a total penalty of 0.

Wait, let's recheck.

Wait, in b=[4,2], p(b) is the number of times b_i < b_{i+1}.

So, 4 < 2? No, so p(b)=0

a=[3,1], p(a): 1<3? No, so p(a)=0

Total penalty =0

But is this really optimal?

Wait, in the split a=[3,1,2], b=[4], total penalty=1

But 0 is better than 1, so the algorithm's split is better.

Wait, but is there any increasing pair in a or b?

In a=[3,1], no increasing pair.

In b=[4,2], no increasing pair.

So, total penalty=0, which is indeed optimal.

So, in this case, the algorithm produces an optimal split.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,3,2,4,5]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=1 → append to a (a=[1], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=3 → x=1, y=inf

x < y, if 1 >=3? False

elif 3 > inf? False

elif inf >=3 and 3 >1 → True, append to b (a=[1], b=[3])

i=2, lit[2]=2 → x=1, y=3

x < y, if 1 >=2? False

elif 2 >3? False

elif 3 >=2 and 2 >1 → True, append to b (a=[1], b=[3,2])

i=3, lit[3]=4 → x=1, y=2

x < y, if 1 >=4? False

elif 4 >2? True, append to a (a=[1,4], b=[3,2])

i=4, lit[4]=5 → x=4, y=2

x > y, if 2 >=5? False

elif 5 >4? True, append to b (a=[1,4], b=[3,2,5])

Penalties:

p(a): 1 (1<4)

p(b): 1 (2<5)

Total penalty = 2

Is there a better split?

Consider a=[1,3,5], b=[2,4]

p(a): 2 (1<3 and 3<5)

p(b): 1 (2<4)

Total penalty =3, worse.

Another split: a=[1,2,4], b=[3,5]

p(a): 2 (1<2 and 2<4)

p(b): 1 (3<5)

Total penalty=3, worse.

Another split: a=[1,3,4,5], b=[2]

p(a): 3 (1<3,3<4,4<5)

p(b): 0

Total penalty=3, worse.

Another split: a=[1,2,5], b=[3,4]

p(a): 2 (1<2 and 2<5)

p(b): 1 (3<4)

Total penalty=3, still worse.

The algorithm's split seems better.

But is there a split with total penalty less than 2?

Wait, a=[1,3,4], b=[2,5]

p(a): 2 (1<3 and 3<4)

p(b): 1 (2<5)

Total penalty=3

Not better.

Another split: a=[1,2,3,4,5], b=[]

p(a): 4 (1<2,2<3,3<4,4<5)

p(b):0

Total penalty=4

Worse.

So, the algorithm's split seems optimal.

Hence, I think the given program is correct.

I need to verify one more example to be sure.

Consider n=6

a=[1,3,2,4,3,5]

According to the algorithm:

i=0, lit[0]=1 → append to a (a=[1], b=[])

i=1, lit[1]=3 → x=1, y=inf

x < y, if 1 >=3? False

elif 3 > inf? False

elif inf >=3 and 3 >1 → True, append to b (a=[1], b=[3])

i=2, lit[2]=2 → x=1, y=3

x < y, if 1 >=2? False

elif 2 >3? False

elif 3 >=2 and 2 >1 → True, append to b (a=[1], b=[3,2])

i=3, lit[3]=4 → x=1, y=2

x < y, if 1 >=4? False

elif 4 >2? True, append to a (a=[1,4], b=[3,2])

i=4, lit[4]=3 → x=4, y=2

x > y, if 2 >=3? False

elif 3 >4? False

elif 2 >=3 and 3 >2? False, so append to a (a=[1,4,3], b=[3,2])

Wait, according to the code:

if x > y:

if y >= lit[i]:

b.append(lit[i])

elif lit[i] > x:

b.append(lit[i])

elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:

a.append(lit[i])

elif x == y:

a.append(lit[i])

else: # x < y

if x >= lit[i]:

a.append(lit[i])

elif lit[i] > y:

a.append(lit[i])

elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:

b.append(lit[i])

In this case, x=4, y=2, lit[i]=3

x > y: True

if y >= lit[i]: 2 >=3? False

elif lit[i] > x: 3 >4? False

else: a.append(lit[i]) → a=[1,4,3], b=[3,2]

i=5, lit[5]=5 → x=3, y=2

x > y: True

if y >=5? 2 >=5? False

elif 5 > x? 5 >3? True, append to b (a=[1,4,3], b=[3,2,5])

Penalties:

p(a): 1 (1<4), p(b):1 (2<5), total penalty=2

Is there a better split?

Consider a=[1,3,5], b=[2,4,3]

p(a): 2 (1<3 and 3<5)

p(b): 1 (2<4), total penalty=3

Worse.

Another split: a=[1,2,4], b=[3,3,5]

p(a): 2 (1<2 and 2<4)

p(b): 1 (3<5), total penalty=3

Worse.

Another split: a=[1,3,4,5], b=[2,3]

p(a): 3 (1<3,3<4,4<5)

p(b):1 (2<3), total penalty=4

Worse.

Seems like the algorithm's split is better.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct in producing the minimum possible penalty.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{0} \]

**Correctness: True**
