Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position instead. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], and applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. Essentially, for any number that's at least 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original number. This can be done any number of times on any qualifying element.

So, the goal is to see if, after possibly splitting some numbers into their digits, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me consider the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] → This is sorted.

   - Alternatively, splitting 45: [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] → Not sorted.

   - Splitting both: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67] → Sorted.

   - So, YES.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - Splitting 12: [1, 2, 28, 5] → Not sorted.

   - Splitting 28: [12, 2, 8, 5] → Not sorted.

   - Splitting both: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5] → Not sorted.

   - Seems like no matter what I do, I can't get it sorted.

   - So, NO.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

   - So, YES.

From these examples, it seems that I need to explore different possibilities of splitting numbers to see if I can achieve a sorted array.

Now, thinking about how to approach this programmatically. The straightforward way might be to recursively try splitting or not splitting each number that's at least 10 and check if any of these configurations result in a sorted array.

However, considering the constraints, n can be up to 50, and each a_i can be up to 99. So, in the worst case, if all elements are, say, 10, each can be split into two digits, leading to a significant increase in the array length. But since n is small (n <= 50), and a_i <= 99, maybe an iterative approach can work.

Wait, but recursive approaches could be too slow for n=50, as the number of possible operations could be exponential.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me think differently. Instead of trying all possible splits, maybe I can simulate the process of splitting numbers in a way that allows the array to become sorted.

One idea is to iterate through the array and ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the next, I need to see if splitting that element or the next one can fix the issue.

But splitting a number can affect the relative order with neighboring elements. It's a bit tricky.

Another idea: since splitting a number into digits can only make those digits smaller (since they're individual digits, max 9), perhaps I can consider all possible splits and see if there's a way to arrange them to be non-decreasing.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to attempt a simple approach: iterate through the array, and if the current element is greater than the next one and also greater than or equal to 10, split the current element into its digits and insert them in place.

Then, after possibly performing such operations, check if the resulting array is sorted.

Wait, but in the first example, [12, 3, 45, 67], if we split 12, we get [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted. But according to the code, it seems to only split elements that are greater than the next one and also greater than or equal to 10.

In the first iteration, 12 > 3 and 12 >=10, so it splits 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5], 12 > 28 is False, so no split. Then 28 > 5 is True and 28 >=10, so split 28 into 2 and 8, resulting in [12, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted, so it seems to print 'No', which matches the expected output.

In the third example, [0, 0], no splits are needed, and it's already sorted, so 'Yes'.

Seems like this approach works for the given examples.

But I need to think if this is always correct.

Suppose we have [15, 2, 30, 4].

- First, 15 > 2, and 15 >=10, so split 15 into 1 and 5: [1, 5, 2, 30, 4]

- Now, 5 > 2, and 5 >=10? No, so no split.

- Then, 30 > 4, and 30 >=10, so split 30 into 3 and 0: [1, 5, 2, 3, 0]

- Now, check if [1,5,2,3,0] is sorted: it's not.

- So, the program would print 'No'.

But maybe there's a better way to split to make it sorted. For example:

- Split 15 and 30: [1,5,2,3,0] → not sorted.

- Alternatively, split only 30: [15,2,3,0] → still 15 > 2.

- Split 15 first: [1,5,2,3,0] → same as before.

- Maybe split 2, but 2 < 10, so can't split.

- So, seems like no way to make it sorted.

So, in this case, the program correctly prints 'No'.

Another test case: [20, 30, 15]

- 20 > 30? No.

- 30 > 15, and 30 >=10, so split 30 into 3 and 0: [20,3,0]

- Now, 20 > 3, so split 20 into 2 and 0: [2,0,3,0]

- Is [2,0,3,0] sorted? No.

- So, program would print 'No'.

But maybe there's a better way:

- Split 20 first: [2,0,30,15]

- Then, 0 > 30? No.

- 30 > 15, split 30: [2,0,3,0,15]

- Is [2,0,3,0,15] sorted? No.

- So, still 'No'.

Seems correct.

What if the array is [10, 1, 20, 30]?

- 10 > 1, split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,1,20,30]

- Now, 0 > 1? No.

- 1 < 20.

- 20 < 30.

- So, [1,0,1,20,30] is not sorted.

- So, program would print 'No'.

But maybe another way:

- Don't split 10 initially.

- 10 < 1? No, but 10 >1, so split 10: same as above.

- Seems like 'No'.

Another test case: [11,11,11]

- No need to split, already sorted.

- So, 'Yes'.

Edge case: [9,8,7]

- No splits possible since all <10.

- Not sorted, so 'No'.

Another edge case: [100,10,1]

- But a_i <=99, so this is invalid.

Wait, a_i can be up to 99, so no need to worry about numbers >=100.

Wait, no, a_i can be up to 99, as per the problem statement.

Another test case: [10,10,10]

- Already sorted.

- So, 'Yes'.

Wait, but splitting 10 into 1 and 0 would make it [1,0,10,10], which is not sorted.

But since they are equal, it's still sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but according to the problem, non-decreasing allows equal elements.

So, [10,10,10] is sorted.

But if I split one 10, it becomes [1,0,10,10], which is not sorted.

So, better to not split any.

Hence, 'Yes'.

Another test case: [19,2,10]

- 19 > 2, split 19 into 1 and 9: [1,9,2,10]

- Now, 9 > 2, split 9 into 9 (can't split, since 9 <10): can't split.

- So, [1,9,2,10] is not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe another approach:

- Split 19 and 10: [1,9,2,1,0]

- Which is not sorted.

- Still 'No'.

Seems correct.

Looking back at the code:

- It iterates through the list, and if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] >=10, it splits list1[p-1] into its digits.

- Then, after possible splits, it checks if the list is sorted.

- In the examples, it seems to work.

But I need to think if this approach is always correct.

Is there any case where this approach might not work, i.e., where it doesn't perform enough splits or splits in the wrong order?

Suppose we have [20, 30, 15].

- Initially, 20 > 15 and 20 >=10, so split 20 into 2 and 0: [2,0,30,15]

- Now, 0 > 30? No.

- 30 >15, split 30 into 3 and 0: [2,0,3,0,15]

- Is [2,0,3,0,15] sorted? No.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe if we split 30 first:

- Original: [20,30,15]

- Split 30: [20,3,0,15]

- Now, 20 >3, split 20: [2,0,3,0,15]

- Still not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, seems correct.

Another test case: [10,20,30]

- Already sorted.

- So, 'Yes'.

If I split 10: [1,0,20,30] → not sorted.

So, better to not split.

Hence, 'Yes'.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, the program would see that 10 <20 <30, so no splits are performed, and it's already sorted.

Hence, 'Yes'.

Good.

Another test case: [10,9,11]

- 10 >9, and 10 >=10, so split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,9,11]

- Now, 0 >9? No.

- 9 <11.

- So, [1,0,9,11] is not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe another approach:

- Don't split 10, and since 10 >9, and 9 <11, it's not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, correct.

Seems like the program's approach works for these cases.

But I need to think if there's any case where multiple splits are needed, and the program might not perform them correctly.

Consider [10,20,15].

- 10 <20, 20 >15, so split 20 into 2 and 0: [10,2,0,15]

- Now, 10 >2, split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,2,0,15]

- Is [1,0,2,0,15] sorted? No.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe another way:

- Split 10 first: [1,0,20,15]

- Then, 0 >20? No.

- 20 >15, split 20: [1,0,2,0,15]

- Still not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: [10,10,9]

- 10 >9, split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,10,9]

- Now, 0 >10? No.

- 10 >9, split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,1,0,9]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Seems correct.

Wait, but maybe if I split the second 10 first:

- Original: [10,10,9]

- Split second 10: [10,1,0,9]

- Now, 10 >1, split 10: [1,0,1,0,9]

- Not sorted.

- Still 'No'.

Hence, correct.

So, from these examples, it seems like the program's approach is correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a case where multiple splits are needed.

Test case: [10,20,30,25]

- 10 <20 <30 >25, so split 30 into 3 and 0: [10,20,3,0,25]

- Now, 20 >3, split 20 into 2 and 0: [10,2,0,3,0,25]

- Now, 10 >2, split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,2,0,3,0,25]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe another approach:

- Split 20 first: [10,2,0,30,25]

- Then, 10 >2, split 10: [1,0,2,0,30,25]

- Then, 0 >2? No.

- 2 <30 <25? 30 >25, split 30: [1,0,2,0,3,0,25]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: [10,11,12]

- 10 <11 <12, already sorted, 'Yes'.

If I split any of them, it would not be sorted.

So, better to not split.

Hence, 'Yes'.

Good.

Seems like the program works correctly for these cases.

Now, looking at the code:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

a = list1[p - 1]

list1.pop(p - 1)

list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

list1.insert(p, a % 10)

if func_1(list1):

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

def func_1(lst):

sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

return lst == sorted_lst

A few observations:

- The function func_1 checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

- The main logic is in the loop that iterates from 1 to len(list1)-1.

- For each position p, it checks if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] >10.

- If both conditions are true, it splits list1[p-1] into its digits and inserts them in place.

- After potentially performing these splits, it checks if the list is sorted.

Seems straightforward.

But I need to think if this approach might miss some cases where splitting a different element could lead to a sorted array.

For example, consider [20, 30, 15].

- According to the code:

- Check p=1: 20 >30? No.

- Check p=2: 30 >15 and 30 >10, so split 30 into 3 and 0: [20,3,0,15]

- Now, check if [20,3,0,15] is sorted: No.

- So, 'No'.

But is there a way to make it sorted?

- Split 20 first: [2,0,30,15]

- Then, split 30: [2,0,3,0,15]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: [10, 15, 20]

- 10 <15 <20, already sorted, 'Yes'.

If I split any, it would not help.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but what if I have [10, 15, 14]?

- 10 <15 >14, so split 15 into 1 and 5: [10,1,5,14]

- Now, 10 >1, so split 10 into 1 and 0: [1,0,1,5,14]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

But maybe another approach:

- Split 10 first: [1,0,15,14]

- Then, 0 >15? No.

- 15 >14, split 15 into 1 and 5: [1,0,1,5,14]

- Not sorted.

- So, 'No'.

Hence, correct.

Seems like the program's logic is sound.

I can't find any counterexamples where this approach would fail.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
