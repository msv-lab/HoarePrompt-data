Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the amount I get back is more than the total amount I bet on all outcomes.

First, I need to understand the constraints. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I get the number of outcomes n and the list of multipliers k_i for each outcome. The goal is to find bets x_i for each outcome such that the sum of all bets is less than k_i * x_i for every i.

So, mathematically, I need to find x_i (integers, at least 1) such that for every i from 1 to n:

sum of all x_j < k_i * x_i

Where j goes from 1 to n.

Let me rearrange this inequality:

sum of all x_j - k_i * x_i < 0

Or,

sum of (x_j for j ≠ i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i

This seems a bit tricky. I need to find values for x_i such that for each i, the sum of the other bets is less than (k_i - 1) times the bet on i.

Hmm, maybe there's a way to express x_i in terms of a common value. Let's think about it differently.

I recall that in some similar problems, using the least common multiple (LCM) helps. Maybe I can use the LCM of the multipliers or something related.

Wait, let's consider setting the bets in proportion to the multipliers. Suppose I set x_i = L / k_i, where L is the LCM of all k_i. Then, the sum of all x_j would be L * sum(1/k_j).

But, I need to check if sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i for each i.

Substituting x_i = L / k_i,

sum(x_j) = L * sum(1/k_j)

And k_i * x_i = k_i * (L / k_i) = L

So, the condition becomes:

L * sum(1/k_j) < L

Which simplifies to sum(1/k_j) < 1

Wait, that's interesting. So, the condition sum(1/k_j) < 1 is necessary for a solution to exist.

Is this always true given the constraints? The k_i are at least 2, and n can be up to 50.

For example, if n=1, k_1 >=2, then sum(1/k_j)=1/k_1 <1, so solution exists.

If n=2, k1=2, k2=2, sum=1/2 +1/2=1, which is not less than 1, so no solution.

If n=2, k1=2, k2=3, sum=1/2 +1/3=5/6 <1, solution exists.

So, in the second test case of the example, n=2, k=3,3, sum=1/3 +1/3=2/3 <1, so solution exists.

In the third test case, n=5, k=5,5,5,5,5, sum=1/5*5=1, which is not less than 1, so -1.

Wait, but in the example output, it's -1 for the third test case, which matches this condition.

So, the condition sum(1/k_j) <1 seems necessary.

But is it sufficient? Suppose sum(1/k_j) <1, does that guarantee a solution exists?

Let's see. If sum(1/k_j) <1, then set x_i = L / k_i, where L is the LCM of k_j.

Then, sum(x_j) = L * sum(1/k_j) < L

And k_i * x_i = L

So, sum(x_j) < L = k_i * x_i for each i.

Perfect, so this works.

But in the code provided, it's using L = lcm(a), and then a[i] = L // k_i

Then, sumo = sum(a[i])

If sumo >= L, then -1, else print a[i]

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, sumo = L * sum(1/k_i), and if sumo < L, which is equivalent to sum(1/k_i) <1, then it's okay.

But in the code, it's checking if sumo >= L, then print -1, else print the a[i].

Wait, but in the example, for the first test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

sum(1/k_i)=1/3 +1/2 +1/7 = (14 + 21 + 6)/42 = 41/42 <1

So, sumo = L * sum(1/k_i) = L * 41/42 < L

Hence, sumo < L, which is correct.

In the second test case, n=2, k=[3,3]

sum(1/k_i)=2/3 <1

But according to the problem, it's acceptable, which matches the code's logic.

In the third test case, n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

sum(1/k_i)=1, which is not less than 1, so sumo = L *1 = L, which is sumo >=L, so -1.

Perfect, so the code's logic seems correct based on this analysis.

But let's verify with the example outputs.

First test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

L = lcm([3,2,7]) = 42

x1 = 42//3 =14

x2=42//2=21

x3=42//7=6

sumo=14+21+6=41 <42

So, sumo < L, which is correct.

But in the example output, it's 27 41 12, which sums to 80 <84 (since L=84?)

Wait, hold on, perhaps I need to double-check the LCM.

Wait, k=[3,2,7], LCM of 3,2,7 is 42, as above.

But in the example, the output is 27 41 12, which sums to 80, and 3*27=81 >80, 2*41=82>80, 7*12=84>80.

So, why is the code outputting 14 21 6 in my calculation?

Wait, maybe there are multiple solutions, and the code is outputting the minimal possible L that satisfies the condition.

But in the example, it's outputting a different solution.

Wait, perhaps the code is not outputting the minimal L, but rather using the LCM directly.

Wait, but in my calculation, L=42, x=[14,21,6], sum=41 <42, which is correct.

But the example output is 27 41 12, which sums to 80 <84.

Wait, perhaps the example is using a different L.

Wait, 84 is also a multiple of LCM=42.

In fact, any multiple of LCM can be used, as long as sum(x_j) < L.

Because if x_i is scaled by a factor, L is scaled by the same factor, and the conditions remain satisfied.

So, in the example, they might have chosen a larger L to get different x_i.

But the code is using the LCM directly, which should also work as long as sum(1/k_i)<1.

So, in this case, sum(1/k_i)=41/42 <1, so sumo=41 < L=42, which is correct.

Hence, the code should output x_i = L // k_i for each i.

In this case, x=[14,21,6], which sums to 41 <42.

But the example output is different, but as long as it satisfies the condition, it's acceptable, since multiple solutions are allowed.

So, the code seems correct in this regard.

Let's look at another test case.

Second test case:

n=2, k=[3,3]

L=LCM(3,3)=3

x=[3//3=1, 3//3=1], sum=2 <3

Hence, output 1 1, which matches the example.

Third test case:

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

sum(1/k_i)=1, which is not less than 1, so -1, as in the example.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

sum(1/k_i)=1/7 +1/9 +1/3 +1/17 +1/9 +1/13

Let's calculate this:

1/3 ≈0.3333

1/7≈0.1429

1/9≈0.1111

1/13≈0.0769

1/17≈0.0588

Sum ≈0.3333 +0.1429 +0.1111 +0.0769 +0.1111 +0.0769 ≈0.8522 <1

So, solution exists.

L=LCM(7,9,3,17,9,13)

First, LCM of 7 and 9 is 63

LCM of 63 and 3 is 63

LCM of 63 and 17 is 63*17=1071

LCM of 1071 and 9 is still 1071

LCM of 1071 and 13 is 1071*13=13923

So, L=13923

Then, x_i = L // k_i

x1=13923//7=1989

x2=13923//9=1547

x3=13923//3=4641

x4=13923//17=819

x5=13923//9=1547

x6=13923//13=1071

Sum=1989+1547+4641+819+1547+1071=11614 <13923, which is correct.

But in the example output, it's 1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071, which matches this calculation.

Fifth test case:

n=3, k=[6,3,2]

sum(1/k_i)=1/6 +1/3 +1/2 =1/6 +2/6 +3/6=6/6=1, which is not less than 1, so -1, as in the example.

Sixth test case:

n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3]

sum(1/k_i)=1/9 +1/4 +1/6 +1/8 +1/3

Calculate:

1/3≈0.3333

1/4=0.25

1/6≈0.1667

1/8=0.125

1/9≈0.1111

Sum≈0.3333+0.25+0.1667+0.125+0.1111≈0.9861 <1, so solution exists.

L=LCM(9,4,6,8,3)

LCM of 9 and 4 is 36

LCM of 36 and 6 is 36

LCM of 36 and 8 is 72

LCM of 72 and 3 is still 72

So, L=72

x_i = L // k_i

x1=72//9=8

x2=72//4=18

x3=72//6=12

x4=72//8=9

x5=72//3=24

Sum=8+18+12+9+24=71 <72, which is correct.

Hence, the code's output matches the example.

Therefore, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic.

One thing to note is that the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is always a solution with x_i <=1e9.

In the code, since L is the LCM of k_i, and k_i <=20, n<=50, but sum of n over all test cases <=2e5.

Given that k_i <=20, the LCM of up to 50 numbers, each <=20, should not exceed some reasonable bound.

Wait, what's the maximum possible LCM of numbers up to 20?

The LCM of numbers from 1 to 20 is 232792560, which is less than 1e9.

But in our case, n<=50, but k_i <=20, so the LCM is at most 232792560.

Hence, L <=232792560

Then, x_i = L // k_i <=232792560 //2 =116396280, which is less than 1e9.

Hence, the solution satisfies the constraints.

Therefore, the code is correct.
