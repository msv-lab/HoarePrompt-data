Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each organized in a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making a total of 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take up 1x1 cells, and others take up 2x2 cells. The 2x2 icons occupy a square of 4 cells, and each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible. So, I need to figure out how to arrange x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons on as few screens as possible, given the constraints of the grid size.

First, I need to understand the grid and how the icons can be placed. Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, which looks like this:

```

Row 1: Cell (1,1) | Cell (1,2) | Cell (1,3)

Row 2: Cell (2,1) | Cell (2,2) | Cell (2,3)

Row 3: Cell (3,1) | Cell (3,2) | Cell (3,3)

Row 4: Cell (4,1) | Cell (4,2) | Cell (4,3)

Row 5: Cell (5,1) | Cell (5,2) | Cell (5,3)

```

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy a block of 4 cells. For example, cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) could be occupied by one 2x2 icon.

Given that each screen has 15 cells, and a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, we need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Let me try to visualize this. In a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 squares can be placed?

Looking at the grid:

- In row 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2: one 2x2 square

- In row 1 and 2, columns 2 and 3: another 2x2 square

- In row 3 and 4, columns 1 and 2: another 2x2 square

- In row 3 and 4, columns 2 and 3: another 2x2 square

- In row 4 and 5, columns 1 and 2: another 2x2 square

- In row 4 and 5, columns 2 and 3: another 2x2 square

Wait, but some of these overlap. Let's see:

- First 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 1-2

- Second 2x2: rows 1-2, columns 2-3

- Third 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 1-2

- Fourth 2x2: rows 3-4, columns 2-3

- Fifth 2x2: rows 4-5, columns 1-2

- Sixth 2x2: rows 4-5, columns 2-3

But actually, in a 5x3 grid, you can't have more than a certain number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares. Let's see:

If I place one 2x2 square in rows 1-2, columns 1-2, that occupies cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Then, another 2x2 square in rows 1-2, columns 2-3, which would occupy cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3). But this overlaps with the first square on cells (1,2) and (2,2), which is not allowed.

So, they can't both be placed simultaneously because they overlap.

Alternatively, if I place one 2x2 square in rows 1-2, columns 1-2, and another in rows 3-4, columns 1-2, that would be non-overlapping.

Similarly, another 2x2 square in rows 3-4, columns 2-3.

And another in rows 4-5, columns 1-2.

And another in rows 4-5, columns 2-3.

So, in total, per screen, I can place up to 4 non-overlapping 2x2 squares, occupying 16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, each 2x2 square occupies 4 cells. So, 4 squares would occupy 16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells. There must be some overlap or miscalculation here.

Let me try to sketch this out.

Let's label the cells:

Row 1: A1, A2, A3

Row 2: B1, B2, B3

Row 3: C1, C2, C3

Row 4: D1, D2, D3

Row 5: E1, E2, E3

Possible 2x2 squares:

- A1, A2, B1, B2

- A2, A3, B2, B3

- C1, C2, D1, D2

- C2, C3, D2, D3

- D1, D2, E1, E2

- D2, D3, E2, E3

Now, looking at these, some of them overlap:

- The first and second overlap on A2 and B2

- The third and fourth overlap on C2 and D2

- The fifth and sixth overlap on D2 and E2

- The first and third do not overlap

- The first and fifth do not overlap

- The second and fourth do not overlap

- The second and sixth do not overlap

So, the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares per screen is 3.

For example:

- Place one in A1, A2, B1, B2

- Another in C2, C3, D2, D3

- Another in E1, E2, D1, D2

Wait, but that would overlap on D2.

Wait, maybe:

- First 2x2: A1, A2, B1, B2

- Second 2x2: C2, C3, D2, D3

- Third 2x2: E1, E2, D1, D2

But this would overlap on D2.

Alternatively:

- First 2x2: A1, A2, B1, B2

- Second 2x2: C2, C3, D2, D3

- Third 2x2: E1, E2, D1, D2

Again, overlap on D2.

Alternatively:

- First 2x2: A2, A3, B2, B3

- Second 2x2: C1, C2, D1, D2

- Third 2x2: E2, E3, D2, D3

This still overlaps on D2.

It seems like it's impossible to place more than 3 non-overlapping 2x2 squares on a 5x3 grid without overlapping.

Wait, maybe only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 squares per screen.

For example:

- First 2x2: A1, A2, B1, B2

- Second 2x2: C2, C3, D2, D3

This doesn't overlap, and there are cells left: A3, B3, D1, E1, E2, E3.

So, only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 squares per screen.

Alternatively, maybe:

- First 2x2: A2, A3, B2, B3

- Second 2x2: C1, C2, D1, D2

- Third 2x2: E1, E2, D1, D2

But this overlaps on D1 and D2.

So, seems like only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 squares per screen.

Therefore, per screen, we can place up to 2 icons of 2x2, occupying 8 cells (2 icons * 4 cells each = 8 cells), leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the first arrangement:

- First 2x2: A1, A2, B1, B2

- Second 2x2: C2, C3, D2, D3

This occupies cells A1, A2, B1, B2, C2, C3, D2, D3.

The remaining cells are: A3, B3, C1, D1, E1, E2, E3: total of 7 cells.

So, yes, per screen, we can place 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1.

Alternatively, if we place only one 2x2 icon, it occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if we don't place any 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Now, the problem is to minimize the number of screens required to place all x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons.

Given that each screen can hold up to 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1, one approach would be to prioritize placing as many 2x2 icons as possible first, since they occupy more space.

But, we need to ensure that the arrangement is possible within the grid constraints.

Wait, but from the earlier analysis, per screen, we can have at most 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1.

But, in reality, it might be possible to arrange more 2x2 icons per screen, depending on their positions.

Looking back at the note in the problem, it shows examples where more than 2 icons are placed per screen.

Wait, in the first test case, with x=1 and y=1, the solution uses only one screen.

Looking at the grid:

- Suppose we place the 2x2 icon in the top-left corner: cells A1, A2, B1, B2.

- Then, the 1x1 icon can be placed in any of the remaining cells, say A3.

So, total cells used: A1, A2, B1, B2 for the 2x2 icon, and A3 for the 1x1 icon.

This uses only 5 cells, and there are 10 cells left unused.

But, according to the earlier analysis, per screen, we can have up to 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1.

But perhaps there's a better way to pack more 2x2 icons per screen.

Looking at the grid again:

- Place first 2x2 in A1, A2, B1, B2

- Place second 2x2 in C2, C3, D2, D3

- Place third 2x2 in E1, E2, D1, D2

But this would cause overlapping on D2.

Is there a way to place three 2x2 icons without overlapping?

Let me try a different arrangement.

- Place first 2x2 in A2, A3, B2, B3

- Place second 2x2 in C1, C2, D1, D2

- Place third 2x2 in E2, E3, D2, D3

This still overlaps on D2.

Another attempt:

- Place first 2x2 in A1, A2, B1, B2

- Place second 2x2 in C2, C3, D2, D3

- Place third 2x2 in E1, E2, D1, D2

Again, overlapping on D2.

It seems impossible to place three non-overlapping 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

Therefore, per screen, the maximum number of 2x2 icons is 2, occupying 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if we place only one 2x2 icon per screen, it occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if we don't place any 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Now, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of icons placed per screen.

Given that 2x2 icons occupy more cells, it might be beneficial to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, but we need to consider the constraints of the grid.

Wait, but from the earlier attempts, it's clear that per screen, we can have at most 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to arrange them.

Looking at the example provided in the problem, with x=1 and y=1, it's possible to place both on one screen, as shown in the figure.

Another example with x=12 and y=4 uses 2 screens.

So, perhaps there's a formula to calculate the minimum number of screens required.

Let me think in terms of total cell requirements.

Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon requires 1 cell.

So, total cells required = 4*y + x.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Therefore, the minimum number of screens needed would be ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But, this doesn't take into account the arrangement constraints.

Wait, in the first test case, x=1, y=1, total cells required = 4*1 + 1 = 5, and 5/15 = 0.333..., ceil(0.333) = 1, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4, total cells required = 4*4 + 12 = 28, 28/15 = 1.866, ceil(1.866) = 2, which also matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the tenth test case, x=8, y=2, total cells required = 4*2 + 8 = 16, 16/15 = 1.066, ceil(1.066) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, x=0, y=0, total cells required = 0, and the output is 0, which makes sense.

So, perhaps the minimal number of screens is simply ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But earlier, I thought that per screen, we can have at most 2 icons of 2x2 and 7 icons of 1x1, which also aligns with 2*4 + 7*1 = 8 + 7 = 15 cells, which matches the screen capacity.

Wait, but in the first test case, with y=1 (4 cells) and x=1 (1 cell), total 5 cells, which is less than 15, so one screen is sufficient.

In the third test case, y=4 (16 cells) and x=12 (12 cells), total 28 cells, which is more than 15 but less than 30, so two screens are needed.

Similarly, in the tenth test case, y=2 (8 cells) and x=8 (8 cells), total 16 cells, which requires two screens.

So, it seems that the formula ceil((4*y + x)/15) works.

But, is there any scenario where this formula would fail due to arrangement constraints?

Let me think about a case where y=3 and x=0.

Total cells required = 4*3 + 0 = 12, which is less than 15, so ceil(12/15) = 1 screen.

But, can we place three 2x2 icons on one screen without overlapping?

From earlier attempts, it seems impossible without overlapping, which would violate the condition that each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

Therefore, in such a case, we cannot place three 2x2 icons on one screen.

Hence, the formula ceil((4*y + x)/15) would suggest one screen, but due to arrangement constraints, it's impossible.

Therefore, the formula is not sufficient on its own; we need to consider the arrangement constraints.

So, perhaps we need to adjust the calculation to account for the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen.

Given that per screen, we can place at most two 2x2 icons, so the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y/2).

Then, the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons can be used for 1x1 icons.

Each screen with two 2x2 icons has 15 - 8 = 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

So, total screens needed would be max(ceil(y/2), ceil(y/2) + ceil(x - 7*ceil(y/2)/15)).

Wait, this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

First, calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y/2).

Then, calculate the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons: ceil(y/2)*15 - 4*y.

Then, see if x (the number of 1x1 icons) can fit into the remaining cells.

If x <= remaining cells, then the total screens needed are ceil(y/2).

If x > remaining cells, then additional screens are needed.

The additional screens required would be ceil((x - remaining cells)/15).

Therefore, total screens = ceil(y/2) + ceil((x - (ceil(y/2)*15 - 4*y))/15).

But this seems a bit messy.

Let me try to simplify it.

Let t = ceil(y/2).

Then, remaining cells after placing y 2x2 icons is t*15 - 4*y.

If x <= remaining cells, then total screens = t.

Else, total screens = t + ceil((x - remaining cells)/15).

This seems correct.

Let me test this with the sample inputs.

First test case: x=1, y=1.

t = ceil(1/2) = 1.

Remaining cells = 1*15 - 4*1 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Since x=1 <= 11, total screens = 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4.

t = ceil(4/2) = 2.

Remaining cells = 2*15 - 4*4 = 30 - 16 = 14.

Since x=12 <= 14, total screens = 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2.

t = ceil(2/2) = 1.

Remaining cells = 1*15 - 4*2 = 15 - 8 = 7.

Since x=8 > 7, additional screens needed: ceil((8-7)/15) = ceil(1/15) = 1.

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0.

t = ceil(0/2) = 0.

Remaining cells = 0*15 - 4*0 = 0.

Since x=0 <= 0, total screens = 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

t = ceil(3/2) = 2.

Remaining cells = 2*15 - 4*3 = 30 - 12 = 18.

Since x=0 <= 18, total screens = 2.

Which seems correct, as we cannot place three 2x2 icons on one screen due to overlapping.

Another test case: x=1, y=3.

t = ceil(3/2) = 2.

Remaining cells = 2*15 - 4*3 = 30 - 12 = 18.

Since x=1 <= 18, total screens = 2.

Which seems correct.

Another test case: x=16, y=2.

t = ceil(2/2) = 1.

Remaining cells = 1*15 - 4*2 = 15 - 8 = 7.

Since x=16 > 7, additional screens needed: ceil((16-7)/15) = ceil(9/15) = 1.

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2.

But, let's see if this is possible.

One screen: 2 icons of 2x2 (8 cells) and 7 icons of 1x1 (7 cells), total 15 cells.

Second screen: remaining 9 icons of 1x1.

But 9 icons need 9 cells, which is less than 15, so one additional screen is sufficient.

Total screens: 2.

Which matches the calculation.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

t = ceil(0/2) = 0.

Remaining cells = 0*15 - 4*0 = 0.

Since x=15 > 0, additional screens needed: ceil(15/15) = 1.

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1.

Which is correct, as 15 icons of 1x1 can fit into one screen.

Another test case: x=16, y=0.

t = ceil(0/2) = 0.

Remaining cells = 0*15 - 4*0 = 0.

Since x=16 > 0, additional screens needed: ceil(16/15) = 2.

Total screens = 0 + 2 = 2.

Which is correct.

Seems like this approach works for various cases.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b * 2

if t % 5 == 0:

t = t // 5

else:

t = t // 5 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

Let's see what this code is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it sets t = b * 2.

Then, if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1.

Wait, why is it doing t = b * 2?

Wait, earlier I had t = ceil(y/2), which is equivalent to (y + 1) // 2 in integer division.

But here, t = b * 2.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, maybe it's trying to calculate something else.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons.

But multiplying by 2 doesn't make sense for ceil(y/2).

Wait, maybe it's a different approach.

Let me see.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b * 4.

So, t is the number of screens, multiplied by 15 cells per screen, minus 4*b cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

Then, if t1 >= a, meaning if the remaining cells can accommodate all the 1x1 icons, then t remains the same.

Else, it calculates t2 = a - t1, which is the number of additional 1x1 icons that can't be placed in the current screens.

Then, it calculates how many additional screens are needed: if t2 % 15 == 0, then t2 // 15, else t2 // 15 + 1.

Finally, it adds these additional screens to t.

This seems similar to the approach I thought of earlier.

But there's a discrepancy in how t is calculated initially.

In my approach, t = ceil(y/2), which is equivalent to (y + 1) // 2.

But in the code, t = b * 2, and then if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1.

Wait, this seems like a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the author intended to calculate ceil(y/2), but implemented it incorrectly.

Wait, let's see with y=1: t=1*2=2, 2%5=2 !=0, so t=2//5 +1=0 +1=1, which is correct for ceil(1/2)=1.

With y=2: t=2*2=4, 4%5=4 !=0, t=4//5 +1=0 +1=1, but ceil(2/2)=1, which matches.

With y=3: t=3*2=6, 6%5=1 !=0, t=6//5 +1=1 +1=2, which matches ceil(3/2)=2.

With y=4: t=4*2=8, 8%5=3 !=0, t=8//5 +1=1 +1=2, but ceil(4/2)=2, which matches.

So, surprisingly, t = ceil(y/2) is equivalent to t = ceil(2*y/5), which is what the code seems to be calculating.

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil(y/2) is equivalent to (y + 1) // 2.

While in the code, t = b * 2, then if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1, which is equivalent to ceil(2*y / 5).

But ceil(y/2) is not necessarily equal to ceil(2*y/5).

Wait, for y=1: ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/5)=1, matches.

For y=2: ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(4/5)=1, matches.

For y=3: ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(6/5)=2, matches.

For y=4: ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(8/5)=2, matches.

For y=5: ceil(5/2)=3, ceil(10/5)=2, does not match.

Wait, there's a problem here.

When y=5:

ceil(5/2)=3

ceil(10/5)=2

So, t = b*2 = 10, 10%5=0, t=10//5=2

But ceil(5/2)=3, which is different.

So, the code would output t=2, but actually, ceil(y/2)=3.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

But in reality, per screen, we can place at most two 2x2 icons.

So, for y=5, we need at least ceil(5/2)=3 screens.

But according to the code, t=2.

So, this seems like a mistake in the code.

Let me check the sample input where y=5.

Wait, y=9 in one of the test cases.

Wait, y can be up to 99, as per the problem constraints.

But, in the sample input, the highest y is 9.

Let's see with y=9.

According to the code:

t = b*2 = 18

18 % 5 = 3 !=0, so t=18//5 +1=3 +1=4

But ceil(9/2)=5, which is different.

So, the code is miscalculating the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

This seems like a fundamental error in the logic.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a phone's desktop. Each screen is a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells), and icons cannot overlap.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each screen can hold up to 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons.
   - Calculate the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons: `ceil(y / 2)`.

2. **Calculate Remaining Cells After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each screen used for 2x2 icons can hold up to 2 icons, using 8 cells (since each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells).
   - Remaining cells on these screens can be used for 1x1 icons.

3. **Determine Additional Screens for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - Calculate the total cells used by 2x2 icons.
   - Subtract the cells used by 2x2 icons from the total cells available in the screens used for 2x2 icons to get remaining cells for 1x1 icons.
   - If there are still 1x1 icons left after using the remaining cells, calculate additional screens needed: `ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)`.

4. **Total Screens Required:**
   - Sum of screens used for 2x2 icons and additional screens for remaining 1x1 icons.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def min_screens(x, y):
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons
    screens_for_y = math.ceil(y / 2)
    
    # Calculate the remaining cells after placing y 2x2 icons
    total_cells_used_by_y = y * 4
    total_cells_available = screens_for_y * 15
    remaining_cells = total_cells_available - total_cells_used_by_y
    
    # If remaining cells can accommodate all x 1x1 icons
    if remaining_cells >= x:
        return screens_for_y
    else:
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        remaining_x = x - remaining_cells
        additional_screens = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)
        return screens_for_y + additional_screens

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        print(min_screens(x, y))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-step Calculation:**
  - Determine the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`ceil(y / 2)`).
  - Compute the cells used by these 2x2 icons (`y * 4`).
  - Calculate remaining cells in these screens (`screens_for_y * 15 - y * 4`).
  - Check if these remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons. If not, compute additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  
- **Efficiency:**
  - The approach ensures minimal screens are used by maximizing the placement of 2x2 icons and efficiently using the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Handles cases where only 1x1 icons are present.
  - Handles cases where only 2x2 icons are present.
  - Handles cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons need to be placed, ensuring no overlaps and minimal screen usage.
