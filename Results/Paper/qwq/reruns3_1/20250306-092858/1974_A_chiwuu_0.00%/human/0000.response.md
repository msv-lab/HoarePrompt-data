Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each organized in a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, totaling 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: 

1. 1x1 icons that take up one cell each.

2. 2x2 icons that take up a 2x2 square, which is 4 cells.

The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to figure out how to maximize the usage of each screen to accommodate as many icons as possible, considering both types.

Let me think about the screen layout. Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

I need to consider how many 2x2 icons can fit into a screen without overlapping and without leaving cells that cannot be used for other icons.

Given the screen is 5 rows by 3 columns:

- If I place a 2x2 icon, it will cover cells (r,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1).

- I need to ensure that after placing a 2x2 icon, the remaining cells can still be used optimally for other 2x2 icons or 1x1 icons.

Let me try to visualize this. Let's consider the screen as a grid:

Rows: 1 to 5

Columns: 1 to 3

Cells:

(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

(2,1) (2,2) (2,3)

(3,1) (3,2) (3,3)

(4,1) (4,2) (4,3)

(5,1) (5,2) (5,3)

Now, a 2x2 icon can be placed starting at (1,1), covering (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Similarly, another 2x2 icon can be placed starting at (2,2), covering (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).

But wait, the first 2x2 icon already covers (2,2), so placing another 2x2 icon starting at (2,2) would overlap.

So, perhaps the optimal way is to place non-overlapping 2x2 icons first and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

Let's see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen without overlapping.

Looking at the grid:

- Place one 2x2 icon at (1,1): covers (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Place another at (3,1): covers (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)

- Place another at (4,2): covers (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)

Wait, but (4,2) is already covered by the second icon placed at (3,1), which covers (4,2).

So, maybe a better arrangement:

- Place one at (1,1)

- Place one at (3,1)

- Place one at (5,1)

But (5,1) would cover (5,1), (5,2), (4,1), (4,2), which overlaps with the second icon.

Hmm, perhaps only two 2x2 icons can fit per screen without overlapping.

Let me try:

- Place one at (1,1): covers (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Place another at (3,1): covers (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)

- Now, remaining cells are (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)

None of these can form a 2x2 block, so only two 2x2 icons per screen.

Therefore, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Let's calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit after placing two 2x2 icons.

Total cells per screen: 15

Cells occupied by two 2x2 icons: 2 * 4 = 8

Remaining cells: 15 - 8 = 7

So, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But, depending on how the 2x2 icons are placed, maybe the remaining cells can be more or less.

Wait, in the earlier arrangement, after placing two 2x2 icons, there are seven cells left, but they might not all be usable for 1x1 icons if they are fragmented in a way that prevents additional 2x2 placements.

But since 1x1 icons can go into any single cell, all seven remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- Up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if fewer than two 2x2 icons are placed, more 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells.

So, the strategy should be to maximize the number of 2x2 icons placed first, as they occupy more space, and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

Given that, for a given number of y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, we need to find the minimum number of screens required.

Let me formalize this.

Let s be the number of screens.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But, we have to consider that the placement of 2x2 icons affects the available space for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but from the earlier analysis, placing two 2x2 icons leaves seven cells for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- If we place two 2x2 icons, we can place up to seven 1x1 icons.

- If we place one 2x2 icon, we can place up to eleven 1x1 icons (15 - 4 = 11).

- If we place zero 2x2 icons, we can place up to fifteen 1x1 icons.

But, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the use of 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but placing two 2x2 icons per screen allows for seven 1x1 icons additionally.

So, the capacity per screen is:

- Two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling 2*4 + 7*1 = 8 + 7 = 15 cells, which matches the screen size.

- Or, one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons: 4 + 11 = 15.

- Or, zero 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons.

But, in terms of minimizing screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, since they occupy more space.

So, the idea is to use as many screens as needed to place all the 2x2 icons, and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining spaces.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total space required and divide by the screen capacity.

But, since there are constraints on how 2x2 icons can be placed, it's not just about total cells.

But, from the earlier analysis, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, let's think in terms of the number of 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons.

Let y be the number of 2x2 icons, and x be the number of 1x1 icons.

Each screen can take up to two 2x2 icons.

So, the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But, each screen can also take additional 1x1 icons.

Specifically, each screen can take seven 1x1 icons along with two 2x2 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed along with the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2) * 7.

But, wait, if we have s screens, each can have up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But, if we have y 2x2 icons, we need at least ceil(y / 2) screens.

Let s1 = ceil(y / 2).

Then, the total 1x1 icons that can be placed in these s1 screens is s1 * 7.

If x <= s1 * 7, then s = s1.

Otherwise, we need additional screens to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

The remaining 1x1 icons are x - s1 * 7.

Each additional screen can hold up to fifteen 1x1 icons.

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - s1 * 7) / 15).

Therefore, the total number of screens s is:

s = s1 + ceil((x - s1 * 7) / 15)

Where s1 = ceil(y / 2)

But, we need to make sure that this formula correctly accounts for all possibilities.

Let me test this with the sample input.

Sample Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Sample Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Let's take the first test case: x=1, y=1

s1 = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed in s1 screens: 1 * 7 = 7

x=1 <=7, so s=1

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2

s1=ceil(2/2)=1

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed:1*7=7

x=7<=7, so s=1

Matches sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

s1=ceil(4/2)=2

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed:2*7=14

x=12<=14, so s=2

Matches sample output.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

s1=ceil(3/2)=2

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed:2*7=14

x=0<=14, so s=2

Matches sample output.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0

s1=ceil(0/2)=0

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed:0*7=0

x=1>0, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15)=1

Total s=0+1=1

Matches sample output.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

s1=ceil(1/2)=1

Total 1x1 icons that can be placed:1*7=7

x=8>7, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15)=1

Total s=1+1=2

But sample output is 1, which contradicts my calculation.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in my approach.

Wait, in this case, s1=1, can place 7 1x1 icons, but x=8, so need to place one more 1x1 icon.

An additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, but do I need to consider if there are any 2x2 icons left?

Wait, y=1 is already placed in s1=1 screen, so no remaining 2x2 icons.

Therefore, additional screens only need to account for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here, x - s1*7 = 8 - 7 =1

Ceil(1 / 15)=1

Total s=1+1=2

But sample output is 1, so there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the capacity.

Looking back, perhaps screens can be used more efficiently.

Looking at the first test case explanation provided:

It shows a screen with one 2x2 icon and three 1x1 icons, totaling 4 + 3 =7 cells used.

But according to my earlier calculation, with y=1, s1=1, and x=1, total 1x1 icons that can be placed is 7, which is more than enough for x=1.

But in the sample input where x=8 and y=1, according to my calculation, s=2, but sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the arrangement.

Let me look at the screen capacity more carefully.

Each screen is 5x3=15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

So, for y=1, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, x=8 can be placed in the remaining 11 cells.

Hence, total cells used: 4 (from 2x2) + 8 (from 1x1) =12 cells, leaving 3 cells empty.

So, yes, it can be done in one screen.

Therefore, my earlier approach was incorrect.

So, what's wrong with my earlier approach?

I assumed that each screen can take up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But in reality, a screen can take only up to two 2x2 icons, but the remaining cells depend on where the 2x2 icons are placed.

Wait, in the first arrangement I considered, two 2x2 icons leave seven cells.

But, if only one 2x2 icon is placed, it leaves eleven cells for 1x1 icons.

So, in the case where y=1 and x=8, one screen can accommodate the 2x2 icon and up to eleven 1x1 icons, which is more than enough for x=8.

Hence, only one screen is needed, contrary to my earlier calculation.

So, my earlier formula is flawed.

I need a better way to calculate the minimum number of screens.

Let me think differently.

I need to maximize the usage of each screen by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

Given that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, and the remaining cells can hold 1x1 icons.

But, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed depends on the number of 2x2 icons placed on that screen.

Wait, but in practice, placing one 2x2 icon leaves eleven cells for 1x1 icons, and placing two 2x2 icons leaves seven cells for 1x1 icons.

So, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I should iterate over the number of screens and check if the given number of screens can accommodate all the icons.

But, with t up to 10^4, and constraints on x and y, I need an efficient way.

Let me try to find a formula.

Let s be the number of screens.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and a certain number of 1x1 icons, depending on the placement.

But, to simplify, perhaps consider the total cell capacity.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, total cells needed are 4*y + x.

Then, the number of screens needed is ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But, this doesn't consider that 2x2 icons must be placed in a way that they don't overlap and the cells are appropriately arranged.

Wait, but in reality, due to the grid structure, it's not just about the total number of cells.

For example, with y=1 and x=8, total cells needed are 4*1 +8=12, which would fit into one screen (15 cells), but we need to ensure that the 2x2 icon can be placed in a way that doesn't interfere with the placement of 1x1 icons.

From the sample explanation, it seems possible to place one 2x2 icon and three 1x1 icons on one screen.

Similarly, in the case where y=1 and x=8, it should be possible to place one 2x2 icon and eight 1x1 icons on one screen, as 4 +8=12 <15.

But, perhaps there are constraints in the grid that prevent certain arrangements.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that placing a 2x2 icon reduces the available space for 1x1 icons in a way that's not just subtracting 4 cells.

But, in the earlier analysis, with y=1, s=1, and x=8 <=11, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

- For each screen, place up to two 2x2 icons, which take 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons.

- Or, place one 2x2 icon, taking 4 cells, leaving 11 for 1x1 icons.

- Or, place no 2x2 icons, leaving all 15 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., place two 2x2 icons per screen as much as possible.

So, let's calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons, given that each screen can take up to two 2x2 icons.

s1 = ceil(y / 2)

Then, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed in these s1 screens is s1 * (15 - 2*4) = s1 * 7

If x <= s1 * 7, then s = s1

Else, we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Remaining 1x1 icons: x - s1 * 7

Each additional screen can take up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, additional screens needed: ceil((x - s1 * 7)/15)

Total screens: s1 + ceil((x - s1 * 7)/15)

But, in the sixth test case, y=1, x=8

s1 = ceil(1 / 2) =1

s1 * 7 =7

x=8 >7, so additional screens needed: ceil((8-7)/15)=ceil(1/15)=1

Total s=1+1=2

But sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that each screen can take only 7 1x1 icons when two 2x2 icons are placed is incorrect.

From the earlier analysis, when only one 2x2 icon is placed, 11 1x1 icons can be placed.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the calculation based on whether y is odd or even.

If y is even, s1 = y / 2, and each of these screens can take two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

If y is odd, s1 = ceil(y / 2), meaning s1 = (y +1)/2, and one screen will have only one 2x2 icon, allowing for eleven 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of screens with two 2x2 icons and the number with one 2x2 icon.

Let me define:

- Let q = y // 2 (integer division)

- Let r = y % 2 (remainder)

Then, q screens can have two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons each.

One screen (if r=1) can have one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons.

So, total screens s1 = q + r

Then, the total capacity for 1x1 icons is:

- For q screens: q * 7

- For r screens: r * 11

Total capacity: q * 7 + r * 11

If x <= q * 7 + r * 11, then s = s1

Else, remaining 1x1 icons: x - (q * 7 + r * 11)

Each additional screen can take up to 15 1x1 icons.

Additional screens needed: ceil((x - q *7 - r *11)/15)

Total screens: s1 + ceil((x - q *7 - r *11)/15)

Let's test this with the sixth test case: y=1, x=8

q =1 //2=0

r=1

s1=0 +1=1

Capacity: 0*7 +1*11=11

x=8 <=11, so s=1

Which matches the sample output.

Great, this seems correct.

Let's test another case: y=4, x=12

q=4//2=2

r=0

s1=2 +0=2

Capacity:2*7 +0*11=14

x=12 <=14, so s=2

Matches sample output.

Another test: y=3, x=0

q=1

r=1

s1=1 +1=2

Capacity:1*7 +1*11=7+11=18

x=0 <=18, so s=2

Matches sample output.

Another test: y=0, x=15

q=0

r=0

s1=0

Capacity:0*7 +0*11=0

x=15 >0, so additional screens needed: ceil(15/15)=1

Total s=0+1=1

Matches sample output.

Another test: y=0, x=0

s1=0

Capacity:0

x=0 <=0, so s=0

Matches sample output.

Seems correct.

So, the formula is:

q = y // 2

r = y % 2

s1 = q + r

capacity = q * 7 + r * 11

if x <= capacity:

s = s1

else:

additional = ceil((x - capacity)/15)

s = s1 + additional

Now, to implement this in code.

But, in the code provided, it seems to follow a different approach.

Let's look at the given code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b * 2

if t % 5 == 0:

t = t // 5

else:

t = t // 5 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

So, let's try to understand this code.

It takes n test cases.

For each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it computes t = b * 2

Then, t = ceil(t / 5)

This is equivalent to t = ceil(2 * y / 5)

Then, it computes t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

If t1 >= a, then s = t

Else, compute t2 = a - t1

Then, s = t + ceil(t2 / 15)

Wait, this seems different from my approach.

Let me see if this matches the correct logic.

Take the sixth test case: y=1, x=8

t = 1 * 2 =2

ceil(2 /5)=1 (since 2 /5=0.4, ceil(0.4)=1)

t1 =1 *15 -1 *4=15-4=11

x=8 <=11, so s=1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test: y=4, x=12

t=4*2=8

ceil(8/5)=2

t1=2*15 -4*4=30-16=14

x=12<=14, s=2

Matches sample output.

Another test: y=3, x=0

t=3*2=6

ceil(6/5)=2

t1=2*15 -3*4=30-12=18

x=0<=18, s=2

Matches sample output.

Another test: y=2, x=7

t=2*2=4

ceil(4/5)=1

t1=1*15 -2*4=15-8=7

x=7<=7, s=1

But according to my earlier formula:

q=2//2=1

r=0

s1=1+0=1

capacity=1*7 +0*11=7

x=7<=7, s=1

So, matches.

Another test: y=2, x=8

t=4, ceil(4/5)=1

t1=15 -8=7

x=8>7

t2=8-7=1

ceil(1/15)=1

s=1+1=2

Is this correct?

According to my formula:

q=2//2=1

r=0

s1=1

capacity=1*7 +0*11=7

x=8>7

additional=ceil(1/15)=1

s=1+1=2

Same as code's approach.

Seems consistent.

So, perhaps the code's approach is also correct.

But, I need to understand why it works.

Looking at the code's logic:

t = b * 2

This seems to represent the number of "half" 2x2 icons, since each screen can take two 2x2 icons, which is four "halves".

Wait, perhaps t represents the number of "pairs" of 2x2 icons, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, t = b * 2

Then, t = ceil(t / 5)

Wait, 5 seems arbitrary here.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering that each screen can take up to five "halves" of 2x2 icons, since each 2x2 icon is considered as two "halves", and each screen can take up to two 2x2 icons, which is four "halves".

Wait, no, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering something else.

Let me think differently.

In the code, t = b * 2

Then, t = ceil(t / 5)

Then, t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

If t1 >= a, then s = t

Else, s = t + ceil((a - t1)/15)

I need to see the logic behind this.

Perhaps the author is considering that each "half" of a 2x2 icon requires certain resources.

But, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the author is considering the number of screens needed based on a different capacity calculation.

Given that my approach
