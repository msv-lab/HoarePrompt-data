Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, up, or down. It can't move outside the grid, and it can't skip the move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach cell (2,n) from cell (1,1).

First, I need to understand how the robot moves. It has a choice of direction in the first step, and then it follows the arrow in the cell it ends up in after that move.

Given that the grid has only two rows, the possible moves are limited. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but up and down only switch between the two rows.

Let me think about the movement in more detail.

Suppose the robot is in cell (r,c). In the first step, it can choose to move left, right, up, or down, but it can't move outside the grid.

- If it moves left, it goes to (r, c-1), but only if c > 1.

- If it moves right, to (r, c+1), but only if c < n.

- If it moves up, to (r-1, c), but only if r > 1.

- If it moves down, to (r+1, c), but only if r < 2.

After moving, it then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, effectively, each move consists of two parts: a chosen move and then a mandatory move based on the arrow.

I need to model this movement to see if the robot can reach (2,n).

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

4

>><<

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

Output:

YES

YES

NO

YES

From the first test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

One possible path is:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Explanation:

- Start at (1,1), arrow is '>', so if it moves right to (1,2), then follows the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so it moves left to (1,1). That doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the two-step movement carefully.

Let's think again.

At each step:

1. The robot chooses to move in one direction (left, right, up, down).

2. Then it moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, for example, starting at (1,1):

- Choose to move right to (1,2).

- Then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

- So it loops back to (1,1).

Not useful.

- Choose to move down to (2,1).

- Then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so move right to (2,2).

- From (2,2), choose to move up to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

- Back to start.

- Alternatively, from (2,1), choose to move right to (2,2).

- Follow the arrow in (2,2), which is '>', so move right to (2,3).

- From (2,3), choose to move up to (1,3).

- Follow the arrow in (1,3), which is '<', so move left to (1,2).

- And so on.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

I recall that in grids with specific movement rules, it's often useful to model the movement as a graph and see if there's a path from the start to the end.

In this case, since the grid is only 2 rows, I can think of it as a graph with 2n nodes, and edges based on the possible movements.

But given the constraints, maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the problem, the key is that the robot has a choice in the first part of the move, and then is forced to move according to the arrow.

I need to find a sequence of such moves that leads from (1,1) to (2,n).

Let me consider the possible moves from any cell.

From cell (r,c):

- Choose to move left to (r,c-1), then follow the arrow in (r,c-1).

- Choose to move right to (r,c+1), then follow the arrow in (r,c+1).

- Choose to move up to (r-1,c), then follow the arrow in (r-1,c).

- Choose to move down to (r+1,c), then follow the arrow in (r+1,c).

But since r can only be 1 or 2, moving up from row 1 goes out of bounds, and moving down from row 2 goes out of bounds.

So, effectively:

- From row 1:

- Can move left to (1,c-1) and then follow the arrow there.

- Can move right to (1,c+1) and then follow the arrow there.

- Can move down to (2,c) and then follow the arrow there.

- From row 2:

- Can move left to (2,c-1) and then follow the arrow there.

- Can move right to (2,c+1) and then follow the arrow there.

- Can move up to (1,c) and then follow the arrow there.

Now, the arrows are either '<' or '>', which mean move left or move right, respectively.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, after choosing a direction and moving, it then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

But the arrow can only point left or right, not up or down.

So, after choosing a direction and moving, the arrow will make it move left or right again from there.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to simulate the movement for the first test case.

First test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

So, row 1: positions 1 to 4 with arrows: > < < >

Row 2: positions 1 to 4 with arrows: > > < >

Let's label the cells as (r,c), where r=1 or 2, c=1 to 4.

Arrows:

(1,1): >

(1,2): <

(1,3): <

(1,4): <

(2,1): >

(2,2): >

(2,3): <

(2,4): >

Starting at (1,1).

Possible moves:

1. Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

2. Choose to move down to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so move right to (2,2).

From (2,2):

1. Choose to move right to (2,3), then follow the arrow in (2,3), which is '<', so move left to (2,2).

2. Choose to move up to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

3. Choose to move left to (2,1), then follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so move right to (2,2).

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps there's another way.

From (2,2), choose to move right to (2,3), then follow the arrow '<' to (2,2). Not useful.

From (2,2), choose to move up to (1,2), then follow '<' to (1,1). Back to start.

From (2,2), choose to move left to (2,1), then follow '>' to (2,2). Loop.

Seems like a dead end.

But according to the example, it's possible.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Let's look at the example path given in the note:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's simulate that.

Start at (1,1).

Move right to (1,2), then follow '<' to (1,1). Not matching the path.

Wait, maybe the path is interpreted differently.

Perhaps the two steps are combined into one move.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after choosing a direction and moving, then moving according to the arrow in the new cell, the robot ends up at a new position.

So, for example, from (1,1):

- Choose right to (1,2), then follow '<' in (1,2), which moves left to (1,1).

- Choose down to (2,1), then follow '>' in (2,1), which moves right to (2,2).

- Choose to move up to (1,1), but wait, up from (1,1) is out of bounds.

Wait, no, r=1, up is r=1-1=0, which is out of bounds.

So, from (1,1), up is invalid.

So, only right or down.

From (1,1):

- Right to (1,2), then follow '<' to (1,1).

- Down to (2,1), then follow '>' to (2,2).

From (2,2):

- Right to (2,3), then follow '<' to (2,2).

- Left to (2,1), then follow '>' to (2,2).

- Up to (1,2), then follow '<' to (1,1).

Seems like a loop.

But according to the example, there is a path.

Maybe I need to consider multiple steps.

Let's try another approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node is a cell, and there are edges based on the possible moves.

From each cell, the robot can choose to move in one of the four directions (if possible), and then follow the arrow in the new cell.

So, from (r,c), possible next positions are:

- If choosing left: move to (r, c-1), then follow arrow in (r, c-1).

- If choosing right: move to (r, c+1), then follow arrow in (r, c+1).

- If choosing up: move to (r-1, c), then follow arrow in (r-1, c).

- If choosing down: move to (r+1, c), then follow arrow in (r+1, c).

But the arrow only points left or right, so following the arrow doesn't allow moving up or down.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell".

So, after choosing a direction and moving, it then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, if it moves right to (r,c+1), and the arrow there is '<', it moves left to (r,c), for example.

This seems like the movement can be a bit unpredictable.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot's position after a full move (chosen move + arrow move) can be determined based on the initial choice.

Let me try to formalize this.

From cell (r,c):

- Choose to move left to (r,c-1), then follow the arrow in (r,c-1):

- If the arrow is '<', move left again to (r,c-2).

- If the arrow is '>', move right to (r,c).

- Choose to move right to (r,c+1), then follow the arrow in (r,c+1):

- If the arrow is '<', move left to (r,c).

- If the arrow is '>', move right to (r,c+2).

- Choose to move up to (r-1,c), then follow the arrow in (r-1,c):

- If the arrow is '<', move left to (r-1,c-1).

- If the arrow is '>', move right to (r-1,c+1).

- Choose to move down to (r+1,c), then follow the arrow in (r+1,c):

- If the arrow is '<', move left to (r+1,c-1).

- If the arrow is '>', move right to (r+1,c+1).

Given that r can only be 1 or 2, moving up from row 1 or down from row 2 is invalid.

So, from (1,c):

- Up is invalid.

- Down to (2,c), then follow arrow in (2,c):

- If '<', move to (2,c-1).

- If '>', move to (2,c+1).

From (2,c):

- Down is invalid.

- Up to (1,c), then follow arrow in (1,c):

- If '<', move to (1,c-1).

- If '>', move to (1,c+1).

This seems manageable.

So, from any cell, the possible next positions are:

From (1,c):

- Choose left: move to (1,c-1), then follow arrow in (1,c-1):

- If '<', move to (1,c-2).

- If '>', move to (1,c).

- Choose right: move to (1,c+1), then follow arrow in (1,c+1):

- If '<', move to (1,c).

- If '>', move to (1,c+2).

- Choose down: move to (2,c), then follow arrow in (2,c):

- If '<', move to (2,c-1).

- If '>', move to (2,c+1).

From (2,c):

- Choose left: move to (2,c-1), then follow arrow in (2,c-1):

- If '<', move to (2,c-2).

- If '>', move to (2,c).

- Choose right: move to (2,c+1), then follow arrow in (2,c+1):

- If '<', move to (2,c).

- If '>', move to (2,c+2).

- Choose up: move to (1,c), then follow arrow in (1,c):

- If '<', move to (1,c-1).

- If '>', move to (1,c+1).

This seems a bit complicated to simulate directly, especially with the constraints on n being up to 2*10^5 and t being up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

I need an efficient way to determine if (2,n) is reachable from (1,1).

Maybe I can think in terms of possible movements and see if there's a sequence that allows the robot to reach (2,n).

Let me consider that the robot needs to reach column n in row 2.

In row 2, to move to the rightmost column, it needs to be able to move right if the arrow allows or find a way to jump over columns based on the arrows.

But it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent possible movements after choosing a direction and following the arrow.

Then, I can perform a BFS or DFS to see if (2,n) is reachable from (1,1).

But with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way, probably O(n) per test case.

But BFS or DFS on a graph with 2n nodes would be acceptable since the total sum of n is 2*10^5.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows by choosing to move down or up, and within a row by choosing left or right and following the arrows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row based on the arrows and see if there's a way to switch rows at the right points to reach (2,n).

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for patterns or invariants.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

The example path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see how this path works:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow '<' in (1,2) to (1,1). Not matching the path.

Wait, perhaps the path is interpreted differently.

Maybe the path is a sequence of chosen moves, not positions after each move.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move);

2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, the robot first chooses a direction and moves, then follows the arrow in the new cell.

In the example path:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see how this could happen.

From (1,1):

- Choose right to (1,2), follow '<' in (1,2) to (1,1). Doesn't match the path.

Wait, maybe the path is showing the positions after both steps.

Wait, perhaps the path is after each full move (chosen move + arrow move).

In that case:

Start at (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow '<' in (1,2) to (1,1). So, ends up at (1,1).

Not matching the path.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that the movement is deterministic once the chosen move is made.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it differently.

Let me consider that from any cell, the robot's position after one full move (chosen move + arrow move) is determined.

So, from (r,c), for each possible chosen move, the final position after both steps can be determined.

Then, I can model the possible transitions between cells.

Then, I can build a graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent possible transitions after one full move.

Then, I can check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

This seems feasible.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to build the graph and check for reachability.

BFS seems appropriate, as it's efficient for this kind of problem.

Let me try to formalize the transitions.

From (r,c):

- Choose left:

- Move to (r,c-1), then follow arrow in (r,c-1):

- If arrow is '<', move left to (r,c-2).

- If arrow is '>', move right to (r,c).

- So, final positions:

- If c >= 2 and arrow in (r,c-1) is '<', then to (r,c-2).

- If c >= 1 and arrow in (r,c-1) is '>', then to (r,c).

- Choose right:

- Move to (r,c+1), then follow arrow in (r,c+1):

- If arrow is '<', move left to (r,c).

- If arrow is '>', move right to (r,c+2).

- So, final positions:

- If c <= n-1 and arrow in (r,c+1) is '<', then to (r,c).

- If c <= n-2 and arrow in (r,c+1) is '>', then to (r,c+2).

- Choose up:

- Move to (r-1,c), then follow arrow in (r-1,c):

- If r == 2:

- Move to (1,c), then follow arrow in (1,c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (1,c-1).

- If arrow is '>', move to (1,c+1).

- So, final positions:

- If r == 2 and arrow in (1,c) is '<', then to (1,c-1).

- If r == 2 and arrow in (1,c) is '>', then to (1,c+1).

- Choose down:

- Move to (r+1,c), then follow arrow in (r+1,c):

- If r == 1:

- Move to (2,c), then follow arrow in (2,c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (2,c-1).

- If arrow is '>', move to (2,c+1).

- So, final positions:

- If r == 1 and arrow in (2,c) is '<', then to (2,c-1).

- If r == 1 and arrow in (2,c) is '>', then to (2,c+1).

Given this, I can build a graph where each node is a cell (r,c), and edges go to the possible final positions after one full move.

Then, I can perform a BFS from (1,1) and see if I can reach (2,n).

This should work, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Implementing BFS on a graph with 2n nodes should be acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to think about this.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows by choosing to move down or up, and within rows based on the arrows.

Maybe I can model the movement within each row and see if there's a way to switch rows to reach the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of possible positions the robot can reach from the starting position.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the robot can reach any cell that is reachable through some sequence of moves as described.

Given that, I need to find if (2,n) is in the set of reachable cells from (1,1).

To implement this efficiently, perhaps I can represent the grid as a graph and perform a BFS.

But I need to optimize it.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I model the movement within each row based on the arrows and the choices the robot makes.

In row 1:

- The robot can choose to move left or right, then follow the arrow.

- It can also choose to move down to row 2.

Similarly, in row 2:

- The robot can choose to move left or right, then follow the arrow.

- It can choose to move up to row 1.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row independently, and see how switching between rows can help reach the target.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(str, input()))

b = list(map(str, input()))

if b[n - 2] == str('<'):

print('No')

else:

print('Yes')

So, for each test case, it reads n, then reads two strings a and b of length n representing the arrows in row 1 and row 2.

Then, it checks if the arrow in cell (2, n-1) (since indexing is from 1, n-1 is index n-2 in zero-based indexing) is '<'. If it is, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

Wait, is this correct?

In the first test case:

n=4

a = >><<

b = >>><

So, b[n-2] = b[2] (since n-2=2, zero-based index 2 is the third character) which is '<'. According to the program, it should print 'No', but in the example output, it's 'YES'.

Wait, that's contradictory.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, b[n-2] = b[2] which is '<', so the program would print 'No', but the example output is 'YES'.

So, the program seems incorrect for the first test case.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the indices.

Let me check.

n=4

b = >>><

Indices: b[0] = '>', b[1] = '>', b[2] = '<', b[3] = '>'

n-2 = 2, so b[2] = '<', so it should print 'No', but the example output is 'YES'.

So, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right", so column n-1 is column 3 in this case.

Yes, b[n-1] would be b[3] which is '>', but the program checks b[n-2], which is b[2] = '<'.

So, according to the program, it should print 'No', but the correct answer is 'YES'.

Hence, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

But perhaps there's a different logic behind it.

Let me see.

Maybe the author thought that to reach (2,n), the robot needs to be in (2,n-1) and the arrow there should not be '<', so it can move right to (2,n).

But in reality, it's more complicated because the robot can reach (2,n) from other positions as well.

For example, from (1,n), choose down to (2,n), then follow the arrow in (2,n).

Or from (2,n-1), choose right to (2,n), then follow the arrow in (2,n).

But the program only checks if b[n-2] == '<', which seems insufficient.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
