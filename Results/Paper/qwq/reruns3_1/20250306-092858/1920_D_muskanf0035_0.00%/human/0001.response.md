Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Jayden has an array that starts empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. There are two types of operations:

1. Append an integer x to the end of the array.

2. Append x copies of the current array to itself.

After performing all these operations, he has some queries where he wants to know the k-th element of the final array.

First, I need to make sure I understand how the array evolves with these operations.

Let's look at the first example in the problem:

5 operations and 10 queries.

Operations:

1. 1 1 → Append 1 to the array → array = [1]

2. 1 2 → Append 2 to the array → array = [1, 2]

3. 2 1 → Append 1 copy of the current array to itself → array = [1, 2, 1, 2]

4. 1 3 → Append 3 to the array → array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

5. 2 3 → Append 3 copies of the current array to itself → array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Queries are for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., 10th elements of this final array.

From the output, it's [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]

Wait, but according to the final array above, the 1st element is 1, 2nd is 2, 3rd is 1, and so on, which matches the output.

So, my task is to simulate these operations and then answer the queries.

But there's a catch: n and q can be up to 1e5, and t up to 5000, but the sum of n and q over all test cases doesn't exceed 1e5.

So, per test case, n and q can be up to 1e5, but across all test cases, the total n and q combined don't exceed 1e5.

This means I need an efficient solution, because if I try to simulate the array directly, it could become too large.

Looking back at the operations:

- When b=1, append x to the array.

- When b=2, append x copies of the current array to itself.

The problem says that before any b=2 operation, there is at least one b=1 operation, so the array is never empty when a b=2 operation is performed.

Also, x can be up to 1e9 for b=2 operations, which means that the size of the array can become very large, up to 1e9 elements or more, which is impossible to handle directly.

Therefore, I need a smart way to handle these operations without actually building the entire array.

Let's think about this.

For b=1 operations, it's straightforward: just append x to the array.

For b=2 operations, appending x copies of the current array to itself, if x is large, this could exponentially increase the size of the array.

But since x can be up to 1e9, and n can be up to 1e5, if I try to simulate this directly, it's impossible due to time and memory constraints.

Hence, I need a way to represent the array without storing all its elements explicitly.

One idea is to keep track of the structure of the array in a way that allows me to compute the k-th element on the fly, without constructing the entire array.

Let me consider the operations step by step and see how the array evolves.

Take the first example:

Initial array: []

Operation 1: b=1, x=1 → array = [1]

Operation 2: b=1, x=2 → array = [1, 2]

Operation 3: b=2, x=1 → array = [1, 2, 1, 2]

Operation 4: b=1, x=3 → array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Operation 5: b=2, x=3 → array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]

Now, if I have to find the 14th element, it's 2, and the 15th is 3, and so on.

But if I have to handle x up to 1e9, I can't store the array.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the length of the array after each operation.

For b=1 operations, the length increases by 1.

For b=2 operations, the length increases by len(a) * x.

Wait, actually, no. If I have array a, and I append x copies of a to itself, the new length will be len(a) + x * len(a) = len(a) * (x + 1).

But in the problem statement, it says a becomes [a, a, ..., a] x times, but looking back, it's [a, a, ..., a] x times, so the new array is a repeated x+1 times.

Wait, in the third operation of the first example:

After operation 2: b=2, x=1 → array = [1, 2, 1, 2], which is [1,2] repeated 2 times.

Similarly, in the fifth operation: b=2, x=3 → array is [1,2,1,2,3] repeated 4 times (original plus 3 copies).

So, actually, when b=2, x, it appends x copies of a to a, making the new array a repeated x+1 times.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- Initially, a = [1,2,1,2,3]

- Then, b=2, x=3 → a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Which is the original a concatenated with x=3 copies of a.

So, the new a is a + x*a, which is a repeated x+1 times.

Hence, the length becomes len(a) * (x+1).

Got it.

So, for b=2 operations, the length of a becomes len(a) * (x+1).

For b=1 operations, len(a) increases by 1.

So, I can keep track of the length of a after each operation.

Then, for queries, I need to find the k-th element in this final a.

But since a can be up to 1e9 elements or more, I need a way to find the k-th element without constructing a.

This seems similar to finding an element in a repeated structure.

One approach is to keep track of the structure of a in a tree-like fashion, where each b=2 operation represents a repetition.

I need to navigate through this structure to find the k-th element.

Let me think about how to represent this.

I can maintain a list of operations, and for each operation, record its effect on the length.

Then, for each query, I can traverse this structure to find the k-th element.

But with n up to 1e5 and q up to 1e5 per test case, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, but t is up to 5000, and the sum of n and q over all test cases doesn't exceed 1e5.

So, the total operations and queries across all test cases are up to 1e5.

Hence, I need a solution that is linear or linearithmic in the total number of operations and queries.

Let's think about building a segment tree or something similar to handle the repetitions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the origin of each element.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the position in the final array and map it back to the original operations.

But this seems complicated.

Another idea: Since the array is built by appending copies of itself, it has a recursive structure.

I can think of the array as a tree, where each b=2 operation corresponds to a node that repeats its subtree.

But I'm not sure about the implementation.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Simulate the operations, keeping track of the length of a after each operation.

- For b=1 operations, record the position and the value appended.

- For b=2 operations, record the repetition factor.

- Then, for each query, traverse the operations in reverse to find which element corresponds to the k-th position.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

I'll keep a list of operations, where each operation is either:

- ('append', value), which adds one to the length.

- ('repeat', x), which multiplies the length by (x+1).

Then, for each query k, I need to find which value corresponds to the k-th position in the final array.

To do this, I can start from the end and see which operation affects the k-th position.

Let me try with the first example.

Operations:

1. ('append', 1) → length = 1

2. ('append', 2) → length = 2

3. ('repeat', 1) → length = 2 * 2 = 4

4. ('append', 3) → length = 5

5. ('repeat', 3) → length = 5 * 4 = 20

Final length is 20.

Now, for k=14, let's see:

Start with length=20.

Last operation is ('repeat', 3), which means the array is repeated 4 times.

So, position 14 is in the 14 % 5 = 4-th position of the original array before this operation, since 5 is the length before repeating.

Wait, more precisely, the array is divided into 4 blocks of size 5.

So, block number is (14 - 1) // 5 = 2 (0-indexed), and position within block is (14 - 1) % 5 + 1 = 4.

So, k=4 in the original array before the last operation.

Now, look at the operation before that: ('append', 3), which added one element to an array of length 5-1=4.

So, positions 1 to 4 correspond to the array before this operation.

So, k=4 is within that.

Next operation: ('repeat', 1), which repeated the previous array 2 times.

Length before this was 2.

So, position 4 is in the second repeat: (4 - 1) // 2 = 1, position within block: (4 -1) % 2 +1 = 1.

So, k=1 in the array before this operation.

Previous operation: ('append', 2), which added one element to an array of length 1.

So, k=1 is in the array before this operation.

Previous operation: ('append', 1), which started the array.

So, the first element is 1.

Hence, the 14th element is 1.

But according to the output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculations.

Let me try again.

Final length is 20.

For k=14:

- Last operation: ('repeat', 3), which repeats the previous array 4 times.

- Length before this operation: 5.

- So, block number: (14 - 1) // 5 = 2

- Position within block: (14 - 1) % 5 + 1 = 4

- So, k=4 in the array before the last operation.

- Previous operation: ('append', 3), which added one element to an array of length 4.

- So, positions 1 to 4 correspond to the array before this operation.

- Hence, k=4 is in that part.

- Previous operation: ('repeat', 1), which repeated the previous array 2 times.

- Length before this operation: 2.

- So, position 4 is in the second repeat: (4 -1) // 2 = 1, position within block: (4 -1) % 2 +1 = 2.

- So, k=2 in the array before this operation.

- Previous operation: ('append', 2), which added one element to an array of length 1.

- So, k=2 corresponds to the second element, which is 2.

Hence, the 14th element is 2.

Got it.

So, the approach is:

- Keep track of the operations in order.

- For each query k, starting from the final array, use the operations in reverse to find which element corresponds to k.

- For 'repeat' operations, determine which block k falls into and adjust k accordingly.

- For 'append' operations, check if k is in the appended part or before it.

This seems feasible.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I need to store the operations in reverse order, so I can process them from the end to the beginning.

Wait, no, I can store them in order and process them one by one, keeping track of the current length.

Wait, perhaps it's better to process the operations in order, building up the length, and then for each query, traverse the operations to find the k-th element.

But traversing the operations for each query could be too slow if n and q are up to 1e5 per test case.

But since the total n and q across all test cases don't exceed 1e5, it should be manageable.

Still, I need an efficient way.

An optimization could be to precompute the lengths after each operation and then, for each query, perform a kind of binary search or use precomputed jumps to find the k-th element quickly.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the length after each operation and, for each query, simulate the process of finding the k-th element.

Let me try to outline the steps:

- Initialize a list to store operations, where each operation is a tuple (type, value).

- For each operation:

- If type=1, append ('append', x) and increment the current length by 1.

- If type=2, append ('repeat', x) and multiply the current length by (x+1).

- For each query k:

- Start with k.

- Traverse the operations in reverse:

- If the operation is 'append', check if k is equal to the current length. If yes, return the appended value. Otherwise, decrement the length and continue.

- If the operation is 'repeat', divide k by (x+1) to find the block and the position within the block, and set k to the position within the block.

- Continue until the beginning.

This seems similar to what I did in the example.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, I need to store the operations in order, along with the length after each operation.

Then, for each query, start from the end and navigate back to find the k-th element.

I need to make sure that this is efficient enough, given the constraints.

Let's consider the time complexity.

For each query, in the worst case, I might need to traverse all n operations.

With n and q up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but with the sum of n and q across all test cases not exceeding 1e5, it should be acceptable.

Hence, this approach should work.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

I'll need to store the operations with their types and values, and keep track of the length after each operation.

For 'append' operations, type=1, and value is the appended integer.

For 'repeat' operations, type=2, and value is x, the number of copies to append.

Then, for each query k, I need to find the k-th element in the final array.

To do this, I'll start from the final array and work backwards through the operations.

Here's a step-by-step plan for the query processing:

1. Initialize the current k as the query k.

2. Start from the last operation and move backwards.

3. For each operation:

- If it's a 'repeat' operation (type=2), it means that the array was repeated (x+1) times.

- So, to find which block the current k belongs to, compute block_number = (k - 1) // len_before

- Then, set k = (k - 1) % len_before + 1

- Continue with the updated k.

- If it's an 'append' operation (type=1), it means that a single element was appended.

- If k is equal to the current length before this operation, return the appended value.

- Otherwise, decrement the length and continue.

Wait, more precisely:

- For 'repeat' operation:

- Let len_before be the length before this operation.

- The array was repeated (x+1) times, so the total length after this operation is len_before * (x+1).

- Given k in [1, len_before * (x+1)], find which repeat block it falls into.

- block_number = (k - 1) // len_before

- position_within_block = (k - 1) % len_before + 1

- Set k = position_within_block

- For 'append' operation:

- Let len_before be the length before this operation.

- If k == len_before, return the appended value.

- Else, set k = k

- Continue with the previous operations.

Wait, actually, for 'append' operations, the length increases by 1.

So, before an 'append' operation, the length was len_before = current_length - 1

If k <= len_before, proceed to the previous operation.

Else, if k == current_length, return the appended value.

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me try to formalize this.

Maintain a list of operations in order, each with their type and value, and the length after that operation.

Then, for each query k:

- Start with the final length.

- Traverse the operations from the end to the beginning.

- For each operation:

- If it's 'repeat':

- Let repeat_factor = x + 1

- block_number = (k - 1) // len_before

- k = (k - 1) % len_before + 1

- If it's 'append':

- If k <= len_before - 1:

- Continue to the previous operation.

- Else:

- Return the appended value.

This seems correct.

Let me test this with the first example.

Operations:

1. ('append', 1), len=1

2. ('append', 2), len=2

3. ('repeat', 1), len=4

4. ('append', 3), len=5

5. ('repeat', 3), len=20

Query k=14:

- Start with k=14, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4

- len_before = 5

- block_number = (14 - 1) // 5 = 2

- k = (14 - 1) % 5 + 1 = 4

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=5-1=4

- k=4 <= 4, so continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2

- len_before=2

- block_number = (4 - 1) // 2 = 1

- k = (4 - 1) % 2 + 1 = 2

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

- k=2 > 1, so return x=2

Which matches the output.

Good.

Let me try another example.

Take the second operation in the first test case: k=2 should be 2.

- k=2, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4

- len_before=5

- block_number = (2 - 1) // 5 = 0

- k = (2 - 1) % 5 + 1 = 2

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=4

- k=2 <=4, so continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2

- len_before=2

- block_number = (2 -1 ) // 2 = 0

- k = (2 -1 ) % 2 +1 = 1

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=1

- k=1 <=1, so continue to previous operation.

- Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

- k=1 >0, so return x=1

Wait, but according to the output, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the operation lengths.

Wait, in the first test case:

Operations:

1. ('append', 1), len=1

2. ('append', 2), len=2

3. ('repeat', 1), len=4

4. ('append', 3), len=5

5. ('repeat', 3), len=20

So, for k=2:

- Start with k=2, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4, len_before=5

- block_number = (2-1)//5 = 0

- k = (2-1)%5 +1 =1

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=5-1=4

- k=1 <=4, so continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

- block_number=(1-1)//2=0

- k=(1-1)%2 +1=1

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

- k=1 <=1, so continue to previous operation.

- Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

- k=1 >0, return x=1

But according to the output, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the len_before for operation 4.

Wait, after operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, len becomes 2.

Then operation 4: 'append', x=3, len becomes 3.

Then operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, len becomes 3*4=12.

Wait, but in the first example, it's 5 operations leading to length 20.

Wait, perhaps I need to carefully calculate the lengths after each operation.

Let me do that.

Initial len=0

Operation 1: 'append', x=1 → len=1

Operation 2: 'append', x=2 → len=2

Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1 → len=2 * (1+1) = 4

Operation 4: 'append', x=3 → len=4 +1 =5

Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3 → len=5 * (3+1) =20

Yes, so after operation 3, len=4

After operation 4, len=5

After operation 5, len=20

So, for k=2 in the final array:

- Start with k=2, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4, len_before=5

- block_number=(2-1)//5=0

- k=(2-1)%5 +1=1

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=5-1=4

- k=1 <=4, continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

- block_number=(1-1)//2=0

- k=(1-1)%2 +1=1

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

- k=1 <=1, continue to previous operation.

- Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

- k=1 >0, return x=1

But according to the output, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the 'repeat' operations differently.

Wait, in operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, which appends 3 copies of the current array to itself, so the new array is the original array concatenated with 3 copies of itself, so it's 4 times the original.

But in operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, which appends 1 copy of the current array to itself, so it's 2 times the original.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the 'repeat' operation as appending x copies, making the new array a + x*a, so the total is (x+1)*a.

Hence, the length becomes (x+1)*len_before.

So, in operation 5, x=3, so len_after = (3+1)*5 = 20

In operation 3, x=1, so len_after = (1+1)*2 = 4

Yes, that matches.

But according to this, for k=2 in the final array of length 20, it should correspond to the first copy's second element, which is 2.

But according to my earlier logic, it returned 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle 'append' operations.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, for 'repeat' operations, I should consider that the array is divided into (x+1) blocks, each of length len_before.

So, for k, I find which block it falls into and then map it to the position in the original array.

For 'append' operations, when I append a single element, the new array is the old array plus this one element.

So, if k <= len_before, I continue to previous operations.

Else, if k == len_before +1, it's the appended element.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the len_before accordingly.

Let me try again.

For 'append' operations:

- len_before = current_len -1

- if k <= len_before, continue to previous operations.

- else, k == current_len, return the appended value.

For 'repeat' operations:

- repeat_factor = x +1

- block_number = (k -1) // len_before

- k = (k -1) % len_before +1

- Continue with the new k.

Let me try with k=2:

- Start with k=2, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4, len_before=5

- block_number=(2-1)//5=0

- k=(2-1)%5 +1=1

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=5-1=4

- k=1 <=4, continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

- block_number=(1-1)//2=0

- k=(1-1)%2 +1=1

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

- k=1 <=1, continue to previous operation.

- Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

- k=1 >0, return x=1

But according to the output, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle 'repeat' operations.

Wait, perhaps in 'repeat' operations, the array is a + x*a, so it's (x+1) copies of a.

Hence, the position k in the final array corresponds to k % len_before, but need to handle carefully.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the 'repeat' operation as making the array a sequence of (x+1) blocks, each of length len_before.

So, to find k, I find which block it falls into and then map it to the position within that block.

Hence, block_number = (k -1) // len_before

And position_within_block = (k -1) % len_before +1

Then, set k = position_within_block

And continue with the previous operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Alternatively, perhaps I should build a tree where each 'repeat' operation creates child nodes.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Let me consider another approach.

I can keep track of the origin of each position in the final array by traversing the operations.

But with n and q up to 1e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the mapping from final positions to original appended values.

But with the sizes involved, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the positions that are copied from previous arrays.

Wait, perhaps segment trees can help here, but I'm not sure.

Given time constraints, I'll stick with the initial approach and try to debug it.

In the earlier example, it seems to be returning incorrect values for some k.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the 'repeat' operations differently.

Let me consider that after a 'repeat' operation, the array becomes a sequence of (x+1) blocks, each identical to the array before the operation.

Hence, for k, I can find which block it falls into and then map it to the corresponding position in the original array before the 'repeat' operation.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for 'repeat' operations:

- repeat_factor = x +1

- total_length_after = len_before * repeat_factor

- block_number = (k -1) // len_before

- position_within_block = (k -1) % len_before +1

- Set k = position_within_block

And continue with the previous operations.

For 'append' operations:

- len_before = current_len -1

- if k <= len_before:

- continue to previous operation

- else:

- return the appended value

In the first test case, for k=2:

- Start with k=2, current len=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4, len_before=5

- block_number=(2-1)//5=0

- position_within_block=(2-1)%5 +1=1

- Set k=1

- Operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=5-1=4

- k=1 <=4: continue to previous operation

- Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

- block_number=(1-1)//2=0

- position_within_block=(1-1)%2 +1=1

- Set k=1

- Operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

- k=1 <=1: continue to previous operation

- Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

- k=1 >0: return x=1

But according to the output, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle 'append' operations.

Wait, perhaps when I have an 'append' operation, and k == current_len, I should return the appended value, but in this case, k=1 < current_len-1, so it continues.

Wait, no, in operation 4: 'append', x=3, current_len=5, len_before=4

k=1 <=4: continue to previous operation.

Then, in operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

block_number=(1-1)//2=0

position_within_block=(1-1)%2 +1=1

Set k=1

Then, operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

k=1 <=1: continue to previous operation.

Then, operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

k=1 >0: return x=1

But according to the array [1,2,1,2,3,...], the 2nd element should be 2, but according to this, it's returning 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate len_before for 'append' operations.

Wait, perhaps len_before should be the length before the 'append' operation.

Wait, in operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=4

So, k=1 <=4: continue to previous operation.

But in the array, after operation 4, the array is [1,2,1,2,3]

So, k=1 should be 1, k=2 should be 2, k=3 should be1, etc.

Wait, but according to the final array, k=2 is 2.

But according to my logic, for k=2 in the final array, it maps to k=1 in operation 1, which is x=1.

But according to the array, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the mapping for 'repeat' operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after a 'repeat' operation, the array is composed of (x+1) blocks, each identical to the array before the 'repeat' operation.

Hence, for k, I need to find which block it falls into and then map it to the corresponding position in the original array.

In the first test case, operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, repeat_factor=4, len_before=5

So, the final array is the array before this operation (length 5) repeated 4 times.

Hence, for k=2, it's in the first block (block_number=0), position 2.

So, it should correspond to the 2nd element of the array before this operation, which is 2.

Hence, it should return 2.

But according to my earlier logic, it returned 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle 'append' operations.

In operation 4: 'append', x=3, len_before=4

So, k=2 <=4: continue to previous operation.

Then, operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, repeat_factor=2, len_before=2

block_number=(2-1)//2=0

position_within_block=(2-1)%2 +1=1

Set k=1

Then, operation 2: 'append', x=2, len_before=2-1=1

k=1 <=1: continue to previous operation.

Operation 1: 'append', x=1, len_before=0

k=1 >0: return x=1

But according to the array, k=2 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the mapping for 'repeat' operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the block_number calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the blocks are 1-based.

Wait, no, I'm using 1-based indexing for k, but internally using 0-based for calculations.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the mapping differently.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the final array, which is the array after all operations.

I need to find the k-th element in this array.

But since the array can be very large, I can't store it.

Hence, I need a way to find the k-th element without constructing the entire array.

Given that the array is built through appending single elements and repeating the array multiple times, I can keep track of the structure.

I can represent the array as a tree, where each 'repeat' operation creates child nodes corresponding to the repeated arrays.

Then, for each query, I can traverse this tree to find the k-th element.

But with n up to 1e5 and q up to 1e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the structure in a way that allows O(1) or O(log n) queries.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the origins of the elements.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of segments, where each segment corresponds to a range of the array and its origin.

For example, after operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, the array is [1,2,1,2]

Then, after operation 4: 'append', x=3, the array is [1,2,1,2,3]

Then, after operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, the array is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

I can represent this as:

- Segment 1: positions 1 to 5, origin: original array after operation 4

- Segment 2: positions 6 to 10, origin: segment 1

- Segment 3: positions 11 to 15, origin: segment 1

- Segment 4: positions 16 to 20, origin: segment 1

Then, for k=14, it falls in segment 4, which origins from segment 1, which is [1,2,1,2,3]

Position 14 in segment 4 corresponds to position 14 - 15*(4-1) =14-15*3=14-45= negative, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of multiples.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the array as a tree, where each 'repeat' operation creates child nodes for each repetition.

Then, for each query, I can traverse the tree to find the k-th element.

But with n up to 1e5 and q up to 1e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the cumulative lengths and, for each query, binary search through the operations to find the corresponding element.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of operations with their types and lengths, and then for each query, traverse the operations backwards to find the k-th element.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of operations in reverse order and, for each query, process the operations one by one, adjusting k accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Define a function that, given k and the current operation index, returns the value at position k.

If the operation is 'append', check if k is the last position; if yes, return the appended value.

Else, continue with k unchanged.

If the operation is 'repeat', find which block k falls into and adjust k accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can implement this recursively.

But with n up to 1e5 and q up to 1e5, recursion might cause stack overflows.

Hence, I need an iterative approach.

Let me try to implement the iterative approach again, but more carefully.

Store the operations in order, with their types and values, and the length after each operation.

Then, for each query k:

- Start with the final length.

- Traverse the operations from the end to the beginning.

- For each operation:

- If it's 'repeat', x:

- repeat_factor = x +1

- block_number = (k -1) // len_before

- k = (k -1) % len_before +1

- If it's 'append', x:

- if k <= len_before:

- continue to the previous operation.

- else:

- return x

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the length before each operation.

Hence, perhaps I should store the length before each operation.

Let me try that.

Initialize a list of operations, where each operation is a tuple: (type, value, len_before)

Then, for each operation:

- If type=1 ('append'):

- len_after = len_before +1

- Else if type=2 ('repeat'):

- len_after = len_before * (x+1)

Store len_before for each operation.

Then, for each query k:

- Start with the final len_after.

- Traverse the operations from the end to the beginning.

- For each operation:

- If type=2 ('repeat'):

- repeat_factor = x +1

- block_number = (k -1) // len_before

- k = (k -1) % len_before +1

- Else if type=1 ('append'):

- if k <= len_before:

- continue to the previous operation.

- else:

- return the appended value.

Let me try this with the first test case.

Operations:

1. ('append', 1, len_before=0) → len_after=1

2. ('append', 2, len_before=1) → len_after=2

3. ('repeat', 1, len_before=2) → len_after=8

Wait, no, wait:

Operation 3: 'repeat', x=1, len_before=2, len_after=2*(1+1)=4

Operation 4: 'append', 3, len_before=4, len_after=5

Operation 5: 'repeat', 3, len_before=5, len_after=5*(3+1)=20

Ok, so operations with len_before:

Operation 1: ('append', 1, len_before=0), len_after=1

Operation 2: ('append', 2, len_before=1), len_after=2

Operation 3: ('repeat', 1, len_before=2), len_after=4

Operation 4: ('append', 3, len_before=4), len_after=5

Operation 5: ('repeat', 3, len_before=5), len_after=20

Now, for k=2:

- Start with k=2, len_after=20

- Operation 5: 'repeat', x=3, len_before=5

- repeat_factor=4

- block_number=(2-1)//5=0

- k=(2-1)%5 +1=1

- Operation 4: 'append', 3, len_before=4

- k=1 <=4: continue to previous operation.

- Operation 3: 'repeat', 1, len_before=2

- repeat_factor=2

- block_number=(1-1)//2=0

- k
