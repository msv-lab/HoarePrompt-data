Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Jayden has an array that starts empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. There are two types of operations: 

1. Appending an integer x to the end of the array.

2. Appending x copies of the current array to itself.

After performing all these operations, he has some queries where he wants to know the k-th element of the final array.

First, I need to understand how the array evolves with these operations. Let's look at the first example in the problem:

Operations:

1. Type 1, append 1 → array becomes [1]

2. Type 1, append 2 → array becomes [1,2]

3. Type 2, append 1 copy of the current array → array becomes [1,2,1,2]

4. Type 1, append 3 → array becomes [1,2,1,2,3]

5. Type 2, append 3 copies of the current array → array becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, after all operations, the array is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]. Now, for the queries, he asks for various k-th elements from this array.

My task is to process multiple test cases, each with n operations and q queries, and output the answers to the queries for each test case.

Looking at the constraints:

- t (number of test cases) ≤ 5000

- n and q ≤ 10^5 per test case

- Sum of n and q over all test cases ≤ 10^5

This means I need an efficient solution because the total number of operations and queries can be up to 10^5 per test case, and with t up to 5000, but summed over all test cases, it's still 10^5.

First, I need to think about how to simulate the operations efficiently.

Option 1: Simulate the array build step by step.

But this seems problematic because:

- If I actually build the array by appending x copies, and x can be up to 10^9, this will lead to a very large array that I can't store in memory.

- Even if I try to optimize storage, for example, by storing the array as a tree or some other data structure, the time to build and query it might be too slow for the time limits.

Option 2: Keep track of the array's structure without building the entire array.

Since the operations involve appending elements or appending multiple copies of the current array, perhaps I can represent the array as a tree or a linked list where each node represents a subarray.

Wait, but even that might not be efficient enough for the time and space constraints.

Option 3: Calculate the position of the k-th element on the fly without building the entire array.

This seems promising. If I can compute the size of the array after all operations, and then for each query, find the k-th element based on the operation history, that would be efficient.

Let me think about how to do that.

First, I need to track the size of the array after each operation.

For operation type 1, appending an integer x increases the array size by 1.

For operation type 2, appending x copies of the current array increases the size by x * current size.

But wait, if I append x copies of the current array, the new size will be original size plus x times the original size, which is size * (x + 1).

But in the problem, it says "appends x copies of array a to the end of array a", which means a becomes [a, a, ..., a] with x copies appended.

Wait, no, it says "appends x copies of array a to the end of array a". So, if a has size s, after appending x copies, the new size is s + x*s = s*(x+1).

But looking back at the example:

After operation 3: a = [1,2,1,2], which is the original [1,2] appended once.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's "appends x copies of a to the end of a", so a becomes [a, a, ..., a] with x copies.

Wait, in the example, after operation 3, a = [1,2,1,2], which is [1,2] appended once more to itself.

Wait, but according to the problem, "appends x copies of a to the end of a", so a becomes [a, a, ..., a] with x copies.

Wait, but in the example, it seems like it's [a, a], which is x=1.

Wait, but in the fifth operation, x=3, and a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is [1,2,1,2,3] appended three times to itself.

Wait, no, according to the problem, it should be a becomes [a, a, a, a], with the original a appended three times to itself.

Wait, the problem says: "appends x copies of a to the end of a". So, if a is [1,2,1,2,3], and x=3, then a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3].

So, effectively, a is extended by x times its own elements.

Wait, but in the example, after operation 5, a has 20 elements, which is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3].

Wait, but 5 operations, with the last one being append 3 copies of a, where a was [1,2,1,2,3], so after appending 3 copies, a should be [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is 15 elements, but the example shows 20 elements.

Wait, in the example, after operation 5, a has 20 elements: [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3].

Wait, that's 20 elements, but according to my calculation, it should be 15. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"After the fifth operation a = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]"

Wait, but that's 20 elements. Wait, no, let's count:

1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3

That's 20 elements. Wait, but if a was [1,2,1,2,3] and x=3, then appending 3 copies of a would add 15 elements, making the total 20.

Wait, no, appending 3 copies of a means adding a + a + a to the end of a.

So, a becomes a + a + a + a, which is a repeated 4 times.

Wait, but according to the problem, "appends x copies of a to the end of a", so a becomes a + a + ... + a, x times.

But in the example, after operation 5, a is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is a repeated 4 times.

Wait, but x=3, so it should be a repeated 4 times (original + 3 copies).

So, a becomes a + (a * x).

Wait, perhaps it's a *= (x + 1).

Wait, in programming terms, if a is [1,2,1,2,3], and x=3, then a += a * x, which would be a + a + a, making a total of 5 + 15 = 20 elements.

Yes, that matches the example.

So, operation 2 with x=3 appends 3 copies of the current a to itself.

Hence, the size becomes size + x * size = size * (x + 1).

Got it.

Now, the challenge is to handle operations and queries efficiently.

Given that n and q can be up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but sum of n and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Option 1: Simulate the array building process and store the array, then answer queries by indexing into the array.

But this is problematic because the array can become very large. For example, if we have an operation 2 with x=1e9, and the current size is 1e5, then the new size would be 1e5 + 1e9 * 1e5, which is 1e14 elements, which is impossible to store.

Hence, I need a smarter way to handle this.

Option 2: Keep track of the array's structure using a tree or segment-like structure where each node represents a subarray.

But even that might be too slow for the time constraints.

Option 3: Precompute the size of the array after each operation, and for each query, determine which operation's elements contain the k-th element.

This seems promising.

Let me think about it step by step.

I can keep track of the size of the array after each operation.

For operation 1, size increases by 1.

For operation 2, size becomes size + x * size = size * (x + 1).

I can compute the size after each operation, storing the sizes in a list.

Then, for each query k, I can iterate through the operations in reverse, checking if k is within the part added by that operation.

For example, in the final array, the last operation might have appended multiple copies of a previous version of the array.

So, I can find out which part of the array the k-th element belongs to by looking at the size changes.

Wait, perhaps I can use binary search or some other method to find out which operation's addition contains the k-th element.

Wait, actually, since operation 2 can append a large number of copies, I need a way to handle that efficiently.

Let me consider that each operation can be represented as either adding a single element or adding multiple copies of the previous array.

So, I can keep a list of operations, where each operation is either:

- Type 1: add element x at position current_size, with size=1

- Type 2: add x copies of the previous array, with size=x*previous_size

Then, for a query k, I can find the operation whose cumulative size includes k.

To do this efficiently, I can keep a list of operations with their types and sizes, and a cumulative size.

Then, for each query k, I can perform a binary search on the cumulative sizes to find the operation that contains the k-th element.

Wait, but operation 2 adds multiple copies of the previous array, so I need to handle that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to represent the array as a tree, where each operation is a node, and operation 2 creates child nodes representing the copies.

But that might be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that operation 2 appends multiple copies of the current array, so I can represent the array as a combination of individual elements and repeated blocks.

This seems similar to how we handle string operations where we have operations that duplicate substrings.

In such cases, we can use a technique called "implicit treap" or "rope", but that might be too slow for this problem.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the size of the array after each operation and then, for each query, find out which part of the array the k-th element belongs to by dividing k by the sizes.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the array as a sequence of segments, where each segment corresponds to either a single element or multiple copies of previous segments.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that after each operation, I can keep track of the size of the array.

So, I can have a list that stores the size after each operation.

For operation 1, size += 1

For operation 2, size += x * current_size

Wait, but in operation 2, it's appending x copies of the current array, so the new size is current_size + x * current_size = current_size * (x + 1)

So, perhaps it's better to track the multiplier.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of multipliers.

Wait, maybe I can model the array's size as a product of factors based on the operations.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to keep track of the size after each operation and store it in a list.

Then, for each query k, I can find the latest operation whose cumulative size is at least k.

Wait, but I need to find which specific element corresponds to k.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the array as a sequence of segments, where each segment corresponds to an operation.

For operation 1, it's a segment of size 1.

For operation 2, it's a segment that is x copies of the entire array up to that point.

Then, for a query k, I can find the segment that contains the k-th element.

But I need to handle the fact that operation 2 can repeat the array multiple times.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively.

I can represent the array as built by the operations, where each operation 2 corresponds to repeating the array up to that point x times.

So, to find the k-th element, I can find in which repetition and which part of the original array it lies.

But this seems too slow for the time constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the size of the array after all operations and then, for each query, compute the position within the array.

But given that the array can be up to 1e18 elements, I need a smarter way.

Wait, in the problem, it's mentioned that for each query, k can be up to min(1e18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.

So, I need to handle k up to 1e18.

Hence, I need a way to compute the k-th element without building the entire array.

I need to find a way to navigate through the operations to find the k-th element efficiently.

Let me consider that each operation can be seen as transforming the array in a certain way.

Operation 1 appends a single element, increasing the size by 1.

Operation 2 appends x copies of the current array, increasing the size by x * current_size.

So, after each operation, the size of the array is known.

I can keep a list of operations with their corresponding size increments.

Then, for each query k, I can find the operation whose cumulative size includes k.

Wait, but operation 2 makes it complex because it repeats the array multiple times.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the size of the array after each operation and keep a list of sizes.

Then, for a query k, I can find the operation whose cumulative size is at least k.

Wait, but I need to handle the repetitions correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the operations in reverse order.

Starting from the last operation, check if k is within the size added by that operation.

If it is, then find out which element corresponds to k within that operation.

If not, subtract the size added by that operation from k and continue to the previous operation.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have a list of operations, and for each operation, I have the size it adds to the array.

I can compute the cumulative size after each operation.

Then, for a query k, I can find the latest operation whose cumulative size is at least k.

Once I find that operation, I can determine which element corresponds to k within that operation.

If it's an operation 1, it's straightforward: the element added in that operation.

If it's an operation 2, it's more complex because it repeats the previous array x times.

In that case, I need to find which copy of the previous array contains k and then recurse into that copy to find the corresponding element in the original array.

This seems like it could work, but I need to implement it efficiently to handle the time constraints.

Given that n and q are up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 5000, but summed over all test cases, n and q sum to 1e5, I need an O(n + q) per test case solution.

Wait, but with t up to 5000 and sum of n and q over all test cases up to 1e5, total operations are acceptable.

I need to make sure that for each query, the time to find the k-th element is acceptable.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For each test case, read n, q, the n operations, and the q queries.

2. Process the operations to compute the size of the array after each operation.

3. For each query k, find the operation that contains the k-th element.

- Start from the last operation.

- If k is within the size added by the last operation:

- If it's operation 1, return the element added in that operation.

- If it's operation 2, find which copy of the previous array contains k and recurse to find the corresponding element in the original array.

- Else, subtract the size added by the last operation from k and consider the previous operation.

4. Repeat this process until k is found.

I need to handle operation 2 carefully because it can repeat the array multiple times.

Let me think about how to handle operation 2.

Suppose at operation i, it's operation 2 with x copies.

The size added by this operation is x * size_before_operation_i.

So, the total size after operation i is size_before_operation_i + x * size_before_operation_i = size_before_operation_i * (x + 1).

Now, for a query k, if k is within the size added by operation i, I need to find which copy of the previous array it belongs to.

Let me denote:

size_before_operation_i = size_before_i

size_added_by_operation_i = x * size_before_i

total_size_after_operation_i = size_before_i + size_added_by_operation_i = size_before_i * (x + 1)

Given that, for a query k, if k > size_before_i, then k belongs to one of the x copies.

I can compute which copy it belongs to by computing (k - size_before_i - 1) // size_before_i to find the copy number, and (k - size_before_i - 1) % size_before_i to find the position within that copy.

Then, I can recurse to find the element at that position in the original array before operation i.

Wait, but recursing for each query might be too slow if operation 2 has large x.

Wait, but since x can be up to 1e9, and n and q are up to 1e5 per test case, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Perhaps I can precompute the size after each operation and store it in a list.

Then, for each query, I can iterate through the operations in reverse order and find out which operation's size includes k.

If it's operation 1, return the element added in that operation.

If it's operation 2, compute which copy of the previous array contains k and set k to the corresponding position in the previous array, then continue.

I need to make sure that this can be done in O(n) time per query in the worst case, but since n is up to 1e5 and t is up to 5000, this might be too slow.

Wait, but since the sum of n and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, and t is up to 5000, perhaps it's acceptable.

But I need to make sure that the total time is within limits.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, q

- Read n operations: list of (b, x)

- Read q queries: list of k

Then, process the operations to compute the size after each operation.

Initialize size = 0

Initialize a list sizes with size values after each operation.

For each operation in order:

if b == 1:

size += 1

append size to sizes

elif b == 2:

size += x * size

append size to sizes

Now, for each query k:

while k > 0:

find the latest operation whose sizes[j] >= k

if operations[j][0] == 1:

answer is operations[j][1]

break

elif operations[j][0] == 2:

# operation is append x copies of current array

# sizes[j] = sizes[j-1] + x * sizes[j-1] = sizes[j-1] * (x + 1)

# find which copy k belongs to

copy_number = (k - sizes[j-1] - 1) // sizes[j-1] + 1

if copy_number > x:

# impossible, since x copies are appended

pass

else:

# find the position within the copy

pos_in_copy = (k - sizes[j-1] - 1) % sizes[j-1] + 1

# set k to pos_in_copy and continue with previous array

k = pos_in_copy

continue

This seems correct, but I need to handle it carefully to avoid errors.

I need to make sure that I handle the indices correctly and that I don't go out of bounds.

Also, I need to handle the case where operation 2 has x=0, but according to the problem, x >=1 for operation 2.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, for operation 2, x >=1.

It says: "1 <= x <= 1e9"

Hence, x >=1.

So, no need to handle x=0.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one operation of type 1 is performed before any operation of type 2.

Hence, the array is never empty when operation 2 is performed.

Good.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to keep track of the sizes after each operation.

I can store the operations in a list with their types and values.

Then, for each query, I can iterate through the operations in reverse order and find the operation that contains k.

If it's operation 1, return the element added.

If it's operation 2, compute which copy k belongs to and adjust k to the corresponding position in the previous array.

Repeat until k is found.

I need to make sure that this is efficient enough.

Given that n and q are up to 1e5 per test case, and t is up to 5000, but sum of n and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, I think it should be acceptable.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 5000, but sum of n and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, I need to read all test cases first or read them one by one efficiently.

In Python, it's efficient to read all input at once and then process it.

Hence, I can read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them accordingly.

Now, to implement the logic for each test case, I can write a function that takes n, operations, q, queries, and returns the list of answers for the queries.

Then, in the main function, I can read t, then read and process each test case one by one, calling this function and printing the results.

Now, to handle the large input sizes, I need to make sure that I don't use too much memory.

Hence, I need to manage the data structures efficiently.

In particular, for storing the sizes after each operation, I can use a list to store the sizes.

Given that n can be up to 1e5, and t up to 5000, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, it should be fine.

Similarly for q.

Now, to optimize the code, I can precompute the sizes for each operation and store them in a list.

Then, for each query, I can iterate through the operations in reverse order and find the operation that contains k.

In Python, iterating through a list in reverse can be done using reversed() or by using a loop that counts down.

I think using a loop that counts down is more efficient in this case.

Now, let's think about implementing the function.

Define a function, say, get_answers(n, operations, q, queries):

# Precompute sizes

sizes = []

current_size = 0

for op in operations:

if op[0] == 1:

current_size += 1

sizes.append(current_size)

elif op[0] == 2:

current_size += op[1] * current_size

sizes.append(current_size)

# Now, for each query k, find the element

answers = []

for k in queries:

# Find the operation that contains k

i = n - 1

while i >= 0:

if k <= sizes[i]:

# k is within this operation

if operations[i][0] == 1:

answers.append(operations[i][1])

break

elif operations[i][0] == 2:

# operation 2: append x copies of a

# sizes[i] = sizes[i-1] + x * sizes[i-1] = sizes[i-1] * (x + 1)

# find which copy k belongs to

copy_number = (k - sizes[i-1] - 1) // sizes[i-1] + 1

if copy_number > op[1]:

# This should not happen, since sizes[i] = sizes[i-1] * (x + 1)

# and k <= sizes[i]

pass

else:

# Find the position within the copy

pos_in_copy = (k - sizes[i-1] - 1) % sizes[i-1] + 1

# Set k to pos_in_copy and continue with previous array

k = pos_in_copy

continue

i -= 1

answers.append(-1)  # Should not happen

return answers

Wait, but according to the problem, k is within the size of the array, so I don't need to handle the case where k is larger than the array size.

Hence, I can assume that k <= sizes[-1].

Hence, I can remove the -1 case.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't go out of bounds with i.

Now, in terms of efficiency, this should work within the time limits, given the constraints.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

I need to read t, then for each test case, read n and q, then read n operations, then read q queries, process the queries, and output the answers.

Given that sum of n and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, and t is up to 5000, but n and q per test case are up to 1e5, I need to make sure that I read the input efficiently.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.read() and splitting it into tokens is efficient.

Hence, I can read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them one by one.

Now, in terms of code structure, I can have a main function that reads all input, processes each test case, and calls a function to get the answers for each test case.

Then, print the answers for each test case.

Now, to handle large inputs, I need to make sure that I don't use too much memory.

Hence, I should avoid storing large lists if possible.

But given that n and q are up to 1e5 per test case, and t is up to 5000, but sum over all test cases is up to 1e5, it should be manageable.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, q=1, operation is append 1, query is k=1.

Answer should be 1.

Edge case 2: n=2, operations: append 1, append 2, query k=2.

Answer should be 2.

Edge case 3: n=3, operations: append 1, append 2, append 3 copies of a, query k=5.

After operations: [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

k=5 should be 1.

Wait, no, according to the problem, operation 2 appends x copies of a to itself.

Hence, after operation 2, a becomes [1,2,1,2,1,2].

Wait, no, in the problem, it's "appends x copies of a to the end of a", so a becomes a + a + ... + a, x times.

Hence, if a is [1,2], and x=3, then a becomes [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2].

So, 4 copies in total: original + 3 copies.

Hence, size becomes size * (x + 1).

Hence, in this case, k=5 would be the first element of the third copy, which is 1.

Hence, answer is 1.

Edge case 4: n=1, operation append 1, q=1, k=1.

Answer is 1.

Edge case 5: n=2, operations: append 1, append 2 3, q=1, k=4.

After operations: a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...]

Wait, no, operation 2 appends x copies of a to itself.

So, if a is [1], and x=3, a becomes [1,1,1,1].

Hence, size becomes 1 + 3*1 = 4.

Hence, k=4 should be 1.

Hence, answer is 1.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to make sure that I handle operation 2 correctly.

Now, let's think about implementing the get_answers function.

Define get_answers(n, operations, q, queries):

sizes = []

current_size = 0

for op in operations:

if op[0] == 1:

current_size += 1

sizes.append(current_size)

elif op[0] == 2:

current_size += op[1] * current_size

sizes.append(current_size)

answers = []

for k in queries:

i = n - 1

while i >= 0:

if k <= sizes[i]:

if operations[i][0] == 1:

answers.append(operations[i][1])

break

elif operations[i][0] == 2:

copy_number = (k - sizes[i-1] - 1) // sizes[i-1] + 1

if copy_number > op[1]:

# This should not happen

pass

else:

pos_in_copy = (k - sizes[i-1] - 1) % sizes[i-1] + 1

k = pos_in_copy

continue

i -= 1

return answers

Now, I need to make sure that this function works correctly.

Let's test it with the first example in the problem.

n=5, operations:

1 1

1 2

2 1

1 3

2 3

queries: 1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

After operations:

After op1: [1], sizes=[1]

After op2: [1,2], sizes=[1,2]

After op3: [1,2,1,2], sizes=[1,2,4]

After op4: [1,2,1,2,3], sizes=[1,2,4,5]

After op5: [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], sizes=[1,2,4,5,15]

Queries:

k=1: belongs to op1, answer=1

k=2: belongs to op2, answer=2

k=3: belongs to op3, copy_number=1, pos_in_copy=3-2=1, so k=1, which is op1, answer=1

k=4: belongs to op3, copy_number=1, pos_in_copy=4-2=2, which is op2, answer=2

k=5: belongs to op4, answer=3

k=6: belongs to op5, copy_number=(6-5-1)//5 +1 =0//5+1=1, pos_in_copy=(6-5-1)%5 +1=0%5+1=1, so k=1, which is op1, answer=1

k=14: belongs to op5, copy_number=(14-5-1)//5 +1=8//5+1=2, pos_in_copy=8%5+1=3, so k=3, which is op3, copy_number=(3-2-1)//2 +1=0//2+1=1, pos_in_copy=0%2+1=1, which is op1, answer=1

Wait, but according to the problem, for k=14, the answer should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate for k=14.

sizes = [1,2,4,5,15]

operations:

0: append 1

1: append 2

2: append 1 copies of a (which was [1,2]), so a becomes [1,2,1,2], sizes[2]=4

3: append 3, a becomes [1,2,1,2,3], sizes[3]=5

4: append 3 copies of a, a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], sizes[4]=15

Now, for k=14:

i=4, sizes[4]=15 >=14

operation 2: x=3

copy_number=(14 -5 -1)//5 +1=(8)//5 +1=1 +1=2

pos_in_copy=8%5 +1=3

So, k=3

Now, k=3 belongs to i=2, sizes[2]=4 >=3

operation 2: x=1

copy_number=(3-2-1)//2 +1=0//2 +1=1

pos_in_copy=0%2 +1=1

k=1 belongs to i=0, operation 1, answer=1

But according to the problem, the answer should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in copy_number calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should adjust the formula.

Let me think differently.

When operation 2 appends x copies of a, the new array is a + x*a, meaning x+1 copies of a.

Hence, the positions in the new array correspond to:

- positions 1 to sizes[i-1]: original a

- positions sizes[i-1]+1 to sizes[i]: copies of a

Hence, to find which copy k belongs to, I can compute:

copy_number = (k - sizes[i-1] -1) // sizes[i-1] +1

But in the above calculation, for k=14, sizes[3]=5, sizes[4]=15

copy_number=(14-5-1)//5 +1=8//5 +1=1 +1=2

pos_in_copy=(14-5-1)%5 +1=3

So, k=3 in the second copy.

Now, in the original a of size 5, k=3 belongs to operation 3, which is operation 2 with x=1.

Wait, no, operation 3 is append 3, which is operation 1.

Wait, let's index the operations:

operations:

0: append 1

1: append 2

2: append 1 copies of a

3: append 3

4: append 3 copies of a

Hence, for k=14:

i=4, sizes[4]=15 >=14

operation 2 with x=3

copy_number=(14-5-1)//5 +1=8//5 +1=1 +1=2

pos_in_copy=8%5 +1=3

So, k=3 in the second copy.

Now, k=3 in the original a of size 5.

Looking at operations up to i=3:

sizes=[1,2,4,5]

k=3 <= sizes[2]=4, which is operation 2 with x=1

So, operation 2 with x=1

copy_number=(3-2-1)//2 +1=0//2 +1=1

pos_in_copy=0%2 +1=1

So, k=1, which is operation 0, append 1, answer=1

But according to the problem, the answer should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the operation indexing.

Wait, let's list the operations with their indices:

operations:

0: b=1, x=1 → append 1

1: b=1, x=2 → append 2

2: b=2, x=1 → append 1 copies of a

3: b=1, x=3 → append 3

4: b=2, x=3 → append 3 copies of a

Hence, sizes:

After op0: [1], sizes[0]=1

After op1: [1,2], sizes[1]=2

After op2: [1,2,1,2], sizes[2]=4

After op3: [1,2,1,2,3], sizes[3]=5

After op4: [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], sizes[4]=15

Now, for k=14:

i=4, sizes[4]=15 >=14

operation 2 with x=3

copy_number=(14-5-1)//5 +1=8//5 +1=1 +1=2

pos_in_copy=8%5 +1=3

So, k=3 in the second copy.

Now, look at the original a of size 5.

k=3 belongs to operation 2 (i=2), which is append 1 copies of a.

Wait, no, sizes up to i=3 is 5.

Hence, k=3 <=5, so it's in operation 3, which is append 3.

Wait, no, sizes[3]=5, which includes operations up to i=3.

But in operation 4, which is append 3 copies of a, a becomes a + 3*a, where a was [1,2,1,2,3].

Hence, positions 1-5: original a

6-10: first copy

11-15: second copy

Hence, k=14 is in the third copy, position 14-10=4, so position 4 in the original a, which is 2.

Hence, answer is 2.

But according to my earlier calculation, I got copy_number=2, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula for copy_number.

Let me think differently.

Total size after operation 4: sizes[4]=15

Original a: sizes[3]=5

Copies appended: x=3, so total copies=4 (original + 3 copies)

Hence, copies start from copy 0 (original) to copy 3.

Position k in the new array:

if k <= sizes[3], it's in copy 0

else, k - sizes[3] gives the position in the copies.

copy_number = (k - sizes[3] -1) // sizes[3] +1

pos_in_copy = (k - sizes[3] -1) % sizes[3] +1

Hence, for k=14:

copy_number=(14 -5 -1)//5 +1=8//5 +1=1 +1=2

pos_in_copy=8%5 +1=3

So, it's in the third copy, position 3.

But in the original a, position 3 is 1.

But according to the problem, the answer should be 2.

Wait, in the original a of size 5: [1,2,1,2,3]

Position 1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2, 5:3

Hence, position 3 is 1.

But according to the problem, for k=14, the answer is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

In the final array: [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Positions:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:2

13:1

14:2

15:3

Hence, k=14 is 2.

But according to my earlier logic, I got position 3 in the original a, which is 1.

Hence, there is a mistake in my logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate copy_number and pos_in_copy.

Let me think again.

After operation 4, a has 15 elements: [original a (1-5), copy1 (6-10), copy2 (11-15)]

For k=14, it's in copy2, position 14-10=4, which corresponds to position 4 in the original a, which is 2.

Hence, answer is 2.

Hence, in general, for operation 2 with x copies:

- The original a is positions 1 to sizes[i-1]

- The first copy is positions sizes[i-1]+1 to sizes[i-1]*2

- The second copy is positions sizes[i-1]*2+1 to sizes[i-1]*3

- ...

- The x-th copy is positions sizes[i-1]*x +1 to sizes[i-1]*(x+1)

Hence, to find which copy k belongs to:

if k <= sizes[i-1]:
