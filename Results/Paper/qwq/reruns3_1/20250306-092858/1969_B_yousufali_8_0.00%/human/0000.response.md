Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would make it "110". Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I can do this operation as many times as I want, and I need to find the minimum total cost to get the string sorted.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. It's simply that all 0s are before any 1s. So, in the example "10", to sort it, I can perform a cyclic shift on the entire string to get "01", and the cost is 2.

In another example, "0000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

Then there's "11000". According to the sample output, the cost is 9. From the explanation, they perform three operations, each on a substring of length 3, for a total cost of 9.

Okay, so I need a general strategy to find the minimum cost to sort any given binary string.

Let me think about how these cyclic shifts affect the string. Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of the substring to the front of that substring. So, it's like rotating the substring by one position.

I need to use these rotations to rearrange the substring in a way that helps me sort the entire string.

Wait a minute, rotating a substring doesn't directly sort it, but maybe I can use multiple rotations to move elements within the substring.

But this seems inefficient if I have to do it multiple times. I need a better approach.

Maybe I can think in terms of inversions. In a sorted array, there are no inversions where a 1 comes before a 0. So, perhaps the number of such inversions indicates how much work I need to do.

But in this problem, the operation is not just swapping two elements or reversing a substring; it's rotating a substring.

I need to find a way to measure how far the string is from being sorted and relate that to the cost of operations.

Let's consider the positions where the string deviates from the sorted order. In the sorted string, all 0s should be before all 1s. So, I can find the position where the 0s end and 1s begin.

For example, in "11000", the sorted version is "00011", so the transition point is after the third character.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they performed three operations, each on substrings of length 3, to sort it. That gives a total cost of 9.

But is there a better way? Let's see.

If I have "11000", and I want to turn it into "00011", I can think of moving the first two 1s to the end.

If I select the substring "110" and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "011", so the string becomes "01100". Then, if I select "110" again, it becomes "00110", and finally, selecting "110" again becomes "00011". That's three operations, each of cost 3, total 9.

But is there a way to do it with less cost?

What if I select a larger substring? For example, select the entire string "11000" and perform a cyclic shift: "01100", cost 5. Then, select "110" to get "00110", cost 3. Then, select "110" to get "00011", cost 3. Total cost is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, which is higher than 9. So, not better.

Another approach: maybe select overlapping substrings.

Wait, perhaps I need a different strategy altogether.

Let me think about the positions of 0s and 1s.

In the final sorted string, all 0s are before all 1s. So, any 1 that appears before a 0 in the original string needs to be moved past all the 0s that come after it.

Each such move can be achieved by a series of cyclic shifts.

But counting the number of operations needed seems complicated.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can directly give me the minimum cost.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case: "10" -> cost 2

Second: "0000" -> cost 0

Third: "11000" -> cost 9

Fourth: "101011" -> cost 5

Fifth: "01101001" -> cost 11

I need to find a general approach that can handle any binary string and compute the minimum cost to sort it.

Perhaps I can model this as moving the 1s to their correct positions.

Each time I perform a cyclic shift on a substring, I'm effectively moving the last character of that substring to the front.

So, if I have a 1 that needs to be moved to the end, I can select a substring that includes that 1 and the characters after it, and perform cyclic shifts to move the 1 towards the end.

But this seems inefficient, as it might require multiple shifts for each 1.

Is there a way to group the operations to minimize the total cost?

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of blocks.

Suppose I identify the blocks of 1s and 0s that are out of place and find a way to move these blocks with minimal cost.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the positions where the string differs from the sorted version.

For example, in "11000", the sorted version is "00011". So, positions 1 and 2 need to be 0 instead of 1, and positions 4 and 5 need to be 1 instead of 0.

So, I need to move the two 1s from positions 1 and 2 to positions 4 and 5.

Each move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 1 and the positions it needs to be moved to, and performing cyclic shifts.

But calculating the exact number of shifts and their costs seems tricky.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I have a string of length n.

I can consider the positions where the string is not sorted, i.e., where a 1 appears before a 0.

Each such inversion needs to be corrected.

Each cyclic shift can correct certain inversions at the cost of the substring's length.

I need to find a set of cyclic shifts that correct all inversions with minimal total cost.

This sounds like an optimization problem.

But optimization problems can be complex.

Is there a simpler way to look at this?

Wait, maybe I can think about the number of 1s that need to be moved past certain 0s.

Each time a 1 needs to be moved past a 0, it incurs some cost.

But how does that relate to the cyclic shifts?

Let me consider that each cyclic shift allows me to move a 1 over a 0 within the substring.

Wait, in a cyclic shift, if I have a substring like "10", shifting it becomes "01", which corrects one inversion at the cost of 2.

Similarly, in "110", shifting it becomes "011", which corrects two inversions at the cost of 3.

So, perhaps the cost per inversion corrected is the length of the substring.

But substrings can overlap, so it's not straightforward.

I need to find a way to group inversions together to minimize the total cost.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the prefix sums.

Suppose I have the sorted string, and I compare it with the original string.

I can find the positions where they differ and calculate the cost based on moving the characters from their original positions to their target positions.

But again, with cyclic shifts, it's not directly about moving individual characters but about shifting substrings.

I need to find a way to model this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as inversion counts, where each inversion represents a pair of positions where the order is incorrect, and the cost to fix each inversion is related to the substring covering that pair.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have the string divided into parts, and I can sort each part separately, then combine them.

But I need to consider the interactions between the parts.

This seems messy.

Maybe I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and their costs.

Looking back at the samples:

1. "10" -> cost 2

   - One inversion: the 1 before 0.

   - Cost equals the length of the string.

2. "0000" -> cost 0

   - Already sorted.

3. "11000" -> cost 9

   - There are multiple inversions: each of the two 1s needs to be moved past the three 0s.

   - So, 2 * 3 = 6, but the cost is 9. Hmm.

4. "101011" -> cost 5

   - Not sure how many inversions, but the cost is 5.

5. "01101001" -> cost 11

   - Again, multiple inversions.

It seems like the cost is not directly proportional to the number of inversions.

Wait, maybe it's related to the number of 1s that need to be moved past the 0s.

In "11000", there are two 1s that need to be moved past three 0s, so 2 * 3 = 6, but the sample cost is 9. That doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the positions they need to be moved.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation can be used to move a 1 past multiple 0s in one operation.

For example, in "11000", shifting "110" to "011" moves one 1 past one 0.

Then, shifting "110" again moves another 1 past one 0.

Finally, shifting "110" moves a 1 past another 0.

So, total cost is 3 operations * 3 cost each = 9.

But is there a way to do it more efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can select a larger substring to move multiple 1s at once.

For example, selecting "11000" and performing a cyclic shift: "01100", which moves both 1s past one 0 each, at the cost of 5.

Then, selecting "110" and shifting it to "011", cost 3.

Total cost is 5 + 3 = 8, which is better than 9.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they did three shifts of 3, totaling 9.

So, perhaps there is a better strategy than what's provided in the sample explanation.

But according to the sample output, the cost is 9, but according to my calculation, it could be 8.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let me try again.

Start with "11000".

First operation: select substring "11000", perform cyclic shift to "01100", cost 5.

Now, string is "01100".

Second operation: select substring "110", shift to "011", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

Third operation: select substring "110", shift to "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, which is higher than the sample's 9.

So, my earlier idea didn't help.

Back to the drawing board.

Let me consider that for each 1 that needs to be moved past a 0, I need to perform operations that effectively move it past that 0.

Each such move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 1 and the 0, and performing cyclic shifts.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of positions each 1 needs to be moved.

For example, in "11000", the first two characters are 1s that need to be moved to the end, after all the 0s.

So, the first 1 needs to be moved past three 0s, and the second 1 also needs to be moved past three 0s.

So, total moves: 3 + 3 = 6.

But in the sample, the cost is 9, which is higher.

Hmm.

Maybe each move costs more than 1.

Wait, but the operation cost is equal to the length of the substring.

So, it's not directly related to the number of positions moved.

I need to find a way to group these moves to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps I can use prefix sums or suffix sums to calculate the total cost.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string and count the number of 1s that appear before the first 0.

Each of these 1s needs to be moved past all the 0s that come after them.

So, the cost for each such 1 is equal to the number of 0s after it.

I can sum these up to get the total cost.

Wait, let's try this with the sample input "11000".

Number of 1s before the first 0: two 1s.

Number of 0s after them: three 0s.

So, each 1 needs to be moved past three 0s, total cost 6.

But according to the sample, it's 9.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Maybe I need to consider that moving a 1 past multiple 0s in one operation is cheaper than moving it past one 0 at a time.

Wait, perhaps each operation can move a 1 past multiple 0s, but at the cost of the substring length.

So, I need to find a way to group these moves to minimize the total cost.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different pattern.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

- "10" -> cost 2

- "0000" -> cost 0

- "11000" -> cost 9

- "101011" -> cost 5

- "01101001" -> cost 11

I need to find a formula that can generate these costs based on the input strings.

Let me try to see if there's a relationship between the number of 1s that need to be moved and the number of 0s they need to be moved past.

In "11000", two 1s need to be moved past three 0s, so 2 * 3 = 6, but cost is 9.

In "10", one 1 needs to be moved past one 0, so 1 * 1 = 1, but cost is 2.

Hmm, not matching.

Maybe the cost is the sum of the positions each 1 needs to be moved.

But in "11000", moving both 1s to the end would involve moving them each by 3 positions, so 3 + 3 = 6, but sample cost is 9.

Still not matching.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the cost is related to the number of inversions multiplied by something.

In "10", there is one inversion, and the cost is 2.

In "11000", there are six inversions (each 1 before each 0), and the cost is 9.

In "101011", there are five inversions, and the cost is 5.

In "01101001", there are eleven inversions, and the cost is 11.

Wait a minute, in the fourth and fifth samples, the cost seems to be equal to the number of inversions.

But in the third sample, there are six inversions (two 1s before three 0s: 2*3=6), but the cost is 9.

This suggests that the cost per inversion is not constant.

Perhaps the cost is the number of inversions multiplied by the average substring length or something.

But in the first sample, one inversion with cost 2.

In the third sample, six inversions with cost 9.

9 is not 6 multiplied by any constant.

Wait, 9 is 6 plus 3, but I don't see the pattern.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to make all the 0s come before the 1s by performing cyclic shifts.

Each cyclic shift allows me to rotate a substring by one position.

Each rotation can fix some inversions.

I need to find the minimal total cost to fix all inversions.

This sounds similar to bubble sort, where each swap fixes one inversion.

But in this case, each cyclic shift can fix multiple inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions multiplied by the average substring length.

But that still doesn't explain the sample costs.

Wait, maybe the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all inversions of the substring length needed to fix each inversion.

But that seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation can fix multiple inversions if the substring includes multiple inversions.

So, the key is to group inversions into substrings and fix them in one operation.

This way, the cost is the length of the substring, which covers all the inversions within it.

I need to find a way to cover all inversions with a minimal total substring length.

This sounds similar to covering a set with subsets and minimizing the sum of the sizes.

This is reminiscent of the set cover problem, which is NP-hard.

But maybe in this specific case, there's a greedy algorithm that can solve it efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps there's a simpler formula.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum, for each 1 that needs to be moved, of the number of 0s it needs to be moved past.

But in the third sample, that would be 2 * 3 = 6, but the cost is 9.

Discrepancy again.

Wait, maybe the cost is the sum over all inversions of the substring length that covers that inversion.

But I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the number of 1s that need to be moved past certain positions.

I can calculate the prefix sums of 1s and 0s and use that to determine the cost.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of 1s before each 0 and sum them up, multiplied by some factor.

In "11000", there are two 1s before each of the three 0s, so 2 * 3 = 6, but the sample cost is 9.

Hmm.

In "10", one 1 before one 0, cost should be 1 * 1 = 1, but the sample cost is 2.

Again, discrepancy.

Maybe the cost per inversion is not 1 but something else.

Wait, perhaps the cost is the position difference between the 1 and the 0 in the inversion.

In "10", the position difference is 1, cost is 2.

In "11000", there are six inversions, each with position differences of 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, sum is 9, matching the sample.

Wait, let's see:

For "11000":

- First 1 (position 0) and third 0 (position 2): difference 2

- First 1 and fourth 0 (position 3): difference 3

- First 1 and fifth 0 (position 4): difference 4

- Second 1 (position 1) and third 0 (position 2): difference 1

- Second 1 and fourth 0 (position 3): difference 2

- Second 1 and fifth 0 (position 4): difference 3

Total sum: 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 15, which is not matching the sample cost of 9.

Wait, maybe it's not the position differences.

Back to square one.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation can be used to move a 1 past multiple 0s in one operation.

So, if I select a substring that includes a 1 and some 0s, I can perform a cyclic shift to move the 1 past those 0s.

The cost is the length of the substring, which includes the 1 and the 0s it's moving past.

So, if I can group the 1s and the 0s they need to move past into substrings, I can minimize the total cost.

This sounds like grouping the inversions into substrings and paying the cost of the substring for all inversions within it.

I need to find an optimal way to group these inversions.

This seems similar to covering the inversions with substrings in a way that minimizes the total length of the substrings used.

This is starting to sound like the minimum substring cover problem, which can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

In such problems, a greedy approach often works where you always pick the substring that covers the most inversions per unit cost.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need a solution that runs in linear or linearithmic time, as the string can be up to 2e5 characters and there are up to 1e4 test cases.

I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me think about the positions of 1s and 0s.

Suppose I have a list of positions where 1s are before 0s in the string.

Each such pair needs to be "fixed" by moving the 1 past the 0.

Each cyclic shift operation can fix multiple such pairs if they are within the same substring.

So, the goal is to group these pairs into substrings and pay the substring length for fixing all pairs within that substring.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a classic optimization problem, but I need to find a way to implement it efficiently.

Perhaps I can model this as a sum over all inversions of the minimal substring length needed to cover each inversion.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the positions of the 0s and see how much I need to move the 1s past them.

For each 0, count how many 1s are before it in the string, as each of those 1s needs to be moved past this 0.

Then, the total cost would be the sum over all 0s of the number of 1s before them, each multiplied by the cost to move a 1 past that 0.

But I need to find a way to group these moves into operations.

Wait, maybe the cost to move a 1 past a 0 is equal to the distance between them, but that doesn't seem to fit with the sample inputs.

In "10", there's one inversion, and the cost is 2, which matches the length of the string.

In "11000", there are six inversions, and the cost is 9, which is less than 15 (sum of position differences).

Hmm.

Perhaps the cost is equal to the number of inversions multiplied by the average substring length.

But that doesn't seem consistent across the samples.

I need to find a formula that can be applied generally.

Let me consider that each operation can fix multiple inversions, specifically all inversions within the chosen substring.

So, if I choose a substring that covers multiple inversions, I can fix all those inversions at once for the cost of the substring length.

Therefore, I need to cover all inversions with substrings in a way that minimizes the total length of the substrings chosen.

This sounds similar to the minimum substring cover problem, where I need to cover all inversions with substrings optimally.

In such problems, a greedy approach often works, where I always pick the substring that covers the most inversions per unit cost.

However, in this case, since the cost is simply the length of the substring, and I want to cover all inversions, I need to find a way to select substrings that cover as many inversions as possible relative to their lengths.

This seems too vague for implementation.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all inversions of the minimal substring length that covers each inversion.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the string and, for each position, keep track of the number of inversions that include that position, and then sum up the minimal substring lengths needed to cover those inversions.

This is still too abstract.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have a function that, given a substring, tells me how many inversions it covers.

Then, I need to select a set of substrings that cover all inversions, with minimal total length.

This is similar to the set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but perhaps in this specific case, there's a simpler solution.

Given time constraints, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions, each costing 1, but that doesn't match the samples.

Wait, in "10", one inversion with cost 2, which is higher than 1.

In "11000", six inversions with cost 9, which is less than 6 * 2 = 12, but more than 6.

So, perhaps the cost per inversion is not constant.

This is confusing.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Suppose I consider that each 1 needs to be moved past all the 0s that come after it in the string.

Each such move can be done by selecting a substring that includes the 1 and the 0, and performing a cyclic shift.

The cost of moving one 1 past one 0 is equal to the length of the substring that includes both the 1 and the 0.

In "10", moving the 1 past the 0 requires selecting the entire string and performing one cyclic shift, costing 2.

In "11000", moving the first 1 past three 0s could be done by selecting "11000" and performing three cyclic shifts, costing 5 each, total 15, but the sample cost is 9.

Alternatively, as in the sample explanation, performing three operations of cost 3 each, total 9.

So, it's better to group the moves.

Wait, perhaps the cost to move a 1 past multiple 0s in one operation is equal to the substring length times the number of moves.

But in the sample, moving two 1s past three 0s with three operations of cost 3 each seems inefficient.

Wait, maybe there's a formula based on the number of 1s and 0s.

Let me consider that for each 1 that needs to be moved past some 0s, the cost is equal to the number of 0s it needs to be moved past, multiplied by some factor.

But again, not matching the sample.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the positions that each 1 needs to be moved, but adjusted for overlapping moves.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each inversion is an edge, and find a way to cover all edges with minimal total cost.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is not working and look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the number of 1s that need to be moved multiplied by the average number of 0s they need to be moved past.

But again, not matching the samples.

I need to find a formula that fits all the sample inputs.

Looking back:

- "10": one 1 to move past one 0, cost 2.

- "11000": two 1s to move past three 0s, cost 9.

- "101011": to be analyzed.

- "01101001": to be analyzed.

Wait, perhaps in "11000", the cost is (number of 1s to move) * (number of 0s to move past) + something.

Two 1s moving past three 0s: 2 * 3 = 6, plus maybe the number of operations?

But sample cost is 9.

Wait, 3 operations of cost 3 each: 3 * 3 = 9.

So, perhaps it's (number of 1s to move) * (number of 0s to move past).

In this case, 3 * 3 = 9.

Wait, but there are two 1s moving past three 0s, so why is it 3 * 3?

Wait, maybe it's the number of inversions multiplied by the average substring length.

In "11000", there are six inversions, cost is 9.

So, 6 * 1.5 = 9.

But in "10", one inversion, cost 2, which is 1 * 2.

This suggests that the cost per inversion varies.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of operations needed.

In "11000", performing three operations of cost 3 each, total 9.

Each operation fixes two inversions (since there are six inversions total).

Wait, no, with three operations, each operation fixes two inversions, but in reality, it's more complex.

I need a better way to think about this.

Perhaps I should look for a formula based on the positions of the 1s and 0s.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 multiplied by the position of the 0.

But in "11000", that would be 2 * (2 + 3 + 4) = 2 * 9 = 18, which is not matching the sample cost of 9.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 multiplied by something else.

This is getting too convoluted.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach isn't working and look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions multiplied by the average substring length needed to fix them.

But I need a way to calculate this efficiently.

This seems too vague.

I need to find a formula or algorithm that can compute the minimal cost directly.

Given that, perhaps I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and try to generalize from there.

Looking back at the samples:

- "10" -> cost 2

- "0000" -> cost 0

- "11000" -> cost 9

- "101011" -> cost 5

- "01101001" -> cost 11

I need to find a pattern that connects these inputs to their outputs.

Looking at "10", cost 2: one inversion, cost 2.

"11000", six inversions, cost 9.

"101011", five inversions, cost 5.

"01101001", eleven inversions, cost 11.

Wait a minute, in "101011":

- Inversions: positions (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5).

Wait, no, only the inversions where a 1 is before a 0.

So, in "101011":

- Position 0 (1) before position 1 (0): inversion

- Position 0 before position 3 (0): inversion

- Position 2 (1) before position 3 (0): inversion

- Position 2 before position 4 (1): no inversion

- Position 2 before position 5 (1): no inversion

- Position 4 before position 5: no inversion

So, total inversions: three.

But according to the sample, the cost is 5.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the inversions.

Let me recount:

- Position 0 (1) before position 1 (0): inversion

- Position 0 (1) before position 3 (0): inversion

- Position 2 (1) before position 3 (0): inversion
