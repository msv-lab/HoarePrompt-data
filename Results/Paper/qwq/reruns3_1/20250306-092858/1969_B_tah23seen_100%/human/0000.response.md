Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before all the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Each time I do this, there's a cost equal to the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. So, I need to figure out the sequence of shifts that will result in a sorted string with the least possible cost.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. In this case, all '0's should be before any '1'. So, if I have a string like "10", I need to turn it into "01". The example says that I can choose the entire string, perform a cyclic shift, and get "01" with a cost of 2.

Another example is "11000". The solution provided is to perform three shifts on substrings of length 3, each costing 3, for a total cost of 9. But is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, maybe there is a smarter way. Let's think about what operations I can perform. Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front of that substring. So, it's like rotating the substring by one position.

I need to move all '0's to the front of the string. So, for each '0' that is after some '1's, I need to find a way to move it before those '1's.

Let me consider the positions of '1's and '0's. If I have a '0' that is after a '1', I need to move that '0' before the '1'. To do that, I can select a substring that includes that '0' and the '1's before it and perform a cyclic shift to move the '0' to a position before the '1's.

But this seems inefficient if done naively. I need a systematic way to calculate the minimum cost.

Let me look at the function provided: `func_1(s)`. It seems simple enough. It iterates through the string, counts the number of '1's encountered, and whenever it sees a '0', if there are any '1's before it, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.

Wait, let's see:

- `cost = 0`

- `one = 0`

- For each character in s:

- If it's '1', increment `one`

- If it's '0' and `one > 0`, add `one + 1` to cost

So, for example, take "10":

- First character '1': one = 1

- Second character '0': one > 0, so cost += 1 + 1 = 2

So, total cost is 2, which matches the first example.

Another example, "0000":

- All '0's, so no '1's before any '0', so cost = 0

Again, matches the second example.

Third example, "11000":

- First '1': one = 1

- Second '1': one = 2

- Third '0': one = 2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Fourth '0': one = 2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Fifth '0': one = 2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

Which matches the third example.

Fourth example, "101011":

- First '1': one = 1

- Second '0': one = 1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- Third '1': one = 2

- Fourth '0': one = 2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Fifth '1': one = 3

- Sixth '1': one = 4

- Total cost = 2 + 3 = 5

Matches the fourth example.

Fifth example, "01101001":

- First '0': one = 0, no addition

- Second '1': one = 1

- Third '1': one = 2

- Fourth '0': one = 2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Fifth '1': one = 3

- Sixth '0': one = 3 > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4

- Seventh '0': one = 3 > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4

- Eighth '1': one = 4

- Total cost = 3 + 4 + 4 = 11

Matches the fifth example.

So, the function seems to be correct based on the examples provided. But I need to make sure that this is indeed the minimum cost required.

Let me think about what this function is doing. For each '0' that appears after some '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost. So, `one` is the number of '1's before this '0'. What does `one + 1` represent?

Well, to move this '0' before the '1's, I need to select a substring that includes this '0' and all the '1's before it, and perform a cyclic shift. The length of this substring would be `one + 1` (since 'one' is the number of '1's before the '0', and +1 is for the '0' itself). So, the cost of this operation is `one + 1`.

But, can I perform multiple shifts to reduce the total cost?

Let's consider the third example, "11000". According to the function, the cost is 9. But in the explanation, they perform three shifts, each on a substring of length 3, costing 3 each, total 9.

Is there a way to do it with fewer operations or lower cost?

Suppose I select the entire string, "11000", which has length 5, and perform a cyclic shift: "11000" -> "01100", cost = 5.

Now, the string is "01100". There are still '0's after '1's: the third character is '1' and the fifth is '0'.

If I select substring [3,5]: "100" -> "010", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "01010". Still not sorted.

Next, select substring [2,4]: "101" -> "011", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "00110". Almost there.

Finally, select substring [4,5]: "10" -> "01", cost = 2.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 13, which is higher than the previous approach of 9.

Wait, but the function gives cost = 9, which is less than this. So, perhaps the function is better.

Let me try another approach.

Select substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "01100".

Select substring [4,5]: "00" -> "00", cost = 2, but it doesn't change.

Wait, cyclic shift on "00" is "00", so no change.

So, perhaps select substring [3,5]: "100" -> "010", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "00100".

Select substring [3,4]: "10" -> "01", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "00010".

Select substring [4,5]: "10" -> "01", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "00001".

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10, which is still higher than 9.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Let's try selecting substring [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost = 4.

Now, the string is "01100".

Select substring [4,5]: "00" -> "00", cost = 2, no change.

Again, no improvement.

Alternatively, select substring [2,5]: "1000" -> "0100", cost = 4.

Now, the string is "10100".

Select substring [1,2]: "10" -> "01", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "01100".

Select substring [3,5]: "100" -> "010", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "00110".

Select substring [1,3]: "001" -> "100", cost = 3.

Wait, that would make it "10010", which is worse.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the function's approach is more efficient.

Let me think differently. Maybe instead of trying to simulate shifts, I can think in terms of inversions.

In a sorted array, there should be no '1' before any '0'. So, the number of inversions where a '1' appears before a '0' needs to be corrected.

Each cyclic shift can correct certain inversions at a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

But minimizing the total cost isn't straightforward.

Looking back at the function, it seems to be adding `one + 1` for each '0' that has '1's before it, where `one` is the count of '1's before it.

This seems similar to counting the number of '1's before each '0' and adding one for the '0' itself.

But is this the minimal cost?

Let me consider a smaller example.

Take "10": according to the function, cost = 2.

Indeed, shifting the entire string costs 2, and it sorts it.

Another example: "110".

According to the function, `one = 2` when it sees the '0', so cost = 2 + 1 = 3.

Indeed, shifting the entire string "110" -> "011", cost = 3.

Alternatively, shifting substring [2,3]: "10" -> "01", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "101". Still not sorted.

Then, shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", cost = 3.

Then, shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost = 3.

Total cost: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8, which is worse than shifting the entire string once for cost 3.

So, the function's cost of 3 is better.

Another example: "1010".

According to the function:

- First '1': one = 1

- Second '0': one = 1, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- Third '1': one = 2

- Fourth '0': one = 2, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- Total cost = 2 + 3 = 5

Is there a way to sort "1010" with cost less than 5?

Let's try:

Select substring [2,4]: "010" -> "001", cost = 3.

Now, the string is "1001".

Select substring [3,4]: "01" -> "10", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "1010". Still not sorted.

Select substring [2,3]: "01" -> "10", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "1100". Sorted.

Total cost: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which is higher than 5.

Alternatively, select substring [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", cost = 4.

Now, select substring [1,2]: "01" -> "10", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "1001".

Select substring [3,4]: "01" -> "10", cost = 2.

Now, the string is "1010". Not sorted.

This is getting tricky.

Maybe the function's cost of 5 is indeed the minimal.

Another approach: think in terms of bubble sort, where each cyclic shift is like swapping adjacent elements with a cost.

But in this problem, the cyclic shift can be on any substring, not just adjacent elements.

Wait, but in this problem, a cyclic shift on a substring can be seen as moving the last character to the front, which is different from swapping adjacent elements.

I need to find a way to model this operation to minimize the total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the string as a sequence of '1's and '0's, and count the number of '1's that need to be moved after the '0's.

But I need to consider the cost associated with moving them.

Wait, maybe it's better to accept that the function provided is correct based on the examples and the logic behind it.

The function seems to correctly calculate the minimal cost required to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings with the associated costs.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
