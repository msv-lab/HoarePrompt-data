Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n, and f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) is greater than f(x, z). Here, f(l, r) is the XOR of all elements from a_l to a_r.

First, I need to understand what f(x, y) represents. It's the XOR of elements from a_x to a_y. Similarly, f(y, z) is the XOR from a_y to a_z, and f(x, z) is the XOR from a_x to a_z.

So, the condition is f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z).

I recall that XOR has some properties that might be useful here. For instance, XOR is associative and commutative, which could help in simplifying the expression.

Let me think about what f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) is. Since f(x, y) is a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y, and f(y, z) is a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z, then f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) would be:

(a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

Because XOR is associative and commutative, this simplifies to a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_z, which is exactly f(x, z).

Wait a minute, that can't be right. Because if f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = f(x, z), then the condition becomes f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is always false. But in the example, there are tuples that satisfy the condition. So, where did I go wrong?

Ah, I see. The XOR operation is not cancellative in the way I thought. Let's recast this.

Given that f(x, y) = a_x to a_y XOR, f(y, z) = a_y to a_z XOR, and f(x, z) = a_x to a_z XOR.

I need to find when f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z).

But f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x to a_y XOR) XOR (a_y to a_z XOR) = a_x to a_z XOR, as the a_y terms cancel out.

Wait, no. Actually, XOR is not about cancellation in the same way as addition. Let me think again.

Actually, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x to a_y XOR) XOR (a_y to a_z XOR). Because of associativity, this is a_x to a_z XOR.

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = f(x, z).

Therefore, the condition is f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is never true. But the example shows that there are tuples that satisfy the condition. So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, wait, the condition is f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z), not the other way around.

So, if f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = f(x, z), then the condition is f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is never true. But in the example, there are tuples where this is supposed to be true. So, perhaps I need to re-express the condition.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying f(x, y) XOR f(y, z).

Let me try to compute f(x, y) XOR f(y, z):

f(x, y) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y

f(y, z) = a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR ... XOR a_z)

When I XOR these two, the a_y terms will cancel out, because a_y XOR a_y = 0. So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z.

Wait, that's different from f(x, z), which is a_x XOR ... XOR a_z.

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

而 f(x, z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_z

所以 f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = f(x, z) XOR a_y

因为 f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (f(x, z) XOR a_y)

Wait, is that correct? Let's see:

f(x, y) = f(x, z) XOR f(y+1, z)

Wait, no. Actually, f(x, y) = f(x, z) XOR f(y+1, z)

因为 f(x, z) = f(x, y) XOR f(y+1, z)

所以 f(x, y) = f(x, z) XOR f(y+1, z)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me recall that XOR has the property that a XOR b = c implies a = b XOR c, etc.

Let me try to express f(x, y) XOR f(y, z):

f(x, y) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_y

f(y, z) = a_y XOR ... XOR a_z

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR ... XOR a_z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_z

Wait, no. More carefully:

f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

When you XOR these, the a_y terms cancel out, so you get a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z.

Which is f(x, z) XOR a_y.

因为 f(x, z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_z

所以 f(x, z) XOR a_y = (a_x XOR ... XOR a_z) XOR a_y

Which is equal to f(x, y) XOR f(y, z), as we have.

所以，条件是 f(x, z) XOR a_y > f(x, z)

所以，我们需要 f(x, z) XOR a_y > f(x, z)

现在，我需要找出对于哪些 (x, y, z)，这个不等式成立。

这看起来有点复杂，我需要找到一种方法来高效地计算满足这个条件的元组数量。

首先，注意到 x ≤ y ≤ z，所以 y 在 x 和 z 之间。

给定这个条件，我需要找到一种方法来计算满足 f(x, z) XOR a_y > f(x, z) 的 (x, y, z) 的数量。

也许我可以先固定 y，然后对于每个 y，计算满足条件的 x 和 z 的数量。

但是，n 可以达到 1e5，t 可以达到 1e4，总和是 1e5，所以需要一个 O(n) 或 O(n log n) 的解决方案。

我需要找到一种优化的方法来计算这个。

首先，考虑 XOR 操作的性质。XOR 是按位进行的，每一位独立。

也许我可以考虑每一位上，XOR 的影响。

但是，直接这样可能太慢了。

让我尝试将问题分解。

给定 f(x, z) 和 a_y，我需要检查 f(x, z) XOR a_y > f(x, z)

让我考虑 f(x, z) XOR a_y 这个表达式。

我注意到，对于任何两个数 a 和 b，a XOR b > a 当且仅当 b 不是 a 的子集在二进制表示中。

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it.

也许我应该考虑 f(x, z) XOR a_y - f(x, z) > 0

因为 f(x, z) XOR a_y 可以看作是 f(x, z) + a_y 如果没有进位，但 XOR 不是简单的加法。

这可能不是最好的方向。

让我尝试具体化。

假设 f(x, z) = a，a_y = b。

那么，a XOR b > a

我需要找出对于哪些 a 和 b，这个不等式成立。

让我考虑 a 和 b 的二进制表示。

XOR 操作会翻转 a 的与 b 中对应位为1的位。

所以，a XOR b > a 当且仅当 b 的最高有效位大于 a 的对应位。

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the most significant bit where a and b differ.

Let me recall that for two numbers x and y, x > y if and only if the most significant bit where they differ has a 1 in x and a 0 in y.

So, for a XOR b > a, the most significant bit where a XOR b and a differ should have a 1 in a XOR b and a 0 in a.

Wait, a XOR b is greater than a when the highest bit where a XOR b and a differ is set to 1 in a XOR b and 0 in a.

But a XOR b differs from a in the bits where b has 1.

Wait, no. a XOR b flips the bits of a where b has 1.

So, a XOR b > a 当且仅当最高位的 b 的位为1，并且在那一位上 a 是0。

Wait, more precisely, let's look at the binary representation from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.

Find the leftmost bit where b has a 1. If a has a 0 in that position, then a XOR b will have a 1 in that position, making it larger than a.

If a already has a 1 in that position, then a XOR b will have a 0 in that position, making it smaller than a.

So, a XOR b > a 当且仅当 b 的最高有效位1对应 a 的那一位是0。

所以，对于我们的条件 f(x, z) XOR a_y > f(x, z)，这等价于 a_y 的最高有效位1对应的 f(x, z) 的位是0。

现在，我需要对于每个 y，找到所有 x 和 z，使得 f(x, z) 的最高有效位1在 a_y 的相应位上是0。

这看起来仍然比较抽象，我需要找到一种方法来高效地计算这个。

也许我可以预先计算 f(x, z) 的值，然后对于每个 y，根据 a_y 的最高有效位1来统计满足条件的 f(x, z)。

但是，n 很大，这样可能不现实。

让我考虑前缀 XOR。

定义 prefix[i] = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_i

那么，f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

所以，f(x, z) = prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z]

现在，我需要对于每个 y，找到所有 x 和 z，使得 prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR a_y > prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z]

Let me denote p = prefix[x-1], q = prefix[z]

So, p XOR q XOR a_y > p XOR q

From our earlier analysis, this holds when the highest set bit of a_y in p XOR q is 0.

Wait, more precisely, when the highest set bit of a_y is set to 0 in p XOR q.

Wait, let's recall that a XOR b > a when the highest bit where a and a XOR b differ is set to 1 in a XOR b and 0 in a.

Here, a is p XOR q, and b is a_y.

So, p XOR q XOR a_y > p XOR q when the highest bit where p XOR q and p XOR q XOR a_y differ, which is the highest set bit of a_y, is set to 1 in p XOR q XOR a_y and 0 in p XOR q.

So, the highest set bit of a_y must be 0 in p XOR q, and 1 in p XOR q XOR a_y.

Which means that p XOR q has the highest set bit of a_y as 0, and a_y has that bit as 1.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

Given that p XOR q is some value, and p XOR q XOR a_y is greater than p XOR q.

From earlier, this happens when the highest bit where a_y has a 1 corresponds to a 0 in p XOR q.

So, for a_y, find its highest set bit, say bit k.

Then, p XOR q must have bit k as 0.

Because if bit k is 0 in p XOR q and a_y has bit k as 1, then p XOR q XOR a_y will have bit k as 1, making it larger than p XOR q.

If bit k is 1 in p XOR q, then p XOR q XOR a_y will have bit k as 0, making it smaller than p XOR q.

Therefore, the condition simplifies to: for each y, find all x and z such that prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] has the highest set bit of a_y as 0.

Now, I need to find a way to count the number of pairs (x, z) where prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] has a specific bit as 0.

This seems manageable.

Let me denote that for each y, I can determine the highest set bit of a_y, say it's bit k (0-indexed from the least significant bit).

Then, for each y, I need to count the number of pairs (x, z) where prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] has bit k as 0.

Since prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] is equal to f(x, z), which is the XOR from a_x to a_z.

But to make it efficient, perhaps I can precompute for each bit position how many prefix[i] have that bit set.

Wait, maybe.

Let me consider that for a specific bit k, and for a specific y where the highest set bit is k.

Then, for all pairs (x, z), prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] should have bit k as 0.

Which means that prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] should have the same value for bit k.

Because XOR of two same bits is 0.

So, if prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] both have bit k as 0 or both as 1, then prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] will have bit k as 0.

Therefore, for each y, with the highest set bit k in a_y, the number of pairs (x, z) where prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] have the same value for bit k.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I can precompute for each prefix[i], the value of each bit.

But n can be up to 1e5, and t up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is 1e5, so it should be manageable.

So, here's a plan:

1. For each test case, compute the prefix XOR array.

2. For each y from 1 to n:

a. Determine the highest set bit k of a_y.

b. Count the number of pairs (x, z) where x <= y and z >= y, and prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] has bit k as 0.

c. Given that prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] has bit k as 0, which means prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] have the same value for bit k.

d. So, for each bit k, precompute the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 0 and where bit k is 1.

e. Then, for a given y and k, the number of pairs (x, z) where prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] both have bit k as 0 or both have bit k as 1.

f. But x <= y and z >= y.

g. So, need to consider the number of prefix[x-1] with x <= y where bit k is 0, and the number where bit k is 1.

h. Similarly, the number of prefix[z] with z >= y where bit k is 0 and 1.

i. Then, the total number of pairs where both prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] have bit k as 0 is (count_prefix[x-1 < y, k=0] * count_prefix[z >= y, k=0])

j. Similarly, the number of pairs where both have bit k as 1 is (count_prefix[x-1 < y, k=1] * count_prefix[z >= y, k=1])

k. So, total pairs for this y is the sum of the above two.

3. Sum over all y to get the total number of tuples.

Wait, but x can be from 1 to y, and z can be from y to n.

So, for each y, I need to consider x from 1 to y, and z from y to n.

Also, prefix[0] is 0.

So, for x=1, prefix[0]=0.

I need to make sure to handle prefix[0].

Let me think about how to compute count_prefix[x-1 < y, k=0] and count_prefix[x-1 < y, k=1]

Similarly, count_prefix[z >= y, k=0] and count_prefix[z >= y, k=1]

I can precompute for each bit k, the prefix counts.

Let me try to outline this.

First, compute the prefix XOR array.

Then, for each bit position k (from 0 to 31, since a_i can be up to 1e9, which is within 31 bits), compute two arrays:

- pre[k]: the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 0, for i from 0 to y-1.

- suf[k]: the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 0, for i from y to n.

Similarly, pre[k][1] is the number where bit k is 1 for prefix[i] from 0 to y-1.

And suf[k][1] is the number where bit k is 1 for prefix[i] from y to n.

Wait, perhaps it's better to have pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for the number of prefix[i] with bit k being 0 or 1, respectively, for i from 0 to y-1.

Similarly, suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for i from y to n.

Then, for each y, and for the k corresponding to the highest set bit of a_y, the number of valid (x, z) pairs is:

(pre[k][0] * suf[k][0]) + (pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])

Because we need prefix[x-1] and prefix[z] to have the same value for bit k.

Now, I need to initialize these arrays properly.

First, compute the prefix XOR array.

Then, for each bit k from 0 to 31:

- pre[k][0] counts the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 0, for i from 0 to y-1.

- pre[k][1] counts the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 1, for i from 0 to y-1.

- suf[k][0] counts the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 0, for i from y to n.

- suf[k][1] counts the number of prefix[i] where bit k is 1, for i from y to n.

I can precompute suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by iterating from n to 1, and pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by iterating from 1 to n.

Wait, actually, it's better to initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1 to n+1.

Similarly for suf[k][0] and suf[k][1].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y from 0 to n.

Similarly, suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y from 0 to n.

But I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me think about y from 1 to n.

For each y, x can be from 1 to y, which corresponds to prefix[x-1] where x-1 is from 0 to y-1.

And z can be from y to n.

So, for each y, pre[k][0] is the number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from 0 to y-1.

Similarly, suf[k][0] is the number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from y to n.

Similarly for 1.

Then, for each y, and for the k corresponding to the highest set bit of a_y, the number of valid (x, z) pairs is pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1].

Now, I need to compute pre[k][0], pre[k][1], suf[k][0], suf[k][1] for all y from 1 to n.

I can do this by iterating y from 1 to n+1, and updating pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] accordingly.

Similarly, iterate y from n to 0, and update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1].

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate y from 1 to n, and for each y, update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] up to y-1, and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] from y to n.

But to make it efficient, I can precompute prefix[k][0] and prefix[k][1] up to each y.

Let me try to define:

For each bit k from 0 to 31:

- pre[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from 0 to y-1.

- pre[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from 0 to y-1.

- suf[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from y to n.

- suf[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from y to n.

I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1.

Then, for y from 1 to n:

- For each bit k, check prefix[y-1]'s k-th bit.

- If it's 0, increment pre[k][0] for y.

- If it's 1, increment pre[k][1] for y.

Similarly, initialize suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=n+1.

Then, for y from n downto 1:

- For each bit k, check prefix[y]'s k-th bit.

- If it's 0, increment suf[k][0] for y.

- If it's 1, increment suf[k][1] for y.

Wait, perhaps it's better to precompute for each bit k, the prefix sum of prefix[i] with bit k=0 and bit k=1 up to y.

Similarly, the suffix sum from y to n.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute the prefix XOR array.

Then, for each bit k from 0 to 31:

- pre[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from 0 to y-1.

- pre[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from 0 to y-1.

- suf[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from y to n.

- suf[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from y to n.

I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1.

For y=1:

- pre[k][0] = number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from 0 to 0.

- pre[k][1] = number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from 0 to 0.

Similarly, for suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1: suffix from y=1 to n.

Then, for each y from 1 to n:

- For the current y, determine the highest set bit k of a_y.

- Then, the number of valid (x, z) pairs is pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1].

- Then, update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by including prefix[y].

- Update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by excluding prefix[y].

Wait, perhaps it's better to have pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] up to y-1.

And suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] from y to n.

Then, as y increases, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] include prefix[y-1], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] exclude prefix[y-1].

So, I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1: pre[k][0] = number of prefix[i<1] with bit k=0, which is prefix[0].

Similarly for pre[k][1].

Then, for y from 1 to n:

- Determine k for a_y.

- Compute ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1].

- Update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by including prefix[y-1].

- Update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by excluding prefix[y-1].

Wait, but to exclude prefix[y-1], I need to decrement the corresponding suf[k][bit] where bit is the bit value of prefix[y-1] at position k.

This seems manageable.

So, here's the plan:

- Compute prefix XOR array.

- For each bit k from 0 to 31:

- Compute pre[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from 0 to y-1.

- pre[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i from 0 to y-1.

- suf[k][0]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=0 for i from y to n.

- suf[k][1]: number of prefix[i] with bit k=1 for i
