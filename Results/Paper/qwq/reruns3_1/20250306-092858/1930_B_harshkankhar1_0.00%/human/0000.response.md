Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there shouldn't be any two different indices i and j (where i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Hmm, that means that for any pair of positions i and j, if the number at position i divides the number at position j, and the number at position i+1 divides the number at position j+1, then that's not allowed.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Let's consider all possible pairs of i and j:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4 divides p_2=1? No, because 4 doesn't divide 1. So, this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4 divides p_3=2? Yes, 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, but not the other way around. So, this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4 divides p_4=3? No, 4 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1 divides p_3=2? Yes, 1 divides 2. Now check p_{i+1}=p_3=2 divides p_{j+1}=p_4=3? 2 doesn't divide 3. So, this pair is fine.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1 divides p_4=3? Yes, 1 divides 3. But p_3=2 divides p_5? Wait, p_5 doesn't exist because n=4. The problem says 1 ≤ i, j < n, so j+1 should be less than or equal to n. So, j can be up to n-1=3. So, j=3 is the maximum.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

So, for n=4, the permutation [4,1,2,3] seems to satisfy the condition.

In the second test case, n=3, and the output is [1,2,3]. Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1 divides p_2=2? Yes, 1 divides 2. Now, p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1 divides p_3=3? Yes, 1 divides 3. p_2=2 divides p_4? Again, p_4 doesn't exist. So, no issue.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No, 2 doesn't divide 3. Fine.

So, this permutation is also valid.

Now, looking at the program provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

    print(a)

This code defines a function func_1 that reads n, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based), and prints the list.

Let's see what this does for n=4:

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3], which is different from [3,2,1,4]. So, is [3,2,1,4] a valid permutation?

Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 divides p_2=2? No. Fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 divides p_3=1? No. Fine.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=3 divides p_4=4? No. Fine.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=1? No. Fine.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes. Now check p_3=1 divides p_5? Again, p_5 doesn't exist. So, no issue.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=1 divides p_4=4? Yes. p_4=4 divides p_5? Doesn't exist. So, fine.

So, [3,2,1,4] seems to be valid as well.

But in the example, [4,1,2,3] is provided, and the code produces [3,2,1,4]. Both seem to be valid, so the code might be correct.

Let's try n=3:

a = [1,2,3]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1]

But in the example, [1,2,3] is provided, which is valid, but the code produces [3,2,1], which is also valid.

Let's check if [3,2,1] is valid for n=3:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3 divides p_2=2? No. Fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3 divides p_3=1? No. Because 3 doesn't divide 1.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=1? No. Fine.

So, it seems valid.

Wait, but in the note, it says that for n=3, all 6 permutations are valid. So, [3,2,1] is indeed valid.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for these cases.

Let's think about the general case.

The code reverses the elements at even indices. So, for n=5:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Let's check if this is valid:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes. Now, p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No. So, fine.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No. Fine.

So, [5,2,3,4,1] seems valid.

Another example: n=6

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=5 divides p_5=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes. p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No. Fine.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=1? No.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=1? No.

So, [5,2,3,4,1,6] seems valid.

It seems like this method of reversing the elements at even indices is producing valid permutations for the given constraints. But is there a general proof that this method always produces a valid permutation?

Let's try to reason about it.

Suppose we have n, and we create a list a = [1,2,3,...,n], then reverse the elements at even indices.

So, a[0], a[2], a[4],... are reversed.

For example, for n=4: original [1,2,3,4], after reversing even indices: [4,2,1,3]

Wait, in earlier examples, for n=4, it was [3,2,1,4], but in this case, it's [4,2,1,3]. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the code, a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

For n=4:

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, in my earlier thought, I thought it was [4,2,1,3], but that's incorrect. It's [3,2,1,4]

Similarly, for n=6:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly thought it was [4,2,1,3], but actually, it's [3,2,1,4]. So, I need to correct that.

Now, to generalize, the permutation p is such that p[0] = n - (0//2) * 2, p[1] = 2, p[2] = n -1, p[3] = 4, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to generalize this.

Let me consider that the even indices (0-based) are reversed, so p[0] = n, p[2] = n-2, p[4] = n-4, and so on, down to p[n-2] = n - (n//2)*2 + 2, and the odd indices remain the same, p[1] = 2, p[3]=4, etc.

Wait, but for n=4:

p[0] = 4, p[1]=2, p[2]=1, p[3]=3

Wait, but earlier I saw that for n=4, the code produces [3,2,1,4], but according to this, p[0]=4, p[1]=2, p[2]=1, p[3]=3, but that's different from [3,2,1,4]. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, for n=4:

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Yes, p[0]=3, p[1]=2, p[2]=1, p[3]=4

Okay, so the even indices (0-based) are reversed.

Similarly, for n=5:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Yes.

So, generalizing, for any n, the permutation p is constructed by reversing the elements at even indices.

Now, I need to verify if this construction always satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

To prove this, I need to show that for any i and j, if p_i divides p_j, then p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}, or vice versa.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can look for a pattern or invariant in the constructed permutation.

Looking at the constructed permutation, for even indices (0-based), the numbers are decreasing: for n=4, p[0]=3, p[2]=1; for n=5, p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[4]=1.

And for odd indices, the numbers are increasing: p[1]=2, p[3]=4, etc.

Wait, in n=4: [3,2,1,4]

- p[0]=3, p[1]=2, p[2]=1, p[3]=4

- Even indices: p[0]=3, p[2]=1 (decreasing)

- Odd indices: p[1]=2, p[3]=4 (increasing)

In n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

- p[0]=5, p[1]=2, p[2]=3, p[3]=4, p[4]=1

- Even indices: p[0]=5, p[2]=3, p[4]=1 (decreasing)

- Odd indices: p[1]=2, p[3]=4 (increasing)

So, it seems that even indices have numbers in decreasing order, and odd indices have numbers in increasing order.

Maybe this property helps in satisfying the condition.

Let's consider that for even indices, the numbers are decreasing, and for odd indices, they are increasing.

Suppose I have two indices i and j, with i < j.

Case 1: both i and j are even.

Then, p_i > p_j (since even indices are decreasing), and p_{i+1} and p_{j+1} are from odd indices, which are increasing.

So, p_{i+1} < p_{j+1}.

If p_i divides p_j, but p_i > p_j, that's only possible if p_j is a multiple of p_i, but p_j < p_i, which is only possible if p_j = p_i * k for some integer k >=2.

But in that case, p_{i+1} < p_{j+1}, so p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} only if p_{j+1} is a multiple of p_{i+1}.

But since p_{i+1} < p_{j+1}, it's possible, but maybe the construction avoids this.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe I should look for counterexamples where the condition fails.

Let's try n=6:

p = [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check for i=1 (p[1]=2), j=3 (p[3]=4):

p_1=2 divides p_3=4, and p_2=3 divides p_4=4? No, 3 doesn't divide 4. So, fine.

i=1, j=4: p_1=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_2=3 divides p_5=1? No. Fine.

i=1, j=5: p_1=2 divides p_5=1? No.

i=2, j=3: p_2=3 divides p_3=4? No.

i=2, j=4: p_2=3 divides p_4=4? No.

i=2, j=5: p_2=3 divides p_5=1? Yes, but p_3=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, 4 divides 6? No. So, fine.

i=3, j=4: p_3=4 divides p_4=1? No.

i=3, j=5: p_3=4 divides p_5=1? No.

i=4, j=5: p_4=1 divides p_5=6? Yes, but p_5=6 divides p_6=6? Yes, but j+1=6 is within bounds?

Wait, j can be up to n-1=5, so j+1=6 is allowed.

So, p_4=1 divides p_5=6, and p_5=6 divides p_6=6? Yes, but in the condition, it's specified that i and j are less than n, so j < n, and j+1 <= n.

But in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ i, j < n, and i ≠ j.

So, for i=4, j=5: p_4=1 divides p_5=6, and p_5=6 divides p_6=6? Yes, but is this allowed or not?

Wait, the condition says that there do not exist i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In this case, i=4, j=5: p_4=1 divides p_5=6, and p_5=6 divides p_6=6. So, both conditions are satisfied, which violates the rule.

Wait, but in the permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6], for i=4 (p_4=1), j=5 (p_5=6), p_4 divides p_5 (1 divides 6), and p_5=6 divides p_6=6. So, this violates the condition.

Therefore, the permutation [5,2,3,4,1,6] is invalid according to the problem's condition.

But according to the code, for n=6, it should produce [5,2,3,4,1,6], but this is invalid.

Wait, but earlier examples seemed valid. Maybe this method doesn't always work.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the indices. Let's check again.

Wait, in Python, list indices start from 0, but in the problem, indices start from 1.

In the code, a = list(range(1, n+1)), then a[::2] = a[::2][::-1].

So, a[0] is p_1, a[1] is p_2, and so on.

So, for n=6:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Now, let's check for i=4, j=5:

p_4=4, p_5=1: 4 does not divide 1. Wait, earlier I thought p_4=1, but no, p_4=4.

Wait, in a = [5,2,3,4,1,6], p_1=5, p_2=2, p_3=3, p_4=4, p_5=1, p_6=6.

So, i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=1? No, because 4 doesn't divide 1.

So, no violation there.

Another check: i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No. Fine.

i=1, j=3: p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No.

i=1, j=4: p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No.

i=1, j=5: p_1=5 divides p_5=1? No.

i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=1? No.

i=3, j=4: p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No.

i=3, j=5: p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No.

So, [5,2,3,4,1,6] seems valid after all.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought p_4=1, but it's p_4=4. My bad.

So, perhaps this method works.

Let me try n=7:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7][::-1] = [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes. p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No. Fine.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes. p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No. Fine.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes. p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No. Fine.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes. p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No. Fine.

So, [7,2,5,4,3,6,1] seems valid.

Seems like this method works for n=7 as well.

Let me think about why this method might work in general.

In this construction, the even indices (1-based) remain the same, i.e., p_2=2, p_4=4, p_6=6, etc.

The odd indices (1-based) are in decreasing order: p_1=n, p_3=n-2, p_5=n-4, and so on.

So, for even i (1-based), p_i = i

For odd i (1-based), p_i = n - (i//2)*2

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see for n=4: p=[3,2,1,4]

- p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1, p_4=4

For n=5: p=[5,2,3,4,1]

- p_1=5, p_2=2, p_3=3, p_4=4, p_5=1

For n=6: p=[5,2,3,4,1,6]

- p_1=5, p_2=2, p_3=3, p_4=4, p_5=1, p_6=6

For n=7: p=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

- p_1=7, p_2=2, p_3=5, p_4=4, p_5=3, p_6=6, p_7=1

It seems like for odd i (1-based), p_i decreases from n to 1 in steps of 2, and for even i, p_i increases from 2 to n in steps of 2.

Wait, for n=4: p=[3,2,1,4]

- odd indices: p1=3, p3=1 (decreasing)

- even indices: p2=2, p4=4 (increasing)

For n=5: p=[5,2,3,4,1]

- odd: p1=5, p3=3, p5=1 (decreasing)

- even: p2=2, p4=4 (increasing)

For n=6: p=[5,2,3,4,1,6]

- odd: p1=5, p3=3, p5=1 (decreasing)

- even: p
