Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem describes two conditions:

1. If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as t's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that at least one position i violates one of the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider the positions where a and b differ from c, because for those positions, I can set t in a way that a and b match, but c does not.

Wait, but it's more nuanced than that because t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, which impose different constraints on the matching strings.

Let me consider position by position.

For each position i from 1 to n, I need to decide whether to make t's i-th character lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t's i-th character to be lowercase, then both a and b must have the same character as t at that position, and c must have a different character.

If I choose t's i-th character to be uppercase, then both a and b must have a character different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character, and c must have the same as the lowercase version.

Wait, no.

Let me re-read the conditions carefully.

If t's i-th character is lowercase:

- a's i-th character must be equal to t's i-th character.

- b's i-th character must be equal to t's i-th character.

- c's i-th character must be different from t's i-th character.

If t's i-th character is uppercase:

- a's i-th character must be different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

- b's i-th character must be different from the lowercase version of t's i ith character.

- c's i-th character must be equal to the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

Wait, no.

Wait, when t's i-th character is uppercase, the condition is that s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

So, for a and b to match t when t's i-th character is uppercase, a_i and b_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

For c to not match t, c_i must be the same as the lowercase version of t_i.

Wait, no. If t's i-th character is uppercase, then for the string to match, s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

Therefore, for c to not match t, c_i must be the same as the lowercase version of t_i.

Wait, actually, the problem says that c does not match t, which means that at least one position i violates the condition for matching.

So, for c to not match t, there exists at least one i where:

- If t_i is lowercase, then c_i != t_i.

- If t_i is uppercase, then c_i == lowercase(t_i).

So, in other words, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where the mismatch condition holds.

But I need to ensure that a and b both match t, and c does not.

So, I need to find a template t such that:

- For all i, if t_i is lowercase, then a_i == t_i and b_i == t_i.

- For all i, if t_i is uppercase, then a_i != lowercase(t_i) and b_i != lowercase(t_i).

- There exists at least one i where:

  - If t_i is lowercase, then c_i != t_i.

  - If t_i is uppercase, then c_i == lowercase(t_i).

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider each position i independently and see what constraints they impose on t_i.

For each position i, I have the following possibilities:

1. a_i == b_i == c_i:

   - In this case, it's impossible to have a and b match t while c does not, because whatever t_i I choose, if t_i is lowercase, then t_i must be equal to a_i (since a matches t), but then c also matches t because c_i == a_i == t_i.

   - If t_i is uppercase, then a_i and b_i must be different from lowercase(t_i), but since a_i == b_i == c_i, and a_i != lowercase(t_i), then c_i != lowercase(t_i), which means c matches t if t_i is uppercase.

   - Therefore, in this case, it's impossible to have a and b match t while c does not.

2. a_i == b_i != c_i:

   - Here, a and b have the same character, which is different from c_i.

   - If I set t_i to be lowercase and equal to a_i, then a and b match t, and c does not match t because c_i != t_i.

   - This seems to work.

3. a_i != b_i:

   - If a_i != b_i, then it's impossible for both a and b to match t at position i.

   - Because if t_i is lowercase, then both a_i and b_i must equal t_i, but since a_i != b_i, this is impossible.

   - If t_i is uppercase, then both a_i and b_i must be different from lowercase(t_i). But even in this case, it's possible that a_i != b_i and both are different from lowercase(t_i).

   - However, for c to not match t, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i).

   - So, in this scenario, I need to set t_i to be uppercase, and ensure that a_i and b_i are both different from lowercase(t_i), and c_i == lowercase(t_i).

   - This is possible only if a_i != b_i and both a_i and b_i are different from c_i.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If a_i != b_i, and I set t_i to be uppercase, then:

- a_i != lowercase(t_i)

- b_i != lowercase(t_i)

- c_i == lowercase(t_i)

So, for this to hold, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i), and a_i and b_i must both be different from lowercase(t_i).

Therefore, in this case, it's possible only if c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, t_i is uppercase, so lowercase(t_i) is determined.

Let me denote lowercase(t_i) as t_i_lower.

So, for t_i being uppercase:

- a_i != t_i_lower

- b_i != t_i_lower

- c_i == t_i_lower

Therefore, for this to be possible, c_i must be different from both a_i and b_i, because a_i != t_i_lower and b_i != t_i_lower, and c_i == t_i_lower.

So, in this case, it's possible only if c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, no.

Wait, if c_i == t_i_lower, and a_i != t_i_lower and b_i != t_i_lower, then yes, a and b match t, and c does not.

But in this scenario, a_i and b_i are different from each other and from c_i.

So, in summary:

- If a_i == b_i == c_i, it's impossible.

- If a_i == b_i != c_i, set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

- If a_i != b_i, then set t_i to be uppercase, with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i, provided that c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i.

Therefore, for each position i, I can determine whether it's possible to set t_i in a way that a and b match t, and c does not.

Then, for the entire string, I need to make sure that:

- For all positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i, set t_i to be uppercase, with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i, provided c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i.

- Additionally, ensure that in positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, it's impossible, so in such cases, the answer is "NO".

Wait, but in positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, I can set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i, which makes a and b match, and c does not.

In positions where a_i != b_i, I can set t_i to be uppercase, with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i, provided that c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i.

If c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i in such positions, then it's impossible.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, then if I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i == a_i, then a_i == c_i == t_i_lower, but the condition for t_i being uppercase is that a_i != t_i_lower, which would be violated.

Similarly, if c_i == b_i, it would violate the condition for b_i.

Therefore, in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, it's impossible.

So, in summary:

- For positions where a_i == b_i == c_i: impossible.

- For positions where a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i: impossible.

Therefore, if there are any positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, or where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, then it's impossible to find such a template t.

Otherwise, it's possible to construct t by setting:

- For positions where a_i == b_i != c_i: t_i = a_i (lowercase)

- For positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: t_i = c_i.upper()

So, in code, I can iterate through each position, check these conditions, and if all positions satisfy the possible scenarios, then print "YES", otherwise "NO".

Wait, but I need to make sure that for positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i.

But in the problem, t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters.

So, I need to choose for each position whether t_i is lowercase or uppercase, based on the above rules.

Also, I need to make sure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, no. The condition is that c does not match t, meaning that there exists at least one position where the mismatch condition holds.

But in the positions where t_i is lowercase, c_i must be different from t_i.

In positions where t_i is uppercase, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i).

So, to ensure that c does not match t, there must be at least one position where c_i does not satisfy the matching condition.

But in the way I'm constructing t, for positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, setting t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i ensures that c_i != t_i, so c does not match t at that position.

Similarly, in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, setting t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) equal to c_i ensures that c_i == lowercase(t_i), so c does not match t at that position.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t_i is uppercase and lowercase(t_i) == c_i, then c_i == lowercase(t_i), which violates the matching condition for c, meaning c does not match t.

Wait, but according to the problem, if t_i is uppercase, then s_i must be different from lowercase(t_i) for s to match t.

Therefore, for c to not match t, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i).

So, in this case, by setting t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i, c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, in such positions, c does not match t.

Similarly, in positions where t_i is lowercase and c_i != t_i, c does not match t.

So, in the construction I described earlier, c does not match t in at least one position.

Therefore, as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t, and in all other positions, a and b match t, then it's acceptable.

Wait, but I need to ensure that a and b both match t in all positions.

So, in positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, setting t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i ensures that a and b match t, and c does not.

In positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, setting t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i ensures that a and b match t (since a_i != c_i and b_i != c_i), and c does not match t.

In positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, it's impossible.

In positions where a_i != b_i and (c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i), it's impossible.

Therefore, if there are no positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, and no positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, then it's possible to construct such a template t.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, I can set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i, which makes a and b match t (since a_i != c_i and b_i != c_i), and c does not match t.

In positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, setting t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i makes a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Therefore, if there are no positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, and no positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the example provided:

1.

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Here, a != b, and c != a and c != b.

So, for position 1, a != b and c != a and c != b, so set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i == "c", so t_i == "C".

Then, a_i == "a" != "c", b_i == "b" != "c", so a and b match t.

c_i == "c" == lowercase(t_i), so c does not match t.

Therefore, "YES".

2.

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Here, position 1: a == "a", b == "b", c == "a"

So, a != b and c == a.

This falls into the impossible category because a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i.

Therefore, "NO".

3.

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Let's compare position by position.

For each position i from 1 to 10:

- If a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to lowercase a_i.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i.

- If a_i == b_i == c_i: impossible.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i: impossible.

I need to check if any position falls into the impossible categories.

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Comparing position by position:

1. m != l, c == a: impossible (a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i)

So, "NO".

Wait, but the sample output is "YES" for this case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, c is "adhoccoder", which is different from "mathforces" and "luckforces".

Let me compare position by position.

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Position 1: m != l, c == a: impossible.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "YES".

So, perhaps my earlier logic is incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that not all positions need to be set in a way that c does not match t, but at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where the mismatch condition holds.

But in the positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, setting t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i ensures that c does not match t at that position.

In positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, setting t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i ensures that c does not match t at that position.

In other positions, it's impossible.

But in the third sample input, position 1 has a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, which is impossible.

So, according to my earlier logic, it should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to choose for some positions to be lowercase and some to be uppercase in t, in a way that a and b match t in all positions, and c does not match t in at least one position.

Wait, but in the third sample input, for position 1, a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, which seems impossible.

But maybe there is a way to set t_i in such a way that a and b match t, and c does not, even in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to set t_i to be uppercase in positions where a_i != b_i, and ensure that c_i != lowercase(t_i).

Wait, but in the position where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, if I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, then:

- a_i != lowercase(t_i)

- b_i != lowercase(t_i)

- c_i != lowercase(t_i)

Wait, but this would mean that c matches t at that position, which is not what I want.

I need c to not match t in at least one position.

Wait, no.

If t_i is uppercase, then for c to not match t, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i).

So, if I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, then c_i != lowercase(t_i), which means c matches t at that position.

But I need c to not match t in at least one position.

So, in this case, it's impossible to have c not match t in this position.

Therefore, in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, it's impossible to find a t_i that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, in the third sample input, position 1 has a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, which should make it impossible.

But the sample output is "YES", which contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Therefore, I must have missed something.

Let me look at the third sample input again.

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Wait, c is "adhoccoder", which is different from both a and b in some positions.

Wait, let's compare position by position.

Position 1: a='m', b='l', c='a'

- a != b and c != b but c == a: impossible.

Therefore, according to my earlier logic, it should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

So, perhaps my logic is incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that even if in some positions it's impossible, in other positions it's possible, and overall, if there's a way to set t such that a and b match t in all positions, and c does not match t in at least one position.

But in this case, position 1 seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can set t_i to be uppercase in positions where a_i != b_i, with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, and in positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

But in position 1, a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i.

If I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, then:

- a_i != lowercase(t_i) (since c_i == a_i and lowercase(t_i) != c_i)

- b_i != lowercase(t_i) (since b_i != a_i and lowercase(t_i) != a_i)

- c_i == a_i != lowercase(t_i), so c_i != lowercase(t_i), which means c matches t at this position.

But I need c to not match t in at least one position.

So, in this setup, c matches t at position 1.

But in other positions, perhaps I can set t_i such that c does not match t.

But in position 1, c matches t, and in other positions, if I set t_i such that c does not match t, then overall, c does not match t because there exists at least one position where it does not match.

Wait, no.

The problem says that c does not match t, which means that there exists at least one position where the mismatch condition holds.

But in the positions where t_i is uppercase, c_i must be equal to lowercase(t_i) for c to not match t.

In the position where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, if I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, then c_i != lowercase(t_i), meaning c matches t at that position.

In other positions, I can set t_i to make c not match t.

But in this case, in position 1, c matches t, and in other positions, I can set t_i to make c not match t.

But the overall condition is that c does not match t, meaning that there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, if in position 1, c matches t, but in position 2, c does not match t, then overall, c does not match t.

Therefore, even in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, I can still set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, which makes c match t at that position, but in other positions, make c not match t.

Therefore, it's possible.

Wait, but in position 1, c matches t, and in position 2, c does not match t.

Does this mean that c does not match t overall?

Yes, because c does not match t if there exists at least one position where the condition is violated.

So, in this case, even if c matches t in some positions, as long as there is at least one position where it does not match, the overall result is that c does not match t.

Therefore, in the third sample input, it should be possible to set t in such a way that a and b match t in all positions, and c does not match t in at least one position.

Therefore, "YES".

So, my earlier logic was incomplete.

I need to ensure that:

- For all positions, a and b match t.

- There exists at least one position where c does not match t.

For a and b to match t in all positions:

- For positions where a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i: set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i if c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, for positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, I can still set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, which makes a and b match t (since a_i != lowercase(t_i) and b_i != lowercase(t_i)), and c matches t at that position (since c_i != lowercase(t_i)).

But in other positions, I can set t_i such that c does not match t.

Therefore, overall, c does not match t because there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

Therefore, it's possible.

So, in code, I need to:

- For positions where a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to be lowercase equal to a_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i.

- For positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i: set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i.

- Ensure that in at least one position, c does not match t.

Wait, but in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, setting t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i makes c match t at that position.

But in other positions, I need to have at least one position where c does not match t.

So, as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t, it's acceptable.

Therefore, in the third sample input, position 1: a != b and c == a, set t_i uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, so c matches t at position 1.

In position 2: a == b != c, set t_i lowercase equal to a_i, so c does not match t at position 2.

Therefore, overall, c does not match t because it does not match at position 2.

Therefore, "YES".

So, in code, I need to:

- For each position:

- If a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to lowercase a_i.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i: set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i.

- Ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

In the first case, position 1: a == b != c, set t_i to lowercase a_i, so c does not match t at position 1.

In the second case, position 1: a == b != c, set t_i to lowercase a_i, but c == a, so c does not match t at position 1.

Wait, no, c == a, so c_i == t_i if t_i is lowercase a_i, which means c matches t.

Wait, no, if t_i is lowercase a_i, and c_i == a_i, then c_i == t_i, which means c matches t.

Wait, but according to the problem, if t_i is lowercase, then c must be different from t_i to not match t.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t_i is lowercase, then for c to match t, c_i must be equal to t_i.

So, if c_i == t_i, c matches t at that position.

If c_i != t_i, c does not match t at that position.

But in the first case, position 1: a == b != c, set t_i to lowercase a_i, so c_i != t_i, meaning c does not match t at position 1.

Wait, but in the second case, position 1: a == b != c, set t_i to lowercase a_i, but c == a, which means c_i == t_i, so c matches t at position 1.

Wait, but in the second sample input:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

So, position 1: a='a', b='b', c='a'

- a != b and c == a, so set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i.

- Let's say t_i = 'B' (uppercase), so lowercase(t_i) = 'b'

- Then, a_i = 'a' != 'b', b_i = 'b' != 'b' (wait, 'b' != 'b'? No, 'b' == 'b'.

Wait, no, if t_i is 'B', lowercase(t_i) is 'b', so for b_i = 'b', b_i == lowercase(t_i), which means b does not match t.

Wait, according to the problem, if t_i is uppercase, then s_i must be different from lowercase(t_i) to match t.

So, for b_i = 'b', and lowercase(t_i) = 'b', then b_i == lowercase(t_i), which means b does not match t.

Therefore, in this case, b does not match t.

Wait, but I need b to match t.

So, in this scenario, it's impossible.

Therefore, in positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, it's impossible to have both a and b match t.

Wait, but in the third sample input, position 1: a='m', b='l', c='a'

- a != b and c == a

- If I set t_i to be uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i, say t_i = 'B' (lowercase 'b' != 'a')

- Then:

- a_i = 'm' != 'b', so a matches t.

- b_i = 'l' != 'b', so b matches t.

- c_i = 'a' != 'b', so c matches t.

Wait, but I need c to not match t in at least one position.

So, in this case, c matches t at position 1.

But in other positions, I can set t_i such that c does not match t.

For example, in position 2: a='a', b='u', c='d'

- a != b and c != a and c != b, so set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i == 'd', so t_i = 'D'

- Then:

- a_i = 'a' != 'd', so a matches t.

- b_i = 'u' != 'd', so b matches t.

- c_i = 'd' == 'd', so c does not match t at position 2.

Therefore, overall, c does not match t because it does not match at position 2, even though it matches at position 1.

Therefore, it's possible, and the answer is "YES".

So, in code, I need to:

- For each position:

- If a_i == b_i != c_i: set t_i to lowercase a_i.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i: set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) == c_i.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i: set t_i to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != c_i.

- Additionally, ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

- In positions where a_i == b_i != c_i, c does not match t.

- In positions where a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, c does not match t.

- In positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, c matches t.

- Therefore, as long as there is at least one position where a_i == b_i != c_i or a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, then it's possible.

- If all positions are either a_i == b_i == c_i (impossible) or a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i (where c matches t), then it's impossible.

Wait, but in the second sample input, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa"

- Position 1: a='a', b='b', c='a' -> a != b and c == a, so c matches t if t_i is set to uppercase with lowercase(t_i) != 'a'.

- Position 2: a='a', b='b', c='a' -> a != b and c == a, so c matches t.

- So, in both positions, c matches t, which means c matches t overall.

- Therefore, "NO".

In the third sample input, position 2: a='a', b='u', c='d' -> a != b and c != a and c != b, set t_i to uppercase 'D', so c does not match t at position 2.

Therefore, overall, c does not match t.

Hence, "YES".

Therefore, the condition is:

- If there exists at least one position where:

- a_i == b_i != c_i, or

- a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i

Then, "YES".

Else, "NO".

Because in such positions, c does not match t, and in other positions, even if c matches t, the overall result is that c does not match t.

Wait, but in the second sample input, position 2 is a='a', b='b', c='a', which is a != b and c == a, so c matches t at position 2.

But in position 1, it's the same situation, so c matches t at position 1.

Therefore, overall, c matches t, hence "NO".

In the third sample input, position 1: c matches t, position 2: c does not match t, hence overall c does not match t, hence "YES".

Therefore, the condition is:

- If there exists at least one position where:

- a_i == b_i != c_i, or

- a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i

And in all other positions:

- If a_i == b_i == c_i, it's impossible.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i, it's possible as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in the second sample input, there are positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, which is possible as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t.

But in that case, there is no such position, so "NO".

In the third sample input, there is at least one position where c does not match t, hence "YES".

Therefore, in code, I can check:

- Count the number of positions where:

- a_i == b_i != c_i, or

- a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i

- And ensure that there are no positions where a_i == b_i == c_i.

- If the count of such positions is greater than 0 and there are no impossible positions, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the third sample input, position 1 is a != b and c == a, which is possible as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Therefore, I need to:

- Check if there exists at least one position where c does not match t, and there are no positions where a_i == b_i == c_i.

- Positions where a_i == b_i == c_i are impossible.

- Positions where a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i or c_i == b_i are possible, as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Therefore, in code, I can:

- Iterate through each position.

- If a_i == b_i == c_i, it's impossible, so "NO".

- Else, if a_i == b_i != c_i or a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, it's a position where c does not match t.

- Keep track of such positions.

- If there is at least one such position, and no positions where a_i == b_i == c_i, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the second sample input, position 1:
