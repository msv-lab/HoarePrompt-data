Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x using a binary search-like algorithm. But here's the catch: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps on the permutation before running this binary search. The goal is to rearrange the permutation in such a way that after performing the modified binary search, the value at position l ends up being equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, the binary search algorithm described here is a bit unusual. Normally, binary search works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. But here, the array isn't sorted, and the binary search steps are a bit different:

1. Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

2. While r - l != 1:

a. Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2)

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m

c. Otherwise, set r = m

Wait a minute, this is interesting. In standard binary search, we have l = 0 and r = n, and we adjust l and r based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target. But here, l starts at 1, r at n+1, and the condition is p_m <= x.

I need to make sure I understand how this algorithm works. Let's consider an example.

Take n = 6, x = 3, and the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. So, it's already sorted.

Initialize l = 1, r = 7.

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4, which is greater than 3, so r = 4

Now, r - l = 4 - 1 = 3, which is not 1, so continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2, which is less than or equal to 3, so l = 2

Now, r - l = 4 - 2 = 2, not 1, so continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3, which is less than or equal to 3, so l = 3

Now, r - l = 4 - 3 = 1, so end the loop.

The final l is 3, and p_l = 3, which matches x. So, in this case, no swaps are needed.

Another example: n = 6, x = 5, array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Initialize l = 1, r = 7.

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 5, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 4

r - l = 7 - 4 = 3, continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 5

r - l = 7 - 5 = 2, continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 6

r - l = 7 - 6 = 1, stop.

p_l = p_6 = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, in this case, we need to perform some swaps before running the binary search to make p_l = 5.

The problem states that it's always possible to do this with at most two swaps.

I need to figure out a strategy to determine which swaps to make.

First, I need to understand what the binary search is trying to achieve.

In standard binary search on a sorted array, it's trying to find the position where the target value x would be located. But here, the array isn't sorted, and the binary search is adjusted.

Looking back at the steps:

- Initialize l = 1, r = n + 1

- While r - l != 1:

- m = floor((r + l)/2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- End while

- Check if p_l == x

So, after the loop, l points to a position where p_l should be equal to x.

But since the array isn't sorted, we need to manipulate it so that after at most two swaps, this condition holds.

I need to think about how the binary search proceeds and how the positions of elements affect the final l.

Let me think about the binary search process.

In each step, it calculates m as the floor of the average of l and r, then checks if p_m <= x.

- If yes, it sets l = m

- Else, it sets r = m

This continues until r - l = 1.

So, it's somewhat similar to finding a position where p_l <= x < p_r, but with r = l + 1.

Wait, but it's not exactly that, because the conditions are a bit different from standard binary search.

I need to see what the final l represents.

Let me consider the final state when r - l = 1.

At that point, l is such that if we were to insert x into the array, it would go right after position l.

But since the array isn't sorted, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Perhaps I should consider where x is located in the array and adjust the array so that after the binary search, l points to x.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to bring x to a position where the binary search will end up with l pointing to it.

Alternatively, I could try to make the array somewhat sorted around x to make the binary search work.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Perform the binary search as described and see where l ends up.

2. If p_l == x, we're done.

3. If not, perform some swaps to make p_l == x.

But I need to do this with at most two swaps.

Wait, perhaps I can swap x to the position where l points after the binary search.

For example, in the second case:

n = 6, x = 5

array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

After binary search:

l = 6, p_l = 4, which is not x=5.

So, I can swap p_l (4) with x (5), which is at position 4.

So, swap positions 4 and 6: array becomes [3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5]

Now, run the binary search again:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 5, so l = 4

r - l = 7 - 4 = 3, continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5, so l = 5

r - l = 7 - 5 = 2, continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6

p_6 = 5 <= 5, so l = 6

r - l = 7 - 6 = 1, stop.

Now, p_l = 5, which is x.

So, with one swap, I achieved the goal.

This seems promising.

Generalizing, after performing the binary search, if p_l != x, swap x's current position with position l.

Then, perform the binary search again and check if p_l == x.

If yes, output the swap performed.

If not, perform a second swap if necessary.

But in this example, one swap was enough.

Let's see another example.

Take n = 5, x = 1, array = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Run binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3

p_3 = 4 > 1, so r = 3

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2, continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 3 > 1, so r = 1

r - l = 1 - 1 = 0, stop.

p_l = p_1 = 3 != 1

So, need to swap.

Where is x=1? At position 5.

Swap position l=1 (3) with position 5 (1): array becomes [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]

Run binary search again:

l = 1, r = 6

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3

p_3 = 4 > 1, so r = 3

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2, continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2, continue.

Wait, r - l should be 3 - 1 = 2, which is not 1, so continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2, continue.

Wait, this seems like it's stuck in a loop.

Wait, perhaps I misimplemented the binary search steps.

Looking back at the problem:

After m is calculated, if p_m <= x, set l = m

Else, set r = m

And continue while r - l != 1

In the second loop:

l = 1, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

This seems like it will loop indefinitely.

Wait, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Looking back at the problem:

"The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x ."

It seems that I need to rearrange the array before running the binary search, not adjust it during the search.

Wait, no, I think I misread it.

It says: "rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x."

So, I need to perform up to two swaps on the array before running the binary search, and then run the binary search as is, and ensure that p_l == x.

I can't perform swaps during the search; I can only perform up to two swaps before starting the search.

So, in the above example, after swapping positions 1 and 5, making array [1, 5, 4, 2, 3], running the binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3

p_3 = 4 > 1, so r = 3

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

Second loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

Third loop:

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

This seems like it's stuck in an infinite loop, but according to the problem, it should terminate when r - l = 1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "If r - l = 1, end the loop"

So, in this case, when l = 1 and r = 3, r - l = 2 != 1, continue.

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

Now, r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

Again, m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1, l = 1, r = 3, and so on.

This seems like an infinite loop. There must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

Looking back:

"After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm, two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is executed:

While r - l != 1:

m = floor((r + l)/2)

If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m."

In this case, with l = 1, r = 6, m = 3

p_3 = 4 > 1, so r = m = 3

Now, l = 1, r = 3, r - l = 2 != 1, continue.

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

Now, r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

Again, m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 != 1, continue.

This seems like it will loop forever.

There must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be "if r - l <=1", or something else.

Looking back at the problem:

"After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm, two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is executed:

While r - l != 1:

m = floor((r + l)/2)

If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m."

So, it's indeed while r - l !=1.

In the above example, l =1, r=3, r - l =2 !=1, continue.

m=1, p_1=1 <=1, l=1

Now, r - l =3 -1=2 !=1, continue.

Again, m=1, p_1=1 <=1, l=1

This seems like an infinite loop.

Perhaps I need to consider that floor((1+3)/2) is 2, not 1.

Wait, (1 + 3)/2 = 2.0, floor(2.0) = 2.

Wait, in programming, floor((1 + 3)/2) in integer division is 1 in some languages, but in Python, floor would be applied after division.

Wait, in Python, floor((1 + 3)/2) is floor(2.0) = 2.

Wait, actually, in the code, it's floor((r + l)/2), which in Python would be (l + r) // 2.

So, in Python, (1 + 3) // 2 = 2

So, m =2

p_2 =5 >1, so r = m =2

Now, l=1, r=2, r - l =1, stop.

So, p_l = p_1 =1 == x=1

Perfect, so with one swap, positions 1 and 5 swapped, the binary search correctly finds x=1.

So, in this case, one swap was sufficient.

Another example: n=6, x=3, array=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=floor((1+7)/2)=4

p_4=5 >3, so r=4

Now, l=1, r=4, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=floor((1+4)/2)=2

p_2=3 <=3, so l=2

Now, l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=1 <=3, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=1 !=3

So, need to perform swaps.

Option 1: swap position 3 (where l points) with position of x=3, which is position 2.

Swap positions 2 and 3: array becomes [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Run binary search again:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 >3, r=4

l=1, r=4, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=1 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=3, p_3=3 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=3 == x=3

So, one swap suffices.

Another example: n=3, x=2, array=[3,2,1]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=floor((1+4)/2)=2

p_2=2 <=2, l=2

l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=1 <=2, l=3

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=1 !=2

Need to perform swaps.

Current array: [3,2,1]

Position of x=2 is 2.

After binary search, l=3.

Swap position 3 (1) with position 2 (2): array becomes [3,1,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=1 <=2, l=2

l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=3, p_3=2 <=2, l=3

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=2 == x=2

So, one swap suffices.

From these examples, it seems that swapping the position where l ends up with the position of x in the array is often sufficient.

But I need to generalize this approach.

Let me think about it more carefully.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to ensure that after the binary search, p_l == x.

I need to find a way to adjust the array such that after the binary search terminates, l points to x.

One way to think about it is to ensure that x is placed in a position where the binary search will end up with l pointing to it.

But since the binary search depends on the values in the array, this is tricky.

An alternative approach is to simulate the binary search to see where l ends up, and if p_l != x, perform swaps to make p_l == x.

But I need to do this in at most two swaps.

Wait, the problem mentions that two operations are always sufficient.

So, I need to find a general method that uses at most two swaps to achieve the goal.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Perform the binary search to find where l ends up.

2. If p_l == x, no swaps are needed.

3. If p_l != x, perform one swap to bring x to position l.

4. Perform the binary search again.

- If p_l == x, we're done with one swap.

- If not, perform a second swap to adjust.

But in the examples above, one swap was sufficient.

Is it always the case that one swap is enough?

Looking back at the problem, it says "it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient."

So, one or two swaps are enough.

I need to find a way to achieve the goal with at most two swaps.

Let me consider a more challenging example.

Suppose n=4, x=3, array=[2,4,1,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=floor((1+5)/2)=3

p_3=1 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=5, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=floor((3+5)/2)=4

p_4=3 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=5, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_4=3 == x=3

No swaps needed.

Another example: n=4, x=2, array=[3,1,4,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p_3=4 >2, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=1 <=2, l=2

l=2, r=3, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_2=1 !=2

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 2 (1) with position of x=2 (4): array becomes [3,2,4,1]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p_3=4 >2, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=2 <=2, l=2

l=2, r=3, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_2=2 == x=2

One swap suffices.

Another example: n=5, x=3, array=[5,1,2,4,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=2 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m= floor((3+6)/2)=4

p_4=4 >3, r=4

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=2 !=3

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 3 (2) with position of x=3 (5): array becomes [5,1,3,4,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=3 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=4 >3, r=4

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=3 == x=3

Again, one swap suffices.

From these examples, it seems that swapping the position where l ends up with the position of x is sufficient in one swap.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Let me consider a case where one swap isn't enough.

Suppose n=4, x=2, array=[4,3,1,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p_3=1 <=2, l=3

l=3, r=5, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=2 <=2, l=4

l=4, r=5, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_4=2 == x=2

No swap needed.

Another case: n=5, x=4, array=[2,5,1,3,4]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=1 <=4, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=3 <=4, l=4

l=4, r=6, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=5, p_5=4 <=4, l=5

l=5, r=6, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_5=4 == x=4

No swap needed.

Another case: n=5, x=4, array=[1,2,3,5,4]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=3 <=4, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=5 >4, r=4

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=3 !=4

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 3 (3) with position of x=4 (5): array becomes [1,2,4,5,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 <=4, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=5 >4, r=4

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=4 == x=4

One swap suffices.

Wait, but according to the problem, two operations are always sufficient, but in all these examples, one swap suffices.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try n=4, x=3, array=[4,1,2,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=5

m=3, p_3=2 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=5, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=3 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=5, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_4=3 == x=3

No swap needed.

Another case: n=5, x=3, array=[5,4,1,2,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=1 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=6, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=5, p_5=3 <=3, l=5

l=5, r=6, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_5=3 == x=3

No swap needed.

Hmm, maybe in all these cases, one swap suffices or no swaps are needed.

Is there a case where two swaps are needed?

Let's consider n=5, x=3, array=[2,5,4,1,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 >3, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=5 >3, r=2

l=1, r=2, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_1=2 !=3

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 1 (2) with position of x=3 (5): array becomes [3,5,4,1,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4 >3, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=5 >3, r=2

l=1, r=2, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_1=3 == x=3

One swap suffices.

Another case: n=6, x=3, array=[6,1,2,5,4,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 >3, r=4

l=1, r=4, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=1 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=3, p_3=2 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=2 !=3

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 3 (2) with position of x=3 (6): array becomes [6,1,3,5,4,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=5 >3, r=4

l=1, r=4, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=1 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=4, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=3, p_3=3 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=4, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_3=3 == x=3

Again, one swap suffices.

It seems that one swap is always sufficient to achieve the goal.

But the problem says "two operations are always sufficient", which includes one swap as a special case.

So, in implementation, I can aim to perform at most one swap to achieve the goal.

Now, to generalize the approach:

- Perform the binary search to find where l ends up.

- If p_l == x, no swaps are needed.

- If p_l != x, swap the element at position l with the element that is x.

- Perform the binary search again.

- If p_l == x, output one swap.

- If not, perform a second swap to adjust and ensure p_l == x.

But in all the examples I tried, one swap was sufficient.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider n=5, x=3, array=[4,1,5,2,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=5 >3, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=1 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=3, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_2=1 !=3

Need to perform swaps.

Swap position 2 (1) with position of x=3 (5): array becomes [4,3,5,2,1]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=5 >3, r=3

l=1, r=3, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=2, p_2=3 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=3, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_2=3 == x=3

One swap suffices.

Another case: n=5, x=4, array=[2,5,1,3,4]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=1 <=4, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=3 <=4, l=4

l=4, r=6, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=5, p_5=4 <=4, l=5

l=5, r=6, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_5=4 == x=4

No swaps needed.

Wait, perhaps there's a case where one swap isn't enough.

Let me try n=5, x=3, array=[5,4,1,2,3]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=1 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=6, r - l=3 !=1, continue.

m=4, p_4=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=6, r - l=2 !=1, continue.

m=5, p_5=3 <=3, l=5

l=5, r=6, r - l=1, stop.

p_l = p_5=3 == x=3

No swaps needed.

Another case: n=5, x=2, array=[4,3,5,1,2]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=5 >2, r=3

l=1
