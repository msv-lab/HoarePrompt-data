Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that is at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, maintaining their order. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I apply the operation to the third element (45), it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], and applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I choose an element that is at least 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the original element. So, for example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I then split 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is sorted. So, in this case, it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting some elements.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5], let's see what happens. If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Then, if I split 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted. If I split 12 and 28, and then consider splitting 5 (which is less than 10, so no split), I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. If I don't split 12 but split 28, it becomes [12, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. If I split 12 and don't split 28, it's [1, 2, 28, 5], which is not sorted. If I don't split anything, it remains [12, 28, 5], which is not sorted. So, in this case, it's impossible to make the array sorted.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no need to perform any operations.

From these examples, it seems that the key is to split numbers that are at least 10 in such a way that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, I need to think about how to approach this problem systematically. Given that n can be up to 50, and each a_i can be up to 99, the arrays aren't too large, but I need an efficient way to check if it's possible to sort the array by splitting numbers as needed.

One way to think about this is to consider all possible ways to split the numbers and check if any of those configurations result in a sorted array. However, since we can choose to split or not split each number independently, the number of possible configurations could be up to 2^n, which for n=50 would be too slow to compute directly. So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number always results in smaller numbers, since we're splitting it into its digits. For example, splitting 12 gives 1 and 2, both of which are less than 12. Similarly, splitting 45 gives 4 and 5, both less than 45. So, splitting a number can only decrease the value in that position, or split it into smaller parts.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting 12 gives 1 and 2, which are both less than 12, and splitting 45 gives 4 and 5, which are less than 45. So, in a way, splitting can only help in making the array sorted if the splits allow the array to be in non-decreasing order.

But in the second example, [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], which is not sorted. Splitting 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted. So, it seems like no matter what splits I make, I can't get a sorted array.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 and 45 gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

So, perhaps a strategy is to always split all numbers that are at least 10, and then check if the resulting array is sorted. If it is, then answer YES. If not, then it's impossible, so answer NO.

Wait, but in the second example, splitting all numbers that are at least 10 gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted. So, answer NO. In the first example, splitting all such numbers gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted, so answer YES. In the third example, no splitting is needed since the array is already sorted, so answer YES.

This seems to work for the given examples. But is this always correct?

Let me think of a case where splitting all numbers that are at least 10 doesn't result in a sorted array, but there exists a different combination of splits that does result in a sorted array.

For example, consider [13, 2, 34]. If I split both 13 and 34, I get [1,3,2,3,4]. This is not sorted. But if I only split 34, I get [13,2,3,4]. This is still not sorted. If I only split 13, I get [1,3,2,34]. This is not sorted. If I don't split any, it's [13,2,34], which is not sorted. So, in this case, it's impossible to make it sorted.

Another example: [15, 1, 25]. Splitting all numbers gives [1,5,1,2,5]. This is not sorted. Splitting only 15 gives [1,5,1,25], which is not sorted. Splitting only 25 gives [15,1,2,5], which is not sorted. Not splitting any gives [15,1,25], which is not sorted. So, again, impossible to sort.

Another example: [29, 30, 40]. Splitting all gives [2,9,3,0,4,0], which is not sorted. Splitting only 29 gives [2,9,30,40], which is not sorted. Splitting only 30 gives [29,3,0,40], which is not sorted. Splitting only 40 gives [29,30,4,0], which is not sorted. Splitting 29 and 30 gives [2,9,3,0,40], not sorted. Splitting 29 and 40 gives [2,9,30,4,0], not sorted. Splitting 30 and 40 gives [29,3,0,4,0], not sorted. Splitting all still not sorted. So, impossible to sort.

Now, consider [10, 11]. Splitting 10 gives [1,0,11]. This is not sorted. Splitting 11 gives [1,0,1,1]. This is sorted: 0,1,1,1. Wait, but 1,0,1,1 is not sorted because 0 comes after 1. Wait, no, splitting 10 gives [1,0,11], and then splitting 11 gives [1,0,1,1]. This is not sorted because 0 comes after 1.

Wait, but 1,0,1,1 is not sorted in non-decreasing order because 0 is less than 1. So, it's still not sorted. So, in this case, it's impossible to sort.

Another example: [21, 0]. Splitting 21 gives [2,1,0], which is not sorted. Not splitting 21 gives [21,0], which is not sorted. So, impossible to sort.

Wait, but in the third example, [0,0], it's already sorted. So, answer YES.

So, from these observations, it seems that splitting all numbers that are at least 10 and checking if the resulting array is sorted is sufficient. If it is sorted, then answer YES; otherwise, NO.

But wait, in the [13,2,34] example, splitting all gives [1,3,2,3,4], which is not sorted, and indeed, it's impossible to sort. In [15,1,25], splitting all gives [1,5,1,2,5], which is not sorted, and again, impossible to sort. In [29,30,40], splitting all gives [2,9,3,0,4,0], not sorted, and impossible to sort. In [10,11], splitting all gives [1,0,1,1], which is not sorted, and impossible to sort. In [21,0], splitting gives [2,1,0], not sorted, impossible to sort. In the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting all gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted, so YES. In the third example, [0,0], already sorted, so YES. In the second example, [12,28,5], splitting all gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted, so NO.

So, this seems to be a correct approach: split all numbers that are at least 10, and check if the resulting array is sorted.

But is there a case where splitting not all numbers that are at least 10 can result in a sorted array, even if splitting all doesn't?

Let me think about [10, 11]. Splitting both gives [1,0,1,1], which is not sorted. But what if I only split 10? Then it becomes [1,0,11]. Is this sorted? 0 is less than 11, but 1 comes before 0, which is not sorted. So, no. What if I only split 11? Then it's [10,1,1]. Is this sorted? 10 is greater than 1, so no. So, in this case, splitting all or some doesn't result in a sorted array, which matches the earlier approach.

Another example: [10, 1]. Splitting 10 gives [1,0,1], which is not sorted. Splitting 1 gives [10,1], which is not sorted. Splitting both gives [1,0,1], which is not sorted. So, impossible to sort.

Another example: [10, 10]. Splitting both gives [1,0,1,0], which is sorted in non-decreasing order: 0,0,1,1. Wait, is this sorted? 0 <= 0 <= 1 <= 1, so yes, it's sorted. So, in this case, splitting all numbers results in a sorted array, so answer YES.

Another example: [10, 10, 11]. Splitting all gives [1,0,1,0,1,1], which is sorted: 0,0,1,1,1,1. So, YES.

Another example: [10, 11, 12]. Splitting all gives [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted because 0 comes after 1. So, NO.

Wait, but in this case, is there a way to make it sorted by not splitting all numbers? Let's see:

- Don't split any: [10,11,12], which is sorted: 10 <= 11 <= 12, so YES.

Ah, so in this case, not splitting any numbers results in a sorted array, so answer YES. But according to the earlier approach of always splitting all numbers that are at least 10, we would get [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted, but in reality, not splitting any makes it sorted. So, in this case, the approach of always splitting all numbers would incorrectly answer NO, while the correct answer should be YES.

So, my earlier assumption is flawed. I can't just always split all numbers and check if the resulting array is sorted. There are cases where not splitting some numbers results in a sorted array, even if splitting all doesn't.

Therefore, I need a better way to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted by choosing which numbers to split.

Let's think differently. For each number in the array, if it's less than 10, I can't split it, so I have to keep it as is. If it's at least 10, I have two choices: split it into its digits or keep it as is.

My goal is to make the entire array sorted in non-decreasing order.

One way to approach this is to consider the array as a sequence of numbers, where for each number that is at least 10, I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into its digits. Then, I need to check if there exists a choice of splits that results in a sorted array.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Let me consider a greedy approach: iterate through the array, and for each number that is at least 10, decide whether to split it or not based on the current state of the array.

But I need to ensure that the entire array, after all splits, is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Another idea: since splitting a number into its digits always results in smaller or equal values, I can consider the maximum possible value that can be in each position after splits.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the smallest possible value that each position can take after any number of splits.

Wait, but splitting doesn't necessarily make the number smaller; it just breaks it into its digits.

Wait, no, actually, digits are always less than or equal to the original number if it's less than 10, but for numbers greater than 10, splitting them into digits will result in digits that are less than 10.

For example, 12 splits into 1 and 2, both less than 12. 45 splits into 4 and 5, both less than 45.

So, splitting can only make the values in the array smaller or the same.

Therefore, splitting more can only help in making the array sorted if splitting less doesn't sort it.

Wait, but in the [10,11,12] example, not splitting any makes it sorted, but splitting all doesn't. So, in this case, splitting less (i.e., not splitting) makes it sorted.

Wait, this contradicts the earlier idea that splitting more can only help.

So, perhaps the earlier idea is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the array, and I want to make it sorted by possibly splitting some numbers.

I need to ensure that after all splits, the array is in non-decreasing order.

One way to think about this is to consider all possible splits and see if any of them lead to a sorted array.

But as mentioned earlier, this could be exponential in time complexity, which is not feasible for n=50.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits inserts those digits in place of the number, so the array's length increases.

Therefore, after splitting some numbers, the array's length can be up to the sum of the number of digits in each number that is split, plus the numbers that are not split.

But since all numbers are at most 99, which has two digits, the maximum length after splitting all numbers is 2*n.

Given that n<=50, the maximum array length after splitting all numbers is 100, which is manageable.

So, perhaps I can simulate the splitting process.

But how?

Wait, maybe I can think of it as building a new array by choosing, for each number, whether to include it as is or to include its digits.

Then, I need to check if there's a way to choose for each number that results in a sorted array.

This sounds like a graph where each number is a node, and edges represent possible choices.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have the array, and I iterate through it, keeping track of the minimum possible value that can be in each position after splits.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and maintain a "current minimum" that the next element must be greater than or equal to.

For each number, if it's less than 10, I have no choice but to keep it as is, so it must be >= the current minimum.

If it's >= current minimum, I can keep it, and set the next current minimum to be >= this number.

If it's < current minimum, then I can't keep it as is, so I must split it, if possible.

But splitting it into digits, each digit must be >= the current minimum.

Wait, but in the [10,11,12] example, if I don't split any, it's already sorted.

If I choose to split 10 into 1 and 0, then I have [1,0,11,12], which is not sorted.

If I split 11 into 1 and 1, I get [10,1,1,12], which is not sorted.

If I split 12 into 1 and 2, I get [10,11,1,2], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, not splitting any numbers is the way to go.

But in the [12,3,45,67] example, splitting all gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

So, I need a way to decide for each number whether to split it or not, such that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the current position and the previous element's value.

But given time constraints, I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as inserting the digits in place of the number, maintaining their order.

So, for example, [12,3,45,67] becomes [1,2,3,4,5,67] after splitting 12 and 45.

Now, if I consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than the number itself, which they are for numbers >=10.

But as seen in the [10,11,12] example, not splitting any numbers can already make the array sorted.

So, perhaps the way to go is to iterate through the array and, for each number that is >=10, check if splitting it would help in making the array sorted.

But I need a way to do this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with a sequence of digits that are in non-decreasing order (since digits are split and can be reordered, but in this problem, we need to maintain the order).

Wait, no, the digits must be inserted in the same order they appear in the number.

So, for 12, it's 1 and then 2; for 45, it's 4 and then 5.

So, the order is preserved.

Given that, perhaps I can think of the array as a sequence of digits, where some digits are "packed" into numbers >=10.

My task is to "unpack" some of these packed digits to make the entire sequence sorted.

This seems a bit abstract.

Let me think recursively.

Define a function that, given the current position in the array and the previous element's value, decides whether it's possible to make the remaining array sorted by choosing to split or not split the current number.

This sounds like a recursive approach with memoization.

But with n up to 50, and each number having two choices (split or not), the state space could be too large.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as inserting the digits in place of the number, and these digits must fit into the sorted sequence.

So, for a number >=10, I have two options:

1. Keep the number as is.

2. Split the number into its digits and insert them in order.

In both cases, the resulting sequence must be sorted.

So, for each number, I need to check both possibilities and see if any of them leads to a sorted sequence.

This sounds similar to the earlier recursive approach, which may be too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the final sequence and ensure that it's sorted.

Given that, I can iterate through the array and build the sequence by choosing to split or not split each number, ensuring that at each step, the sequence remains sorted.

This sounds promising.

Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty list for the final sequence.

Initialize a pointer to track the current position in the sequence.

Iterate through each number in the original array:

- If the number is less than 10, I have no choice but to add it to the sequence.

- If the number is >=10, I can choose to either add it as is or split it into its digits and add them in order.

At each addition, ensure that the new element(s) are >= the previous element in the sequence.

But this is still a bit vague.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Start with an empty sequence.

Set the previous value to -1 (since all a_i >=0).

For each number in the array:

- If the number is <10:

- If the number >= previous, add it to the sequence and set previous to this number.

- Else, it's impossible to sort, so answer NO.

- If the number is >=10:

- Option 1: Keep the number as is.

- If number >= previous, add it to the sequence and set previous to this number.

- Option 2: Split the number into its digits.

- For each digit, if digit >= previous, add it to the sequence and update previous to this digit.

- Else, it's impossible to sort, so answer NO.

But this seems too simplistic and might not cover all cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both options for each number and see if any of them leads to a sorted sequence.

This sounds like a recursive decision tree, where at each number, I choose to split or not, and check if the sequence remains sorted.

But again, this could be too slow for n=50.

Is there a way to optimize this decision process?

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the number itself, which they are.

But in some cases, splitting can make the sequence harder to sort, as seen in [10,11,12], where splitting 10 into 1 and 0 disrupts the sorting.

So, perhaps the best approach is to split all numbers that are >=10 and check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

If it is, then answer YES.

If not, then check if there's a way to not split some numbers to make the sequence sorted.

But checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to determine which numbers need to be split and which shouldn't, to make the sequence sorted.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that for numbers >=10, their digits are always less than 10, and splitting them increases the length of the array.

So, the final sequence can have a mix of single-digit numbers and numbers >=10.

I need to ensure that in the final sequence, each element is >= the previous one.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the array and, for each number:

- If it's <10, add it to the sequence as is.

- If it's >=10, consider splitting it into digits and adding them one by one, ensuring each digit >= the previous element in the sequence.

- If not splitting, ensure that the number >= the previous element in the sequence.

Wait, but in the [10,11,12] example, if I don't split any numbers, it's already sorted.

If I choose to split 10 into 1 and 0, it becomes [1,0,11,12], which is not sorted.

If I split 11 into 1 and 1, it becomes [10,1,1,12], which is not sorted.

If I split 12 into 1 and 2, it becomes [10,11,1,2], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, not splitting any numbers is the way to go.

But in the [12,3,45,67] example, splitting all numbers gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

So, I need a way to decide for each number whether to split it or not, such that the entire sequence is sorted.

This seems too time-consuming to implement in an efficient manner.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the previous element in the sequence.

Wait, no, in the [12,3,45,67] example, splitting 12 gives [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted except for 2 and 3, but in this case, 2 <=3, so it's sorted.

Wait, 1 <=2 <=3 <=45 <=67, so it's sorted.

But in [12,28,5], splitting all gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted because 2 <=2 <=8, but 8 >5 is a problem.

So, perhaps I can check if splitting all numbers results in a sorted sequence.

If it does, then answer YES.

If not, then check if there's a way to not split some numbers to make it sorted.

But checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

Is there a way to determine which numbers need to be split to make the sequence sorted?

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the sequence is non-decreasing.

So, maybe I can iterate through the array and, for each position, determine the smallest possible value that can be placed there after considering splits.

Then, check if this sequence is sorted.

But I'm not sure how to implement this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each number that is >=10, its digits are smaller than itself, and splitting it can only help in making the sequence sorted if the digits are in non-decreasing order relative to the previous elements.

So, perhaps I can precompute the split versions of each number and try to interleave them in a way that maintains the sorted order.

But this seems too vague and not practical.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach of splitting all numbers that are >=10 and checking if the resulting sequence is sorted.

If it is, answer YES; otherwise, NO.

But as seen in the [10,11,12] example, splitting all numbers may not be necessary, and in fact, not splitting any numbers already gives a sorted sequence.

So, to make the approach correct, I should first check if the original array is sorted.

If it is, answer YES.

If not, then split all numbers that are >=10 and check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

If it is, answer YES; otherwise, NO.

This way, I cover the case where not splitting any numbers already makes the array sorted.

Let me test this approach with the [10,11,12] example.

- Original array: [10,11,12], which is sorted, so answer YES.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted, but since the original array is sorted, we already answered YES.

Good.

Another example: [12,3,45,67].

- Original array: [12,3,45,67], which is not sorted because 12 >3.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted, so answer YES.

Good.

Second example: [12,28,5].

- Original array: [12,28,5], which is not sorted because 28 >5.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted because 8 >5.

- So, answer NO.

Good.

Third example: [0,0].

- Original array is sorted, so answer YES.

Good.

Another example: [10,10].

- Original array is sorted, so answer YES.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,0,1,0], which is sorted, but since the original array is already sorted, we don't need to split.

Good.

Another example: [10,11].

- Original array: [10,11], which is sorted, so answer YES.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,0,1,1], which is not sorted, but since the original array is sorted, we already answered YES.

Good.

Another example: [13,2,34].

- Original array: [13,2,34], which is not sorted because 13 >2.

- Splitting all numbers: [1,3,2,3,4], which is not sorted because 1 <=3 <=2 is not true.

- So, answer NO.

Good.

So, this approach seems to work for these cases.

Therefore, the plan is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Check if a is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If yes, answer YES.

- If not, split all numbers that are >=10 into their digits and form a new array.

- Check if this new array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If yes, answer YES; else, answer NO.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Looking back at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

First, it reads m, the number of test cases.

Then, it initializes an empty list b to store the results.

Then, it loops m times and calls func_1() each time.

After that, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in list b.

Now, looking at func_1():

- It reads k (which should be n, the length of the array).

- Then reads a string of numbers, splits them into a list of integers a.

- Initializes x, y, n, and c.

- Then, loops through the array:

- If a[i] >=10 and i >0:

- Splits a[i] into digits x (a[i] %10) and y (a[i] //10).

- Checks if y >= c[n-1], the last element in c.

- If y <=x, appends y and x to c, increment n by 2.

- Else, appends a[i] to c, increment n by 1.

- If i==0 and a[i]>=10:

- Splits a[i] into digits x and y.

- If y <=x, appends y and x to c, increment n by 2.

- Else, appends a[i] to c, increment n by 1.

- Else, appends a[i] to c, increment n by 1.

- Then, sorts c and checks if c is equal to the sorted c.

- If yes, appends 1 to b; else, appends 0.

Wait, but sorted(c) is always equal to c if c is sorted.

Wait, no, sorted(c) sorts c in ascending order, and if c is already sorted, then sorted(c) == c.

So, it's checking if c is sorted in non-decreasing order.

But the logic inside the loop seems confusing.

First, it only splits numbers >=10 if i>0, which is strange.

Why is there a condition on i>0 for splitting numbers >=10?

In the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 (i=0) would be allowed, but according to this code, it only splits if i>0.

Wait, no, the code says if i>0 and a[i]>=10, then split.

But in the case where i==0 and a[i]>=10, it also splits, but with a different condition.

Wait, in the code, for i==0 and a[i]>=10, it splits a[i] into digits x and y.

If y <=x, it appends y and x to c, else appends a[i] to c.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67], for i=0, a[0]=12 >=10, so it splits into x=2, y=1.

Then, y=1 <=x=2, so it appends 1 and 2 to c.

Then, for i=1, a[1]=3 <10, so
