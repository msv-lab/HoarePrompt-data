Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that is at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if, after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero), the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order. So, I need to check if there's a sequence of operations that leads to a sorted array.

First, I need to understand the operation thoroughly. When I apply the operation to an element that is at least 10, I replace it with its digits in the same order. So, for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and so on. If the number is less than 10, it remains as is.

Now, I need to think about how this operation can help me sort the array. Since I can apply this operation any number of times, I need to consider all possible sequences of operations that could lead to a sorted array.

One important observation is that once I split a number into its digits, those digits can't be further split because they are less than 10. So, the operation is only applicable to numbers greater than or equal to 10, and it's a one-time split per number.

Another thing to consider is that splitting a number can increase the length of the array, as a single number is replaced by multiple digits.

My goal is to check if, after possibly splitting some numbers, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - Finally, check if the array is sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67] is sorted.

   - So, the answer is YES.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

   - If I split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

   - Now, the array is [1, 2, 2, 5, 8], which is sorted.

   - So, the answer is YES.

Wait, but according to the problem's sample output, it's NO. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's check the second example again.

Second example:

3

12 28 5

According to the sample output, it's NO.

But according to my previous step, it seems I can get a sorted array by splitting 12 and 28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the splitting process.

Let me try again.

Original array: [12, 28, 5]

Option 1: Split 12 -> [1, 2, 28, 5]

Is [1, 2, 28, 5] sorted? No, because 2 < 28, but 28 > 5.

Option 2: Split 28 -> [12, 2, 8, 5]

Is [12, 2, 8, 5] sorted? No, because 12 > 2.

Option 3: Split both 12 and 28 -> [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

Is [1, 2, 2, 5, 8] sorted? Yes.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's NO.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can't perform operations in sequence; maybe I have to choose which elements to split and see if the resulting array is sorted.

Wait, no, the problem says I can perform the operation any number of times, so I can choose to split both 12 and 28, resulting in [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is sorted.

But according to the sample output, it's NO.

Wait, maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero)."

So, it's about whether there exists a sequence of operations that leads to a sorted array.

In the second example, it seems possible, but the sample output is NO.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input and output.

Looking back:

Sample Input:

3

4

12 3 45 67

3

12 28 5

2

0 0

Sample Output:

YES

NO

YES

Wait, in the second test case, n=3, array=[12,28,5]

According to the sample output, it's NO.

But according to my earlier reasoning, I can split both 12 and 28 to get [1,2,2,8,5], which is sorted.

So, why is the answer NO?

Wait, maybe I need to preserve the relative order of the elements that are not split.

Wait, no, the problem allows me to split any elements that are >=10, and when I split them, their digits are inserted in their place, maintaining the order.

So, in the first example, splitting 12 and 45 maintains their positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that splitting a number can only be done in a way that the digits replace the number, but I can't rearrange the other elements.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting 12 and 45 leads to a sorted array.

In the second example, splitting both 12 and 28 leads to [1,2,2,8,5], which is sorted.

But the sample output is NO, which contradicts my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the operation is applied.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"take any element of the array a, which is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element."

So, for 12, it's 1 and 2.

For 28, it's 2 and 8.

So, in the second example, starting with [12,28,5], if I split 12 first, it becomes [1,2,28,5].

Then, if I split 28, it becomes [1,2,2,8,5].

This is sorted.

So, why is the answer NO?

Wait, maybe I can only perform the operation once per element, or perhaps there's a restriction on the positions.

Wait, no, the problem says "any number of times", so I should be able to perform it multiple times.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the operation's definition.

Wait, maybe the operation can only be performed once per element, meaning I can't split the same element multiple times.

But in this case, since 12 and 28 are only split once, it should be allowed.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting 12 and 45 leads to a sorted array, and the answer is YES.

In the second example, splitting 12 and 28 leads to a sorted array, but the answer is NO.

This inconsistency suggests that I might be misinterpreting the operation.

Wait, perhaps the operation is to split all occurrences of numbers >=10 in a single operation, not sequentially.

Wait, no, the problem says "any number of times", so I should be able to perform the operation multiple times.

Alternatively, perhaps the operation can only be performed once, affecting the entire array at once.

But that doesn't make sense, because it says "take any element of the array a, which is at least 10".

So, I can choose one element at a time to split, and I can do this multiple times.

Given that, in the second example, splitting both 12 and 28 should lead to a sorted array.

But according to the sample output, it's NO.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the operation is to split all elements >=10 in one go, not individually.

But that doesn't align with the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the operation can only be performed once, affecting one element each time, but with some restriction.

Wait, no, the problem says "any number of times", so multiple operations are allowed.

Given that, I'm confused why the answer is NO for the second example.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that I can't split elements in a way that interleaves their digits in a way that affects the sorting.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the operation is to split all elements >=10 simultaneously, not sequentially.

But again, that doesn't align with the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that splitting an element affects the positions of the subsequent elements.

Wait, no, when I split an element, I replace it with its digits in the same position.

So, in [12,28,5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], and then splitting 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5].

This is sorted.

So, I'm still confused why the answer is NO.

Wait, maybe the problem is to determine if there exists a sequence of operations where, after all operations are performed, the array is sorted.

But in this case, it's possible.

Unless there's a misunderstanding in how the digits are inserted.

Wait, perhaps when splitting, the digits are inserted in reverse order.

For example, splitting 12 would give [2,1], not [1,2].

Wait, no, the problem says "in the same position, in order they appear in that element."

So, for 12, it's 1 and 2, in that order.

Similarly, for 28, it's 2 and 8.

So, my earlier approach seems correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that I can't split elements in a way that changes the relative order of the other elements.

But in the first example, splitting 12 and 45 leads to a sorted array, so why is the second example NO?

Wait, perhaps the problem is to check if the array can be sorted by only splitting elements, without changing the relative order of the unsplit elements.

In other words, the positions of the unsplit elements should remain relative to each other.

So, in the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 and 45 gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which maintains the relative order of 3 and 67.

In the second example, [12,28,5], splitting 12 and 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5], where 5 comes after the split digits of 28.

But in this case, 5 was originally after 28, and after splitting, the digits of 28 are inserted in place of 28, so the 5 remains after them.

So, [1,2,2,8,5] has 5 after 8, which breaks the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps that's the issue.

If I split 12 and 28 in [12,28,5], I get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted because 8 > 5.

So, in this case, it's impossible to get a sorted array by splitting elements.

Hence, the answer is NO.

Wait, but earlier I thought [1,2,2,5,8] is sorted, but that would require moving the 5 before the 8, which isn't allowed because the operation only allows splitting elements, not reordering the unsplit elements.

So, in other words, the relative order of the unsplit elements must be preserved, even when splitting other elements.

Therefore, in the second example, after splitting 12 and 28, I get [1,2,2,8,5], where 8 > 5, and I can't rearrange the 5 and 8 because the operation doesn't allow reordering of unsplit elements.

Hence, it's impossible to get a sorted array, so the answer is NO.

Similarly, in the first example, splitting 12 and 45 gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted.

In the third example, [0,0] is already sorted.

So, the answers are YES, NO, YES, which matches the sample output.

Therefore, the key is that splitting elements can insert digits into the array, but the relative order of the unsplit elements must be preserved.

Given that, I need to find a way to determine if there's a sequence of splits that leads to a sorted array.

Now, to implement this, I need to think about an efficient way to model this.

One approach could be to iterate through the array and simulate the splits, checking if the resulting array can be sorted.

However, since the array length can be up to 50, and splitting elements can increase the array length, I need an efficient way to handle this.

An important observation is that splitting a number into its digits can only happen once, and the digits are fixed.

So, for each element, if it's >=10, I have the option to split it into its digits or keep it as is.

I need to consider all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting each element >=10 and check if any of these combinations result in a sorted array.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each element can be either split or not split, the number of possible combinations could be up to 2^50, which is too large to handle directly.

Therefore, I need a smarter approach.

Another observation is that splitting a number into digits can only help in sorting if the digits are smaller than the original number.

For example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 can help because 1 and 2 are smaller than 12.

Similarly, splitting 28 into 2 and 8 can help if 2 and 8 are in the right positions.

But, as seen in the second example, splitting can sometimes make it impossible to sort the array if the digits are not in the correct order relative to the surrounding elements.

So, perhaps I can model the array as a list of possible values for each position: either the original number if it's less than 10, or the list of digits if it's >=10.

Then, I need to select one of these options for each position and check if there's a combination where the selected values are non-decreasing.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, and for each position, choose whether to split the number or keep it as is, ensuring that the chosen value is greater than or equal to the previous maximum.

If I can reach the end of the array without violating the non-decreasing order, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function dp(pos, prev), where pos is the current position in the array, and prev is the value of the previous element in the desired sorted array.

dp(pos, prev) returns true if there exists a way to make the subarray starting from pos sorted, given that the previous value is prev.

For each position pos, if a[pos] < 10, then I must keep it as is, and ensure that a[pos] >= prev.

If a[pos] >= 10, I have two choices:

1. Keep a[pos] as is, and ensure that a[pos] >= prev.

2. Split a[pos] into its digits, and ensure that each digit is >= prev.

Wait, no, when splitting a[pos], I insert all its digits in order, so I need to treat the digits as a sequence and ensure that each digit is >= prev.

But this complicates things because splitting a[pos] can insert multiple digits, each of which needs to be >= prev.

Moreover, after inserting the digits, the next position will be after these digits.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider the array as a sequence of elements that can be either kept as is or split into digits, and I need to find a way to arrange them in a non-decreasing order.

Another idea is to consider the array as a stream of digits, where each element can be either a single digit or a number consisting of multiple digits.

Wait, but numbers can be up to 99, which is two digits.

So, perhaps I can think of each element as contributing either itself (if <10) or its digits (if >=10), and I need to arrange these contributions in a non-decreasing sequence.

Given that, I can model the array as a list of possible contributions for each position, and try to select one contribution per position such that the entire sequence is sorted.

For example, for [12,3,45,67]:

- 12 can be either 12 or [1,2]

- 3 is only 3

- 45 can be either 45 or [4,5]

- 67 can be either 67 or [6,7]

So, possible sequences:

- [12,3,45,67]: 12 >= 3? No, so not sorted.

- [1,2,3,45,67]: 1 <=2 <=3 <=45 <=67, which is sorted.

Hence, YES.

In the second example, [12,28,5]:

- 12 can be [12] or [1,2]

- 28 can be [28] or [2,8]

- 5 is [5]

So, possible sequences:

- [12,28,5]: 12 <=28 <=5? No.

- [12,28,5]: same as above.

- [12,2,8,5]: 12 >=2? No.

- [1,2,28,5]: 1<=2<=28<=5? No.

- [1,2,2,8,5]: 1<=2<=2<=5<=8, which is sorted.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's NO.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operation.

Looking back, the operation is to "delete it and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element."

So, when I split 12, I replace 12 with 1 and 2.

Similarly, splitting 28 replaces 28 with 2 and 8.

So, starting with [12,28,5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], and splitting 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5].

Now, is [1,2,2,8,5] sorted?

Well, 1<=2<=2<=5<=8 is true, so it should be YES.

But according to the sample output, it's NO.

This discrepancy suggests that I might be misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that I can't split both elements; maybe I can only split one element.

But the problem says "any number of times", including zero.

So, I should be able to split both 12 and 28.

Alternatively, perhaps the operation can only be performed once, affecting one element at a time, and the final array is after all operations are done.

But I think I've misinterpreted something.

Wait, perhaps the operation is to split all elements >=10 at once, not sequentially.

But that doesn't make sense, because the problem allows performing the operation any number of times.

Alternatively, maybe the operation can only be performed on one element per step, but the final array is the result of all operations combined.

Wait, maybe the issue is that when I split an element, the digits are inserted in place, but the remaining elements keep their relative order.

So, in [12,28,5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], and then splitting 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5].

Now, [1,2,2,8,5] is not sorted because 8 >5.

But if I could split 28 before splitting 12, but since operations are performed sequentially, and I choose which element to split each time, perhaps the order of operations matters.

Wait, but in this case, I first split 12, then split 28.

Alternatively, if I first split 28, then split 12.

Starting with [12,28,5], split 28: [12,2,8,5], then split 12: [1,2,2,8,5], which is [1,2,2,5,8], which is sorted.

Wait, but 8 is after 5, so [1,2,2,8,5] is not sorted because 8 >5.

Wait, but in this sequence, 8 >5, so it's not sorted.

Hence, it's impossible to get a sorted array, hence NO.

So, the key is that after splitting, the relative order of the unsplit elements must be preserved, and the digits inserted must not disrupt this order.

In this case, splitting 12 and 28 leads to [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted because 8 >5.

There is no way to split the elements to get a sorted array.

Hence, the answer is NO.

Therefore, to solve this problem, I need to check if there exists a way to split some elements such that the resulting array is sorted.

Given that n can be up to 50, and each element can be either split or not split, leading to potentially exponential time complexity, I need an efficient way to handle this.

An efficient approach is to model the array as a sequence of possible contributions (either the number itself if <10, or its digits if >=10), and check if there's a way to interleave these contributions to form a sorted array.

This can be done using dynamic programming, where I keep track of the maximum value so far and choose which contribution to take at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a DP state dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the array, and j is the last value inserted into the new array.

But since j can be up to 99, and i up to 50, this might not be efficient enough.

An optimization is to use DP with the current position and the previous value, and use memoization to avoid recomputing states.

But given the constraints, it's better to find a greedy approach or some property that allows us to determine if the array can be sorted without exhaustive search.

Let's consider that for each element in the array, if it's >=10, its digits can be inserted in place, and I need to ensure that the sequence of these digits and the remaining elements is sorted.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far.

For each element:

- If it's <10, it must be >= the previous maximum.

- If it's >=10, I have two choices:

  a. Keep it as is, and ensure that it's >= the previous maximum.

  b. Split it into its digits, and ensure that each digit is >= the previous maximum.

However, splitting an element into digits adds multiple elements to the array, which complicates the DP approach.

An alternative approach is to consider the array as a stream of digits, where each element contributes either itself (if <10) or its digits (if >=10).

Then, I can check if this stream of digits is sorted.

But this doesn't account for the fact that splitting is optional.

So, I need to find a way to interleave the possible contributions (split or not split) to achieve a sorted sequence.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can iterate through the array and at each step, consider the possible contributions from the current element and ensure that they don't break the sorted order.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize a variable max_so_far to -1.

Iterate through each element in the array:

- If the element is <10:

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element.

- Else, return NO.

- Else (element >=10):

- Consider splitting it into digits.

- For each digit:

- If digit >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = digit.

- Else, return NO.

- Or, keep the element as is:

- If element >= max_so_far, set max_so_far = element.

- Else, return NO.

- Choose the option that allows the sequence to remain sorted.

Wait, but this approach doesn't account for the fact that splitting adds multiple digits, which may require the subsequent elements to be adjusted accordingly.

So, perhaps I need to track the possible max_so_far states for both splitting and not splitting.

This sounds like a DP where for each position, I consider both options: split or not split, and maintain the possible max_so_far for each choice.

Given that n is up to 50, and each element can be split or not, this could be time-consuming.

An optimization is to realize that for each element >=10, splitting it will always lead to smaller or equal values compared to keeping it as is.

Therefore, splitting an element can only help in maintaining the sorted order, as its digits are smaller than or equal to the original number.

Wait, but in the second example, splitting leads to a situation where the digits are not in order relative to the subsequent elements.

Hence, splitting might sometimes make it harder to sort the array.

Wait, no, in the first example, splitting helps in sorting, but in the second example, splitting causes issues because the digits may not align properly with the subsequent elements.

So, perhaps I need to check if, for each element, splitting it or keeping it as is doesn't violate the sorted order given the previous maximum.

This seems tricky.

Another approach is to consider that splitting an element is equivalent to replacing it with its digits, and then checking if the resulting sequence is sorted.

Given that, I can model the array as a sequence of possible contributions and see if there's a way to choose these contributions to form a sorted sequence.

But this still seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array and maintain a stack of the current sequence.

For each element:

- If it's <10, it must be >= the top of the stack.

- If it's >=10, I can choose to either:

  a. Push it onto the stack, ensuring it's >= the top.

  b. Split it into digits and push each digit onto the stack, ensuring each digit is >= the top.

This resembles a stack-based approach to check for sorted sequences with the option to split elements.

However, implementing this correctly might be error-prone.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach.

An alternative idea is to preprocess the array by considering the minimum possible value at each position if we choose to split the element, and the maximum possible value if we keep it as is.

Then, I can check if there's a way to choose between splitting or not splitting such that the sequence is sorted.

But this still seems too vague.

Given the complexity of the problem, perhaps the intended solution is to use a backtracking approach, where I recursively try splitting or not splitting each element and check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

However, with n=50, this would be too slow.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting an element into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the original number, but it can also cause issues if the digits are not in the correct order relative to the subsequent elements.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that for each element that is split, its digits are in non-decreasing order up to the next element.

This is getting too convoluted.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that this problem requires a careful implementation of a DP approach, where I track the possible max_so_far for each position, considering both options: splitting or not splitting.

I'll proceed to implement this approach.

In summary, the problem requires determining if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by optionally splitting elements that are >=10 into their digits.

The challenge is to find a sequence of splits that leads to a sorted array, considering the constraints on the relative ordering of the elements and their digits.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make the given array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows us to delete any element that is at least 10 and insert its digits in the same position.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We can perform the operation on any element >= 10, replacing it with its digits.
   - Our goal is to check if, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Insight**:
   - For elements less than 10, they remain as is.
   - For elements >= 10, we have the option to either keep them as is or split them into their constituent digits.
   - We need to check all possible combinations of keeping or splitting these elements to see if any combination results in a sorted array.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a DP table where each entry represents the possibility of having a certain sequence up to that point.
   - Track the maximum value encountered so far in the potential sorted sequence.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use a recursive helper function with memoization to explore all possibilities efficiently.
   - At each step, decide whether to keep the element as is or split it into digits, ensuring the sequence remains sorted.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(position, prev, n, a, dp):
    if position == n:
        return True
    if dp[position][prev] != -1:
        return dp[position][prev] == 1
    result = False
    num = a[position]
    if num < 10:
        if num >= prev:
            result = can_be_sorted(position + 1, num, n, a, dp)
    else:
        # Option 1: Keep the number as is
        if num >= prev:
            result = can_be_sorted(position + 1, num, n, a, dp)
        # Option 2: Split the number into digits
        if not result:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            current_prev = prev
            temp_result = True
            for digit in digits:
                if digit < current_prev:
                    temp_result = False
                    break
                current_prev = digit
            if temp_result:
                result = can_be_sorted(position + 1, digits[-1], n, a, dp)
    dp[position][prev] = 1 if result else 0

  - `dp[position][prev]` stores whether it is possible to reach a sorted sequence up to `position` with the previous value being `prev`.

- **Helper Function (`can_be_sorted`)**:
  - Recursively checks for each position if keeping the number as is or splitting it into digits leads to a sorted sequence.
  - For numbers < 10, they must be greater than or equal to the previous value.
  - For numbers >= 10, we check both options: keeping the number or splitting it, and ensure the sequence remains sorted.

- **Main Function**:
  - Reads input, parses test cases, and for each test case, initializes the DP table and calls the helper function to check if a sorted sequence can be achieved.

This approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible sequences of operations to determine if a sorted array can be obtained.
