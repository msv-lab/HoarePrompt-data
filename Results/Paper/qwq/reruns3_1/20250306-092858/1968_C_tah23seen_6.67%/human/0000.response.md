Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to find any such array a that meets these criteria.

First, I need to understand what x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, x_i is the remainder of a_i divided by a_{i-1}.

I need to find values for a_1 to a_n such that this condition holds for each pair (a_{i-1}, a_i).

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by choosing a value for a_1 and then determine the rest based on that.

But how do I choose a_1? Well, a_1 can be any value between 1 and 10^9, but it will affect the values of a_2 to a_n because of the modulo operations.

Wait, actually, a_1 doesn't directly depend on any other a_i since there's no a_0. So maybe I can choose a_1 freely, and then determine the rest based on it.

But no, because x_2 = a_2 mod a_1. So, a_2 mod a_1 = x_2. That means a_2 should be equal to x_2 plus some multiple of a_1.

In general, a_i should be equal to x_i plus some multiple of a_{i-1}.

Wait, but a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i implies that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i.

My goal is to choose k such that a_i stays within 1 to 10^9.

But also, a_i should be greater than x_i because if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} = a_i, assuming a_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, more precisely:

- If a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} = a_i.

- If a_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.

Given that, I need to ensure that for each i, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

One way to ensure this is to set a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 1.

But I need to choose k such that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

Also, a_i should be at least x_i, since if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} = a_i, which should equal x_i.

So, if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i = x_i.

But a_i cannot be less than x_i because x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, and remainders are always non-negative and less than the divisor.

Wait, no. The remainder is less than the divisor only if the divisor is positive, which it is since a_{i-1} >=1.

So, x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the input, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says 1 <= x_i <= 500, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

So, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

But, in the modulo operation, x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, which means x_i < a_{i-1}, unless a_i < a_{i-1}, in which case x_i = a_i.

Wait, more precisely:

- If a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} = a_i.

- If a_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} is the remainder of a_i divided by a_{i-1}.

Given that, for x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, there are two cases:

1. If a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i = x_i.

2. If a_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >=1.

So, for each i, to satisfy x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, a_i can be:

- x_i, if x_i < a_{i-1}.

- Or, k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >=1.

But, I need to choose a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

Also, I need to make sure that a_i is consistent across all these equations.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can start building the array a from the beginning.

Let's start with a_1. a_1 can be any value between 1 and 10^9, but it will affect a_2 through the modulo operation.

Wait, a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

So, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k >=0.

I need to choose a_1 and k such that a_2 is between 1 and 10^9.

One way is to choose a_1 > x_2, and then choose k such that a_2 is within the limit.

Wait, but x_2 can be up to 500, and a_1 can be from 1 to 10^9.

If a_1 > x_2, then a_2 can be a_1 + x_2, or 2*a_1 + x_2, etc.

But I need to make sure that a_2 <= 10^9.

Similarly, for a_3, a_3 mod a_2 = x_3, and so on.

This seems like a chain of dependencies.

Maybe I can choose a_1 to be x_2 + 1, to make sure a_1 > x_2.

Then, a_2 can be a_1 + x_2, which is (x_2 + 1) + x_2 = 2*x_2 + 1.

Then, a_3 can be a_2 + x_3, and so on.

Wait, but is this always valid?

Let me try with the first example.

In the first example:

n=4

x = [2,4,1]

So, x_2=2, x_3=4, x_4=1

According to the sample output, a = [3,5,4,9]

Let's verify:

a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which matches x_2=2.

a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 =4, which matches x_3=4.

a_4 mod a_3 =9 mod 4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, this seems correct.

Now, according to my earlier idea, if I set a_1 = x_2 +1 =3, then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 =5, a_3 =a_2 +x_3=9, a_4=a_3 +x_4=10.

But in the sample, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5.

Wait, but in my approach, a_3 would be a_2 + x_3=5+4=9.

But in the sample, a_3=4.

So, my approach doesn't match the sample.

But the sample is also correct.

So, maybe my approach is too restrictive.

Perhaps there's a better way to choose a_i.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose a_1 to be greater than x_2.

Then, a_2 can be a_1 + x_2.

Similarly, a_3 can be a_2 + x_3.

And so on.

This seems similar to what I did earlier.

But in the sample, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5.

How is that possible?

Well, according to the modulo operation, if a_3 < a_2, then a_3 mod a_2 =a_3, which should equal x_3=4.

So, a_3=4 is acceptable.

But in my earlier approach, I was adding x_i to a_{i-1}, which ensures a_i > a_{i-1}, but it's not necessary.

In fact, it's better to allow a_i to be less than a_{i-1}, as long as a_i =x_i in that case.

Wait, but in general, a_i can be either greater than or equal to a_{i-1}, or less than a_{i-1}.

If a_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some k>=1.

If a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i =x_i.

So, in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and a_3=x_3=4, which is correct.

Then, a_4=9 > a_3=4, and 9 mod 4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, in this case, a_3 was less than a_2, and a_4 was greater than a_3.

In my earlier approach, I was always setting a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i, which may not be necessary.

Maybe I need to set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i only if x_i >= a_{i-1}, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a_i >=x_i, and a_i >=a_{i-1} if x_i >=a_{i-1}.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i can be either:

- a_i =x_i (if a_i < a_{i-1}), or

- a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some integer k>=1 (if a_i >=a_{i-1}).

- If x_i >=a_{i-1}, then a_i must be x_i (since a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i implies a_i <a_{i-1} if x_i >=a_{i-1}), but wait, that can't happen because if x_i >=a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i only if a_i =x_i +m*a_{i-1} for some m, but x_i >=a_{i-1}, which would make a_i >a_{i-1}, and thus a_i mod a_{i-1}=x_i -a_{i-1}*floor(x_i /a_{i-1}).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I should stick to the initial approach of setting a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n-1, and set a_n =a_{n-1} +x_n.

This ensures that a_i >=a_{i-1} +x_i, which should satisfy a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

But in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and x_3=4, which is acceptable because 4 mod 5=4.

So, my initial approach misses this possibility.

Perhaps I should set a_i to be a_{i-1} +x_i if x_i >= a_{i-1}, otherwise, set a_i =x_i.

Wait, but in the sample, x_3=4 and a_2=5, so x_3 < a_2, and they chose a_3=4 < a_2=5.

But according to my rule, since x_3 < a_2, I could set a_3 =x_3=4, which matches the sample.

Similarly, for x_4=1 and a_3=4, x_4=1 < a_3=4, so set a_4 =x_4=1.

But in the sample, a_4=9.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my rule is incomplete.

Wait, in the sample, a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4, and 9 mod 4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, both a_4=1 and a_4=9 are acceptable, since both 1 mod 4=1 and 9 mod 4=1.

But in the sample, they chose a_4=9, which is greater than a_3.

So, perhaps I can choose a_i to be a_{i-1} +x_i, but need to make sure it doesn't exceed 10^9.

Wait, but in the sample, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, and a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4.

So, perhaps I need to handle cases where x_i < a_{i-1} and x_i >= a_{i-1} differently.

Wait, x_i can't be >= a_{i-1} because in the modulo operation, x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, which is always less than a_{i-1}.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

If a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} =a_i, which could be less than a_{i-1}.

If a_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i mod a_{i-1} is between 0 and a_{i-1}-1.

But in the problem, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

So, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

So, x_i can be less than a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the problem, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so x_i < a_{i-1} is generally true, except when a_{i-1} <=500.

Wait, but a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so x_i=500 could be less than or equal to a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the problem, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so x_i < a_{i-1} is usually true, unless a_{i-1} <=x_i.

Wait, but a_{i-1} can be chosen to be larger than x_i.

Wait, but in the sample, a_3=4 and x_4=1, and a_4=9.

So, a_4=9 > a_3=4, and 9 mod 4=1.

Alternatively, a_4 could be 1, which is less than a_3=4, and 1 mod 4=1.

So, both are acceptable.

So, perhaps in general, for each i, if x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i can be either x_i or a_{i-1} +x_i or 2*a_{i-1} +x_i, etc.

But to make it simple, perhaps I can set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i if x_i < a_{i-1}, and a_i =x_i otherwise.

Wait, but in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and x_3=4 < a_2=5, but they chose a_4=9 > a_3=4.

So, maybe setting a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i is acceptable when x_i < a_{i-1}.

But in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and x_3=4 < a_2=5, but they chose a_4=9, which is a_{i-1} +x_i=4+1=5, but they chose 9, which is larger.

So, perhaps I can set a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some integer k>=1.

In the sample, a_4=9=2*4 +1, which fits this pattern.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, then set a_i =x_i or a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some integer k>=1.

- If x_i >=a_{i-1}, then set a_i =x_i.

But in practice, since x_i can be up to 500 and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, x_i < a_{i-1} is usually true.

So, perhaps I can always set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i.

But in the sample, they chose a_i < a_{i-1} for some i, which is also acceptable.

So, maybe to make it simple, I can set a_1 =x_2 +1, to ensure a_1 >x_2, and then set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n-1, and set a_n =a_{n-1} +x_n.

But in the sample, they chose a_3=4 < a_2=5, which doesn't fit this pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set a_1 =x_2 +1, then a_2 =a_1 +x_2, a_3 =a_2 +x_3, and so on.

But in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, which doesn't match a_2 +x_3=5+4=9.

So, perhaps there's more flexibility in choosing a_i.

Let me try to think recursively.

Start with a_1.

Choose a_1 >=1.

Then, a_2 =k*a_1 +x_2 for some integer k>=0.

Similarly, a_3 =m*a_2 +x_3 for some integer m>=0.

And so on.

So, each a_i depends on a_{i-1} and x_i.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I can choose a_1 to be x_2 +1, as I thought earlier.

Then, a_2 =a_1 +x_2.

Then, a_3 =a_2 +x_3.

And so on, up to a_n =a_{n-1} +x_n.

This ensures that a_i >a_{i-1}, and a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

But in the sample, a_3=4 < a_2=5, which doesn't fit this pattern.

But the sample is still correct because 4 mod 5=4=x_3.

So, perhaps setting a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i is just one possible way, but not the only way.

So, perhaps I can set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for all i, and that would work.

Let me check with the sample.

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Set a_1=3 (since x_2=2, a_1=2+1=3)

a_2=3+2=5

a_3=5+4=9

a_4=9+1=10

Then, check:

5 mod 3=2

9 mod 5=4

10 mod 9=1

Which matches x=[2,4,1]

But in the sample, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, but still correct because 4 mod 5=4.

So, both approaches are correct, but the sample chose a different path.

So, perhaps to make it simple, I can set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for all i.

This ensures that a_i >a_{i-1}, and a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

And since a_i increases rapidly, it should stay within 10^9 for n up to 500 and x_i up to 500.

Wait, but n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, so a_n could be up to 500*500=250,000, which is less than 10^9, so it's acceptable.

Therefore, I can set a_1 =x_2 +1, then a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

This should work.

Let me check with another sample.

Third sample:

n=6

x=[4,2,5,1,2]

According to my approach:

a_1=4+1=5

a_2=5+4=9

a_3=9+2=11

a_4=11+5=16

a_5=16+1=17

a_6=17+2=19

Check:

9 mod 5=4

11 mod 9=2

16 mod 11=5

17 mod 16=1

19 mod 17=2

Which matches x=[4,2,5,1,2]

But in the sample output, a=[5,14,16,5,11,24]

Wait, their a_2=14, which is different from my a_2=9.

But still, 14 mod 5=4, which is correct.

So, their choice is also correct, just different.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Hence, my approach is valid.

Another sample:

n=2

x=[500]

Set a_1=500+1=501

a_2=501+500=1001

Check:

1001 mod 501=1001-2*501=1001-1002=-1, which is not correct.

Wait, what?

Wait, 1001 mod 501 should be 1001 - 2*501 =1001-1002=-1, but modulo should be non-negative.

Wait, no, 1001 divided by 501 is 2, with remainder -1, but actually, 501*1=501, 501*2=1002, which is larger than 1001, so actually, 1001 mod 501=1001-1*501=500.

Wait, 501*1=501

501*2=1002 >1001

So, quotient is 1, remainder is 1001-501=500.

Hence, 1001 mod 501=500, which matches x_2=500.

So, my approach works here.

Another sample:

n=3

x=[1,5]

Set a_1=1+1=2

a_2=2+1=3

a_3=3+5=8

Check:

3 mod 2=1

8 mod 3=2, which does not match x_3=5.

Wait, that's not matching.

So, my approach fails here.

Wait, but according to the problem, x_i=a_i mod a_{i-1}.

Here, a_3=8 mod 3=2, but x_3=5.

So, it doesn't match.

Wait, but x_3=5, and 8 mod 3=2, which is not equal to 5.

So, my approach is incorrect in this case.

But in the sample, for n=3, x=[1,5], the output is [2,7,5].

Let's check:

a_1=2

a_2=7

a_3=5

Check:

7 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1

5 mod 7=5, which matches x_3=5

So, this is correct.

So, in this case, a_3=5 < a_2=7, which is acceptable because 5 mod 7=5.

But in my approach, a_3=8, which gives 8 mod 3=2, which doesn't match x_3=5.

So, my approach fails in this case.

Hence, I need a better way to choose a_i.

Perhaps I need to set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i only if a_{i-1} >x_i, otherwise choose a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some k>=1.

Wait, but in the sample where n=3, x=[1,5], they chose a_2=7, which is greater than a_1=2, and a_3=5, which is less than a_2=7.

So, perhaps I need to handle cases where x_i < a_{i-1} and x_i >=a_{i-1} differently.

Wait, but x_i can't be >=a_{i-1} because
