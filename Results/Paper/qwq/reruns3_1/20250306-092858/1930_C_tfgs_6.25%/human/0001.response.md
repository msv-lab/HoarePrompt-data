Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation, he selects an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from `a`. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain `n` elements, but since it's a set, it might have fewer unique elements if there are duplicates in the inserted values.

Then, Stack constructs a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order. My task is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b` that Stack can make by choosing the indices wisely in each operation.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that when comparing two arrays, the one with the larger element at the first position where they differ is considered larger. So, for `b`, I want the largest possible elements at the front.

Given that `S` is a set, it can only contain unique elements. So, even if I insert the same value multiple times, it will only appear once in `S`. Therefore, the order in which I choose the indices affects which values end up in `S`, and I need to maximize the values in `S` in decreasing order.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since `S` is a set, the final `b` will be sorted in decreasing order, and I need to maximize it lexicographically. That means I want the largest possible elements to appear first in `b`.

Given that `a[i] + i` is being inserted into `S`, and `i` is the index starting from 1, I need to consider how the choice of `i` affects the value being inserted.

Wait, but in each operation, `a` shrinks as elements are deleted, so the indices change in each step. This seems complicated to handle directly. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider that ultimately, I'm choosing a subset of `n` values of the form `a[i] + i`, but since `S` is a set, duplicates are ignored. So, the final `S` will contain unique values from all possible `a[i] + i`.

But I need to choose which ones to insert, knowing that some choices might prevent others from being added due to duplicates.

Wait, actually, since I have to perform exactly `n` operations, and each operation selects an index `i`, inserts `a[i] + i` into `S`, and deletes `a[i]` from `a`, the challenge is in choosing the order of indices to maximize the set `S` in a way that the sorted array `b` is lexicographically largest.

This seems tricky. Let's look at the example to get some intuition.

In the first test case:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

If I choose i=1 first:

Insert 2 + 1 = 3 into S, then delete a[1]=2, so a becomes [1]

Then choose i=1 again:

Insert 1 + 1 = 2 into S, delete a[1]=1, a becomes empty

So S = {3, 2}, b = [3, 2]

Alternatively, if I choose i=2 first:

Insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, delete a[2]=1, a becomes [2]

Then choose i=1:

Insert 2 + 1 = 3 into S, but since 3 is already in S, it doesn't change, and delete a[1]=2, a becomes empty

So S = {3}, b = [3]

Comparing [3,2] and [3], [3,2] is lexicographically larger.

So, choosing to insert unique larger values first is better.

Another example:

n = 5

a = [1, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]

If I always choose the last element:

Operation 1: i=5, insert 1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005, delete a[5]=1000000000, a becomes [1,100,1000,1000000]

Operation 2: i=4, insert 1000000 + 4 = 1000004, delete a[4]=1000000, a becomes [1,100,1000]

Operation 3: i=3, insert 1000 + 3 = 1003, delete a[3]=1000, a becomes [1,100]

Operation 4: i=2, insert 100 + 2 = 102, delete a[2]=100, a becomes [1]

Operation 5: i=1, insert 1 + 1 = 2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes empty

So S = {1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2}, b = [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]

This seems to be the optimal choice, as it maximizes the values inserted into `S`.

Another test case:

n = 3

a = [6,4,8]

Choosing i=1 first:

Insert 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1]=6, a becomes [4,8]

Then i=1:

Insert 4 + 1 = 5, delete a[1]=4, a becomes [8]

Then i=1:

Insert 8 + 1 = 9, delete a[1]=8, a becomes empty

S = {7,5,9}, b = [9,7,5]

Alternatively, choosing i=3 first:

Insert 8 + 3 = 11, delete a[3]=8, a becomes [6,4]

Then i=2:

Insert 4 + 2 = 6, delete a[2]=4, a becomes [6]

Then i=1:

Insert 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1]=6, a becomes empty

S = {11,6,7}, b = [11,7,6]

Comparing [9,7,5] and [11,7,6], [11,7,6] is lexicographically larger.

So, the strategy seems to be to prioritize inserting larger values into `S`, especially unique ones.

But how to formalize this?

I need to maximize the set `S` in a way that the sorted array `b` is lexicographically largest.

Given that `S` is a set, duplicates are ignored, so I need to maximize the unique values inserted into `S`.

Moreover, since `b` is sorted in decreasing order, I need the largest possible elements to appear first in `b`.

So, to maximize `b`, I need to maximize the maximum element in `S`, then the second maximum, and so on, up to the smallest element in `S`.

Given that, perhaps I should sort the possible values of `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and select the largest unique ones first.

But there's a catch: when I delete an element from `a`, the indices of the elements to the right of it shift left by one. So, choosing an index affects the indices of the remaining elements.

This seems complicated to handle directly. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can precompute all possible values of `a[i] + i` for all `i` from 1 to n, and then select a subset of size `n` such that duplicates are ignored, and the sorted unique values are lexicographically largest.

But I need to perform exactly `n` operations, inserting one value each time, and deleting an element each time, which affects the indices of the remaining elements.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can find a way to select indices such that the values inserted into `S` are as large as possible, prioritizing uniqueness.

Let me consider that the set `S` will contain unique values, so I need to maximize the unique values inserted, starting with the largest possible.

I think the best way is to sort the values of `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and select the largest unique ones first.

But I need to ensure that I can actually select them in such a way that the operations allow it.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the values of `a[i] + i` along with their indices, and then select them in decreasing order, skipping those that would cause duplicates.

But this might not be efficient for large `n`.

Given the constraints, with `n` up to 3*10^5 and sum of `n` over all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) time.

Let me think about the properties of the set `S`.

The set `S` will contain unique values of `a[i] + i`, but since I perform `n` operations, and `S` is a set, it might have fewer than `n` elements if there are duplicates.

But the problem guarantees that I perform exactly `n` operations, inserting into `S` each time, but `S` might have fewer than `n` unique elements.

Then, `b` is the sorted array of `S` in decreasing order.

I need to maximize `b` lexicographically.

I recall that to maximize a lexicographical order, I should maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

So, I need to maximize the largest element in `S`, then the second largest, and so on.

Given that, perhaps I should aim to include as many large unique values in `S` as possible.

But how?

Let me consider that the possible values of `a[i] + i` are candidates for `S`.

I need to select a subset of these values, with no duplicates, to maximize the sorted array in decreasing order.

Wait, but I have to perform exactly `n` operations, inserting one value each time.

However, since `S` is a set, inserting duplicates doesn't change `S`.

So, perhaps I should focus on selecting the largest possible unique values, and if there are duplicates, choose only one of them.

But I need to perform `n` operations, so I need to insert `n` values, but only unique ones will be added to `S`.

Therefore, if there are duplicates, some insertions won't add new elements to `S`.

But I need to maximize `S` in a way that the sorted array `b` is lexicographically largest.

I think the key is to select the largest possible unique values of `a[i] + i`, and include as many of them as possible in `S`, in decreasing order.

But I need to perform exactly `n` operations, even if some of them don't add new elements to `S`.

Wait, but the problem says that after `n` operations, `a` will be empty.

So, I need to perform `n` operations, each time deleting one element from `a`.

But the set `S` might have fewer than `n` elements if there are duplicates in the inserted values.

Then, `b` is the sorted array of `S` in decreasing order.

I need to maximize `b` lexicographically.

I need to find a way to select the indices in each operation to maximize the unique values inserted into `S`.

This seems complex.

Let me consider that the final `S` is determined by the unique values of `a[i] + i` that I choose to insert, and I need to perform exactly `n` operations.

But since some insertions might not add new elements to `S` (if they are duplicates), I need to maximize the unique values added to `S`.

I think the optimal strategy is to select the largest possible unique values for `S`, and include as many of them as possible.

But I need to ensure that I perform `n` operations, even if some don't add new elements to `S`.

Wait, but the problem is to maximize `b`, which is the sorted array of unique values in `S`.

So, perhaps I can focus on selecting the largest possible unique values for `S`.

Given that, maybe I can sort all possible `a[i] + i` in decreasing order, and then select the unique ones, and fill `b` with them in that order.

But I need to perform exactly `n` operations, and each operation corresponds to selecting an index, inserting `a[i] + i` into `S`, and deleting `a[i]` from `a`.

The challenge is that the indices change after each deletion, so I need to keep track of the current indices.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps there's a better way to look at this.

Let me consider that the final `S` is a set of unique values of `a[i] + i`, where each value corresponds to an operation where I selected index `i`, inserted `a[i] + i` into `S`, and deleted `a[i]` from `a`.

Given that, I need to perform `n` such operations, but `S` might have fewer elements if there are duplicates.

I need to maximize the sorted array `b` of `S` in decreasing order.

I think that to maximize `b`, I should aim to have as many large unique values in `S` as possible.

So, I should prioritize selecting indices that give me the largest possible unique values of `a[i] + i`.

But I need to perform `n` operations, and some operations might not add new elements to `S` if they are duplicates.

Wait, perhaps I can compute all possible `a[i] + i` values, find the unique ones, sort them in decreasing order, and that would be `b`.

But that can't be right because I need to perform exactly `n` operations, and some operations might insert duplicates that don't add to `S`.

So, the size of `S` can be less than `n` if there are duplicates.

But the problem says to output `b`, which is `S` sorted in decreasing order, and I need to make it lexicographically largest.

I think the key is to maximize the unique values in `S`, focusing on the largest possible values.

Given that, perhaps I can collect all possible `a[i] + i` values, sort them in decreasing order, remove duplicates, and that would be `b`.

But in the first test case, if I do that, I get [3,2], which is correct.

In the second test case, [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2], which is correct.

In the third test case, [11,7,6], which is correct.

So, perhaps the solution is to collect all possible `a[i] + i` values, sort them in decreasing order, and remove duplicates, then output the sorted unique values.

But wait, in the first test case, if I just collect all possible `a[i] + i` values, which are:

For i=1: a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

For i=2: a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, unique values are {3}, but in the explanation, choosing a different order gives {3,2}.

Wait, but if I perform two operations, inserting 3 and 2, I get {3,2}.

But according to my previous idea, if I collect all possible `a[i] + i` values and remove duplicates, I would get {3}, which is not matching the example.

So, perhaps my initial thought is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that performing `n` operations allows me to insert `n` values into `S`, but only unique ones are kept.

So, even if there are duplicates, I can still insert them, but they won't change `S`.

But I need to perform `n` operations, so I need to select `n` indices, inserting `n` values into `S`, but only unique ones are added.

Therefore, the size of `S` can be up to `n`, but might be less if there are duplicates.

I need to maximize the sorted array `b` of `S` in decreasing order.

Given that, perhaps I need to select the largest possible unique values for `S`, and if there are duplicates, I can still perform the operations, but only one of them will add to `S`.

But I need to perform `n` operations, so I need to select `n` values, even if some don't add to `S`.

I need to maximize the unique values in `S`.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I collect all possible `a[i] + i` values with their frequencies.

Then, the set `S` can contain each unique value only once, regardless of how many times I insert it.

So, the final `S` will contain each unique `a[i] + i` exactly once, unless I have to perform extra operations that don't add new elements to `S`.

But I need to perform exactly `n` operations.

So, if there are duplicates, some operations won't add new elements to `S`.

But I need to maximize `S` by including as many large unique values as possible.

Given that, perhaps I should sort the `a[i] + i` values in decreasing order, and select the unique ones first, and fill `S` with the largest unique values.

Then, for the remaining operations, I can insert duplicates, which won't add to `S`, but I need to perform `n` operations.

But in terms of maximizing `b`, which is the sorted array of `S` in decreasing order, it only depends on the unique values in `S`, not on how many times I insert duplicates.

So, perhaps I can simply collect all possible `a[i] + i` values, sort them in decreasing order, remove duplicates, and that would be `b`.

But in the first test case, that would give [3,2], which matches the example.

In the second test case, [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2], which matches the example.

In the third test case, [11,7,6], which matches the example.

So, perhaps my initial thought was correct.

Therefore, the solution is to collect all possible `a[i] + i` values, sort them in decreasing order, remove duplicates, and output the sorted unique values.

This seems straightforward.

But I need to confirm if this is always correct.

Let me think of a case where this might not hold.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,1,1]

Possible `a[i] + i`:

i=1: 1+1=2

i=2: 1+2=3

i=3: 1+3=4

If I select i=3 first: insert 4, delete a[3]=1, a becomes [1,1]

Then select i=2: insert 1+2=3, delete a[2]=1, a becomes [1]

Then select i=1: insert 1+1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes empty

So S={4,3,2}, b=[4,3,2]

Alternatively, if I select i=1 first: insert 2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes [1,1]

Then i=1: insert 1+1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes [1]

Then i=1: insert 1+1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes empty

So S={2}, b=[2]

Clearly, [4,3,2] is better than [2].

So, collecting all unique `a[i] + i` and sorting them decreasingly seems correct.

Another case: n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

Possible `a[i] + i`:

i=1:1+1=2

i=2:2+2=4

i=3:3+3=6

i=4:4+4=8

If I select i=4 first: insert 8, delete a[4]=4, a becomes [1,2,3]

Then i=3: insert 3+3=6, delete a[3]=3, a becomes [1,2]

Then i=2: insert 2+2=4, delete a[2]=2, a becomes [1]

Then i=1: insert 1+1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes empty

S={8,6,4,2}, b=[8,6,4,2]

Alternatively, if I select i=1 first: insert 2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes [2,3,4]

Then i=1: insert 2+1=3, delete a[1]=2, a becomes [3,4]

Then i=1: insert 3+1=4, delete a[1]=3, a becomes [4]

Then i=1: insert 4+1=5, delete a[1]=4, a becomes empty

S={2,3,4,5}, b=[5,4,3,2]

Comparing [8,6,4,2] and [5,4,3,2], [8,6,4,2] is better.

So, selecting the largest unique `a[i] + i` values is better.

Hence, my initial thought seems correct.

Therefore, to solve the problem, for each test case, I need to:

1. Read n and the array a.

2. Compute all possible a[i] + i for i from 1 to n.

3. Collect these values into a list.

4. Use a Counter to count the frequency of each value.

5. Sort the unique values in decreasing order.

6. Output the sorted unique values in decreasing order.

But looking back at the provided program, it seems to do something more complicated.

Let's look at the provided program:

from collections import Counter

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):

a[i] += i + 1

counter = Counter(a)

a = list(set(a))

a.sort(reverse=True)

cnt = n - len(a)

ans = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if i > 0:

adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])

for j in range(adv):

ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)

cnt -= adv

counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv

ans.append(a[i])

counter[a[i]] -= 1

for _ in range(cnt):

ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)

print(*ans)

So, it does the following:

- Reads t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and the array a.

- Adjusts a[i] to a[i] + (i + 1), assuming indices start from 1.

- Uses a Counter to count frequencies of each value in a.

- Creates a list of unique a[i] + i values, sorted in decreasing order.

- Computes cnt = n - len(a), which is the number of duplicates.

- Initializes an answer list.

- Iterates through the sorted unique values, and for each pair of consecutive values, calculates how many additional unique values can be inserted between them, up to the number of duplicates (cnt).

- Appends these additional values to the answer list.

- Appends the current unique value to the answer list.

- Finally, if there are still duplicates left (cnt > 0), appends values decreasing by 1 from the last appended value.

- Prints the answer list.

Wait, this seems more involved than my initial thought.

I need to understand why it's doing this.

In my initial thought, I just collect all unique a[i] + i values, sort them in decreasing order, and output them.

But the provided program seems to be trying to insert additional values between the unique values, based on the differences between them and the number of duplicates.

I need to verify if this is necessary.

Looking back at the examples, in all cases, just taking the unique a[i] + i values and sorting them decreasingly seems sufficient.

But perhaps there are cases where inserting additional values between the unique values can lead to a lexicographically larger b.

Let me think of such a case.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,2,4]

Possible a[i] + i:

i=1:1+1=2

i=2:2+2=4

i=3:4+3=7

So, unique values are {2,4,7}, b=[7,4,2]

But perhaps there is a way to get a better b by inserting additional values.

Wait, in this case, there are no duplicates, so cnt=0, and the program would just output [7,4,2], which matches my initial thought.

Another case: n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

Possible a[i] + i:

i=1:1+1=2

i=2:2+2=4

i=3:3+3=6

i=4:4+4=8

Unique values: {2,4,6,8}, b=[8,6,4,2]

Again, no duplicates, cnt
