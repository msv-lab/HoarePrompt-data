Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about buying concert tickets over multiple days with some constraints. Let me try to understand the problem first.

So, there are n days, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a1 to an. I need to buy k tickets in total, and each day I can buy at most m tickets. But there's a twist: every time I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all the remaining days. That sounds a bit tricky.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying these k tickets. I need to figure out when to buy how many tickets to achieve the minimum cost.

First, I need to think about how the price increases affect future purchases. If I buy more tickets on an earlier day, the price for future days goes up, which might offset any savings I get from buying cheaper tickets earlier.

Let's consider the example given in the problem:

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

One optimal way is to buy 0 tickets on the first two days, then 1 ticket on the third day for 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day for 6, totaling 10.

Wait, but why not buy 2 tickets on the first day? That would cost 16, and then the prices for the remaining days increase by 2, so the next days' prices would be 8, 6, 4 -> 10, 8, 6. Then buying 1 ticket on the second day would cost 10, totaling 26, which is worse than the previous strategy.

Another approach: buy 1 ticket on the third day for 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day for 6, totaling 10. Same as the first strategy.

So, it seems that delaying purchases can be beneficial because the price increases don't affect the days you've already bought tickets on.

Wait, but in the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

Here, the only way is to buy 2 tickets each day, and the prices increase by 2 each day after purchases.

So, day 1: buy 2 tickets for 16, prices for remaining days increase to 10, 8, 6

Day 2: buy 2 tickets for 20, prices for remaining days increase to 12, 10

Day 3: buy 2 tickets for 24, prices for remaining days increase to 14

Day 4: buy 2 tickets for 28

Total cost: 16 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 88, but the output is 64. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the problem says: "the prices per ticket increased by x from day i+1 onwards". So, in the first test case:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices remain the same for days 2-4: [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices remain the same for days 3-4: [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost is 4, prices for day 4 increase by 1: [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost is 6

Total: 4 + 6 = 10

Another strategy: buy 2 on day 1: cost is 16, prices for days 2-4 increase by 2: [10,8,6]

Then buy 2 on day 2: cost is 20, prices for days 3-4 increase by 2: [12,10]

Then buy 2 on day 3: cost is 24, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [14]

Then buy 2 on day 4: cost is 28

Total: 16+20+24+28 = 88, which is worse.

So, delaying purchases can be better because you avoid increasing the prices for future days.

But in the second test case, k=8, n=4, m=2.

The output is 64, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 88, which is higher than the output. So, there must be a better strategy.

Wait, maybe buying all tickets on the first day is not optimal. Let's try different approaches.

Alternative approach for second test case:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost is 8, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [4]

- Buy 6 on day 4: cost is 24 (since m=2, but k=6, but m=2, wait, m is the maximum per day, but k=8, so buy m=2 on day 3 and m=2 on day 4, but k=8 requires buying 4 tickets on day 4, which is more than m=2, which is not allowed. Wait, m is the maximum per day.

Wait, m=2, so per day, you can buy at most 2 tickets.

So, in the second test case, you have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days, totaling 8 tickets.

But according to the problem, m=2, and k=8, n=4.

So, you have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days.

But according to the example, the output is 64, but my calculation gives 88.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the price increase.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, in the second test case:

- Buy 2 tickets on day 1: cost is 16, prices for days 2-4 increase by 2: [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 2: cost is 20, prices for days 3-4 increase by 2: [10+2=12, 8+2=10]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 3: cost is 24, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [12+2=14]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost is 28

Total: 16+20+24+28 = 88

But the sample output is 64, which is less than 88. So, there must be a better strategy.

Wait, maybe buying fewer tickets on earlier days and more on later days can save money because the price increases are lower.

Let's try:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost is 8, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [4+2=6]

- Buy 6 on day 4: but m=2, so can only buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost is 12, total so far is 8+12=20

But k=8, so need to buy more tickets.

Wait, k=8, n=4, m=2, so have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days, totaling 8 tickets.

But according to the sample output, it's 64, but according to this, it's 88.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the price increases are cumulative.

Wait, in the first strategy:

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost 16, prices increase by 2 for days 2-4: [10,8,6]

- Buy 2 on day 2: cost 20, prices increase by another 2 for days 3-4: [12,10]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 24, prices increase by another 2 for day 4: [14]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 28

Total: 16+20+24+28=88

But sample output is 64, which is less than 88, so there must be a better way.

Alternative strategy:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 8, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [4+2=6]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 12

Total: 8 + 12 = 20

But k=8, but I've only bought 4 tickets so far. I need to buy 8 tickets. Wait, m=2, n=4, so maximum tickets bought are 8.

Wait, in this strategy, I've bought 2 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, totaling 4 tickets, but k=8, so I need to buy more.

But m=2, and n=4, so the maximum is 8 tickets.

Wait, perhaps I need to buy 2 tickets each day, but in this strategy, I'm only buying on days 3 and 4.

Wait, no, in this strategy, I'm buying 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 2 on day 3, and 2 on day 4, totaling 4 tickets, but k=8, so I need to buy 8 tickets.

But m=2 per day, and n=4 days, so buying 2 each day for 4 days gives 8 tickets.

But in this strategy, I'm only buying on two days, getting 4 tickets.

So, I need to buy on all four days.

Wait, but m=2, and k=8, n=4, so have to buy 2 each day.

Wait, perhaps I need to buy different amounts on different days.

Wait, m=2 is the maximum per day, so I can buy up to 2 per day.

But k=8, so I need to buy 2 each day for 4 days.

Given that, the cost would be:

Day 1: buy 2 tickets for 16, prices increase by 2 for days 2-4: [10,8,6]

Day 2: buy 2 tickets for 20, prices increase by 2 for days 3-4: [12,10]

Day 3: buy 2 tickets for 24, prices increase by 2 for day 4: [14]

Day 4: buy 2 tickets for 28

Total: 16+20+24+28=88

But sample output is 64, which is less than 88, so there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I can buy fewer tickets on some days and more on others, within the m=2 limit.

But m=2 is the maximum per day, so I can't buy more than 2 per day.

Wait, but in this case, I have to buy 2 each day for 4 days, totaling 8 tickets.

But according to the sample output, the minimal cost is 64, but according to my calculation, it's 88.

Wait, maybe I need to buy on different days or buy different amounts.

Wait, but m=2 per day, and k=8, n=4.

Wait, perhaps I can buy on only some days, but then k=8 requires buying on all days.

Wait, no, m=2 per day, n=4 days, k=8 tickets, so have to buy on all days.

Wait, but in the first strategy, buying 0 on day 1 and day 2 seems to save money, but then I can't buy enough tickets.

Wait, in that strategy, I only buy 4 tickets, but k=8, so I need to buy on all days.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to distribute the purchases.

Wait, maybe buying fewer tickets on earlier days and more on later days can save money.

Let's try:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 8, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [4+2=6]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 12

Total: 8 + 12 = 20 for 4 tickets.

But I need 8 tickets, so I need to buy on all days.

Wait, but m=2 per day, n=4 days, k=8 tickets, so have to buy 2 each day.

But according to the earlier calculation, that costs 88, but sample output is 64.

Wait, maybe I need to buy different amounts on different days, but m=2 is the maximum per day.

Wait, perhaps buying less on some days and more on others within the m=2 limit.

But m=2 is the maximum per day, so I can't buy more than 2 per day.

Wait, maybe buying less on some days and more on others can optimize the cost.

Wait, but with m=2 per day, and k=8, n=4, I have to buy 2 each day.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the price increases are cumulative.

Wait, in the first strategy:

- Day 1: buy 2 tickets for 16, prices increase by 2 for days 2-4: [10,8,6]

- Day 2: buy 2 tickets for 20, prices increase by 2 for days 3-4: [12,10]

- Day 3: buy 2 tickets for 24, prices increase by 2 for day 4: [14]

- Day 4: buy 2 tickets for 28

Total: 16+20+24+28=88

But sample output is 64, which is less than 88, so there must be a better strategy.

Wait, maybe the optimal strategy is to buy as few tickets as possible on days with higher prices and more on days with lower prices.

Given that the prices are increasing if you buy tickets on earlier days, perhaps buying on later days is better.

Wait, but in this case, buying on later days doesn't help because the prices are already increased due to previous purchases.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a balance.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the cost per ticket including the future price increases.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the third test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1, a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

So, n=5 days, m=100 (can buy up to 100 per day), k=1 (only need to buy 1 ticket).

The prices are [10000,1,100,10,1000]

The minimal cost would be to buy on the day with the lowest price, which is day 2 for 1.

So, total cost is 1.

That makes sense.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, m=3, k=9, a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

So, n=6 days, m=3, k=9, prices are all 5.

If I buy 3 tickets each day for 3 days: days 1,2,3, costing 15 each day, total 45.

Alternatively, buy 3 on days 1,2,3; prices for days 4,5,6 increase by 3 each day.

But since all prices are the same, maybe it's the same total.

Wait, but the sample output is 72, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, n=6, m=3, k=9.

If I buy 3 tickets each day for 3 days, total cost is 3*5 + 3*5 + 3*5 = 45.

But sample output is 72, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the price increases properly.

Wait, if I buy 3 tickets on day 1: cost is 15, prices for days 2-6 increase by 3: [8,8,8,8,8]

Then buy 3 tickets on day 2: cost is 24, prices for days 3-6 increase by another 3: [11,11,11,11]

Then buy 3 tickets on day 3: cost is 33, prices for days 4-6 increase by another 3: [14,14,14]

Then buy 3 tickets on day 4: cost is 42, prices for days 5-6 increase by another 3: [17,17]

Then buy 3 tickets on day 5: cost is 51, prices for day 6 increase by another 3: [20]

Then buy 3 tickets on day 6: cost is 60.

Total: 15+24+33+42+51+60 = 225, which is way higher than 72.

Wait, but the sample output is 72, which is less than my previous calculation.

So, there must be a better strategy.

Wait, maybe buying all tickets on the first day: buy 3 tickets on day 1 for 15, then prices increase by 3 for days 2-6: [8,8,8,8,8].

Then buy 3 tickets on day 2 for 24, prices increase by another 3 for days 3-6: [11,11,11,11].

Then buy 3 tickets on day 3 for 33, prices increase by another 3 for days 4-6: [14,14,14].

Then buy 0 on day 4,5,6 since k=9 is already reached.

Total: 15+24+33 = 72, which matches the sample output.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought that I need to buy 3 tickets each day for 3 days, but actually, I can stop after buying 9 tickets.

So, in this case, buying 3 tickets on days 1,2,3, totaling 72.

Wait, but in the earlier strategy of buying 2 on day 1 and 2 on day 2 and so on, I was miscalculating.

So, perhaps in the second test case, a similar strategy applies.

Wait, in the second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

Buy 2 on day 1: cost 16, prices for days 2-4 increase by 2: [10,8,6]

Buy 2 on day 2: cost 16, prices for days 3-4 increase by another 2: [12,10]

Buy 2 on day 3: cost 20, prices for day 4 increase by another 2: [14]

Buy 2 on day 4: cost 28

Total: 16+16+20+28=80, still higher than 64.

Wait, maybe I need to buy fewer tickets on earlier days.

Alternative strategy:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost 8, prices for day 4 increase by 2: [4+2=6]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost 12

Total: 8 + 12 = 20 for 4 tickets.

But I need 8 tickets, so I need to buy on all days.

Wait, m=2 per day, n=4 days, k=8 tickets.

So, have to buy 2 each day for 4 days.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 64, but according to my calculation, it's 80.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that buying on later days avoids higher price increases.

Wait, perhaps buying on the first two days is worse because it increases the prices for the remaining days.

Wait, maybe I need to minimize the total price increases.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula or a mathematical way to calculate this.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

M = list(map(int, input().split()))

(n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])

m = min(m, k)

M.sort()

q = int(math.ceil(k / m))

N = M[:q]

n = len(N)

if n * m == k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu = k - (n - 1) * m

cost = mu * w

n = len(N)

cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu

print(cost)

continue

So, the code sorts the prices in ascending order, then determines how many days to buy from, based on q = ceil(k / m).

Then, it selects the q lowest prices, and calculates the cost based on some formula.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a=[8,6,4,2]

sorted a=[2,4,6,8]

q = ceil(3/2) = 2

N = [2,4]

n=2

Since n*m=4 which is > k=3, so it's the else case.

w = N.pop() = 4

mu = 3 - (2-1)*2 = 3 - 2 =1

cost = 1 * 4 =4

n=1

cost += 2*sum([2]) + 2*2*(0) +1*2*1 = 4 + 0 + 2 = 6

Total cost =4 +6=10, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a=[8,6,4,2]

sorted a=[2,4,6,8]

q=ceil(8/2)=4

N=[2,4,6,8]

n=4

Since n*m=8 ==k=8

cost =2*sum([2,4,6,8]) +2*2*(3+2+1+0)=2*20 +4*(6)=40+24=64, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

sorted a=[1,10,100,1000,10000]

q=ceil(1/100)=1

N=[1]

n=1

Since n*m=100 >=k=1

But n*m !=k, so else case.

w=N.pop()=1

mu=1 - (1-1)*100=1-0=1

cost=1*1=1

n=0

cost +=100*sum([]) +100*100*(0)+0*100*1=0+0+0=0

Total cost=1+0=1, matches sample.

Fourth test case:

n=6, m=3, k=9

a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

sorted a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

q=ceil(9/3)=3

N=[5,5,5]

n=3

n*m=9==k=9

cost=3*sum([5,5,5])+3*3*(2+1+0)=3*15 +9*3=45+27=72, matches sample.

So, the code seems to be calculating the correct cost based on the sorted prices and some formula.

Now, I need to understand why this formula works.

Looking at the formula:

If n*m ==k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
