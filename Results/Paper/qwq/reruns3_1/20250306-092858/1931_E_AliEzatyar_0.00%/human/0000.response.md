Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins in a game between Anna and Sasha based on a list of integers and some conditions. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, there's a list of integers given, and Anna and Sasha take turns playing a game on this list. The game ends when there's only one number left in the list, and based on the value of that number, either Sasha or Anna wins.

Let me first understand the moves each player can make.

Anna's move:

- She chooses one element from the list and reverses its digits, removing any leading zeros.

For example:

- If she chooses 42, it becomes 24.

- If she chooses 1580, it becomes 851.

Sasha's move:

- He chooses two different elements from the list, concatenates them in any order, removes them from the list, and inserts the concatenated number back into the list.

For example:

- If he chooses 2007 and 19, he can make either 200719 or 192007.

The game ends when there's only one number left in the list, and if this number is at least 10^m, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

I need to determine, for each test case, who wins if both players play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and how the players can influence the final number.

Let's think about the sequence of moves.

- The game starts with Anna making the first move since she has the right to make the first move.

- Then Sasha makes a move, and they alternate turns until there's only one number left.

I need to model this game to understand who can force a win.

Let me consider the number of elements in the list and how it changes with each move.

- Initially, there are n elements.

- Each time Sasha makes a move, he removes two elements and adds one, so the number of elements decreases by one.

- Anna's move doesn't change the number of elements; she just reverses one element.

So, the number of elements decreases only when Sasha makes a move.

Let me try to see how many moves each player can make.

Let's denote the number of elements as n.

- Sasha can make a move only if there are at least two elements in the list.

- Anna can always make a move as long as there is at least one element.

The game ends when there's only one element left, and it's Anna's turn to play.

Wait, no. The game ends after Anna's move when there's only one element left.

Wait, let's think carefully.

- If there's only one element left, it's after Anna's move, because Sasha's move requires two elements.

- So, when there's only one element left, it's after Anna's move, and Sasha can't make a move.

- Therefore, the game ends when there's only one element left, and it's Sasha's turn to play, but he can't make a move.

So, the final number is the one left after Anna's move.

Wait, but according to the problem, "The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e., after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list."

So, indeed, the game ends when there's one number left, and it's after Anna's move.

Now, I need to see what that final number is and whether it's at least 10^m.

I need to think about how the players can influence this final number.

Let me consider the operations:

- Anna reverses the digits of one number, possibly removing leading zeros.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order.

I need to see how these operations affect the final number.

First, reversing a number can change its value. For example, reversing 123 gives 321, which is larger. Reversing 100 gives 1, which is smaller.

Concatenating two numbers can be done in two ways, producing two different numbers, and Sasha chooses one of them.

The goal is to make the final number at least 10^m for Sasha to win.

I need to find out who can force the final number to be at least 10^m or less, depending on who wants what.

Sasha wants the final number to be at least 10^m to win, while Anna wants it to be less than 10^m to win.

So, Sasha tries to maximize the final number, and Anna tries to minimize it, in a way.

But it's not exactly maximizing and minimizing; it's more about strategic choices to reach a certain threshold.

I need to model this game to understand the optimal strategies.

Let me think about the number of moves.

Each time Sasha makes a move, he reduces the number of elements by one.

Anna's moves don't change the number of elements.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is equal to n - 1, but only if there are enough elements for him to make moves.

Wait, but Anna can make moves in between.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of moves.

Let me consider the total number of moves.

Each move is either Anna's or Sasha's.

- Anna's move: reverses one number, doesn't change the count.

- Sasha's move: removes two, adds one, so decreases the count by one.

The game starts with n elements and ends with 1 element.

Each Sasha's move reduces the count by one, and Anna's move doesn't change it.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is n - 1.

But, Sasha can only make a move if there are at least two elements.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is floor(n/2), but perhaps not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me consider small values of n.

Case 1: n = 1

- Only Anna makes a move, reverses the single number.

- Then, Sasha can't make a move, so the game ends with that reversed number.

- So, if the reversed number is >= 10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Case 2: n = 2

- Anna makes the first move: reverses one of the two numbers.

- Then, Sasha makes a move: concatenates the two numbers (the one reversed by Anna and the other one) in either order.

- Then, Anna can make another move: reverses the single number left.

- Wait, no. After Sasha's move, there's only one number left, so the game ends.

Wait, let's see:

- Start with two numbers: a and b.

- Anna reverses one of them, say a becomes a'.

- Then, Sasha concatenates a' and b to make a' concatenated with b, or b concatenated with a'.

- Then, there's only one number left, so the game ends.

- So, the final number is either a' concatenated with b or b concatenated with a'.

- Sasha chooses which order to concatenate.

- So, Sasha can choose the larger of the two possible concatenations.

- Then, if this number is >= 10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Wait, but Anna chooses which number to reverse initially.

So, Anna can choose which number to reverse to minimize the final number, and Sasha chooses the order of concatenation to maximize it.

Case 3: n = 3

- Anna reverses one of the three numbers.

- Then, Sasha concatenates two of the remaining two numbers in the best way for him.

- Then, Anna reverses the remaining number.

- Then, Sasha concatenates the two numbers left in the best way for him.

- Wait, no. After Sasha's first move, there are two numbers left: the concatenated one and the one not concatenated.

- Then, Anna reverses one of these two.

- Then, Sasha concatenates them in the best way.

- So, the final number is determined by Sasha's second move.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me think about the total number of digits.

Each Sasha's move concatenates two numbers, which combines their digits into one number.

Anna's move reverses a number, which can change the order of digits.

But the final number's value depends on the digit sequence.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find a way to calculate the minimal or maximal possible final number.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of digits.

If I consider that concatenating two numbers adds their digit counts, and reversing a number doesn't change its digit count, then the final number's digit count is the sum of all digit counts minus the digit counts of the numbers that were reversed.

Wait, that doesn't seem directly helpful.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The reference solution seems to calculate the total digits and subtract some zeros based on the number of trailing zeros in some numbers.

Wait, let's look at the code.

The code reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and m, where n is the number of integers in the list, and m is the exponent for 10^m.

Then, it reads the list of numbers as strings.

It calculates the total digits by summing the lengths of the strings.

It also collects the number of trailing zeros for numbers that have trailing zeros.

It sorts these trailing zeros in descending order.

Then, it subtracts every other trailing zero starting from the first one.

Finally, it checks if the total digits minus the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to m + 1.

If yes, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Wait, there are a few things unclear here.

First, why are we considering trailing zeros?

Second, why subtract every other trailing zero?

Third, why compare total digits minus subtracted zeros to m + 1?

I need to understand the logic behind this.

Let me consider that the final number's value is determined by its digit count and its digit sequence.

If the final number has at least m + 1 digits, it is at least 10^m.

Because 10^m has m + 1 digits.

Wait, 10^m has m + 1 digits only if m >= 1.

Wait, 10^0 = 1 has 1 digit, 10^1 = 10 has 2 digits, 10^2 = 100 has 3 digits, and so on.

So, in general, 10^m has m + 1 digits.

Therefore, if the final number has at least m + 1 digits, it is at least 10^m.

So, perhaps the key is to see if the final number can have at least m + 1 digits.

Now, the total digits in the list initially is the sum of the lengths of all numbers.

Each Sasha's move concatenates two numbers, which combines their digits.

Each Anna's move reverses a number, which doesn't change the digit count.

So, the total digit count remains the same throughout the game.

Wait, but when Sasha concatenates two numbers into one, the digit count remains the same, as concatenation doesn't add extra digits.

Wait, no, concatenating two numbers adds their digit counts.

Wait, no, concatenating two numbers with lengths l1 and l2 results in a number with l1 + l2 digits, assuming no leading zeros in the concatenated number.

But, in reality, if the first number has leading zeros, they are removed when concatenated.

Wait, but in this problem, leading zeros are removed after Anna's reversal, but not during Sasha's concatenation.

Wait, the problem says that Anna reverses the digits and removes leading zeros, but Sasha just concatenates the numbers as they are, without removing leading zeros.

Wait, actually, the problem says that Anna reverses the digits and removes leading zeros, but it doesn't specify about Sasha's concatenation.

However, in programming, when you concatenate two integers, you concatenate their digit sequences without adding extra leading zeros.

So, the digit count of the concatenated number is the sum of the digit counts of the two numbers being concatenated.

Therefore, the total digit count in the list remains constant throughout the game.

Wait, but each time Sasha concatenates two numbers into one, the total digit count remains the same, as the sum of digits of the two numbers is equal to the digit count of the concatenated number.

Wait, but actually, if you have two numbers with l1 and l2 digits, their concatenation has l1 + l2 digits.

But, in the list, before concatenation, the total digit count is l1 + l2, and after concatenation, it's l1 + l2, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the total digit count remains constant throughout the game.

Therefore, the final number will have the same total digit count as the sum of the digit counts of the initial numbers.

So, if the total digit count is at least m + 1, Sasha can always make the final number have at least m + 1 digits, hence winning.

Wait, but the reference solution seems to subtract some trailing zeros from the total digit count.

Why is that?

Let me think about numbers with trailing zeros.

If a number has trailing zeros, reversing it will move those zeros to the front, and then Anna can remove the leading zeros.

So, for example, if a number is 100, reversing it gives 001, and after removing leading zeros, it becomes 1, which has only one digit.

Therefore, such numbers can be reduced to a single digit by Anna.

So, perhaps Anna can minimize the digit count of some numbers to 1 by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.

Therefore, she can reduce the total digit count by reducing some numbers with multiple digits to single-digit numbers.

Specifically, for numbers with trailing zeros, Anna can reverse them to make them single-digit numbers.

So, if there are numbers with trailing zeros, Anna can choose to reverse them and reduce their digit count to 1.

Therefore, the total digit count can be reduced by the number of such reductions Anna can make.

But how many such reductions can Anna make?

Well, Anna can choose to reverse any number in her turn, but she can only reverse one number per turn.

However, since Sasha's moves interleave with Anna's, and Sasha's moves reduce the number of elements by one each time, the number of times Anna can choose to reverse a number with trailing zeros is limited.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of such numbers Anna can reverse before Sasha concatenates them.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of such numbers.

Wait, let's look back at the reference solution.

It collects the number of trailing zeros for numbers that have trailing zeros, sorts them in descending order, and subtracts every other one starting from the first.

Wait, perhaps Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros in such a way that she minimizes the total digit count.

Wait, but the reference solution seems to subtract the maximum possible trailing zeros that Anna can remove.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros, thereby reducing their digit count to 1, and Sasha wants to minimize the impact of this.

Wait, but actually, Anna wants the final number to be less than 10^m, so she wants to minimize the final number's digit count.

Sasha wants the final number to be at least 10^m, so he wants to maximize the digit count.

Therefore, Anna tries to reduce the digit count as much as possible by reversing numbers with trailing zeros, while Sasha tries to prevent that.

So, in the reference solution, it seems to calculate the total digit count and subtract the maximum possible reduction in digit count due to Anna's moves.

Then, if the resulting digit count is at least m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that Anna can reduce the digit count by the number of trailing zeros in some numbers, and Sasha can try to minimize the impact by choosing how to concatenate numbers.

But I'm not fully understanding the logic yet.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

2 2

14 2

Total digit count: 2 (for 14) + 1 (for 2) = 3

m + 1 = 3

So, total digits is 3, which is equal to m + 1, so Sasha wins.

But according to the reference solution, it's Sasha wins.

Another test case:

3 5

9 56 1

Total digit count: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

m + 1 = 6

4 < 6, so Anna wins.

But according to the reference solution, it's Anna wins.

Wait, but in the output, it's "Anna" for this case.

Wait, no, looking back, the first output is "Sasha", which corresponds to the first test case.

Wait, let's check the example again.

Input:

9

2 2

14 2

3 5

9 56 1

4 10

1 2007 800 1580

4 5

5000 123 30 4

10 10

6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7

1 1

6

1 1

10

8 9

1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2

4 5

10 10 10 10

Output:

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Sasha

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Anna

Sasha

So, for the first test case, n=2, m=2, numbers: 14, 2

Total digits: 2 + 1 = 3

m + 1 = 3

So, total digits == m + 1, Sasha wins.

Second test case: n=3, m=5, numbers: 9,56,1

Total digits: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

m + 1 = 6

4 < 6, Anna wins.

Third test case: n=4, m=10, numbers:1,2007,800,1580

Total digits:1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12

m + 1 = 11

12 >= 11, Sasha wins.

Wait, but according to the output, it's "Anna"

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, maybe the reference solution is not just comparing total digits to m + 1.

Wait, perhaps the presence of numbers with trailing zeros affects the total digit count that Anna can reduce.

Looking back at the reference solution:

- It calculates the total digits as the sum of the lengths of the numbers.

- It collects the number of trailing zeros for numbers that have trailing zeros.

- It sorts these trailing zeros in descending order.

- It subtracts every other trailing zero starting from the first one.

- Then, it checks if total digits minus subtracted zeros is >= m + 1.

So, in the third test case: n=4, m=10, numbers:1,2007,800,1580

Total digits:1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12

Numbers with trailing zeros: 800 (2 trailing zeros), 1580 (1 trailing zero)

So, zeros array: [2,1]

Sorted descending: [2,1]

Subtract every other: subtract 2 and then nothing more (since len(zeros)=2, and we subtract zeros[0]=2)

So, total digits - subtracted zeros = 12 - 2 = 10

m + 1 = 11

10 < 11, so Anna wins.

But according to the example output, it's "Anna", which matches.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says "Anna" for this case, which matches the condition 10 < 11.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought total digits is 12, which is >=11, so Sasha wins, but according to the example, it's "Anna".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the reference solution, it's subtracting every other trailing zero.

In this case, zeros=[2,1], sorted descending [2,1], subtract 2, no more subtraction since len(zeros)=2 and we subtract every other starting from the first.

So, total digits - subtracted zeros = 12 - 2 = 10

10 < 11, so Anna wins.

Yes, that matches the example output.

Wait, but why is it subtracting every other trailing zero?

I need to understand the strategy behind this.

I think it's because Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros, thereby reducing their digit count to 1, effectively removing the trailing zeros.

So, for each number with trailing zeros that Anna reverses, she reduces its digit count from its original length to 1.

Therefore, the reduction in digit count is (original length - 1).

So, for numbers with trailing zeros, Anna can reduce their digit count by (original length - 1).

Therefore, the potential reduction in digit count is the sum of (original length - 1) for each number with trailing zeros that Anna can choose to reverse.

But, since Anna and Sasha take turns, Anna can choose to reverse some of these numbers, and Sasha can try to minimize the impact.

In the reference solution, it seems to subtract every other (original length - 1) starting from the first one.

I think this is because Anna can choose to reverse every other number with trailing zeros in her turns, while Sasha tries to minimize the impact by perhaps concatenating numbers in a way that reduces Anna's options.

Therefore, by subtracting every other (original length - 1), it simulates Anna's ability to reduce the digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros in her turns.

Then, if the total digits minus this subtracted amount is still >= m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

This seems to be the logic.

Let me test this logic with another test case.

Take the fourth test case:

4 5

5000 123 30 4

Total digits: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10

m + 1 = 6

Numbers with trailing zeros: 5000 (3 trailing zeros), 30 (1 trailing zero)

zeros array: [3,1]

sorted descending: [3,1]

subtract every other: subtract 3 and then nothing more.

total digits - subtracted zeros = 10 - 3 = 7

7 >= 6, so Sasha wins.

According to the example output, it's "Sasha", which matches.

Another test case:

1 1

6

Total digits:1

m + 1 = 2

Since n=1, Anna reverses 6 to 6, which is still 1 digit.

1 < 2, so Anna wins.

According to the example output, it's "Anna", which matches.

Another test case:

1 1

10

Total digits:2

m + 1 = 2

2 >= 2, so Sasha wins.

According to the example output, it's "Anna", wait, no.

Wait, the seventh test case:

1 1

10

Total digits:2

m + 1 = 2

2 >= 2, so Sasha wins.

But according to the example output, it's "Anna".

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, the seventh test case in the example is:

1 1

10

Output: Anna

But according to the reference solution:

total digits:2

m + 1:2

subtract every other trailing zeros:

numbers with trailing zeros: 10 (1 trailing zero)

zeros array:[1]

sorted descending:[1]

subtract every other: subtract 1

total digits - subtracted zeros = 2 - 1 =1

1 < 2, so Anna wins.

Which matches the example output.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the reference solution seems to be correctly implementing this logic.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
