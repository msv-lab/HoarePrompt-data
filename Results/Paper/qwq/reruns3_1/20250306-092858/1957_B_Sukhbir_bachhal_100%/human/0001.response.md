Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I have to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3. The number of 1s in the binary representation of 3 is 2, which seems to be higher than either 1 or 2 alone.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the resulting number has as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I want as many bits to be set to 1 in the final OR result as possible. To achieve that, I need to have different numbers in the sequence that set different bits.

For example, if I have n=2 and k=3, I can choose [1,2]. Their sum is 3, and 1 OR 2 = 3, which has two 1s in binary. If I chose [0,3], the OR would be 3, which is the same. So, in this case, it's equally good.

But, if n=3 and k=3, I could choose [1,1,1]. Their sum is 3, and 1 OR 1 OR 1 = 1, which has only one 1 in binary. That's worse than [1,2,0], which sums to 3 and ORs to 3, with two 1s.

So, it seems that to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should try to have numbers that cover as many different bit positions as possible.

Wait, but k is given, and I have to sum to k with n numbers. So, I need to distribute k among n numbers such that their OR has as many 1s as possible.

Let me consider the extreme case where n=1. Then, I have only one number, which is k, and the number of 1s in its binary representation is fixed.

For n>1, I can try to split k into parts that set different bits.

But, k can be up to 1e9, which is 10^9, so I need to think in terms of 30-bit integers.

Wait, actually, in Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, but for this problem, since k can be up to 1e9, 30 bits should be sufficient.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of 1s in the OR.

The maximum number of 1s in a binary number is the number of bits in it. For k up to 1e9, the maximum number of bits is 30.

But, in practice, I might not be able to set all 30 bits to 1 because the sum has to be k.

Wait, but if I set multiple bits to 1 in different numbers, their OR could have more 1s than any single number.

Wait no, if I set different bits in different numbers, their OR will have those bits set.

Wait, no, if I have two numbers, one with bit i set and another with bit j set, their OR will have both bits i and j set.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should have as many different bits set across the numbers as possible.

So, the strategy is to distribute the bits across the numbers such that each bit is set in at least one number.

Wait, but I also need to make sure that the sum of all numbers is k.

So, I need to choose n numbers that sum to k, and their bitwise OR has as many 1s as possible.

I think the way to do this is to have one number that is as large as possible, covering as many bits as possible, and then distribute the remaining sum among the other numbers.

Wait, but that might not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, actually, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in at least one of the numbers as possible.

So, perhaps I should try to set the highest possible bits in one number, and then use the remaining numbers to set any additional bits needed.

Wait, maybe it's better to have one number that is close to k, but makes sure that as many high bits are set, and then use the remaining numbers to cover any missing bits.

This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the second test case, n=2 and k=3, they output [1,2], which sums to 3 and OR is 3, which has two 1s in binary.

In the fourth test case, n=6 and k=51, they output [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51 and OR is 63 (binary 111111), which has five 1s.

Wait, 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3 | 32 | 14 = 3
