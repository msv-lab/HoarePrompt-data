Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f (indexed from 1 to n). He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

The task is to determine, based on the given n, f, k, and the array a, whether the favorite cube will be removed for sure, not removed at all, or it's possible either way.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the largest values come first, and he removes the first k after sorting.

So, to determine if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see where it ends up after sorting.

The favorite cube has value a_f (remember, f is 1-based index).

In the sorted array, the positions are determined by the values.

If a_f is larger than some cubes, it will be placed before them in the sorted array.

Since he removes the first k after sorting, which are the top k largest values, if a_f is among these top k, it will be removed.

But there's a catch: when there are ties, the order is unspecified.

So, if a_f is equal to some other cubes, their relative order is unknown, which might affect whether it falls within the first k or not.

Hence, I need to consider the cases where a_f is strictly greater, strictly less, or equal to the k-th largest value.

Let me consider these cases one by one.

Case 1: a_f is strictly greater than the k-th largest value.

In this case, a_f would be among the top k, so it will always be removed, regardless of the order of equal values.

So, output should be "YES".

Case 2: a_f is strictly less than the k-th largest value.

In this case, a_f would be beyond the first k, so it will never be removed.

So, output should be "NO".

Case 3: a_f is equal to the k-th largest value.

Here, because there are ties, the relative order of cubes with the same value is unspecified.

So, it's possible that a_f could be among the first k, or not, depending on the order.

Hence, output should be "MAYBE".

Wait, but I need to be careful.

Let me think about an example.

Suppose n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3].

After sorting, it could be [4,3,3,3,2] or [4,3,3,2,3], etc., depending on how ties are broken.

If it's [4,3,3,3,2], removing the first 2: [4,3], so favorite cube (a_2=3) is removed if it's in position 2.

If it's [4,3,3,2,3], removing the first 2: [4,3], favorite cube is still removed if it's in position 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that in one case it's removed, in another it's not.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Let me look back.

In the problem description, for n=5, f=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], k=2, it says:

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], favorite in position 2, removed.

- After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], favorite in position 3, not removed.

Wait, but in both cases, it's removed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when there are ties, the favorite cube could end up in any position among those with the same value.

So, if there are multiple cubes with value x, the favorite cube could be in any of those positions after sorting.

Hence, if the k-th position has value x, and the favorite cube also has value x, then it depends on where exactly it ends up among the x's.

So, if there are m cubes with value x, and the k-th position is among these m cubes, then the favorite cube could be in any of these m positions.

Hence, some of these positions could be within the first k, others not.

Therefore, it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not, depending on its exact position among the ties.

Hence, the output should be "MAYBE".

But wait, in the sample input, there are cases where it's "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE".

So, my earlier thought seems correct.

Hence, I need to implement this logic.

Now, to do this efficiently, I need to:

1. Sort the array in non-increasing order.

2. Find the value at position k.

3. Compare it with a_f.

4. If a_f > a[k], then "YES".

5. If a_f < a[k], then "NO".

6. If a_f == a[k], then "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the case where a_f == a[k], I need to consider if it's possible for the favorite cube to be in the first k or not.

But, in the sorted array, if a_f == a[k], and there are multiple cubes with value a_f, then depending on their arrangement, the favorite cube could be in position k or beyond.

Hence, it's possible that it's removed or not, hence "MAYBE".

But, I need to make sure that there are multiple cubes with value a_f.

Wait, no. If a_f == a[k], and there are other cubes with value a_f, then it's "MAYBE".

But, if a_f == a[k], and there are no other cubes with value a_f, then it's definite that it's removed.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, no.

If a_f == a[k], and there are no other cubes with value a_f, then it must be in position k, and since he removes the first k, it's removed.

Hence, in this case, it's "YES".

But, if there are other cubes with the same value, then it's "MAYBE".

Hence, I need to count how many cubes have value a_f.

Then, find how many cubes have value greater than a_f.

If the number of cubes with value > a_f is >=k, then the favorite cube could be at position k or after, depending on the arrangement of equal values.

Wait, maybe I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Let me sort the array in non-increasing order.

Then, find the position where a_f would be placed.

Given that there can be ties, the exact position is uncertain within the group of cubes with the same value.

So, first, count how many cubes have value > a_f.

Let's say that number is c.

Then, the favorite cube's position will be somewhere from c+1 to c + number of cubes with value == a_f.

Because the cubes with value > a_f are before them, and those with value < a_f are after.

Within the cubes with value == a_f, their order is unspecified.

Hence, the favorite cube could be in any position from c+1 to c + m, where m is the count of cubes with value == a_f.

Now, if k <= c, then the first k cubes are those with value > a_f, so the favorite cube is not among them, hence "NO".

If c < k <= c + m, then the favorite cube could be in the removed cubes or not, depending on its exact position, hence "MAYBE".

If k > c + m, then the favorite cube could be in the removed cubes, hence "YES".

Wait, no.

Wait, let's clarify.

If k <= c, then the first k cubes are those with value > a_f, which are positions 1 to c.

Since the favorite cube has value a_f, which is less than or equal to these, it's not among the removed ones, hence "NO".

If k > c + m, meaning k is larger than c + m, then the favorite cube is among the first c + m cubes, which are removed, hence "YES".

Wait, no.

Wait, if k > c + m, then the first c + m cubes are those with value > a_f and those with value == a_f.

So, if k > c + m, then he removes c + m cubes, which include all cubes with value > a_f and all cubes with value == a_f.

Hence, the favorite cube is removed.

Wait, but in this case, if k > c + m, but in reality, n is the total number of cubes, so k cannot be larger than n.

Hence, if k > c + m, and k <= n, then the favorite cube is among the first c + m cubes, which are removed.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think again.

Total cubes: n.

Cubes with value > a_f: c.

Cubes with value == a_f: m.

Cubes with value < a_f: n - c - m.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the positions are:

- Positions 1 to c: cubes with value > a_f

- Positions c+1 to c+m: cubes with value == a_f

- Positions c+m+1 to n: cubes with value < a_f

Now, the favorite cube is among the m cubes with value == a_f, so its position is between c+1 and c+m.

If k <= c, then he removes only the first c cubes, which are those with value > a_f, so the favorite cube is not removed: "NO".

If k >= c+1 and k <= c+m, then he removes cubes from position 1 to k, which includes some cubes with value == a_f.

Since the favorite cube is in positions c+1 to c+m, it could be in the removed cubes if k >= position of the favorite cube.

But since the order among equal values is unspecified, the favorite cube could be in any position from c+1 to c+m.

Hence, if k >= c+1 and k <= c+m, it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not, depending on its exact position: "MAYBE".

If k >= c+m +1, meaning he removes cubes up to at least position c+m, then all cubes with value == a_f are removed, hence the favorite cube is always removed: "YES".

Wait, but if k >= c + m, then he removes the first c + m cubes, which include all cubes with value > a_f and all with value == a_f.

Hence, the favorite cube is always removed: "YES".

Wait, but in the earlier thought, I had k > c + m.

But k can be up to n, and c + m could be less than n.

Hence, if k >= c + 1, and c + m >= k, then it's "MAYBE".

Wait, I need to rephrase this.

Let me define:

- c: number of cubes with value > a_f

- m: number of cubes with value == a_f

- t: total cubes with value >= a_f, which is c + m

Then:

- If k <= c, then removed cubes have value > a_f, so favorite cube is not removed: "NO"

- If c < k <= c + m, then removed cubes include some with value == a_f, so it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not: "MAYBE"

- If k > c + m, then all cubes with value >= a_f are removed, so the favorite cube is always removed: "YES"

Wait, but in reality, k cannot be greater than n, but in the case where c + m < n, and k > c + m, then yes, all cubes with value >= a_f are removed.

Hence, "YES".

But in the case where c + m = n, and k >= c + 1, then it's "YES".

Wait, but need to make sure that k does not exceed n.

Hence, in code, need to handle k up to n.

I think this logic is correct.

Let me verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

a_f = 3 (since f=2, 1-based index)

Sort in non-increasing order: [4,3,3,3,2]

c = number of cubes with value > 3, which is 1 (only 4)

m = number of cubes with value == 3, which is 3

So, c = 1, m = 3

k = 2

Since c < k <= c + m (1 < 2 <= 4), it's "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample.

Sample Input 2:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

a_f = 5

Sort: [5,4,3,2,1]

c = number of cubes with value > 5, which is 0

m = number of cubes with value == 5, which is 1

k = 3

Since k > c + m (3 > 1), it's "YES"

Which matches the sample.

Sample Input 3:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

a_f = 3

Sort: [5,4,3,2,1]

c = number of cubes with value > 3, which is 2 (5 and 4)

m = number of cubes with value == 3, which is 1

k = 2

Since k <= c (2 <= 2), it's "NO"

Which matches the sample.

Okay, seems correct.

Hence, I need to implement this logic.

Now, in code, I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read array a of n integers

- Set a_f = a[f-1] (since f is 1-based)

- Count c: number of cubes with value > a_f

- Count m: number of cubes with value == a_f

- If k <= c: print "NO"

- Elif c < k <= c + m: print "MAYBE"

- Else: print "YES"

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to sort the array and then check a[k-1]

Let me look at the given code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems different from my approach.

In my approach, I count c and m, and based on that, decide "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE".

In the given code, it sorts the array in descending order, and then checks the value at position k.

If a[k] > x (a_f), then "NO"

If a[k] < x, then "YES"

If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, then "YES"

- Else, "MAYBE"

Wait, I need to understand this.

Let me think about what this code is doing.

After sorting in descending order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, then x is after k, so not removed: "NO"

If a[k] < x, then x is among the top k, so always removed: "YES"

If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1, meaning x is at the last position, which is the smallest.

- Or a[k-1] < x, meaning the value before k is less than x, so all x's are from k to some position.

- In this case, x is among the top k, so "YES"

- Else, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, I need to see if this aligns with my earlier logic.

In my logic:

- c: number of cubes with value > x

- m: number of cubes with value == x

- If k <= c: "NO"

- Elif c < k <= c + m: "MAYBE"

- Else: "YES"

In the given code:

- Sort a in descending order.

- If a[k] > x: "NO"

- Elif a[k] < x: "YES"

- Else:

- If k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x: "YES"

- Else: "MAYBE"

I need to see if this achieves the same result as my logic.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], x=3

After sorting: [4,3,3,3,2]

a[k] = a[1] = 3 (0-based index)

a[k] == x

Now, k == n-1? 1 == 4? No.

a[k-1] = a[0] = 4 > 3, so not a[k-1] < x.

Hence, "MAYBE"

Which matches my earlier thought.

Another example: n=5, f=5, k=3, a=[4,2,1,3,5], x=5

Sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[2] = 3 < 5, so "YES"

Which is correct.

Another example: n=5, f=5, k=2, a=[5,2,4,1,3], x=3

Sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

a[k] = a[1] = 4 > 3, so "NO"

Which is correct.

Another case: n=5, f=3, k=1, a=[3,3,3,3,3], x=3

Sorting: [3,3,3,3,3]

a[k] = a[0] = 3 == x

k == n-1? 0 == 4? No.

a[k-1] = a[-1], which is out of bounds.

Wait, k-1 = -1, which is the last element, a[4] = 3 == x, so not a[k-1] < x.

Hence, "MAYBE"

But in reality, since all cubes have the same value, the favorite cube could be in any position from 1 to 5.

If k=1, he removes the first cube, which could be the favorite cube or not, depending on the arrangement.

Hence, "MAYBE" is correct.

Another case: n=3, f=2, k=2, a=[1,2,3], x=2

Sorting: [3,2,1]

a[k] = a[1] = 2 == x

k == n-1? 1 == 2? No.

a[k-1] = a[0] = 3 > 2, so not a[k-1] < x.

Hence, "MAYBE"

But in this case, after sorting, the favorite cube is in position 2, which is removed.

Hence, "YES"

Wait, but according to the code, it's "MAYBE"

Is this incorrect?

Wait, no.

In this specific case, since a[k-1] = 3 > 2, which is not less than x, so it prints "MAYBE"

But actually, the favorite cube is in position 2, which is removed.

But according to the code, it's "MAYBE"

Is this a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

In this case, all cubes have unique values except for possible duplicates.

But in this example, all values are distinct, so m=1 for x=2.

c=1 (only 3 > 2)

k=2

c < k <= c + m (1 < 2 <= 2), so "MAYBE"

But in reality, since all cubes have unique values, m=1, and k=2, c=1, c < k <= c + m, so "MAYBE"

But in reality, the favorite cube is in position 2, which is removed.

But according to the logic, since there are no other cubes with value 2, it should be "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

In the code, when a[k] == x, and k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, then "YES"

Else, "MAYBE"

In this case, a[k-1] = 3 > 2, so not a[k-1] < x, hence "MAYBE"

But according to my earlier logic, it should be "YES"

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect in this scenario.

Wait, maybe I need to think again.

In the case where a[k] == x, and there are no other cubes with value x above k, then it's "YES"

But in the code, it checks if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x.

In the example above, a[k-1] = 3 > 2, so it's "MAYBE"

But it should be "YES"

Hence, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed when he arranges his cubes in non-increasing order and removes the first k cubes. The challenge lies in handling ties since cubes with the same value can be in any order relative to each other after sorting.

### Approach

1. **Read Inputs:** For each test case, read the number of cubes (n), the index of the favorite cube (f), the number of cubes to remove (k), and the values on the cubes (
