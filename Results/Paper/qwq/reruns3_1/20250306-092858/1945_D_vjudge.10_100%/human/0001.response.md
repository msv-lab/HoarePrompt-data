Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n. But he's not happy about being at the end; he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people ahead of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with someone at position j (where j < i), he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j. Additionally, for everyone between j and i (excluding j and i), he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Kirill starts at position n, and he wants to be in one of the positions from 1 to m. He can perform swaps with people ahead of him (people with smaller positions) by paying certain amounts as specified.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired position.

Let me think about this step by step.

1. **Understanding the Swap Operation:**

   - When Kirill is at position i, he can choose any j < i and swap places with the person at position j.

   - The cost for this swap is a_j plus the sum of b_k for all k between j and i (exclusive).

   - This operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Objective:**

   - Minimize the total cost such that Kirill's final position is between 1 and m inclusive.

3. **Constraints:**

   - 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000

   - 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9

   - Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2×10^5

Given the constraints, an efficient algorithm is necessary since n can be up to 200,000 and there are up to 10,000 test cases.

4. **Approach:**

   - I need to find a way to model the problem that allows efficient computation.

   - One way to think about this is to consider the cost of moving Kirill from position n to some position between 1 and m.

   - Each swap operation has a cost associated with it, involving a_j and the sum of b_k between j and i.

   - I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

5. **Simplifying the Problem:**

   - Let's consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps to reach his desired position.

   - Each swap has a cost, and I need to minimize the sum of these costs.

   - Perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges representing the cost to swap between positions.

   - But with n up to 200,000, building a graph with edges between all possible pairs isn't feasible due to time and space constraints.

6. **Alternative Approach:**

   - Maybe I can think of this problem in terms of cumulative costs.

   - Starting from position n, Kirill can swap with position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

   - I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.

7. **Dynamic Programming Idea:**

   - Let's consider dp[i], which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to be at position i.

   - Initially, dp[n] = 0 because he starts there without paying any cost.

   - For each position i from n-1 down to 1, dp[i] = min over all j from 1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1).

   - But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=200,000.

8. **Optimizing the DP Approach:**

   - I need a way to compute dp[i] efficiently, perhaps in O(n log n) time.

   - Let's see if I can find a way to compute dp[i] using prefix sums or some other efficient method.

9. **Observation:**

   - The cost to swap from position j to i is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

   - So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum from j+1 to i-1 of b_k).

   - This can be rewritten as dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

   - Here, prefix_b[k] is the prefix sum of b from 1 to k.

10. **Rewriting dp[i]:**

    - dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i-1]

    - Notice that prefix_b[i-1] is independent of j, so it can be added after finding the min value.

    - Therefore, dp[i] = min_val + prefix_b[i-1], where min_val is the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) for j < i.

11. **Efficient Computation:**

    - To compute dp[i], I need to keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) for j < i.

    - I can maintain a variable that keeps track of this minimum value as I iterate from i = 1 to n.

    - I need to handle the prefix sums efficiently.

12. **Algorithm Steps:**

    a. Compute prefix sums of b: prefix_b[i] = b[1] + b[2] + ... + b[i]

    b. Initialize dp[n] = 0

    c. Initialize min_val = dp[n] + a[n] - prefix_b[n]

    d. For i from n-1 down to 1:

        - dp[i] = min_val + prefix_b[i-1]

        - Update min_val = min(min_val, dp[i] + a[i] - prefix_b[i])

    e. Find the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m

13. **Edge Cases:**

    - n = m = 1: Kirill is already at the only position, so cost is 0.

    - n = 2, m = 1: Kirill can swap with the first person paying a_1 plus b_1 if n=2.

14. **Implementation Considerations:**

    - Need to handle prefix sums correctly, considering the indices.

    - Ensure that the minimum is taken only over j < i.

    - Handle cases where m = n, meaning Kirill can stay at his position.

15. **Optimization:**

    - Since n can be up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000, need an efficient implementation.

    - Using prefix sums and a running minimum should suffice.

16. **Final Solution Code:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill has to spend to move from the end of the queue to among the first m positions. We achieve this through an efficient algorithm that utilizes prefix sums and dynamic programming principles.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Kirill starts at position `n` and wants to be within the first `m` positions.
   - He can swap with anyone ahead of him, incurring costs based on the values `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Insight**:
   - The cost to swap from position `j` to `i` is `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for `k` between `j+1` and `i-1`.
   - We can model this using prefix sums for efficient computation of range sums.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute prefix sums of the `b` array.
   - Use dynamic programming to track the minimum cost to reach each position.
   - Maintain a running minimum of a specific expression to avoid recomputation.

4. **Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) per test case due to linear traversal.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for storing prefix sums and DP values.

    idx += 1
    for _ in range(numCasos):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        b = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n

def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    if m == n:
        print(0)
        return
    # Compute prefix sums of b
    prefix_b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i - 1] + b[i - 1]
    
    # Initialize dp for position n
    dp_n = 0
    min_val = dp_n + a[n - 1] - prefix_b[n]
    
    # Iterate from n-1 down to 1
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Calculate dp[i]
        dp_i = min_val + prefix_b[i - 1] if i - 1 >= 0 else min_val
        # Update pergunta if i <= m
        if i <= m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, dp_i)
        # Update min_val
        min_val = min(min_val, dp_i + a[i - 1] - prefix_b[i])
    
    print(pergunta)

- **Dynamic Programming**: We maintain a DP array implicitly using a variable to track the minimum cost to reach each position, avoiding the need for an explicit DP array.
- **Running Minimum**: We keep track of the minimum value needed to compute the DP values efficiently, ensuring that each position is considered only once.
- **Final Output**: For each test case, we output the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` positions in the queue.

This approach ensures that we handle large inputs efficiently while providing the correct minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired position in the queue.
