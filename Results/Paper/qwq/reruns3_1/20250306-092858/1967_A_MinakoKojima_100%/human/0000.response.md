Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a certain number of each type of card, given by a_i for each i from 1 to n. Then, I can buy up to k new cards, and I can choose any numbers from 1 to n for these new cards. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. Essentially, I need to maximize the number of n-length slices of the array that contain each number from 1 to n exactly once.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray of length n a permutation of [1,2,...,n]. Each number from 1 to n must appear exactly once in that subarray. So, in the entire array, I'm looking for windows of size n where all numbers from 1 to n are present, each exactly once.

Now, I need to think about how to arrange my cards, including the new ones I can buy, to maximize the number of such windows.

Let me consider the constraints and what I can do:

- I can buy up to k new cards, each with any number from 1 to n.

- I need to arrange all cards in a single line.

- The score is the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I need to maximize this score.

I need to think about how the arrangement affects the number of good windows.

One approach is to arrange the cards in such a way that the number of times all numbers from 1 to n appear in every n-length window is maximized.

This sounds similar to creating a sequence where the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible, ensuring that in every window of size n, each number appears exactly once.

But this is tricky because I have to deal with the counts of each number I have, including the new ones I can buy.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have an ideal situation where I can have exactly one of each number in every n-length window. That would mean that the sequence is a repetition of the same permutation of [1,2,...,n].

For example, if n=2, and I have enough cards, I can make a sequence like [1,2,1,2,1,2,...]. In this case, every window of size 2 is [1,2] or [2,1], both of which are permutations of [1,2].

So, in this case, the number of good windows is the total length minus n plus one, provided the sequence is perfectly arranged.

But I have to consider the counts of each number I have, including the new cards I can buy.

Let me define:

- Initial counts: a_i for each i from 1 to n.

- Additional cards I can buy: up to k cards, each with any number from 1 to n.

So, the total number of cards I will have is sum(a_i) + k.

The total number of possible windows in the final array will be (sum(a_i) + k - n + 1).

But not all of these windows will necessarily be permutations of [1,2,...,n]. I need to maximize the number of such windows.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of good windows.

One key insight might be that the maximum number of good windows is limited by the number of times I can place a complete set of [1,2,...,n] in the sequence.

But I need to consider overlaps and how the counts of each number constrain the arrangement.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of the minimum count of any number, as that could limit the number of complete sets I can form.

Wait, but it's not just the minimum count, because I can buy additional cards.

Let me consider the initial counts a_i, and the possibility of buying up to k additional cards.

I need to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of times I can place a complete set of [1,2,...,n] in the sequence.

Each complete set requires one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the maximum number of complete sets I can form is limited by the smallest count among a_i, considering I can buy additional cards.

Wait, but I can buy any number of any card up to k.

So, I can increase any a_i by buying more cards.

I need to allocate the k buys to the a_i in a way that maximizes the number of complete sets.

This sounds like I need to balance the a_i such that no a_i is too much lower than the others, but I think the key is to focus on making as many a_i as high as possible, considering the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the minimal a_i, and see how much I can increase it by allocating k buys appropriately.

Let me sort the a_i in ascending order.

Let's say a_sorted = sorted(a).

Then, a_sorted[0] is the smallest count.

I can try to make all a_i at least a_sorted[0], but I might have to buy more to make them equal.

Wait, but I can buy up to k cards in total.

I need to find a way to allocate the k buys to maximize the number of complete sets.

Maybe I can think of it as making as many a_i as possible equal to some value x, and the remaining a_i higher than x.

But I need to think about how this affects the number of good windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of sliding windows.

In a sliding window of size n, I need each number from 1 to n to appear exactly once.

So, if I arrange the sequence in a way that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n], I can maximize the number of good windows.

For example, if n=2, and I have a lot of cards, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,1,2,...] would give me a good window at every position.

But I have to consider the counts I have.

Let me formalize this.

Letâ€™s say I have c_i = a_i + b_i, where b_i is the number of additional cards I buy for number i, with sum(b_i) <= k.

I need to arrange the sequence of c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n cards.

I need to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I think the way to maximize this is to arrange the sequence in a repeating pattern of a permutation of [1,2,...,n], as much as possible, given the counts.

So, the maximum number of complete sets I can form is floor(min(c_i) / 1), since each set requires one of each number.

Wait, more precisely, it's floor(min(c_i)), because each set takes one of each.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have c_i cards of number i, I can participate in c_i different sets, but I need to arrange them in a way that maximizes the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for the minimum among c_i, and that will limit the number of complete sets.

But actually, the number of complete sets I can form is limited by the smallest c_i, because each set requires one of each number.

So, the maximum number of complete sets is floor(min(c_i)).

But wait, c_i = a_i + b_i, and sum(b_i) <= k.

So, I need to choose b_i such that sum(b_i) <= k, and maximize floor(min(c_i)).

This is a classic problem where I need to maximize the minimum value among c_i, given that sum(b_i) <= k.

I know that to maximize the minimum value, I can use a binary search on the minimum value, and check if the required number of buys to reach that minimum is <= k.

So, I can perform a binary search on x, the minimum number of cards for each i, and find the maximum x such that sum(max(x - a_i, 0)) <= k.

This will give me the maximum x where x <= a_i + floor(k / n).

Wait, not exactly.

Actually, in the standard problem, maximizing the min, I can binary search x, and set b_i = x - a_i if x > a_i, else 0, and sum(b_i) <= k.

Find the max x where this sum <= k.

Once I have this x, then the maximum number of complete sets is x, because each set requires one of each number, and I have at least x of each number after buying.

Then, in the sequence, I can arrange these x complete sets in a repeating pattern, like [1,2,...,n,1,2,...,n,...], up to x times, and then arrange the remaining cards.

In this arrangement, each block of [1,2,...,n] is a good window, and there are x such blocks.

Additionally, there might be overlapping windows if the remaining cards are arranged properly.

Wait, but in this arrangement, each block is [1,2,...,n], and the windows would be:

positions 1 to n: [1,2,...,n] -> good

positions 2 to n+1: [2,3,...,n+1] -> if n+1 is 1, it might be good or not.

Wait, in this arrangement, if I arrange the sequence as [1,2,...,n,1,2,...,n,...], then every window of size n is [i, i+1, ..., i+n-1], modulo n.

Wait, no, if I repeat [1,2,...,n], then windows would be:

[1,2,...,n] -> good

[2,3,...,n+1] where n+1 is 1 -> [2,3,...,n,1] -> which is a permutation of [1,2,...,n]

[3,4,...,n+2] where n+2 is 2 -> [3,4,...,n,1,2] -> not necessarily a permutation.

Wait, no, in the repeating sequence [1,2,...,n,1,2,...,n,...], each window of size n overlaps with the previous one by n-1 elements.

But in this specific arrangement, it's not clear how many windows would be good permutations.

Actually, in the repeating sequence [1,2,...,n,1,2,...,n,...], every window of size n is a rotation of [1,2,...,n], which is still a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

So, in this arrangement, every window of size n is a good permutation.

Therefore, the number of good windows is total length - n + 1, where total length is x * n + remaining cards arranged appropriately.

Wait, but I need to consider the remaining cards after arranging x complete blocks.

Let me think again.

If I have x complete sets, I can arrange them in a sequence of x * n cards, arranged in blocks of [1,2,...,n], repeated x times.

In this arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], because it's a shift of the previous block.

Therefore, the number of good windows in this part is (x * n - n + 1).

But actually, in this arrangement, the number of windows is (x * n - n + 1).

Wait, no, the number of windows of size n in a sequence of length l is l - n + 1.

So, for x * n cards, the number of windows is x * n - n + 1.

But in this arrangement, each window is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], so all x * n - n + 1 windows are good.

But I can have more cards beyond x * n, depending on the remaining cards.

So, after arranging x complete blocks of [1,2,...,n], I can arrange the remaining cards in a way that maximizes the number of good windows involving the remaining cards.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of good windows is (total length - n + 1), where total length is sum(c_i) = sum(a_i) + k.

But this is only achievable if the entire sequence is arranged in a way that every window of size n is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

But this is only possible if c_i >= floor((sum(c_i) - n + 1)/n) + 1 for each i.

This seems too involved.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look back at the initial approach.

I need to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of times I can place a complete set of [1,2,...,n] in the sequence.

Each complete set requires one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the maximum number of complete sets is limited by the smallest c_i, which is a_i + b_i, where sum(b_i) <= k.

So, I need to maximize min(a_i + b_i) subject to sum(b_i) <= k.

This is the standard problem of maximizing the minimum value after distributing k units among n elements.

I can solve this by binary searching on x, the minimum value, and checking if sum(max(x - a_i, 0)) <= k.

Once I find the maximum x, then the number of complete sets is x, and the number of good windows is x * (n - 1) + 1, assuming a perfect arrangement.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a sequence of x * n cards arranged in blocks of [1,2,...,n], repeated x times, the number of good windows is x * n - n + 1.

Wait, for example, if n=2 and x=3, sequence is [1,2,1,2,1,2], the good windows are:

[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2]

So, 5 good windows, which is 3*2 - 2 + 1 = 5.

Generalizing, for x blocks, total good windows are x * n - n + 1.

So, in general, it's (x * n - n + 1).

But I need to consider if I have remaining cards after arranging x complete blocks.

Suppose I have x complete blocks and r additional cards, where r is the remaining cards after allocating x * n cards.

Then, I need to arrange these r additional cards after the x blocks.

The additional windows involving these r cards need to be considered.

This seems complicated to calculate precisely.

Maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can use.

Let me look at the example in the problem.

In the first test case:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

So, initial cards: one card with 1.

We can buy 10 more cards, each with 1.

So, total cards: 11 ones.

The only possible array is [1,1,1,...,1] (11 times).

The number of subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1] is 11.

So, the answer is 11.

This matches the output.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

So, 8 ones and 4 twos.

We can buy 4 more cards, any numbers from 1 to 2.

To maximize the number of [1,2] or [2,1] windows.

One optimal arrangement is [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

Here, there are 8 [1,2] and 7 [2,1], totaling 15.

Indeed, the output is 15.

Looking at this arrangement, it's a repetition of [1,2], eight times, and then continue with [1,2] until all cards are used.

Wait, but with a=[8,4], and k=4, I can buy 4 more cards, say all twos, making it 8 ones and 8 twos.

Then, I can arrange them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2,1,2], which is 8 pairs of [1,2], and 7 overlapping [2,1], totaling 15.

Alternatively, if I buy all ones, I get 12 ones and 4 twos, which might not be as good.

So, distributing the buys to balance the counts is key.

Hence, the initial approach of maximizing the minimum count seems valid.

So, to generalize:

- Find the maximum x such that sum(max(x - a_i, 0)) <= k.

- Then, the number of complete blocks is x.

- The number of good windows is x * n - n + 1.

- Additionally, if there are remaining cards after arranging x complete blocks, I need to account for additional good windows.

But in the second test case, with x=4 (since min(a_i + b_i)=4, with b_i=0 for twos and b_i=4 for ones, but actually, we can set a_i + b_i=8 for both, but k=4, so not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in the second test case, a=[8,4], k=4.

To make both a_i at least x=8, I need to set b_2=4, since a_2 + b_2 >=8, and a_1 + b_1 >=8 with b_1=0.

So, sum(b_i)=4, which is within k=4.

Thus, x=8.

Then, the number of good windows is 8*2 -2 +1=15, which matches the example.

So, perhaps the formula is ans = x * n - n +1.

But let's check the third test case.

n=3, k=4

a=[6,1,8]

We need to find x such that sum(max(x - a_i,0)) <=4.

So, for x=7:

max(7-6,0)=1

max(7-1,0)=6

max(7-8,0)=0

Total buys=1+6+0=7 >4, so x=7 is not possible.

x=6:

1 + 5 + 0 =6 >4

x=5:

1 + 4 +0=5 >4

x=4:

1 +3 +0=4 <=4

So, x=4.

Then, ans=4*3 -3 +1=10.

But the output in the sample is 15.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, in the second test case, x=8, n=2, formula gives 8*2 -2 +1=15, which matches.

In the third test case, x=4, n=3, formula gives 4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is 15.

So, my formula is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to calculate the number of good windows.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have x complete sets, each contributing n -1 overlapping good windows.

Wait, in a sequence of x * n cards arranged in blocks of [1,2,...,n], repeated x times, the number of good windows is x * n - n +1.

Wait, in the second test case, x=8, n=2, so 8*2 -2 +1=15, which matches.

In the third test case, x=4, n=3, so 4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is 15.

So, perhaps there are additional good windows from the remaining cards.

Wait, in the third test case, a=[6,1,8], k=4.

We can set x=4, meaning we need to buy b_2=4-1=3, since a_2=1, need to make it 4.

But sum(b_i)=3 <=4.

Then, we have c_1=6, c_2=4, c_3=8.

But according to the formula, ans=4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is 15.

So, perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Let me consider that after arranging x complete blocks, I might have remaining cards.

In the third test case, x=4, so 4 blocks of [1,2,3], giving a sequence of length 12.

Number of good windows:12 -3 +1=10.

But the sample output is 15, which is higher.

So, perhaps there are more good windows if I have extra cards.

Wait, but in the third test case, c_1=6, c_2=4, c_3=8.

After using 4 of each for the blocks, I have remaining c_1=2, c_2=0, c_3=4.

I can't form complete sets with the remaining cards, since c_2=0.

So, perhaps the formula is ans = x * (n -1) +1 + something else.

Wait, perhaps it's ans = x * (n -1) + min(c_i for i in remaining cards).

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps the number of good windows is x * (n -1) +1, but in the second test case, x=8, n=2, so 8*1 +1=9, which is less than the sample output of15.

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's x * n - n +1.

Wait, in the second test case, 8*2 -2 +1=15, which matches.

In the third test case, 4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is15.

So, perhaps there are more good windows from overlapping or from the remaining cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to add the number of good windows from the remaining cards.

But in the third test case, after arranging 4 blocks of [1,2,3], I have remaining c_1=2, c_3=4.

But since c_2=0 remaining, I can't form any more complete sets.

So, perhaps the formula is ans = x * n - n +1 + min(c_i -x for c_i >x).

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me look for a general formula.

Suppose I have x = floor(min(c_i)), where c_i = a_i + b_i, and sum(b_i)<=k.

Then, the number of good windows is x * (n -1) +1.

But this doesn't match the sample inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ans = x * (n -1) + (sum(c_i) - x *n +1).

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the whole length.

Total length is sum(c_i), which is sum(a_i) +k.

Number of possible windows is sum(c_i) -n +1.

But not all of them are good windows.

I need to maximize the number of good windows, which are those where each window contains exactly one of each number from1 to n.

This sounds like a scheduling problem, where I need to arrange the cards such that in every window of size n, each number appears exactly once.

This is similar to arranging tiles with constraints.

This seems quite complex.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the minimal counts.

Let me sort a_i in ascending order.

a_sorted = sorted(a)

Then, to make as many complete sets as possible, I need to make sure that the smallest a_i is as large as possible.

So, I can iterate through a_sorted, and for each position i, calculate how much I need to increase a_sorted[i] to match a_sorted[j], for j from i to n-1.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of prefix sums.

Wait, maybe I can use the idea from the problem of making all elements equal with minimum cost.

But I need to maximize the minimum value, given a budget of k buys.

Wait, perhaps I can use a binary search to find the maximum x such that sum(max(x - a_i, 0)) <=k.

Then, with this x, the number of good windows is x *n -n +1.

But in the third test case, this gives x=4, n=3, so 4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is15.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of good windows is x * (n -1) +1.

But in the second test case, x=8, n=2, 8*1 +1=9, which is less than15.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps it's x *n -n +1 + some adjustment for remaining cards.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Suppose I have x = floor(min(c_i)), where c_i = a_i + b_i, and sum(b_i)<=k.

Then, I can arrange x complete blocks of [1,2,...,n], which gives me x*n cards, and the number of good windows in these blocks is x*n -n +1.

Then, I have remaining cards c_i -x for each i.

I can append these remaining cards at the end.

In this arrangement, the number of good windows is x*n -n +1.

But in the third test case, x=4, n=3, so 4*3 -3 +1=10, but sample output is15.

So, perhaps there are additional good windows from the remaining cards.

Wait, in the third test case, after arranging 4 blocks of [1,2,3], I have remaining c_i -x = [6-4=2,1-4=-3,8-4=4].

Wait, c_2 -x=1-4=-3, which is invalid, meaning I can't have negative remaining cards.

This suggests that x cannot be 4, because a_2=1, and I can't have c_2=1 >=4.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated x.

Wait, in the third test case, a=[6,1,8], k=4.

To find x, I need to find the maximum x such that sum(max(x - a_i,0)) <=4.

For x=5:

max(5-6,0)=0

max(5-1,0)=4

max(5-8,0)=0

Total buys=4, which is <=4.

So, x=5.

Then, the number of good windows is 5*3 -3 +1=13, which is still not matching the sample output of15.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output is15 for n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8].

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the number of good windows is x*(n-1) + (sum(c_i) - x*n +1).

Wait, with x=5, c_i=[6,1,8], sum(c_i)=15, n=3.

Then, x*n -n +1=5*3 -3 +1=13, which is still less than15.

So, perhaps there are 2 additional good windows from the remaining cards.

Wait, c_i -x=[6-5=1,1-5=-4,8-5=3].

Again, negative remaining cards don't make sense.

This suggests that x=5 is not achievable, because I can't have c_2=1 >=5.

So, perhaps x=4 is the maximum possible.

For x=4:

sum(max(4-6,0)=0 + max(4-1,0)=3 + max(4-8,0)=0)=3 <=4.

So, x=4
