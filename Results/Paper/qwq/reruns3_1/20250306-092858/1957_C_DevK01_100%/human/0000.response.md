Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column.

I start first by placing a white rook at some position (r, c). Then the computer mirrors my move by placing a black rook at (c, r), unless r equals c, in which case it skips its turn. This has already happened k times, and I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward, considering all possible valid moves until no more moves can be made.

The answer needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7 because the numbers can get really big.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

1. **Placing Rooks:**

- I place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.

- My moves are at (r, c), and the computer mirrors at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips.

- We have to ensure that no two rooks are in the same row or column.

2. **Initial State:**

- After k moves, there are k white rooks and possibly k black rooks on the board, depending on whether any moves were skipped by the computer.

- It's guaranteed that all these moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Objective:**

- Determine the number of distinct final configurations possible from this state, where no more moves can be made.

- Two configurations are different if there's at least one position with different rooks or different colors.

Given that, I need to model the game and find a way to count the possible configurations.

**Approach:**

I need to find a way to count the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the mirroring rule.

Let me think about the state of the board after k moves.

- Let’s consider the rows and columns as separate sets.

- Each rook placed occupies a row and a column.

- The mirroring means that if I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), unless r == c.

So, for positions where r != c, both (r, c) and (c, r) are occupied.

For positions where r == c, only (r, c) is occupied.

Given that, I need to consider the remaining available rows and columns after accounting for the placed rooks.

Wait, but it's more nuanced because of the mirroring.

Let me try to model this.

**Modeling the Board:**

Imagine that the board can be represented in terms of rows and columns that are occupied.

- Let’s define two sets: rows_used and cols_used.

- Initially, both are empty.

- For each of my moves:

- Place a white rook at (r, c):

- Add r to rows_used

- Add c to cols_used

- Computer places a black rook at (c, r):

- Add c to rows_used

- Add r to cols_used

- Unless r == c, in which case only I place the rook at (r, c):

- Add r to rows_used

- Add c to cols_used

Wait, but in this case, since r == c, only one rook is placed, at (r, c).

So, rows_used and cols_used both have r added.

But, in terms of available spots, I need to consider that some rows and columns are now occupied.

But, because of the mirroring, when r != c, both rows r and c are occupied, and both columns r and c are occupied.

Wait, no.

Actually, when I place a rook at (r, c):

- Row r is occupied for white.

- Column c is occupied for white.

- Computer places a rook at (c, r):

- Row c is occupied for black.

- Column r is occupied for black.

Unless r == c, in which case only I place at (r, c):

- Row r is occupied for white.

- Column c is occupied for white.

Wait, but in this problem, rooks of different colors still cannot attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row or column.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

"Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

So, even if they are different colors, they still attack each other if they share the same row or column.

Wait, but in standard chess, rooks of different colors can be in the same row or column, but in this problem, it seems that any two rooks, regardless of color, cannot share the same row or column.

Wait, but the problem says:

"Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

Wait, but in standard chess, rooks of opposite colors can be in the same row or column without attacking each other, but here, it's specified that regardless of color, if two rooks share the same row or column, they attack each other.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"while placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

Wait, but in the example, it seems that rooks of different colors cannot be in the same row or column.

Wait, but in standard chess, rooks of different colors can be in the same row or column.

But according to the problem, "two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

So, in this problem, even rooks of different colors cannot be in the same row or column.

Wait, but in the mirroring move, when I place at (r, c), and the computer places at (c, r), these two rooks are in the same row and column if r == c, but according to the problem, they are allowed, because it's only when r != c that the computer places at (c, r), potentially causing conflicts.

Wait, no.

Wait, when r != c, the computer places at (c, r), which is in a different row and column from my move at (r, c).

So, in that case, since r != c, the computer's move at (c, r) is in a different row and column from my move at (r, c).

So, they don't attack each other.

But, if r == c, then the computer doesn't place a rook, so only one rook is placed in that row and column.

So, in that case, only one rook is placed, at (r, c).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"the computer can't mirror your move, and skips its turn."

So, when r == c, only I place a rook, and the computer skips its turn.

So, in that case, only one rook is placed in that row and column.

Wait, but in terms of available spots, I need to make sure that no two rooks share the same row or column, regardless of color.

So, the problem reduces to placing rooks such that no two rooks share the same row or column, considering the moves already made.

Given that, I need to find the number of ways to complete the game from the current state.

Let me think about this differently.

**Permutations and Derangements:**

Placing rooks such that no two share the same row or column is similar to placing non-attacking rooks, which is equivalent to permutations.

In standard chess, placing non-attacking rooks corresponds to permutations of rows to columns.

But here, since we have some moves already made, it's like having some positions already filled in the permutation.

Moreover, since the computer mirrors my moves when r != c, I need to account for that.

Wait, but in the mirroring, when I place at (r, c), the computer places at (c, r), which is like transposing the position.

So, in terms of permutations, it's like applying the permutation and its transpose.

But I need to think carefully.

**Graph Theory Approach:**

I can model this as a bipartite graph where one set represents rows and the other set represents columns.

Edges represent possible placements of rooks.

But this might be too time-consuming to think about for large n.

**Simplifying the Problem:**

Given that the problem involves placing rooks such that no two share the same row or column, and considering the mirroring, perhaps I can think in terms of available rows and columns that are still free.

Let me consider that after k moves, some rows and columns are occupied.

I need to calculate how many rows and columns are still available for placing more rooks.

Given that, the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining grid without any two attacking each other is equal to the number of permutations of the remaining rows to columns, which is the number of ways to arrange non-attacking rooks.

But in this problem, it's more complex because of the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of free rows and columns.

Let me try to calculate how many rows and columns are still available after the k moves.

For each of my moves:

- If r != c:

- Both rows r and c are occupied.

- Both columns r and c are occupied.

- Because the computer mirrors the move.

- If r == c:

- Only row r and column c are occupied.

Because the computer skips its turn.

Wait, but in this case, since r == c, only one rook is placed at (r, c), occupying row r and column c.

So, for r != c:

- Rows r and c are occupied.

- Columns r and c are occupied.

For r == c:

- Row r is occupied.

- Column c is occupied.

But since r == c, it's the same row and column.

So, in this case, only one row and one column are occupied.

Wait, but in terms of counting, I need to be careful not to double-count.

Let me try to compute the number of rows and columns that are still available.

Let’s define:

- rows_used: set of rows that are occupied.

- cols_used: set of columns that are occupied.

Initially, both are empty.

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c:

- Add r and c to rows_used.

- Add r and c to cols_used.

- Computer places at (c, r):

- Add c and r to rows_used.

- Add r and c to cols_used.

- But since r != c, this is the same as above.

- If r == c:

- Add r to rows_used.

- Add c to cols_used.

- Computer skips.

So, in the case where r != c:

- rows_used adds r and c.

- cols_used adds r and c.

In the case where r == c:

- rows_used adds r.

- cols_used adds c (which is r).

So, in this case, only one row and one column are added to the used sets.

Wait, but since r == c, it's the same row and column.

Wait, but in terms of sets, adding r to rows_used and c to cols_used, but since r == c, it's the same index.

But in terms of the board, rows and columns are separate, even if r == c.

Wait, no, the rows and columns are distinct dimensions.

Wait, in a chessboard, rows are labeled differently from columns, but in this problem, they are indexed the same way, from 1 to n.

But logically, rows and columns are separate.

So, if I place a rook at (r, c), it occupies row r and column c.

If the computer places at (c, r), it occupies row c and column r.

So, in terms of sets:

- rows_used = set of all r and c where r != c (both rows r and c are occupied), and only r when r == c.

- Similarly for cols_used.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the union of rows and columns occupied by the rooks placed.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the set of rows occupied by any rook (either white or black), and similarly for columns.

Given that, for each move:

- If r != c:

- rows_used.add(r)

- rows_used.add(c)

- cols_used.add(r)

- cols_used.add(c)

- Because the computer places at (c, r), which occupies row c and column r.

- If r == c:

- rows_used.add(r)

- cols_used.add(c) # which is r

- Computer skips.

So, in this way, I can keep track of the rows and columns that are occupied.

Then, the number of rows still available is n - len(rows_used).

Similarly, the number of columns still available is n - len(cols_used).

But, in terms of placing more rooks, I need to place them in the remaining rows and columns, ensuring that no two rooks share the same row or column.

This is similar to placing non-attacking rooks, which is equivalent to choosing a permutation of the remaining rows to the remaining columns.

The number of ways to place m non-attacking rooks on an m x m chessboard is m!.

But in this problem, I need to consider the mirroring rule for future moves.

Wait, but for the remaining moves, the same mirroring rule applies.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively: after accounting for the initial k moves, the remaining game can be modeled as a smaller chessboard with the remaining rows and columns.

But I need to be careful with the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairs of moves: my move and the computer's mirror move.

Given that, for each pair, two rooks are placed, unless r == c, in which case only one rook is placed.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of remaining pairs I can place.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking at the example:

n = 4, k = 1, with move (1,2)

After my move at (1,2), the computer moves at (2,1).

So, rows_used = {1,2}, cols_used = {1,2}.

Remaining rows: 3,4

Remaining columns: 3,4

So, the remaining board is 2x2.

In this 2x2 board, I need to place rooks alternately, with the mirroring rule.

In this case, when I place a rook at (3,4), the computer places at (4,3).

Alternatively, I can place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4).

Or, I can place at (3,3), and since r == c, computer skips.

Then, I can place at (4,4), with computer skipping.

In this case, both (3,3) and (4,4) are possible moves, and they lead to the same configuration.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that placing at (3,3) and then (4,4) is considered the same as placing at (4,4) and then (3,3).

Because the order doesn't matter in this case.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is based on choosing subsets of positions in the remaining grid, subject to the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each pair of positions (r,c) and (c,r) where r != c, they must be placed together, and for positions where r == c, they can be placed individually.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is based on choosing subsets of these pairs and single positions.

This seems promising.

**Formulating the Solution:**

Let’s define:

- Let m be the number of remaining rows, which is n - len(rows_used).

- Similarly, let p be the number of remaining columns, which is n - len(cols_used).

But since rows and columns are independently occupied, m and p might not be equal.

Wait, but in this problem, because of the way rows and columns are occupied, m might not necessarily equal p.

Wait, in the earlier example, with n=4, k=1, move (1,2), we have rows_used={1,2}, cols_used={1,2}, so m = 2, p = 2.

But in general, it's possible that len(rows_used) != len(cols_used), depending on the moves.

Wait, no. In the initial setup, for each move:

- If r != c:

- rows_used.add(r), rows_used.add(c)

- cols_used.add(r), cols_used.add(c)

- If r == c:

- rows_used.add(r)

- cols_used.add(c) # which is r

So, len(rows_used) could be different from len(cols_used) if there are moves where r == c.

Wait, but in the initial setup, it's guaranteed that the k moves and implied computer moves are valid.

So, perhaps len(rows_used) == len(cols_used), but I need to confirm.

Wait, in the case where r == c:

- rows_used.add(r)

- cols_used.add(c) # which is r

So, len(rows_used) == len(cols_used) in all cases.

Hence, m = p.

Therefore, the remaining board is m x m.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an m x m board, considering the mirroring rule for each move.

Now, in this remaining m x m board, when I place a rook at (r,c), the computer places at (c,r), unless r == c.

So, I need to consider pairs of positions (r,c) and (c,r), and single positions when r == c.

Hence, the number of configurations should be based on choosing subsets of these pairs and singles, considering the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to choosing perfect matchings in a graph, but I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

**Counting Configurations:**

In the remaining m x m board, I need to place rooks such that no two rooks share the same row or column, and considering the mirroring rule.

This is similar to choosing a permutation of rows to columns, where each rook corresponds to a pair (row, column).

But with the mirroring rule, each my move is followed by the computer's move, unless r == c.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is based on the number of ways to choose a subset of the remaining grid, where no two rooks share the same row or column, and accounting for the mirroring.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that after the initial k moves, the remaining game is equivalent to placing non-attacking rooks on the remaining m x m board, with the mirroring rule.

Given that, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of the remaining grid where no two rooks share a row or column, divided by the number of mirror pairs.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of derangements, but I'm not sure.

Let me look for a pattern.

Looking back at the example:

n=4, k=1, with move (1,2)

After k moves, m = 2

And the number of configurations is 3.

Looking at m=2, and the number of configurations is 3.

Let me see what 2x2 board has in terms of possible placements.

Possible placements:

1. Place a rook at (3,4), computer places at (4,3)

2. Place a rook at (4,3), computer places at (3,4) – this is the same as the first one.

3. Place a rook at (3,3), computer skips; then place at (4,4), computer skips.

So, three configurations in total.

Similarly, for m=1, it should be 1 configuration.

For m=0, it should be 1 configuration (doing nothing).

Wait, for m=1, it's either place a rook at (r,c) where r==c, or do nothing.

But in this problem, since r==c, placing a rook at (r,c) is allowed, and the computer skips.

So, for m=1, there are 2 configurations: placing the rook or not placing it.

Wait, but in the example with m=2, there are 3 configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^m, but no, 2^2 is 4, but in the example, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps it's m! + 1, but no, 2! +1 =3, and for m=1, 1! +1=2.

Wait, perhaps it's m! + 1 - something.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of ways to pair the remaining positions, considering the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of ways to choose a subset of the remaining grid where no two rooks share a row or column, divided by 2 for each pair where r != c.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me think recursively.

Define f(m) as the number of configurations for a m x m remaining board.

From the example, f(2) = 3.

Similarly, for m=1, f(1)=2.

For m=0, f(0)=1.

Let me try to find a recurrence relation.

Consider m >=1.

I have m rows and m columns available.

I can choose to place a rook at (r,c), where r !=c, which forces the computer to place at (c,r).

Or, if r==c, I can place a rook at (r,c), and the computer skips.

Alternatively, I can choose not to place any more rooks.

Wait, but in the game, I have to continue placing rooks until no more moves are possible.

So, it's not about choosing to place or not to place at each step, but about playing all possible valid moves until the game ends.

This seems complex to model recursively, especially for large n.

I need a better approach.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

Let me consider that after accounting for the initial k moves, the remaining board is m x m.

I need to count the number of ways to complete the game on this m x m board.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to use a DP function func_1(n) that computes some sequence modulo 10^9+7.

But in the code, it's func_1(n), but in the problem, the modulus is 10^9+7, but in the code, it's 7 + 10^9.

Wait, 7 + 10^9 is 1000000007, which is a common modulus.

So, the DP function seems to be computing a sequence where dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2] modulo 1000000007.

Given that, perhaps this DP is calculating the number of configurations for a i x i board.

Looking back at the example:

For m=2, f(2)=3.

According to the DP:

dp[0]=1

dp[1]=1

dp[2]=dp[1] + 2*(1)*dp[0] =1 + 2*1*1=3, which matches the example.

Similarly, dp[3]=dp[2] + 2*2*dp[1]=3 + 4*1=7.

Not sure if that makes sense, but according to the DP, it's producing the correct value for m=2.

So, perhaps this DP is correctly modeling the number of configurations for an m x m board.

Hence, in the code, after calculating m = n - something, it calls func_1(m), which seems correct.

Wait, but I need to understand how m is calculated.

In the code:

for each of the k moves:

if a != b:

n -= 2

else:

n -=1

Wait, is n being decremented by 2 when a != b, and by 1 when a == b.

But earlier, I thought that m = n - len(rows_used), where len(rows_used) is the number of rows occupied.

But in this code, it's decrementing n by 2 when a != b, and by 1 when a == b.

Is this correct?

Wait, in the earlier analysis, for a != b:

- rows_used.add(a), rows_used.add(b)

- cols_used.add(a), cols_used.add(b)

So, len(rows_used) could be up to 2*k when all a != b and all are distinct.

Wait, but in the code, it's decrementing n by 2 for each a != b, and by 1 for a == b.

Is this equivalent to m = n - len(rows_used)?

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider:

- For each move where a != b:

- rows_used increases by 2 (a and b)

- For each move where a == b:

- rows_used increases by 1 (a)

So, len(rows_used) = 2*num_{a!=b} + num_{a==b}

Similarly for cols_used.

But in the code, it's decrementing n by 2 for each a != b, and by 1 for a == b.

Hence, m = n - (2*num_{a!=b} + num_{a==b}), which matches len(rows_used).

Therefore, m = n - (2*num_{a!=b} + num_{a==b})

Then, the number of configurations is func_1(m), which seems correct based on the example.

Hence, the provided program seems to be correct.

**Final Solution:**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after a series of moves, considering the constraints of non-attacking rooks and mirroring moves by the computer.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup and Move Processing**:
   - We start by processing the initial moves made by the player and the computer.
   - For each move where the player places a rook at (r, c):
     - If r != c, both rows r and c are marked as used, and the computer places a rook at (c, r).
     - If r == c, only row r is marked as used, and the computer skips its move.
   - We adjust the size of the board (n) by subtracting the used rows and columns accordingly.

2. **Dynamic Programming to Calculate Configurations**:
   - After processing the initial moves, we compute the number of ways to place the remaining rooks on the reduced board.
   - We use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining part of the board.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue

def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]
```

### Explanation

- **Input Processing**:
  - Read the number of test cases (t).
  - For each test case, read n (board size) and k (number of initial moves).
  - For each of the k moves, read the positions (a, b) and adjust n based on whether a equals b or not.

- **Dynamic Programming Function (func_1)**:
  - Initialize a DP list with dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1.
  - Use a loop to calculate dp[i] for i from 2 to n, using the recurrence relation:
    dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10**9 + 7)
  - This relation accounts for the ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the mirroring rule.
  - Finally, print the result of func_1(n) for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid configurations by reusing previously computed results, making it suitable for large input sizes.
