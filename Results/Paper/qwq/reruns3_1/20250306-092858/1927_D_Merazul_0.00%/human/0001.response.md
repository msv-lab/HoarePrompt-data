Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. I'm given an array of integers and a set of queries. Each query specifies a range within the array, and I need to find two indices within that range such that the elements at those indices are different. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 -1.

First, I need to parse the input correctly. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case:

- There's an integer n, the length of the array.

- Then there's the array itself, consisting of n integers.

- After that, there's an integer q, the number of queries.

- Then q lines follow, each containing two integers l and r, representing the range for the query.

My task is to process each query and output a pair of indices where the elements are different, or -1 -1 if no such pair exists within the specified range.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, considering the constraints:

- The number of test cases t can be up to 10^4.

- For each test case, n can be up to 2*10^5.

- The total sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

- Similarly, q can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, with the total sum of q across all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution that can handle up to 10^4 test cases, each with a large array and a large number of queries.

One straightforward way is to, for each query, iterate through the specified range and check if there are any two different elements. However, since q can be up to 2*10^5 per test case and t up to 10^4, this approach would be too slow because it would result in too many operations.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider precomputing some information for each test case to make individual queries faster.

One idea is to precompute for each position in the array, the next position that has a different value. This way, for each query, I can quickly find a pair of indices with different values if such a pair exists within the range.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can iterate through the array and, for each index i, find the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i]. I can store this information in an array, say next_diff[i] = j.

Similarly, I can create a similar array but in reverse, to find the previous different element.

But maybe there's a better way.

Wait, actually, for this problem, since we're dealing with queries that ask for any pair of different elements within a range, I can precompute for each possible range whether all elements are the same or not.

But that seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find for each position i, the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i]. Then, for a query [l, r], if there exists any j in [l, r] such that a[j] != a[l], then I can output l and j. Otherwise, all elements in the range are the same, and I output -1 -1.

This seems promising.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently.

I can iterate through the array once and, for each position i, find the next position j where a[j] != a[i]. I can store this in a list next_diff.

Then, for each query [l, r], I can check if next_diff[l-1] <= r. If it does, then a[next_diff[l-1]] != a[l-1], and I can output l-1 and next_diff[l-1] (since Python uses 0-based indexing). If next_diff[l-1] > r, then I need to check if there are any other differences in the range.

Wait, actually, if next_diff[l-1] > r, it means that from l to r, all elements are equal to a[l-1], so I should output -1 -1.

But I need to make sure that next_diff[l-1] is within the query range.

Wait, let's clarify:

- I'll compute next_diff[i] as the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i], or n+1 if no such j exists.

- For a query [l, r], if next_diff[l-1] <= r, then a[next_diff[l-1]] != a[l-1], so I can output l-1 and next_diff[l-1].

- If next_diff[l-1] > r, it means that from l to r, all elements are equal to a[l-1], so I output -1 -1.

This seems correct.

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]

Compute next_diff:

- i=0: a[0]=1, next different is a[2]=2, so next_diff[0]=2

- i=1: a[1]=1, next different is a[2]=2, so next_diff[1]=2

- i=2: a[2]=2, next different is a[3]=1, so next_diff[2]=3

- i=3: a[3]=1, next different is a[4]=1, none, so next_diff[3]=6

- i=4: a[4]=1, no next, so next_diff[4]=6

So next_diff = [2, 2, 3, 6, 6]

Now, for queries:

1. [1,5]: l=1, r=5, next_diff[0]=2 <=5, so output 1 3

2. [1,2]: l=1, r=2, next_diff[0]=2 <=2, so output 1 3, wait, no, indices are 1-based, so a[1]=1, a[2]=1, but next_diff[0]=2 is within [1,2], but a[2]=1 == a[1]=1, which contradicts the earlier assumption.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

In the first test case, a = [1,1,2,1,1]

So, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=2, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

For query [1,2]: l=1, r=2

next_diff[0]=2, which is within [1,2], but a[2]=1 == a[1]=1, so this approach seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscomputed next_diff.

Wait, a[0]=1, a[1]=1: a[1]==a[0], so next_diff[0]=2

a[2]=2 != a[1], so next_diff[1]=2

a[2]=2, a[3]=1 != a[2], so next_diff[2]=3

a[3]=1, a[4]=1 == a[3], so next_diff[3]=5

a[4]=1, no next, so next_diff[4]=6

So next_diff = [2,2,3,5,6]

Now, for query [1,2]: l=1, r=2

next_diff[0]=2 <=2, so output 1 and 3. But a[3]=2, which is outside the range [1,2]. So this is incorrect.

Wait, I need to make sure that j is within [l,r].

So, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

Alternative approach: For each query [l,r], iterate through the range and check if all elements are the same.

But this is inefficient for large q and n.

Another idea: Precompute for each position i, the number of unique elements in the range [1,i].

Then, for a query [l,r], the number of unique elements in [l,r] is unique[1 to r] - unique[1 to l-1].

If this is greater than 1, then there are at least two different elements in the range.

But I need to output the indices of such a pair.

So, this can help me determine if such a pair exists, but I still need a way to find the indices.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position i, the next different element as before, and then for each query, if next_diff[l-1] <= r, output l-1 and next_diff[l-1].

But in the earlier example, this seems to fail.

Wait, in the first query [1,5], next_diff[0]=2 <=5, so output 1 and 3.

But a[1]=1 and a[3]=2, which are different.

In the second query [1,2], next_diff[0]=2 <=2, so output 1 and 3, but 3 is outside [1,2], which is invalid.

So, I need to ensure that j is within [l,r].

Wait, perhaps I need to cap j at r.

But in this case, j=3 is outside [1,2], which is invalid.

So, perhaps this approach isn't working correctly.

Alternative idea: For each query [l,r], find the first two elements in the range that are different.

To optimize, I can precompute for each position i, the next different element within the array.

Then, for each query, find the smallest j where l <= j <= r and a[j] != a[l-1].

But this still requires some iteration within the range.

Wait, perhaps I can use a segment tree or some kind of data structure to answer range queries efficiently.

But given time constraints, I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that for each query, I can iterate through the range and find the first two different elements.

Given that the total sum of q across all test cases is 2*10^5, and n is up to 2*10^5 per test case, this should be acceptable in terms of time complexity, as the total operations would be around 2*10^5 * some small constant.

So, perhaps it's acceptable to handle each query independently without precomputing anything.

Let me think about implementing this.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a of n integers

- Read q

- For each query:

- Read l and r

- Find two indices i and j within [l,r] such that a[i] != a[j]

- If such a pair exists, output any such pair

- Else, output -1 -1

To optimize, I can iterate through the range [l,r] and keep track of the first two elements. If they are different, output them. If not, continue until I find two different elements.

Since the array can be large, and q can be large, I need to make sure that this is efficient.

Alternative idea: For each test case, find all positions where a[i] != a[i-1]. Then, for each query, check if there is any such position within [l,r].

If there is, then output i and i-1 (adjusted for 1-based indexing).

If not, output -1 -1.

Wait, this might work.

Let me think about it.

If there is any position j in [l,r] where a[j] != a[j-1], then I can output j and j-1.

If no such position exists, then all elements in [l,r] are equal.

But I need to handle the indices correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that j-1 is within [l,r].

Wait, for j=l, j-1 = l-1, which might be outside the range.

So, perhaps it's better to look for any j in [l+1, r] where a[j] != a[j-1].

If such a j exists, output j and j-1.

Else, output -1 -1.

This seems correct.

Let me test this with the first query [1,5]:

Check if any j in [2,5] where a[j] != a[j-1].

a[2]=1 == a[1]=1

a[3]=2 != a[2]=1 → output 3 and 2

Similarly, for [1,2]:

Check j in [2,2]:

a[2]=1 == a[1]=1 → no such j → output -1 -1

Good.

For [1,3]:

Check j in [2,3]:

a[2]=1 == a[1]=1

a[3]=2 != a[2]=1 → output 3 and 2

This works.

So, this seems like a good approach.

Let me think about implementing this.

For each query [l,r]:

- For j from l+1 to r:

- If a[j] != a[j-1], output j and j-1

- If no such j is found, output -1 -1

This should work and is efficient enough, as it processes each query in O(r - l + 1) time, and with the constraints, the total time should be acceptable.

Now, considering that t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, this should be fine.

I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary operations inside loops.

Also, I need to handle 1-based vs 0-based indexing correctly.

In Python, lists are 0-based, so I need to adjust the indices accordingly.

Let me think about how to implement this in code.

I'll need to read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a of n integers

- Read q

- For each query:

- Read l and r (1-based)

- Adjust l and r to 0-based indexing for the array

- Iterate from l to r-1

- If a[j] != a[j-1], output j+1 and j (1-based indices)

- If no such j is found, output -1 -1

I need to make sure that I handle the indices correctly.

Also, I need to read the inputs efficiently, as there can be up to 10^4 test cases.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.readline() is faster than input(), which is important for large inputs.

So, I should use sys.stdin to read all input at once and then process it.

Let me think about how to structure the code.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read(), split it into tokens, and process them one by one.

I'll need to keep track of the current position in the token list.

Let me draft some pseudocode.

Import sys

Read all input at once: data = sys.stdin.read().split()

Initialize an index to track the current position in data

Initialize t = int(data[index]); index +=1

For _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index]); index +=1

a = [int(data[index+i]) for i in range(n)]; index +=n

q = int(data[index]); index +=1

for _ in range(q):

l = int(data[index]) -1; index +=1

r = int(data[index]) ; index +=1

# Now, find if there is any j in [l+1, r] where a[j] != a[j-1]

found = False

for j in range(l+1, r):

if a[j] != a[j-1]:

print(j+1, j) # 1-based indices

found = True

break

if not found:

print(-1, -1)

This seems correct.

I need to make sure that r is exclusive in the range, but in Python, range(l+1, r) is correct.

Also, need to handle the case when l+1 >= r, meaning the range has only one element, so output -1 -1.

Wait, in the problem, l and r can be the same, but according to the constraints, l <= r.

But in the problem statement, it says l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, with i and j being different.

So, if l == r, then there's only one element, so output -1 -1.

In my code, range(l+1, r) would be empty, so it'll correctly output -1 -1.

Good.

Let me think about edge cases.

- All elements in the range are the same: output -1 -1

- There are at least two different elements in the range: output any pair of their indices

- Range consists of only one element: output -1 -1

- Range consists of two elements that are different: output the two indices

- Range consists of two elements that are the same: output -1 -1

I need to make sure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Let me test the code with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=5

a=[1,1,2,1,1]

q=3

Queries:

1 5: output 2 3 (but in 1-based indexing, it should be 2 and 3, which correspond to a[2]=1 and a[3]=2)

Wait, in my code, it would output j and j-1, which are 3 and 2 in 1-based indexing.

Yes, that matches.

1 2: output -1 -1

1 3: output 2 3

Good.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

q=5

Queries:

1 2: output 2 and 1 (a[2]=20 != a[1]=30)

2 3: output -1 -1 (a[2]=20 == a[3]=20)

2 4: output 4 and 3 (a[4]=10 != a[3]=20)

2 6: output 4 and 3 or 5 and 4 or 6 and 5

3 5: output 4 and 3

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[5,2,3,4]

q=4

Queries:

1 2: output 2 and 1 (a[2]=2 != a[1]=5)

1 4: output 2 and 1

2 3: output 3 and 2

2 4: output 3 and 2 or 4 and 3

Good.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently in Python.

I need to read all input at once and process it accordingly.

I need to manage the index carefully to avoid going out of bounds.

Also, since n and q can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my code doesn't have any unnecessary operations.

In Python, list indexing is O(1), so it's fine.

I need to make sure that I don't have any extra loops or operations inside the query processing.

Also, printing can be slow in Python if done naively, so I should collect all outputs in a list and print them at once at the end.

Let me adjust the pseudocode accordingly.

Import sys

Read all input at once: data = sys.stdin.read().split()

Initialize an index to track the current position in data

Initialize t = int(data[index]); index +=1

Initialize an empty list to store outputs

For _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index]); index +=1

a = [int(data[index+i]) for i in range(n)]; index +=n

q = int(data[index]); index +=1

for _ in range(q):

l = int(data[index]) -1; index +=1

r = int(data[index]); index +=1

# Now, find if there is any j in [l+1, r] where a[j] != a[j-1]

found = False

for j in range(l+1, r):

if a[j] != a[j-1]:

outputs.append(str(j+1) + ' ' + str(j)) # 1-based indices

found = True

break

if not found:

outputs.append('-1 -1')

After processing all test cases, print all outputs at once.

This should be efficient enough.

Let me think about any possible optimizations.

Since for each query, I'm iterating through the range [l+1, r], and the total sum of q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and n is up to 2*10^5 per test case, but t is up to 10^4, I need to make sure that the total operations are acceptable.

But since the sum of q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and for each query, in the worst case, I might iterate through the entire range, which could be up to n, but since n can be up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

Wait, the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, in total, the operations should be acceptable.

I need to make sure that my code doesn't have any unnecessary nested loops or operations that could cause it to exceed time limits.

Also, in Python, list appends are efficient, so collecting outputs in a list and printing them at once is a good approach.

I should avoid using slow operations inside loops.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

But wait, looking back at the original program provided, it seems completely unrelated to the problem at hand.

The original program is:

def func():

R = lambda : map(int, input().split())

(t,) = R()

while t:

t -= 1

(*_, k) = R()

a = {*R()}

b = {*R()}

f = 1

m = n = k // 2

for i in range(1, k + 1):

u = i in a

v = i in b

f &= u | v

m -= u & ~v

n -= ~u & v

print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])

This seems to be solving a different problem, possibly related to sets and some conditions on their elements.

Given that, this program is incorrect for the current problem, which is about finding pairs of different elements in ranges of an array.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
