Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to earn a lot of money by going to a casino, and he has some initial amount of coins, 'a'. The casino has some rules: when he wins a bet of 'y' coins, he gets 'y times k' coins back, meaning he gains 'y times (k-1)'. If he loses, he loses the entire bet 'y'. Also, there's a promotion where he can't lose more than 'x' times in a row.

The question is, can Sasha make bets in such a way that he's guaranteed to reach any amount of coins 'n', no matter what happens, as long as it doesn't contradict the rules?

First, I need to understand what it means to be "guaranteed" to reach any 'n'. It means that no matter how the wins and losses occur, as long as the sequence of losses doesn't exceed 'x' in a row, Sasha should be able to increase his coins to at least 'n'.

I need to find out, for given 'k', 'x', and 'a', whether starting with 'a' coins, Sasha can always make bets to reach any 'n'.

Looking at the sample input and output:

- For k=2, x=1, a=7, the answer is YES.

- For k=2, x=1, a=1, the answer is NO.

- For k=2, x=3, a=15, the answer is YES.

- And so on.

I need to find a pattern or a condition that determines when the answer is YES and when it's NO.

Let me think about how Sasha can make bets. He needs to choose bet amounts 'y' each time, and based on whether he wins or loses, his coin total changes.

The key here is that losses are limited to 'x' in a row. So, even if he loses, he can only lose 'x' times consecutively before he has to have a win.

I recall that in gambling strategies, there are systems like the Martingale system, where you double your bet after each loss to recoup previous losses when you finally win. But here, the multiplier is 'k', which could be different from 2.

Wait, in this problem, the win multiplies the bet by 'k', so it's similar to Martingale but with a different multiplier.

In the Martingale system, if you can have infinite wealth and no table limits, you're guaranteed to eventually win back your losses plus the original bet. But here, there's a limit on consecutive losses: you can't lose more than 'x' times in a row.

So, perhaps Sasha can use a similar strategy, adjusting his bet based on previous outcomes, but taking into account the limit on consecutive losses.

I need to find out what the minimal initial amount 'a' should be to guarantee that, no matter the sequence of wins and losses (as long as there are no more than 'x' consecutive losses), Sasha can keep betting to reach any 'n'.

Wait, maybe it's about ensuring that even after 'x' consecutive losses, Sasha can still make a bet that allows him to recover.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider the worst-case scenario: Sasha loses 'x' times in a row, and then wins. What should his bet amounts be to ensure that he can always recover and grow his capital.

Suppose he starts with 'a' coins.

He makes a bet of 'y1'. If he loses, he loses 'y1', so he has 'a - y1'.

Then he makes another bet of 'y2', loses again, having 'a - y1 - y2'.

This continues up to 'x' losses.

After 'x' losses, he must have enough to make a bet and, upon winning, gain enough to proceed.

So, after 'x' losses, his capital is 'a - y1 - y2 - ... - yx'.

Then, he wins a bet of 'yx+1', and gains 'yx+1 * k' coins.

So, his new capital would be 'a - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + yx+1 * (k - 1)'.

He needs this to be positive and preferably growing.

But actually, the problem is about being able to reach any 'n', so we need to ensure that, no matter what sequence of wins and losses (with no more than 'x' consecutive losses), Sasha can adjust his bets to eventually reach 'n'.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible losses Sasha might face.

If he can handle the worst-case scenario of 'x' consecutive losses, then he can ensure that he never runs out of coins.

So, maybe I need to calculate the minimal 'a' such that after 'x' consecutive losses, he still has enough to make a bet and continue.

But I need to ensure that he can reach any 'n', which seems to imply that he should be able to grow his capital indefinitely.

Wait, but with each win, he multiplies his bet by 'k', which is at least 2, so if he can keep making bets, he can potentially grow his capital without bound.

The issue is ensuring that he doesn't run out of coins due to consecutive losses.

So, perhaps the initial amount 'a' needs to be at least the sum of the bet amounts for 'x' consecutive losses plus the ability to make a winning bet that allows growth.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a formula or a pattern based on the sample inputs.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- For k=2, x=1, a=7: YES

- For k=2, x=1, a=1: NO

- For k=2, x=3, a=15: YES

- For k=3, x=3, a=6: NO

- For k=4, x=4, a=5: NO

- For k=5, x=4, a=7: YES

- For k=4, x=88, a=1000000000: NO

- For k=25, x=69, a=231: NO

- For k=13, x=97, a=18806: NO

Hmm, seems like for some combinations, a certain threshold of 'a' is required based on 'k' and 'x'.

Maybe I can try to find a formula that calculates the minimal 'a' required based on 'k' and 'x'.

Let me think about what happens if Sasha adopts a strategy where he always bets a fixed amount.

But betting a fixed amount might not be optimal, especially since he needs to account for the possibility of 'x' consecutive losses.

Perhaps he should bet different amounts depending on the sequence of previous wins and losses.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a mathematical way to determine the minimal 'a' for given 'k' and 'x'.

Let me consider that after 'x' losses, Sasha must still have enough coins to make a bet and, upon winning, be able to continue.

Let's denote the bet amounts as y1, y2, ..., ym, depending on the sequence.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in some betting strategies, the total amount that can be lost is the sum of the bet amounts in a losing streak.

So, in this case, the maximum number of consecutive losses is 'x', meaning the total amount that can be lost is y1 + y2 + ... + yx.

Sasha needs to ensure that after 'x' losses, he still has enough to make a bet and potentially grow his capital.

So, perhaps the initial amount 'a' needs to cover the sum of the bet amounts for 'x' losses plus some additional amount to allow for growth.

But how to determine the bet amounts?

Maybe Sasha should choose bet amounts in a way that allows him to recover losses plus some profit.

This sounds similar to the Martingale system, where you double the bet after each loss to recover previous losses plus the original bet.

In that system, if you have a limit on consecutive losses, you can calculate the maximum amount you might need.

But here, the multiplier is 'k', not necessarily 2.

Wait, maybe Sasha can choose his bet amounts such that each subsequent bet after a loss is chosen in a way that, when he eventually wins, he recovers all previous losses plus some gain.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose Sasha has a sequence of bets: y1, y2, ..., ym.

If he wins a bet yj, he gets yj * k coins back.

If he loses, he loses yj coins.

He can't lose more than 'x' times in a row.

So, in the worst case, he can lose 'x' times in a row, and then he must have a win.

So, let's consider a sequence where he loses 'x' times and then wins once.

Let’s calculate his capital after these 'x' losses and one win.

Starting with 'a' coins:

- Loses y1, has a - y1

- Loses y2, has a - y1 - y2

- ...

- Loses yx, has a - y1 - y2 - ... - yx

- Wins y{x+1}, has a - y1 - y2 - ... - yx + y{x+1} * (k - 1)

He needs this to be positive and preferably greater than 'a' to show progress.

But actually, to guarantee reaching any 'n', he needs to be able to keep increasing his capital indefinitely.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should think recursively.

Let’s think about the minimal 'a' such that, after any sequence of up to 'x' losses followed by a win, he can continue.

This feels like he needs to have enough buffer to withstand 'x' losses and still have enough to make a bet that allows growth.

Perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.

Wait, maybe I can think of it this way:

Let’s say Sasha bets y coins.

If he wins, his capital increases by y*(k-1).

If he loses, it decreases by y.

He can lose up to 'x' times in a row.

So, the maximum he can lose is the sum of the last 'x' bets.

He needs to ensure that, after 'x' losses, he can still make a bet that allows him to grow his capital.

This seems circular.

Maybe I need to find the minimal 'a' such that the sum of the bet amounts for 'x' losses plus the bet amount for the next win is less than or equal to 'a'.

But I need to ensure that he can keep doing this indefinitely.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the sum of a series where each bet is related to the previous ones based on 'k'.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

Looking at the first sample:

k=2, x=1, a=7: YES

So, with k=2, x=1, a=7, he can handle one loss and still make a bet to grow.

Similarly, k=2, x=1, a=1: NO

So, for k=2 and x=1, a needs to be at least 7 to guarantee reaching any 'n'.

Wait, but in the Martingale system with k=2 and x=1, maybe the required 'a' is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the sum S where S = y1 + y2 + ... + yx + y{x+1}/(k-1)

or something like that.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a formula that directly relates 'a', 'k', and 'x'.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())

s = 1

for i in range(x):

s += s // (k - 1) + 1

print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')

So, it seems that the threshold 's' is calculated by starting with 1, and then for 'x' times, it adds floor(s/(k-1)) + 1 to 's'.

Then, it checks if 'a' is greater than or equal to 's'.

I need to verify if this is correct.

Let me try to compute 's' for the first sample input:

k=2, x=1, a=7

s = 1

After first iteration: s += s//(2-1) +1 = 1//1 +1 = 1 +1 = 2

So, s = 1 + 2 = 3

Wait, but in the sample, a=7 is YES, but according to this, a should be >=3, but in the sample, a=7 is YES and a=1 is NO, which doesn't match because according to this, a=1 <3 is NO, a=7 >=3 is YES, but in the sample, a=7 is YES, but for k=2, x=1, a=7 is YES, but according to this, s=3, but in the explanation, it seems like s should be higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the code, it's s += s//(k-1) +1, so starting with s=1:

First iteration: s += 1//(2-1) +1 = 1//1 +1 =1 +1=2, so s=1+2=3

Second iteration would not happen since x=1.

Then, it checks if a >= s, i.e., 7 >=3, which is YES.

But in the explanation, it's mentioned that with k=2, x=1, a=7, Sasha can use a strategy where he bets 1 coin if it's the first bet or after a win, and 2 coins if he lost the previous bet.

So, in this strategy, the maximum he can lose is 2 coins (since he can lose only once in a row), so he needs to have at least the sum of those bets, which is 1 + 2 = 3 coins, which matches s=3.

But in the explanation, it's said that he can reach any 'n' with a=7, but according to s=3, a=3 should be sufficient.

Maybe there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps s represents some minimal required initial amount.

Let me try to compute s for other samples.

For k=2, x=1, a=1: s=3, 1 <3, so NO, which matches the sample.

For k=2, x=3, a=15:

s=1

First iteration: s +=1//(2-1)+1 =1//1 +1=1+1=2, s=1+2=3

Second iteration: s +=3//1 +1=3+1=4, s=3+4=7

Third iteration: s +=7//1 +1=7+1=8, s=7+8=15

So, s=15, and a=15 >=15, so YES, matches the sample.

For k=3, x=3, a=6:

s=1

First: s +=1//(3-1)+1=1//2 +1=0 +1=1, s=1+1=2

Second: s +=2//2 +1=1 +1=2, s=2+2=4

Third: s +=4//2 +1=2 +1=3, s=4+3=7

So, s=7, but a=6 <7, so NO, matches the sample.

For k=4, x=4, a=5:

s=1

First: s +=1//3 +1=0 +1=1, s=1+1=2

Second: s +=2//3 +1=0 +1=1, s=2+1=3

Third: s +=3//3 +1=1 +1=2, s=3+2=5

Fourth: s +=5//3 +1=1 +1=2, s=5+2=7

So, s=7, a=5 <7, NO, matches the sample.

For k=5, x=4, a=7:

s=1

First: s +=1//4 +1=0 +1=1, s=1+1=2

Second: s +=2//4 +1=0 +1=1, s=2+1=3

Third: s +=3//4 +1=0 +1=1, s=3+1=4

Fourth: s +=4//4 +1=1 +1=2, s=4+2=6

So, s=6, a=7 >=6, YES, matches the sample.

For k=4, x=88, a=1000000000:

s=1

First: s +=1//3 +1=0 +1=1, s=1+1=2

Second: s +=2//3 +1=0 +1=1, s=2+1=3

...

This will take a long time, but in the sample, a=1000000000 is NO, but according to this, s would be less than a, but in the sample, it's NO, so perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample, it's NO, which contradicts the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, and in this case, s exceeds a, but in the sample, it's NO.

Wait, in the sample, a=1000000000 is NO, but according to the formula, a >=s should be YES.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscomputing s.

Wait, for k=4, x=88, starting with s=1:

Each step, s += s//3 +1

This will grow exponentially.

Wait, perhaps s becomes larger than a=1000000000, hence a < s, so NO.

But in the sample, it's NO, which matches a < s.

Wait, but in the previous cases, it matched.

Wait, for k=4, x=4, a=5: s=7, a=5 <7, NO.

For k=4, x=88, a=1000000000, s would be much larger, hence NO.

Wait, but in the sample, it's NO, which matches a < s.

Wait, but for k=5, x=4, a=7: s=6, a=7 >=6, YES.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but for k=2, x=1, a=7: s=3, a=7 >=3, YES.

Wait, but earlier I thought s should be higher, but according to the sample, it's acceptable.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

But I need to confirm the logic behind this formula.

Why is s calculated this way?

Let me try to understand the logic behind s.

Starting with s=1.

Then, for each of the x possible consecutive losses, s is updated as s += s//(k-1) +1.

I need to see what this represents.

Wait, perhaps s represents the required initial amount to cover the losses and still be able to make the next bet.

Let me try to interpret it.

For k=2, x=1:

s=1

After one possible loss, s += s//(2-1) +1 =1//1 +1=1+1=2, so s=1+2=3

This means that with a=3, Sasha can cover one loss of up to 2 coins (since he needs to have enough to make a bet after one loss).

Then, after winning, he can grow his capital.

Similarly, for k=2, x=3:

s=1

After first loss: s +=1//1 +1=1+1=2, s=3

After second loss: s +=3//1 +1=3+1=4, s=7

After third loss: s +=7//1 +1=7+1=8, s=15

So, s=15, which matches the sample input where a=15 is YES.

This seems to make sense.

So, perhaps this is a correct way to calculate the minimal required initial amount 'a'.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
