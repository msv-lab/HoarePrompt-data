Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given four points that are the corners of a square on a coordinate plane. The square has sides parallel to the axes, and I need to find its area. There are multiple test cases, and I have to do this for each one.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligning with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that.

Given four points, I need to figure out which ones are opposite corners of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the coordinates should make it easy to identify the lengths of the sides.

Let me think about how to approach this. In a square with sides parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates of the vertical sides will be the same, and the y-coordinates of the horizontal sides will be the same.

So, if I have four points, I should be able to group them based on their x and y coordinates to identify the sides.

Wait, actually, in a square, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Given that, perhaps I can calculate the distances between points and identify which pairs form the sides.

But that might be too complicated. Since the problem guarantees that the four points form a valid square with positive area, I can assume that the coordinates are correctly given.

Maybe a better way is to find the unique x and y coordinates. Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, there should be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values among the four points.

Let me try an example from the input:

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

So, the x-values are 1, 4, 1, 4

The y-values are 2, 5, 5, 2

So, the unique x-values are 1 and 4

Unique y-values are 2 and 5

The side lengths would be the differences between these unique values.

So, the side length along x is |4 - 1| = 3

Side length along y is |5 - 2| = 3

Since it's a square, both should be equal, which they are.

Therefore, the area is 3 * 3 = 9, which matches the first output.

Similarly, second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Unique x-values: -1, 1

Unique y-values: -1, 1

Side length: |1 - (-1)| = 2

Area: 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Unique x-values: 45, 17

Unique y-values: 11, 39

Side length: |45 - 17| = 28

|39 - 11| = 28

Area: 28 * 28 = 784, which matches the third output.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Collect the x-coordinates and find the unique ones.

- Collect the y-coordinates and find the unique ones.

- There should be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

- The side length of the square is the difference between the unique x-values or y-values.

- The area is the side length squared.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())

(x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())

(x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())

(x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())

if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:

if y1 < y3:

res = abs(y3 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y3)

elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

print(res ** 2)

So, the function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads four lines of input, each containing two integers (x and y coordinates).

Then, it checks conditions based on the x-coordinates to determine which points share the same x-values, and accordingly calculates the difference in y-coordinates to find the side length, and then prints the square of that side length.

Let's see if this approach is correct.

In the first if condition:

if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:

This assumes that points 1 and 3 share the same x-coordinate, and points 2 and 4 share the same x-coordinate.

Then, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 3.

Similarly, in the second elif:

elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:

It assumes points 1 and 2 share the same x-coordinate, and points 3 and 4 share the same x-coordinate, and calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 2.

And in the third elif:

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

It assumes points 1 and 4 share the same x-coordinate, and points 3 and 2 share the same x-coordinate, and calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 2.

Wait, but in this case, it's calculating the difference between y1 and y2, which may not be correct if points 1 and 4 share the same x-coordinate but points 3 and 2 share the same x-coordinate.

This seems a bit convoluted and error-prone. It relies on specific pairings of points, which might not always hold true for any random ordering of the points.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the unique x-values should be exactly two, and the unique y-values should be exactly two.

So, a more robust way would be to collect all x-coordinates and find the two unique ones, and similarly for the y-coordinates.

Then, the side length is the difference between the two unique x-values (or y-values), and the area is the square of that difference.

This way, it doesn't matter how the points are ordered; as long as they form a valid square with sides parallel to the axes, this approach should work.

Let's see if the given program handles all cases correctly.

Consider the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

In this case, x1=1, y1=2

x2=4, y2=5

x3=1, y3=5

x4=4, y4=2

So, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 4). This matches the first if condition.

Then, it calculates res as abs(y3 - y1) = |5 - 2| = 3, since y1 < y3.

Then prints 3^2 = 9, which is correct.

Second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Suppose the points are read in this order:

x1=-1, y1=1

x2=1, y2=-1

x3=1, y3=1

x4=-1, y4=-1

Now, x1 == x4 (-1 == -1), and x3 == x2 (1 == 1), which matches the third elif.

Then, it calculates res as abs(y2 - y1) = |-1 - 1| = 2, since y1=1 and y2=-1.

Then prints 2^2 = 4, which is correct.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

x1=45, y1=11

x2=45, y2=39

x3=17, y3=11

x4=17, y4=39

Here, x1 == x2 (both 45), and x3 == x4 (both 17), which matches the second elif.

Then, res = abs(y2 - y1) = |39 - 11| = 28

Then prints 28^2 = 784, which is correct.

So, in these cases, it works fine.

But let's consider another arrangement of the same points to see if it always works.

Take the first test case with points shuffled:

(1,5), (4,2), (1,2), (4,5)

x1=1, y1=5

x2=4, y2=2

x3=1, y3=2

x4=4, y4=5

Now, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 4), which again matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |2 - 5| = 3

Prints 9, which is correct.

Another arrangement:

(4,5), (1,2), (4,2), (1,5)

x1=4, y1=5

x2=1, y2=2

x3=4, y3=2

x4=1, y4=5

Here, x1 == x3 (both 4), and x2 == x4 (both 1), which matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |2 - 5| = 3

Prints 9, correct.

Seems consistent so far.

But what if the points are arranged differently, like:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

x1=1, y1=2

x2=1, y2=5

x3=4, y3=2

x4=4, y4=5

Here, x1 == x2 (both 1), and x3 == x4 (both 4), which matches the second elif.

res = abs(y2 - y1) = |5 - 2| = 3

Prints 9, correct.

Another arrangement:

(1,5), (1,2), (4,5), (4,2)

x1=1, y1=5

x2=1, y2=2

x3=4, y3=5

x4=4, y4=2

Again, x1 == x2 (both 1), and x3 == x4 (both 4), matches the second elif.

res = abs(y2 - y1) = |2 - 5| = 3

Prints 9, correct.

Seems like it handles different orderings correctly.

But let's consider a tricky case where the points are not in a straightforward order.

Suppose:

(1,2), (4,5), (4,2), (1,5)

x1=1, y1=2

x2=4, y2=5

x3=4, y3=2

x4=1, y4=5

Here, x2 == x3 (both 4), and x1 == x4 (both 1), which matches the third elif.

Then, res = abs(y2 - y1) = |5 - 2| = 3

Prints 9, correct.

Another arrangement:

(4,2), (1,5), (4,5), (1,2)

x1=4, y1=2

x2=1, y2=5

x3=4, y3=5

x4=1, y4=2

Here, x1 == x3 (both 4), and x2 == x4 (both 1), which matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |5 - 2| = 3

Prints 9, correct.

Seems like no matter how the points are ordered, the program correctly identifies the side length and calculates the area.

Alternatively, considering my initial approach of finding unique x and y values:

For any set of four points forming a square with sides parallel to the axes, there will be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

The side length is the difference between the two unique x-values or the two unique y-values.

So, in code, I could collect all x-values, find the unique ones, take their difference, and square it to get the area.

This seems simpler and more straightforward.

But the given program seems to be working correctly for all the test cases I've tried.

Is there any edge case where it might fail?

Let's think about a square with side length 1.

For example:

0 0

1 0

0 1

1 1

If input in this order:

(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)

x1=0, y1=0

x2=1, y2=0

x3=0, y3=1

x4=1, y4=1

Here, x1 == x3 (both 0), and x2 == x4 (both 1), matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |1 - 0| = 1

Prints 1, which is correct.

Another arrangement:

(0,1), (1,1), (0,0), (1,0)

x1=0, y1=1

x2=1, y2=1

x3=0, y3=0

x4=1, y4=0

Here, x1 == x3 (both 0), and x2 == x4 (both 1), matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |0 - 1| = 1

Prints 1, correct.

What about a square with side length 0?

Wait, the problem states that the area is positive, strictly greater than 0, so side length is greater than 0. So, no need to handle side length 0.

What about negative coordinates?

Test case:

(-2,-2)

(-2,-1)

(-1,-2)

(-1,-1)

Unique x-values: -2, -1

Unique y-values: -2, -1

Side length: |-1 - (-2)| = 1

Area: 1, which is correct.

The program should handle negative coordinates correctly since it uses abs().

Is there a case where the points are not in the order assumed by the program?

Suppose:

(1,2), (2,1), (1,1), (2,2)

This forms a square, but let's see what the program does.

x1=1, y1=2

x2=2, y2=1

x3=1, y3=1

x4=2, y4=2

Now, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 2), matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |1 - 2| = 1

Prints 1, which is correct.

Another arrangement:

(1,1), (2,2), (1,2), (2,1)

x1=1, y1=1

x2=2, y2=2

x3=1, y3=2

x4=2, y4=1

Here, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 2), matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = |2 - 1| = 1

Prints 1, correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in this arrangement:

(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)

x1=1, y1=2

x2=1, y2=1

x3=2, y3=1

x4=2, y4=2

Here, x1 == x2 (both 1), and x3 == x4 (both 2), matches the second elif.

res = abs(y2 - y1) = |1 - 2| = 1

Prints 1, correct.

Another arrangement:

(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)

x1=2, y1=1

x2=1, y2=1

x3=1, y3=2

x4=2, y4=2

Here, x1 == x4 (both 2), and x3 == x2 (both 1), which matches the third elif.

res = abs(y2 - y1) = |1 - 1| = 0

Wait, but the side length should be 1, but according to this, res would be 0.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, let's check:

x1=2, y1=1

x2=1, y2=1

x3=1, y3=2

x4=2, y4=2

Here, x1 == x4 (both 2), and x3 == x2 (both 1), which matches the third elif.

Then, it calculates res as abs(y2 - y1) = |1 - 1| = 0

But this is incorrect because the side length is 1.

This seems like a mistake in the program.

Wait, but according to the problem, the square has positive area, so side length is greater than 0. So, it should not have res = 0.

But in this case, it's calculating res as 0, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

Let's look again:

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

In this case, y1=1, y2=1, so y1 == y2, so res = 0, which is incorrect.

But according to the problem, the square has positive area, so side length should be greater than 0.

This might be a flaw in the program.

Wait, but in this specific case, since y1 == y2, res becomes 0, which is incorrect.

But the problem states that the input is guaranteed to form a valid square with positive area, so y1 should not be equal to y2 in this context.

Wait, but in a square, opposite sides are equal, and coordinates should be such that the differences are consistent.

Wait, maybe the program assumes that y1 != y2, but in reality, for a square, y1 can be equal to y2 only if the side is horizontal, but in this case, it's not handling it correctly.

Wait, no. In a square with sides parallel to the axes, if x-coordinates are the same, then it's a vertical side, and y-coordinates should differ.

But in this case, x1 == x4 (both 2), and x3 == x2 (both 1), which means sides are vertical between x=1 and x=2.

But the program is calculating the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 2, which are both at x=2 and x=1 respectively, but y-values are the same (both y=1).

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming which points are paired.

Maybe the program is not correctly pairing the points to calculate the side length.

This could be a problem.

Let me think of another way.

Instead of trying to pair points based on their x-coordinates, perhaps I can find the distance between points and look for sides and diagonals.

But that might be more complicated than necessary.

Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in x-coordinates for horizontal sides or the difference in y-coordinates for vertical sides.

So, a more straightforward approach is to find the unique x-values and unique y-values, and compute the difference between them.

For example, in the first test case:

x-values: 1, 4, 1, 4 => unique: 1 and 4 => difference: 3

y-values: 2, 5, 5, 2 => unique: 2 and 5 => difference: 3

Area: 3 * 3 = 9

Similarly, in the second test case:

x-values: -1, 1, 1, -1 => unique: -1 and 1 => difference: 2

y-values: 1, -1, 1, -1 => unique: -1 and 1 => difference: 2

Area: 2 * 2 = 4

And so on.

So, a better implementation would be:

for each test case:

read four pairs of coordinates

find unique x-values

find unique y-values

compute side_length = abs(max(x) - min(x)) or abs(max(y) - min(y))

compute area = side_length ** 2

print area

This way, it's straightforward and doesn't depend on how the points are ordered.

Now, looking back at the given program, it seems to be trying to pair points based on their x-coordinates, which is error-prone and can lead to mistakes if the points are not ordered as expected.

In the earlier example where x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, and y1 == y2, it incorrectly calculates res = 0, which is wrong.

But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to form a valid square with positive area, so perhaps y1 != y4 in such a case.

Wait, but in the example I gave, y1 == y4, which led to res = 0.

But the problem says the square has positive area, so perhaps such a case is invalid.

Wait, no. If y1 == y4, and x1 == x4, that would mean two points are the same, which would not form a square.

But in my example, points are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)

Which are distinct points forming a valid square.

So, perhaps the guarantee in the problem does not exclude cases where y1 == y4.

Therefore, the program might have a flaw in such cases.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
