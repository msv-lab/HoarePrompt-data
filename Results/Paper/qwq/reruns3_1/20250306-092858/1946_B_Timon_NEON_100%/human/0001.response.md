Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform exactly k operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after k such operations, and I need to output this sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation does. When I select a subarray, calculate its sum, and insert that sum back into the array, where can I insert it? The problem says "anywhere in the array," which means I can insert it at any position: at the beginning, at the end, or in between any two elements.

My aim is to maximize the sum of the array after k operations. Since I'm allowed to perform exactly k operations, I need to figure out the best way to choose subarrays and insert their sums to achieve the highest possible sum.

Let me think about how the sum of the array changes with each operation. Suppose I have an array a = [a1, a2, ..., an]. The initial sum is S = a1 + a2 + ... + an.

In each operation, I choose a subarray a[i..j], compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array. This means that the new array will have the sum S + (sum of a[i..j]), because I'm adding that sum as a new element.

Wait a minute, I need to be careful here. When I insert the sum of a subarray into the array, I'm adding a new element equal to that sum, but I'm not removing the original subarray elements. So, the sum of the array increases by the sum of the subarray I chose.

But, if I choose an empty subarray, its sum is 0, and inserting 0 into the array doesn't change the sum. So, in that case, the sum remains the same.

Therefore, in each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray (including empty), compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array, thereby increasing the sum of the array by that amount.

My goal is to maximize the sum after exactly k operations. So, I need to choose k subarrays, compute their sums, insert them into the array, and maximize the total sum.

But, there's a catch. Each time I insert a sum into the array, the array grows larger, which might allow for larger subarrays in the next operations. However, since I can choose any contiguous subarray, including the entire array, I need to find a strategy that maximizes the sum efficiently.

Let me consider the maximum sum I can add in each operation. If I always choose the subarray with the maximum sum and insert it, I can maximize the increase in the sum per operation.

So, perhaps in each operation, I should find the subarray with the maximum sum, compute its sum, and insert it into the array.

But, since the array grows with each operation, finding the maximum subarray sum would become more computationally expensive if I have to do it repeatedly.

Given that n and k can be up to 2*10^5, and t (the number of test cases) is up to 10^4, but with the sum of n and k across all test cases being at most 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible sum after k operations without simulating each operation step by step, as that would be too slow.

Let me think about the properties of the operations. Each operation allows me to add the sum of any contiguous subarray to the array. So, effectively, in each operation, I can add any value that is equal to the sum of some contiguous subarray.

To maximize the sum after k operations, I should add the largest possible sum in each operation.

Therefore, I should find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and add that sum in each operation.

Wait, but the array changes after each operation because I'm inserting this sum, which makes the array larger and potentially allows for larger subarrays in the next operations.

However, since I can always choose to add the maximum subarray sum in each operation, and since the maximum subarray sum doesn't necessarily increase with each operation (because I'm adding a new element equal to that sum), I need to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute the total sum after k operations.

Let me denote:

- S: initial sum of the array

- M: maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array

In each operation, I can add M to the array, thereby increasing the sum by M.

So, after k operations, the total sum would be S + k*M.

But, wait, is this correct? Let's see.

In the first operation, I add M to the array, so the sum becomes S + M.

In the second operation, I can again add M to the array, so the sum becomes S + M + M = S + 2*M.

Continuing this way, after k operations, the sum would be S + k*M.

But, in reality, after adding M in the first operation, the array now has an extra element equal to M, which might affect the maximum subarray sum for the next operation.

If M is positive, adding M to the array could potentially allow for larger subarrays that include this new element, possibly increasing the maximum subarray sum in the next operation.

However, if M is negative or zero, adding it won't help much, and the maximum subarray sum might remain the same or not change significantly.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the fact that in each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array.

An important observation is that I can choose to insert the sum of the entire array at any time, which would effectively double the sum of the array (since sum of the array + sum of the array = 2*sum).

But, wait, actually, it's not exactly doubling because when I insert the sum of the entire array, I'm adding one new element equal to the sum, not duplicating all elements.

So, if the sum of the array is S, and I insert S into the array, the new sum becomes S + S = 2*S.

Wait, no. Actually, if I have an array with sum S, and I insert S into the array, the new sum is S + S = 2*S.

But, in the next operation, if I insert 2*S into the array, the new sum becomes 2*S + 2*S = 4*S.

Continuing this way, in each operation, the sum doubles.

So, starting from S, after k operations, the sum would be S * (2^k).

But, this seems too good to be true. Is this actually possible?

Wait, let's check with the example provided.

In the second test case:

n=3, k=3

a = [2, 2, 8]

Sum S = 2 + 2 + 8 = 12

Maximum subarray sum M = 12 (the entire array)

According to my earlier idea, after k=3 operations, sum should be S * (2^k) = 12 * 8 = 96, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2

a = [-4, -7]

Sum S = -11

Maximum subarray sum M = 0 (if we choose an empty subarray)

According to my formula, sum after k operations would be -11 * (2^2) = -44, but the sample output is 999999996, which is -44 modulo 10^9+7.

So, it seems to work in these cases.

Wait, but in the fourth test case:

n=5, k=1

a = [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]

Sum S = 4 - 2 + 8 -12 + 9 = 7

Maximum subarray sum M = 11 (subarray [4, -2, 8, -12, 9] sum is 7, but maybe there's a better one)

Wait, let's compute the maximum subarray sum.

Possible subarrays:

[4] sum=4

[4,-2] sum=2

[4,-2,8] sum=10

[4,-2,8,-12] sum=-4

[4,-2,8,-12,9] sum=7

[-2] sum=-2

[-2,8] sum=6

[-2,8,-12] sum=-6

[-2,8,-12,9] sum= -12 + 9 = -3

[8] sum=8

[8,-12] sum=-4

[8,-12,9] sum=5

[-12] sum=-12

[-12,9] sum=-3

[9] sum=9

So, the maximum subarray sum is 10 (from [4,-2,8]).

According to my earlier formula, sum after k=1 operation would be S + M = 7 + 10 = 17, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but according to my earlier idea that sum after k operations is S * (2^k), in this case, k=1, so it should be S * 2 = 14, but the sample output is 17, which doesn't match.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

What's happening here is that when k=1, inserting the maximum subarray sum M=10 into the array results in the array [4,-2,8,-12,9,10], whose sum is 7 + 10 = 17.

But, according to the formula S * (2^k) = 7 * 2 = 14, which is incorrect.

So, my initial idea is wrong.

Therefore, I need a different approach.

Let me think again.

In each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array.

I need to maximize the sum after k operations.

Let me consider what is the best choice for the subarray to insert in each operation.

If I insert the sum of the current maximum subarray in each operation, I might not be achieving the maximum possible sum.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after inserting a sum, the array changes, and I can choose new subarrays based on the new array.

But, this seems too vague.

Let me try to model this differently.

Let me denote:

- S: initial sum of the array

- M: maximum sum of any contiguous subarray

In the first operation, I can insert M into the array, making the new sum S + M.

In the second operation, I can again insert M into the array, making the new sum S + M + M = S + 2*M.

Continuing this way, after k operations, the sum would be S + k*M.

But, in the fourth test case, S + k*M = 7 + 1*10 = 17, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, S = 12, M = 12, so S + k*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but the sample output is 96, which doesn't match.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the second test case, they perform operations as follows:

[2,2,8] -> insert sum=12, become [2,2,8,12]

-> insert sum=24, become [2,2,8,12,24]

-> insert sum=48, become [2,2,8,12,24,48]

Total sum = 2+2+8+12+24+48 = 96, which matches the sample output.

So, in each operation, they are choosing the entire array and inserting its sum.

Wait, but according to my earlier assumption, M=12, and S + k*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, which is not matching.

So, what's happening is that in each operation, they are choosing the current array and inserting its sum, which effectively doubles the sum.

So, starting with S=12, after first operation: S = 12 + 12 = 24

After second operation: S = 24 + 24 = 48

After third operation: S = 48 + 48 = 96

So, it's doubling the sum in each operation.

But, in the fourth test case, they choose a different subarray.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- If M >= 0, then in each operation, insert M, the maximum subarray sum.

- If M < 0, then it's better to insert 0 in each operation.

Wait, but in the first test case, M=0, and S + k*M = -11 + 2*0 = -11, which modulo 10^9+7 is 999999996, matching the sample output.

So, perhaps the formula is S + k*M, where M is the maximum subarray sum.

But, in the second test case, M=12, S=12, k=3, S + k*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but the sample output is 96.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, in the second test case, they are effectively doubling the sum in each operation.

So, starting with S=12, after first operation: S = 12 + 12 = 24

After second operation: S = 24 + 24 = 48

After third operation: S = 48 + 48 = 96

So, in each operation, they are inserting the current sum S, not the initial M.

But, M was equal to the initial S.

Wait, in this case, M = S = 12.

So, S + k*S = S*(k+1)

For k=3, S=12, S*(k+1)=12*4=48, but sample output is 96.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's S * 2^k.

S * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is S * 2^k.

But, in the fourth test case, S=7, k=1, S * 2^k = 14, but the sample output is 17.

So, this formula doesn't hold in general.

I need to reconcile these observations.

Let me consider that in some cases, inserting the current sum S doubles the sum, but in other cases, inserting a different subarray sum gives a better result.

In the fourth test case, inserting the maximum subarray sum M=10 gives a better result than inserting S=7.

So, perhaps inserting M is better than inserting S in some cases.

Wait, but in the second test case, M=S=12, so inserting M is the same as inserting S.

In the first test case, M=0, S=-11, inserting M=0 in each operation gives S + k*M = -11 + 0 = -11, which matches the sample.

In the fourth test case, M=10, S=7, inserting M=10 gives S + M = 17, which matches the sample.

If in the second test case, M=12=S, inserting M in each operation gives S + k*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but the sample shows 96.

So, perhaps in some cases, M can be updated in each operation, but according to the problem, M is the maximum subarray sum of the initial array.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose to insert any sum of any contiguous subarray, including the entire array.

So, in each operation, I can choose to insert M, where M is the maximum subarray sum of the initial array.

But, as the array grows with each operation, potentially allowing for larger subarrays, but since I can always choose to insert M from the initial array, I can at least add M in each operation.

However, in the second test case, they are choosing to insert the current sum S in each operation, which allows the sum to double each time.

So, perhaps there are two strategies:

1. Insert M (the maximum subarray sum of the initial array) in each operation, leading to S + k*M.

2. Insert the current sum S in each operation, leading to S * 2^k.

I need to choose the strategy that maximizes the sum.

In the first test case, M=0, S=-11, so S + k*M = -11 + 0 = -11, and S * 2^k = -11 * 4 = -44.

Since -11 > -44, the better strategy is to insert M=0 in each operation.

In the second test case, M=12, S=12, S + k*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, and S * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96.

Since 96 > 48, the better strategy is to insert S in each operation.

In the fourth test case, M=10, S=7, S + k*M = 7 + 1*10 = 17, and S * 2^k = 7 * 2 = 14.

Since 17 > 14, the better strategy is to insert M=10 in the single operation.

So, in general, I need to choose the maximum between S + k*M and S * 2^k.

Wait, but in the second test case, M=S, so S + k*M = S + k*S = S*(k+1), and S * 2^k.

In this case, S*(k+1) = 12*4 = 48, and S*2^k = 12*8 = 96.

So, choosing to insert S in each operation gives a better result.

In the fourth test case, S + k*M = 7 + 10 = 17, and S*2^k = 7*2 = 14.

Here, inserting M=10 is better.

In the first test case, S + k*M = -11 + 0 = -11, and S*2^k = -11*4 = -44.

Inserting M=0 is better.

So, the general formula seems to be max(S + k*M, S * 2^k).

But, in the second test case, M=S, so S + k*M = S*(k+1), and S*2^k is better when 2^k > k+1, which is true for k >=1 in most cases.

Wait, but for k=1, 2^1 = 2 and 1+1=2, equal.

For k=2, 2^2=4 and 2+1=3, 4 > 3.

For k=3, 2^3=8 and 3+1=4, 8 > 4.

So, generally, for k >=1, 2^k >= k+1, with equality only at k=1.

But, in the fourth test case, k=1, S + k*M = 7 + 10 = 17, and S*2^k = 7*2 =14.

So, even though 2^k = k+1 when k=1, S + k*M can be better if M > S.

Hence, the general formula should be max(S + k*M, S * 2^k).

Therefore, in the program, we need to compute max(S + k*M, S * 2^k), take it modulo 10^9+7, and output it.

But, in the program provided, it seems to be computing S + k*M, and taking modulo 10^9+7.

Wait, let's look at the code.

From the code:

def func_2(arr):

This function seems to be finding the maximum subarray sum.

It's implementing Kadane's algorithm or something similar.

Then, in the main part:

max_segment = func_2(a)

if max_segment[0] == -1:

max_segment[0] = 0

answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

print(func_1(answer))

Wait, this seems confusing.

First, it finds the maximum subarray sum using func_2(a), which returns max_segment[0].

If max_segment[0] == -1, it sets it to 0. I think this is to handle the case when all elements are negative.

Then, answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

This seems different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, let's see:

sum(a) is S.

max_segment[0] is M.

So, answer = M * 2^k + S - M

= S + M * (2^k - 1)

Is this equivalent to S * 2^k?

Wait, no.

Wait, in the second test case, S=12, M=12, k=3.

answer = 12 * 8 + 12 - 12 = 96 + 0 = 96, which matches the sample.

In the fourth test case, S=7, M=10, k=1.

answer = 10 * 2 + 7 - 10 = 20 + 7 -10 = 17, which matches the sample.

In the first test case, S=-11, M=0, k=2.

answer = 0 * 4 + (-11) - 0 = 0 + (-11) - 0 = -11, which matches the sample.

So, this formula seems to work.

But, why is this formula correct?

Let me try to understand.

If I choose to insert M in each operation, then after k operations, the sum would be S + k*M.

But, in reality, by choosing to insert S in each operation, the sum becomes S * 2^k.

However, in the program, it's computing M * 2^k + S - M.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that in each operation, I'm inserting M, but also the sum of the array is growing in a certain way.

Wait, maybe it's modeling that the inserted M's are themselves being inserted in subsequent operations.

But, I'm still not sure.

Let me see for k=1:

answer = M * 2 + S - M = M + S

Which is S + M, matching the fourth test case.

For k=2:

answer = M * 4 + S - M = 3*M + S

But, in the first test case, M=0, so answer = 0 + (-11) = -11.

But, according to the earlier strategy, S + k*M = -11 + 0 = -11, which matches.

In the second test case, k=3:

answer = 12 * 8 + 12 -12 = 96, which matches.

So, perhaps this formula is correct.

But, I need to verify if this formula is generally correct.

Let me consider a simple case:

n=1, k=1, a=[1]

S=1, M=1

According to the formula, answer = 1 * 2 + 1 -1 = 2

But, in reality:

Original array: [1]

Operation 1: choose subarray [1], sum=1, insert 1 => [1,1], sum=2

So, it matches.

Another case:

n=1, k=2, a=[1]

answer = 1 * 4 +1 -1 = 4

Actual:

[1] -> insert 1 -> [1,1] -> insert 1 -> [1,1,1], sum=3

Wait, doesn't match.

So, in this case, the formula gives 4, but the actual sum is 3.

Wait, there must be something wrong with the formula.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

In the code:

answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

But, in the operation, it's inserting the sum of a subarray, but in this case, M=1, sum(a)=1.

So, answer =1*4 +1 -1=4, but actual sum after 2 operations is 3.

So, the formula is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, you perform exactly k operations, inserting the sum of a subarray in each operation.

In this case, starting with [1], sum=1.

Operation 1: insert 1, array becomes [1,1], sum=2.

Operation 2: insert 1, array becomes [1,1,1], sum=3.

So, final sum is 3, but according to the formula, it's 4.

Hence, the formula is incorrect.

So, perhaps the program is wrong.

But, in the sample inputs, it seems to give correct answers.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in the second test case, inserting S in each operation leads to S * 2^k.

In the fourth test case, inserting M leads to S + k*M.

But, in the simple case I considered, inserting M=1 in each operation leads to S + k*M =1 +1*2=3, which matches the actual sum.

Wait, but according to the formula in the code, it's M*2^k + S - M =1*4 +1 -1=4, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose to insert either M or S.

But, in reality, S changes after each operation, but in the code, it's using a fixed formula.

I need to find a general formula that works for all cases.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S + M * (2^k -1).

In the second test case, S=12, M=12, so 12 +12*(8-1)=12 +84=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, S=7, M=10, 7 +10*(2-1)=7+10=17, which matches.

In the first test case, S=-11, M=0, -11 +0*(2-1)=-11, which matches.

In my simple test case, S=1, M=1, k=2, sum=1 +1*(4-1)=1+3=4, but actual sum is 3, so it doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to cap M to be less than or equal to S in some way.

Wait, in the simple test case, M=1, S=1, k=2.

If I insert M=1 in each operation:

After op1: [1,1], sum=2

After op2: [1,1,1], sum=3

So, sum=3.

But, according to the formula S + M*(2^k -1)=1 +1*(3)=4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S + M * (2^k -1 -k), but 1 +1*(3-2)=2, which is still not 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's S * 2^k if M >= S, else S + k*M.

In the second test case, M=S=12, so S*2^k=12*8=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, M=10 > S=7, so S + k*M=7+10=17, which matches.

In the first test case, M=0 < S=-11, so S + k*M=-11 +0=-11, which matches.

In my simple test case, M=1 = S=1, so S*2^k=1*4=4, but actual sum is 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps my condition is incorrect.

Maybe if M >= S, use S * 2^k, else use S + k*M.

But, in the simple test case, M=1, S=1, so M >= S, use S*2^k=4, but actual sum is 3.

So, this doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider if M > S, use S + k*M, else use S * 2^k.

In the second test case, M=12=S, so use S*2^k=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, M=10 > S=7, so use S + k*M=17, which matches.

In the first test case, M=0 > S=-11, so use S + k*M=-11 +0=-11, which matches.

In my simple test case, M=1 > S=1? No, M=1 == S=1, so use S*2^k=4, but actual sum is 3.

So, the formula seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be if M > S, use S + k*M, else use S * 2^k.

In the simple test case, M=1 == S=1, so use S*2^k=4, but actual sum is 3.

So, perhaps this formula isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when M == S, inserting S in each operation gives S*2^k, but inserting M in each operation gives S + k*M.

So, in such cases, I need to choose the maximum between S + k*M and S * 2^k.

In the simple test case, S=1, M=1, k=2.

S + k*M =1 +2*1=3

S * 2^k =1*4=4

So, max(3,4)=4, but actual sum is 3.

Hence, the formula is still not accurate.

Therefore, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose to insert either M or S, but S changes after each insertion.

This seems too complicated to model directly.

An alternative approach is to realize that the maximum sum is achieved by choosing to insert the largest possible value in each operation.

Given that, in each operation, the largest value I can insert is M, the maximum subarray sum.

Therefore, the sum after k operations should be S + k*M.

However, in the second test case, this doesn't hold, as inserting M=S in each operation allows the sum to double each time, leading to S*2^k.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is the larger of S + k*M and S*2^k.

In the second test case, max(12 + 3*12=48, 12*8=96)=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, max(7 +1*10=17, 7*2=14)=17, which matches.

In the first test case, max(-11 +0= -11, -11*4=-44)= -11, which matches.

In my simple test case, max(1 +2*1=3, 1*4=4)=4, but actual sum is 3, so it doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to be max(S + k*M, S * 2^k, M * (2^k -1) + S).

Wait, in the simple test case, M=1, S=1, k=2.

Compute S + k*M =1 +2*1=3

S * 2^k =1*4=4

M*(2^k -1) + S=1*3 +1=4

So, max is 4, which still doesn't match the actual sum of 3.

This suggests that the formula is overestimating the sum in some cases.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be S * 2^k if M == S, else S + k*M.

In the second test case, M==S, so use S*2^k=96.

In the fourth test case, M != S, use S +k*M=17.

In the first test case, M != S, use S +k*M=-11.

In the simple test case, M==S, use S*2^k=4.

But, in the simple test case, actual sum is 3, which is less than 4.

So, the formula is still incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me think about the operations more carefully.

In each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array.

I can choose different subarrays in different operations.

But, to maximize the sum, I should choose the subarray with the maximum sum in each operation.

However, after inserting a sum, the array changes, so the maximum subarray sum might change.

But, if I choose to insert M in each operation, the sum becomes S + k*M.

Alternatively, if I choose to insert the current sum S in each operation, the sum becomes S * 2^k.

But, in reality, S changes after each insertion.

Wait, perhaps I can model the sum after k operations as S * 2^k - S + k*M.

But, in the second test case, S=12, M=12, k=3, so 12*8 -12 +3*12=96 -12 +36=120, which doesn't match the sample output of 96.

So, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's S + M * (2^k -1).

In the second test case, 12 +12*(7)=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, 7 +10*(1)=17, which matches.

In the first test case, -11 +0*(1)= -11, which matches.

In the simple test case, 1 +1*(1)=2, but actual sum is 3.

So, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that M can be inserted in each operation, leading to S + k*M, or S can be inserted in each operation, leading to S * 2^k, and choose the maximum.

Then, in the simple test case, max(1 +2*1=3, 1*4=4)=4, but actual sum is 3.

So, perhaps in some cases, choosing to insert M in each operation is better, in other cases inserting S is better.

But, in the simple test case, inserting M=1 in each operation gives sum=3, while inserting S=1 in each operation gives sum=4.

So, inserting S is better.

But, according to the formula, it's M*(2^k -1) + S =1*3 +1=4, which matches the choice of inserting S.

But, in reality, inserting M in each operation gives sum=3, while inserting S in each operation gives sum=4.

So, perhaps the formula should be M * (2^k -1) + S, but in the simple test case, it gives 4, which is achievable by inserting S in each operation.

But, in the fourth test case, M=10, S=7, k=1.

M*(2^1 -1) + S=10*1 +7=17, which matches the sample.

In the second test case, M=12, S=12, k=3.

12*7 +12=96, which matches.

In the first test case, M=0, S=-11, k=2.

0*3 + (-11)=-11, which matches.

So, perhaps the correct formula is M * (2^k -1) + S.

In the simple test case, M=1, S=1, k=2.

1*3 +1=4, which is what the program seems to compute, but in reality, by inserting M=1 in each operation, sum=3.

Wait, but in the simple test case, choosing to insert S=1 in each operation gives sum=4, which matches the formula.

So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether to insert M or S in each operation.

Wait, perhaps the formula M*(2^k -1) + S is always greater than or equal to S + k*M.

In the second test case, M=12, S=12, k=3.

M*(7)+12=96, S +k*M=12 +36=48, so 96 >=48.

In the fourth test case, M=10, S=7, k=1.

M*(1)+7=17, S +k*M=17, so equal.

In the first test case, M=0, S=-11, k=2.

0*3 + (-11)=-11, S +k*M=-11 +0=-11, equal.

In the simple test case, M=1, S=1, k=2.

1*3 +1=4, S +k*M=1 +2=3, so 4 >=3.

So, perhaps M*(2^k -1) + S is the correct formula.

But, in the simple test case, to achieve sum=4, I need to insert S in each operation.

But, inserting M in each operation gives sum=3.

So, perhaps the formula M*(2^k -1) + S represents the sum when inserting S in each operation.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the simple test case, inserting S=1 in each operation gives sum=1*2^k -1 =1* (2^2 -1)=3, but actual sum is 3 when inserting M=1 in each operation.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think recursively.

Let me denote sum after k operations as f(k).

In each operation, I can choose to insert any contiguous subarray's sum, say m, into the array.

Then, f(k) = f(k-1) + m, where m is the sum of some contiguous subarray of the array before the k-th operation.

But, this recursive relation is too vague to derive a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in each operation, I can choose to insert the current sum S, effectively doubling the sum.

But, in reality, the sum doesn't necessarily double because inserting S adds S to the current sum, making the new sum 2*S, but in subsequent operations, the sum could be larger if I choose a different subarray.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum possible sum after k operations, which is achieved by inserting S in each operation, leading to S * 2^k.

But, in some cases, inserting M (which is greater than S) in each operation gives a better sum.

Wait, but in the simple test case, M=1, S=1, k=2:

Inserting M=1 in each operation: sum=1 +1 +1=3

Inserting S in each operation:

Operation 1: insert S=1, sum=2

Operation 2: insert S=2, sum=4

So, sum=4, which is better.

Hence, the strategy of inserting S in each operation is better when M == S.

In general, if M == S, inserting S in each operation is better, leading to S * 2^k.

If M < S, inserting M in each operation gives S + k*M.

If M > S, inserting M in each operation gives S + k*M.

So, the maximum sum is:

- If M == S, then S * 2^k

- Else, S + k*M

But, in the simple test case, M == S=1, so sum=1*4=4

But, in reality, by inserting M=1 in each operation, sum=3, which is less than 4.

Hence, the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, perhaps it's max(S * 2^k, S + k*M)

In the simple test case, max(4,3)=4, which matches the achievable sum by inserting S in each operation.

So, perhaps the correct formula is max(S * 2^k, S + k*M)

But, in the fourth test case, M=10, S=7, so max(7*2,7+10)=max(14,17)=17, which matches the sample.

In the first test case, M=0, S=-11, max(-11*4,-11 +0)=max(-44,-11)=-11, which matches.

In the second test case, M=12, S=12, max(12*8,12+3*12)=max(96,48)=96, which matches.

Hence, the formula is max(S * 2^k, S + k*M)

Therefore, the program should compute this and output it modulo 10^9+7.

Now, looking back at the provided program:

answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

Wait, no, it's:

answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]

Which simplifies to:

answer = sum(a) + max_segment[0] * (2**k -1)

Wait, in the fourth test case, sum(a)=7, max_segment[0]=10, k=1

answer=7 +
