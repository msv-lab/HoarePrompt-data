Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR-ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to have the bitwise OR of all these n numbers have as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of all the numbers in the sequence. That means I want as many bits to be set to 1 in the OR operation as possible.

Given that OR operation sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1, I need to ensure that for each bit position, at least one number in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

To maximize the number of 1s, I need to have as many bit positions as possible where at least one number has that bit set to 1.

So, essentially, I need to spread out the 1s across different bit positions in the sequence.

But, there's a constraint: the sum of all the numbers in the sequence must be equal to k.

So, I need to distribute the sum k across n numbers such that their OR has as many 1s as possible in its binary representation.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

If n = 1, then I have only one number, which must be k. So, the OR is just k, and the number of 1s is the number of 1s in the binary representation of k.

If n = k, I can have n-1 zeros and one k, but that's similar to the n=1 case.

But I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, so perhaps spreading out the 1s across different numbers is better.

Wait, but OR operation will set a bit to 1 if any of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many different bit positions set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

In other words, I need to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one 1.

Given that, perhaps the best way is to have each number in the sequence contribute a unique set of 1s in different bit positions.

But, I also need to ensure that the sum is exactly k.

So, maybe I can start by identifying all the bit positions in k and then assigning the necessary values to the numbers in the sequence to cover those bit positions.

Wait, let's think in terms of the binary representation of k.

Let's say k is 5, which is 101 in binary.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have numbers in the sequence that cover both the least significant bit and the third least significant bit.

For example, if n=2, I can have [1,4], which are 01 and 100 in binary. The OR would be 101, which is 5, having two 1s.

Alternatively, I could have [5,0], which would have OR as 5, also having two 1s.

So, in this case, both achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

But, according to the problem, multiple solutions are possible; I just need to output any one of them.

Now, let's consider another example.

Suppose n=2 and k=3.

3 in binary is 11.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have numbers that cover both bit positions.

Possible sequences:

[1,2]: 01 OR 10 = 11, which has two 1s.

[3,0]: 11 OR 00 = 11, which has two 1s.

[1,1]: 01 OR 01 = 01, which has one 1.

So, [1,2] and [3,0] are better than [1,1].

Hence, in this case, [1,2] is a good solution.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need to select n numbers that sum to k, and their OR should have as many 1s as possible.

One approach could be:

- Identify all the bit positions that are set in k.

- Assign numbers to the sequence such that each set bit in k is covered by at least one number.

- Additionally, ensure that the sum is exactly k.

But, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, which is equivalent to covering as many bit positions as possible.

Wait, but k determines the bit positions that need to be covered.

So, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of set bits in k.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that it's possible to have more 1s in the OR than are present in k.

Wait, is that possible?

Wait, no. Because the OR can't have more 1s than are present in any individual number, since OR sets a bit to 1 only if at least one number has that bit set to 1.

Wait, actually, no. The OR can have a 1 in a bit position only if at least one number has that bit set to 1.

So, the OR can't have more 1s than the number of set bits in k.

Wait, but k is the sum of the numbers, and the OR is a different operation.

Wait, but actually, the OR can have more 1s than are in k.

Wait, no. Because if a bit is not set in k, it means that no number in the sequence has that bit set, because if any number had that bit set, it would contribute to the sum k.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum k is the sum of the numbers, whereas the OR is bit-wise OR.

It's possible for the OR to have more 1s than k, because some bits might be set in different numbers but not in k due to carry-over in addition.

Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

Suppose k has a certain binary representation, and the numbers in the sequence have their own binary representations.

The sum k is the arithmetic sum of these numbers, considering carry-over in addition.

However, the OR is a bit-wise operation, independent of addition.

But, in practice, the OR can have at most the same number of 1s as the number of bit positions where at least one number has a 1.

So, the OR can't have more 1s than the number of distinct bit positions where at least one number has a 1.

But, in the sum k, some bit positions might be set due to carry-over from addition, which doesn't directly correspond to any single number having that bit set.

Wait, perhaps the OR can have fewer 1s than are in k, but not more.

Wait, let's take an example.

Suppose k = 3, which is 11 in binary.

If n=2, and I choose [1,2], which are 01 and 10, their sum is 3, and their OR is 11, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, if I choose [3,0], which are 11 and 00, their OR is 11, again two 1s.

Or [1,2] gives the same.

So, in this case, the number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of set bits in k.

Is it possible to have more?

Wait, no, because the OR can't introduce new 1s that aren't present in any of the numbers.

Wait, but in some cases, perhaps with higher bits.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me consider k=5, which is 101 in binary.

If n=2, and I choose [5,0], OR is 101, which has two 1s.

If I choose [1,4], which are 01 and 100, OR is 101, again two 1s.

If I choose [3,2], which are 011 and 010, OR is 011, which has two 1s.

Wait, but k=5 has two 1s in binary.

So, in all these cases, the OR has two 1s.

Is there a way to make the OR have more than two 1s?

Wait, no, because k=5 only has two bits set, and the OR can't have more 1s than that.

Wait, unless I have numbers with additional bits set, but then the sum would exceed k.

Wait, for example, if I have n=3, k=5.

I could have [1,2,2], which sum to 5.

Their OR is 1 | 10 | 10 = 11, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, [1,4,0], which sum to 5, OR is 1 | 100 | 0 = 101, which has two 1s.

So, again, it seems like the OR can't have more 1s than the number of set bits in k.

Wait, but in the problem statement, in the fourth test case, they have 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101 111 in binary, which has five 1s.

Wait, let's check that.

3 is 000011

1 is 000001

1 is 000001

32 is 100000

2 is 000010

12 is 001100

OR-ing them together:

- Bit 0: 1

- Bit 1: 1

- Bit 2: 1 (from 3,12)

- Bit 3: 1 (from 12)

- Bit 4: 1 (from 32)

- Bit 5: 0

So, OR is 101111, which is 47 in decimal, and it has five 1s.

But k=51.

Wait, but 51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1s.

Wait, but the OR is 101111, which is 47, and has five 1s, which is more than the number of 1s in k=51.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is indeed 110011, which is six in decimal, wait no, 32+16+2+1=51, so 110011.

But the OR is 101111, which is 47, which has five 1s.

But 47 < 51, so how is their sum 51?

Wait, in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51, and OR is 101111, which is 47, with five 1s.

Wait, but how is their sum 51?

Let's add them up: 3+1+1+32+2+12 = 3+1=4, +1=5, +32=37, +2=39, +12=51. Yes, sum is 51.

So, their OR is 101111, which is 47, with five 1s.

But k=51 is 110011, which also has four 1s.

Wait, but 110011 is 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0 + 0 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 32+16+2+1=51.

So, it's 110011, which has four 1s.

But the OR is 101111, which is 47, and has five 1s.

Wait, that seems contradictory because k=51 has four 1s, and the OR has five 1s.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between k and the OR.

Wait, k is the sum of the numbers, and the OR is a separate operation.

But in this case, the OR has more 1s than k.

Is that allowed?

Wait, yes, because the OR is not constrained by the sum k in terms of the number of 1s.

The sum k can have carry-over bits, which don't directly correspond to any single bit in the OR.

So, it is possible for the OR to have more 1s than k.

In this example, k=51 (110011) has four 1s, and the OR of the sequence is 101111, which has five 1's.

So, in this case, the OR has more 1s than k.

Hence, my earlier assumption that the OR can't have more 1s than the number of set bits in k is incorrect.

So, I need to rethink that.

Perhaps the OR can have more 1s than are present in k, as long as the sum of the numbers is k.

So, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, without violating the sum constraint.

Alright, so how to approach this.

I need to select n numbers that sum to k, and their OR has as many 1s as possible.

One way to maximize the number of 1s in the OR is to set as many bits to 1 in at least one of the numbers as possible.

Given that, I should try to set different bits in different numbers, as long as the sum allows it.

But, since the sum is k, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that their OR has as many 1s as possible.

Perhaps, I can start by identifying all the bits that can be set in the OR, starting from the least significant bit upwards, and assign them to different numbers if possible, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

But, I need to ensure that the sum is exactly k.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of minimizing the waste in the sum while maximizing the OR's 1s.

Wait, perhaps another way: to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bits set in at least one number as possible.

So, I should try to set different bits in different numbers, as much as possible, without exceeding the sum k.

But, since the numbers can be reused in the OR, meaning that if multiple numbers have the same bit set, the OR will still have that bit set only once.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have each bit set in at least one number.

Hence, the maximum possible number of 1s in the OR is the number of bits in the highest number required to represent k, but possibly more if the distribution allows.

Wait, but in the example, OR had five 1s while k had four 1s.

So, perhaps the maximum number of 1s in OR is not limited by the number of 1s in k.

So, perhaps the strategy is to set as many bits as possible to 1 in the OR, which means having each bit set in at least one number in the sequence.

Given that, I need to find a way to distribute k across n numbers such that as many bits as possible are set in at least one number.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should aim to set the smallest bits in separate numbers, if possible, because smaller bits can be set without affecting higher bits, and higher bits can be used to make up the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should start by identifying all the bits that are set in k and try to assign each of these bits to different numbers in the sequence.

Then, if there's still sum left, I can distribute it among the numbers, preferably setting higher bits to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, but setting higher bits in addition to the lower bits might not necessarily increase the number of 1s in the OR, because if a higher bit is already set in the OR by another number, setting it again won't increase the number of 1s in the OR.

So, perhaps the best way is to assign each bit position that is set in k to a different number, and then distribute the remaining sum among these numbers.

But, if n is larger than the number of set bits in k, I need to decide how to assign the remaining numbers.

Also, if k is larger than the number of set bits, I need to distribute the excess sum among the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should identify all the bit positions that can be set in the OR and try to set as many of them as possible in the sequence.

Given that, I can iterate through the bit positions from the least significant bit to the most significant bit and assign each bit to a different number in the sequence, as long as the sum allows it.

Then, after assigning these bits, I can distribute the remaining sum among the numbers.

Wait, perhaps more concretely:

1. Identify all the bit positions that can be set in the OR.

2. Assign each of these bit positions to a different number in the sequence, if possible.

3. Then, distribute the remaining sum among the numbers.

But, how do I know which bit positions can be set in the OR?

Well, any bit position from 0 up to the highest bit in k can be considered.

Wait, but in the example, they had bit positions up to 5 (32 is 2^5), even though k=51 is 110011, which is up to bit position 5.

So, perhaps I need to consider all bit positions up to the highest bit in k.

Then, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many of these bits as possible in at least one number in the sequence.

Given that, if n is greater than or equal to the number of bit positions, I can set each bit in a different number, and set the remaining sum to zeros.

But, if n is less than the number of bit positions, I need to decide how to assign the bits to the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize setting the lower bits first, since they are smaller in value and easier to distribute.

Wait, but in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the OR, it's about setting as many different bits as possible in at least one number.

Hence, I should try to set each bit in a different number, up to n numbers.

Then, distribute the remaining sum among these numbers.

Wait, perhaps in code, I can:

- Identify all the bit positions that are set in k.

- Assign each of these bit positions to a different number in the sequence, if possible.

- Then, distribute the remaining sum among these numbers.

- If n is larger than the number of set bits, assign zeros to the remaining numbers.

But, in the example where n=2, k=5, they have [5,0], which corresponds to OR=5 (101), which has two 1s.

Alternatively, [1,4] also gives OR=5 (101), which has two 1s.

But, k=5 has two 1s in binary, and the OR also has two 1s.

In another example where n=6, k=51, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51 and OR to 101111 (47), which has five 1s.

Wait, but k=51 is 110011, which has four 1s, but the OR has five 1s.

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the OR.

Let me calculate the OR again:

Numbers: 3 (000011), 1 (000001), 1 (000001), 32 (100000), 2 (000010), 12 (001100)

OR:

- Bit 0: 1 (from 1,3)

- Bit 1: 1 (from 1,3,2,12)

- Bit 2: 1 (from 12)

- Bit 3: 1 (from 12)

- Bit 4: 1 (from 32)

- Bit 5: 0

Wait, so OR is 101111, which is 47, with five 1s.

But k=51 is 110011, which is 32+16+2+1=51, and has four 1s.

So, how is it possible for the OR to have five 1s when k has four 1s?

Wait, perhaps there is no constraint that the OR can't have more 1s than k.

Wait, but in terms of the sum, k is the sum of the numbers, and the OR is just the bitwise OR.

There is no direct relationship between the number of 1s in k and the OR, except that the OR can have at most the number of bits in k.

But in this case, the OR has five 1s, and k has four 1s.

So, it seems like the OR can have more 1s than k.

Hence, my earlier assumption was wrong.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum number of 1s in the OR is not limited by the number of 1s in k.

So, perhaps the goal is to set as many bits as possible to 1 in the OR, up to the highest bit in k.

Wait, but in the example, they have five 1s in the OR, even though k has four 1s.

So, perhaps I need to consider all the bits up to the highest bit in k and set as many of them as possible in at least one number.

Given that, perhaps the strategy is to assign the smallest possible numbers with distinct bits set, and then assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

Wait, perhaps more concretely:

- Identify the highest bit in k.

- Then, assign numbers with distinct bits set, starting from the lowest bit, up to the highest bit, to different numbers in the sequence.

- Then, assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

But, in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sets bits as follows:

- 3: 11

- 1: 1

- 1: 1

- 32: 100000

- 2: 10

- 12: 1100

So, bits set:

- Bit 0: set in 1,3

- Bit 1: set in 1,3,2,12

- Bit 2: set in 12

- Bit 3: set in 12

- Bit 4: set in 32

- Bit 5: not set

Hence, OR is 101111, which has bits 0,1,2,3,4 set.

So, they managed to set five bits, even though k=51 has bits 1,4,5 set (110011).

Wait, no, 51 in binary is 110011, which is bits 1,4,5 set.

But the OR has bits 0,1,2,3,4 set.

So, how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps there is no direct correlation between the number of 1s in k and the OR.

Because k is the sum, which is influenced by carry-over in addition, whereas OR is just the bitwise OR.

Hence, they are different operations.

Therefore, perhaps the goal is to set as many bits as possible to 1 in at least one number in the sequence.

Given that, perhaps the strategy is to assign 1 to as many numbers as possible, up to the number of bits needed.

Wait, but 1 sets only bit 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign numbers with distinct bits set, up to the highest bit in k, and then assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

Wait, perhaps in code, I can:

- Identify all the bit positions up to the highest bit in k.

- Assign each of these bit positions to a different number in the sequence, if possible.

- Then, distribute the remaining sum among these numbers.

But, in practice, I need to make sure that the sum is exactly k.

Wait, perhaps more concretely:

- Find the bit mask that corresponds to the OR of the sequence.

- To maximize the number of 1s in this OR, I need to set as many bits as possible to 1 in at least one number.

- To do this, I can assign numbers that have single bits set, up to the number of n.

- If n is larger than the number of bits needed, assign zeros to the remaining numbers.

But, in the example, they have more than just single bits set; some numbers have multiple bits set.

Hence, perhaps a better approach is:

- Identify the bits that are set in k.

- Assign each of these bits to different numbers.

- Then, assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

- Additionally, set other bits in numbers to maximize the OR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to be attempting to identify the bits set in k and assigning corresponding values to the sequence.

Let me look at the code.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

l1 = input().split()

(n, k) = list(map(int, l1))

arr = []

k0 = k

i = 0

while k:

if k & 1 == 1:

arr.append(i)

k = k >> 1

i += 1

ans = []

c = 0

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, what this code does is:

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and k.

- Initializes an empty list arr.

- Copies k to k0.

- Initializes i to 0.

- While k is not zero:

- If the least significant bit of k is 1, append i to arr.

- Right shift k by 1.

- Increment i.

- Initializes ans as an empty list.

- Initializes c to 0.

- Iterates through arr:

- If c == n - 1, appends the remaining sum (k0 - sum(ans)) to ans and breaks.

- Else, appends 1 << i to ans and increment c.

- Appends zeros to ans to make its length up to n.

- Prints the sequence.

So, in essence:

- It identifies the positions of set bits in k, starting from the least significant bit.

- Assigns 2^i to the sequence for each set bit position i.

- For the last number, assigns the remaining sum to make the total sum k.

- If there are more numbers than set bits, fills the remaining with zeros.

Wait, but in the example where n=2, k=5, it would identify bits 0 and 2 as set in k=5 (101).

So, arr would be [0,2].

Then, it would assign 1<<0=1 and 1<<2=4 to the first two numbers, and the remaining sum is 5 - 1 - 4 = 0, but since n=2, it stops after assigning the first two numbers and doesn't need to append zeros.

Hence, the sequence would be [1,4], which sums to 5 and OR to 5 (101), which has two 1s.

Another sequence could be [5,0], which also sums to 5 and OR to 5 (101), which has two 1s.

So, both are acceptable.

In the fourth example, n=6, k=51.

k=51 is 110011 in binary, which has bits 1,4,5 set.

So, arr would be [1,4,5].

Then, it would assign 1<<1=2, 1<<4=16, 1<<5=32 to the first three numbers.

Then, the remaining sum is 51 - 2 -16 -32 = 1.

Since n=6, it would assign the remaining sum of 1 to the fourth number, and the remaining two numbers would be zeros.

Hence, the sequence would be [2,16,32,1,0,0], which sums to 51 and OR to 1|16|32|2|0|0 = 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Wait, but in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51 and OR to 101111 (47), which has five 1s.

So, both sequences achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, the code's approach seems acceptable.

But, in the code, it seems to identify the set bits in k and assign corresponding powers of two to the sequence, and then assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

This way, it ensures that the OR has those bits set, and possibly more if the remaining sum allows setting additional bits in some numbers.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Approach

1. **Identify Set Bits in `k`**:
   - Determine the positions of set bits in `k` by continuously checking the least significant bit and right-shifting `k`.

2. **Assign Values to Sequence**:
   - Assign values corresponding to the identified set bits to the sequence. This ensures that these bits are set in the bitwise OR.
   - Assign the remaining sum to one of the sequence elements to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Pad with Zeros if Necessary**:
   - If there are more elements in the sequence than set bits, pad the remaining elements with zeros.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

# Example Usage
# func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Identify the positions of set bits in `k` and store them in `arr`.
   - Initialize an empty list `ans` to build the sequence.
   - Assign values corresponding to the set bits to `ans`, ensuring that the sum of these values does not exceed `k`.
   - Assign the remaining sum to the last element if necessary.
   - Pad the sequence with zeros if `n` is greater than the number of set bits.

3. **Output the Sequence**:
   - Print the sequence for each test case.

This approach ensures that the sequence sums to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. 

## Correctness
**True**
