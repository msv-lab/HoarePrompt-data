Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each turn, the player picks a card from their hand and plays it on the table. If the number on that card is already on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she tries to minimize my points. I need to figure out the maximum points I can get if I play optimally as well.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. Since there are 2n cards and each number appears twice, some numbers might be in both players' hands, and some might be only in one player's hand.

Let's think about the distribution of the numbers. For each number from 1 to n:

- If both cards are in my hand, then when I play the first one, there's no point, but when I play the second one, there is already one on the table, so I get a point.

- If both cards are in Nene's hand, then when she plays the first one, no point, and when she plays the second one, she gets a point.

- If one card is in my hand and the other is in Nene's hand, then whoever plays their card first will not get a point, and the second player to play that number will get a point.

The key here is to maximize my points while considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let's consider the example given:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

In the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. So Nene has 2,3,4,4.

The explanation says that I can get 1 point, and Nene gets 3.

Let me try to simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play 1, table: [1], my points: 0

- Turn 2: Nene plays 4, table: [1,4], Nene points: 0

- Turn 3: I play 1, table: [1,4,1], my points: 1 (since 1 is already on the table)

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,4], Nene points: 1

- Turn 5: I play 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2], my points: 1

- Turn 6: Nene plays 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2], Nene points: 2

- Turn 7: I play 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3], my points: 1

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3], Nene points: 3

So, I ended up with 1 point, and Nene with 3.

Is there a better way for me to play? Let's try a different sequence:

- Turn 1: I play 2, table: [2], my points: 0

- Turn 2: Nene plays 4, table: [2,4], Nene points: 0

- Turn 3: I play 3, table: [2,4,3], my points: 0

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4, table: [2,4,3,4], Nene points: 1

- Turn 5: I play 1, table: [2,4,3,4,1], my points: 0

- Turn 6: Nene plays 1, table: [2,4,3,4,1,1], Nene points: 2

- Turn 7: I play 1, but I already played one 1, so I don't have another 1. Wait, I had two 1's initially, but I already played one. So, I can't play another 1. Wait, in the first simulation, I played two 1's, but in this simulation, I only played one 1. Wait, no, in the first simulation, I played two 1's: first 1 and then 1 again, getting a point the second time.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the hand.

Wait, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

So, in the second simulation, if I play 2 first, then 3, then 1, and then the second 1.

But in that case, when I play the second 1, there's already a 1 on the table, so I get a point.

But Nene can play her cards in a way to maximize her points.

Wait, perhaps the order doesn't matter, and there's a mathematical way to calculate the maximum points I can get.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that for each number that appears twice, there are two cards.

Depending on who has the two cards, the points can be distributed differently.

Case 1: Both cards are in my hand.

Then, I can play one card without getting a point, and the second card gets a point for me.

Case 2: Both cards are in Nene's hand.

Then, she plays one without a point, and the second with a point.

Case 3: One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

Then, whoever plays their card first doesn't get a point, and the second player to play that number gets a point.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, I need to strategize accordingly.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on who has the cards.

For each number from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then I can get 1 point from that number.

- If Nene has both cards, then she gets 1 point from that number.

- If one card is mine and one is Nene's, then the player who plays their card second gets the point.

Since Nene plays optimally against me, she will try to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the case where one card is mine and one is Nene's, the order in which we play the cards matters.

But since the game is deterministic and both players play optimally, perhaps there is a way to calculate the points without simulating the entire game.

Let me think about it in terms of the number of pairs.

If I have both cards of a number, I get 1 point.

If Nene has both cards of a number, she gets 1 point.

If we each have one card of a number, then one of us will get 1 point, depending on who plays second.

Nene, being smart, will try to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, in the case where one card is mine and one is hers, she will play her card in such a way that minimizes my potential points.

Wait, more carefully:

- For numbers where I have both cards, I will get 1 point.

- For numbers where Nene has both cards, she will get 1 point.

- For numbers where one card is mine and one is hers, the point will go to the player who plays their card second.

Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will try to get the point for herself in these mixed-number cases.

So, in the mixed cases, Nene will get the point.

Wait, but it depends on the sequence of plays.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as:

- For each number where I have both cards, I get 1 point.

- For each number where Nene has both cards, she gets 1 point.

- For each number where one card is mine and one is hers, Nene, playing optimally, can ensure that she gets the point.

Therefore, in the mixed cases, Nene gets the point.

So, my total points would be equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, is that right?

Let me check with the first example.

In the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

Numbers:

1: I have both

2: one in my hand, one in Nene's

3: one in my hand, one in Nene's

4: Nene has both

So, according to this, I get 1 point from number 1.

From numbers 2 and 3, Nene will get the points because it's one each.

From number 4, Nene gets 1 point.

So, total points:

Me: 1

Nene: 3

Which matches the example.

So, in general, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but is that always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=2

My cards: 1,2

Nene's cards: 1,2

Numbers:

1: one in my hand, one in Nene's

2: one in my hand, one in Nene's

So, according to the earlier logic, Nene would get both points.

But let's simulate:

- I play 1, table: [1], my points: 0

- Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], Nene points: 1

- I play 2, table: [1,1,2], my points: 0

- Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], Nene points: 2

So, I get 0 points, Nene gets 2 points.

Which matches the earlier logic.

Another example:

n=3

My cards: 1,1,2

Nene's cards: 2,3,3

Numbers:

1: I have both

2: one in my hand, one in Nene's

3: Nene has both

So, I should get 1 point from number 1.

Nene gets 1 point from number 3.

And from number 2, Nene gets the point.

So, total:

Me: 1

Nene: 2

Seems consistent.

Wait, but let's think about a more complex case.

Suppose n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

Numbers:

1: one in my hand, one in Nene's

2: one in my hand, one in Nene's

3: one in my hand, one in Nene's

So, according to the earlier logic, Nene gets all 3 points.

But let's see:

- I play 1, table: [1], my points: 0

- Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], Nene points: 1

- I play 2, table: [1,1,2], my points: 0

- Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], Nene points: 2

- I play 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3], my points: 0

- Nene plays 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3,3], Nene points: 3

So, again, I get 0 points.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if in some cases, Nene has to give me a point?

Is there any scenario where Nene has to let me get a point?

Let me think.

Suppose n=3

My cards: 1,1,2

Nene's cards: 2,3,3

As before, I get 1 point from number 1, and Nene gets points from number 2 and 3.

Wait, but in this case, Nene can choose to play number 3 first, then number 2.

Let's see:

- I play 1, table: [1], my points: 0

- Nene plays 3, table: [1,3], Nene points: 0

- I play 1, table: [1,3,1], my points: 1

- Nene plays 3, table: [1,3,1,3], Nene points: 1

- I play 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2], my points: 1

- Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2,2], Nene points: 2

So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 2 points.

Same as earlier.

Alternatively:

- I play 1, table: [1], my points: 0

- Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene points: 0

- I play 1, table: [1,2,1], my points: 1

- Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene points: 0

- I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2], my points: 1

- Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3,2,3], Nene points: 1

Wait, in this case, Nene has to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

But in this sequence, she ends up with only 1 point, which is worse than the previous sequence where she got 2 points.

So, she would prefer to play her cards to get more points.

Hence, in the earlier sequence, she plays 3 first, then 3 again to get a point, and play 2 to get another point.

Wait, but in that sequence, she gets 2 points.

So, perhaps in this game, Nene can choose the order of playing her cards to maximize her points.

But, in any case, I can only get points from the numbers where I have both cards.

Hence, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but in this example, I have one number (1) where I have both cards, and I get 1 point.

Similarly, in the first test case, I have one number (1) where I have both cards, and I get 1 point.

In the second test case, let's see:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, numbers:

1: I have one

2: I have one

4: I have one

5: I have two

7: I have one

8: I have two

So, Nene has:

Numbers:

3: two cards (since n=8, numbers are from 1 to 8)

6: two cards

But wait, n=8, so numbers from 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have:

5: two cards

8: two cards

1: one card

2: one card

4: one card

7: one card

So, Nene has:

3: two cards

6: two cards

And for numbers 1,2,4,7, she has one card each.

Wait, no.

Total cards for each number:

1: two cards

2: two cards

3: two cards

4: two cards

5: two cards

6: two cards

7: two cards

8: two cards

I have:

1: one card

2: one card

3: zero cards

4: one card

5: two cards

6: zero cards

7: one card

8: two cards

So, Nene has:

1: one card

2: one card

3: two cards

4: one card

5: zero cards

6: two cards

7: one card

8: zero cards

So, for numbers:

- 5: I have both cards → I get 1 point

- 8: I have both cards → I get 1 point

- 1: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 2: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 4: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 7: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 3: Nene has both cards → Nene gets 1 point

- 6: Nene has both cards → Nene gets 1 point

So, total points:

Me: 2 (from 5 and 8)

Nene: 5 (from 1,2,4,7, and 6)

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2, which matches.

So, in this case, I get 2 points.

Another test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have:

1: one card

2: one card

3: one card

4: two cards

5: one card

6: one card

7: one card

8: zero cards

Nene has:

1: one card

2: one card

3: one card

4: zero cards

5: one card

6: one card

7: one card

8: two cards

So, for numbers:

- 4: I have both cards → I get 1 point

- 8: Nene has both cards → Nene gets 1 point

- 1: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 2: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 3: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 5: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 6: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

- 7: one card me, one card Nene → Nene gets the point

So, total points:

Me: 1 (from 4)

Nene: 6 (from 1,2,3,5,6,7, and 8)

But in the sample output, it's 1, which matches.

Another test case:

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

As before, I get 0 points, Nene gets 3 points.

And in the sample output, it's 0.

Similarly, for n=1, my cards: 1, Nene's cards: 1, I get 0 points, Nene gets 1 point.

So, in all these cases, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Hence, the solution seems to be to count how many numbers I have two cards of.

In code, for each test case:

- Read n

- Read the list of a1 to an

- Count the frequency of each number from 1 to n in my hand

- Count how many numbers have frequency 2

- Output that count

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))

}

Wait, it's a bit messy.

Let's see:

- It seems to read lines from input starting from the third line, stepping by 2.

- For each such line, it splits the line into tokens.

- It computes the length of the tokens list minus the length of a set created from the tokens.

- The set will have unique elements, so len({*tokens}) is the number of unique numbers in the list.

- Therefore, len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) is the number of duplicates in the list.

Wait, but in the context of the problem, since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire deck, and I have n cards, then in my hand, some numbers appear once, some appear twice, and some appear zero times (but since n is from 1 to n, and I have n cards, but with possible duplicates).

Wait, no, the problem says: "each of integers 1 through n appears exactly on 2 cards", and "each player receives n cards".

So, in my hand, since I have n cards, and there are 2n cards in total, with each number appearing exactly twice, it's possible that some numbers appear twice in my hand, and others appear once.

Given that, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

So, in the code, len(tokens) is n, and len({*tokens}) is the number of unique numbers in my hand.

Therefore, n - number of unique numbers = number of duplicates.

But in this context, since I have n cards, and there are only pairs of numbers, the number of duplicates in my hand is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Hence, n - len({*tokens}) is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no.

Wait, suppose n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3.

Then, tokens = [1,1,2,3], len(tokens)=4, len({*tokens})=3, so 4-3=1, which matches that I have one number (1) appearing twice.

Another example: n=8, my cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

tokens = [7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], len(tokens)=8, len({*tokens})=6 (unique numbers:7,4,1,2,8,5), so 8-6=2, which matches that I have two numbers (8 and 5) appearing twice.

Another example: n=8, my cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

tokens = [7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], len(tokens)=8, len({*tokens})=7 (unique numbers:7,1,4,5,3,2,6), so 8-7=1, which matches that I have one number (4) appearing twice.

Another example: n=3, my cards:1,2,3

tokens = [1,2,3], len(tokens)=3, len({*tokens})=3, so 3-3=0, which matches that I have no numbers appearing twice.

Another example: n=1, my cards:1

tokens = [1], len(tokens)=1, len({*tokens})=1, so 1-1=0, which matches that I have one number appearing once.

Hence, n - len({*tokens}) gives the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand, which is exactly the number of points I can get.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve in a card game against Nene, given specific rules and optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - You and Nene each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
   - Players take turns playing one card at a time, scoring a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - Determine the maximum points you can achieve by playing optimally.

2. **Insight**:
   - For numbers where you have both cards, you can score a point from the second card.
   - For numbers where Nene has both cards, she scores a point.
   - For numbers where one card is yours and one is Nene's, Nene can play optimally to score the point.
   - Hence, the only points you can guarantee are from the numbers where you have both cards.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Count how many numbers appear twice in your hand. This count directly gives the number of points you can score.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Read the input efficiently, processing multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, calculate the number of duplicate numbers in your hand.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        unique_numbers = set(a)
        points = n - len(unique_numbers)
        print(points)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input at once and split into lines.
   - The first line indicates the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, the first line is `n`, the number of cards each player has.
   - The second line contains `n` integers representing the numbers on your cards.

2. **Calculating Points**:
   - For each test case, count the number of unique numbers in your hand using a set.
   - The points you can score are given by `n - len(unique_numbers)`, which represents the count of numbers that appear twice in your hand.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the calculated points for each test case.

This approach ensures an efficient and optimal solution to determine the maximum points you can achieve in the game.
