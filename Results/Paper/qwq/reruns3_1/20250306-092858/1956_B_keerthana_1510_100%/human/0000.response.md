Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards initially. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, for a total of 2n turns. I start first.

Each time I play a card, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, I get a point. The same goes for Nene when it's her turn. Nene is really smart and always plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she tries to minimize my points.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. Let's think about how the turns work.

- On each turn, a player chooses one of their cards and plays it on the table.

- If the number on that card is already on the table, the player gets a point.

- The card is then placed on the table.

- This happens alternately, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns.

Since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, I need to anticipate her moves based on the cards I play.

Let's consider the distribution of cards. Each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck. So, for each number, the two cards are distributed between me and Nene in some way. Possible scenarios:

1. I have both cards of a number.

2. I have one card of a number, and Nene has the other.

3. Nene has both cards of a number.

In scenario 1, if I have both cards of a number, I can play them in such a way that I get a point from the second one.

In scenario 2, one card is with me and one with Nene. Depending on who plays which first, points can be scored.

In scenario 3, Nene has both cards of a number, so she can play them to get a point from the second one.

I need to think about how to maximize my points considering Nene's optimal play.

Let's think about the game progression.

Since turns are public, meaning both players can see the table at any time, decisions can be made based on the current state.

Nene is trying to maximize her points first, and then minimize mine. So, she will choose moves that benefit her the most, and among those, choose the one that hurts me the most.

I need to anticipate her moves and plan accordingly to maximize my points.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Given that each number appears at most twice in my hand (since each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck), I can count how many numbers appear once or twice in my hand.

Let's define:

- For each number from 1 to n, determine how many cards of that number I have.

- Similarly, infer how many cards of that number Nene has.

Given that, I can categorize the numbers based on how many cards I and Nene have.

Let's define:

- For each number, if I have both cards, then Nene has zero.

- If I have one card, Nene has one card.

- If I have zero cards, Nene has both.

Wait, actually, since each number appears exactly twice in total, and I have n cards, and Nene has n cards, it's possible to have:

- I have both cards of some numbers.

- I have one card of some numbers, and Nene has the other.

- I have no cards of some numbers, and Nene has both.

But, given that I have n cards, and there are n distinct numbers, each appearing twice, it's possible to have overlapping distributions.

Wait, actually, since there are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice, and I have n cards, it's possible that:

- For some numbers, I have both cards.

- For some numbers, I have one card, and Nene has the other.

- For some numbers, I have no cards, and Nene has both.

But, since each number appears exactly twice, and I have n cards, the distribution must be such that the total number of cards adds up to 2n.

Wait, no, I have n cards, Nene has n cards, and there are 2n cards in total.

Wait, but the problem says that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck. So, the deck has 2n cards, with each number appearing exactly twice.

Then, when we divide the cards between me and Nene, each getting n cards, it's possible that:

- For some numbers, I have both cards.

- For some numbers, I have one card, and Nene has the other.

- For some numbers, I have no cards, meaning Nene has both.

But, since I have n cards, and there are n distinct numbers, each appearing twice, the distribution must be such that the sum of the counts of each number's cards that I have equals n.

Wait, but it's possible that I have multiple cards of the same number, but since each number appears only twice in total, I can have at most two cards of any number.

Given that, I can have some numbers where I have both cards, some where I have one, and some where I have none.

Now, the key is to decide the order in which I play my cards to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me think about the possible strategies.

First, let's consider that Nene can see the table and knows the cards that have been played so far.

So, she can make decisions based on that.

I need to think about the sequence of plays and how they affect the scoring.

Let me consider a simple example to get some intuition.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, Nene's cards must be 2,3,4,4

Now, according to the explanation, if I play one of the 1's first, then Nene plays one of her 4's, then I play my remaining 1 and get a point because there's already a 1 on the table, and so on.

最终，我得到1分，Nene得到3分。

But, is there a better way for me to play to get more than 1 point?

Let's try different sequences.

Suppose I play 2 first.

Table: 2

Nene plays 4.

Table: 2,4

I play 3.

Table: 2,4,3

Nene plays 4.

Table: 2,4,3,4

I play 1.

Table: 2,4,3,4,1

Nene plays 1.

Table: 2,4,3,4,1,1

In this case, I only get a point when I play the second 1, but Nene plays her 4 and gets a point when she plays the second 4.

So, I still get only 1 point.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Suppose I play 1 first.

Table:1

Nene plays 4.

Table:1,4

I play another 1, get a point.

Table:1,4,1

Nene plays 4, get a point.

Table:1,4,1,4

I play 2.

Table:1,4,1,4,2

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,4,1,4,2,3

I play 3, get a point.

Table:1,4,1,4,2,3,3

In this case, I get points for playing the second 1 and the second 3, totaling 2 points.

But, according to the problem, it's said that I can get only 1 point.

Wait, maybe Nene would play differently if I play differently.

Wait, perhaps Nene, being optimal, would try to minimize my points.

So, if I play 1 first, Nene might play a 4, and then I play another 1 to get a point, and Nene plays the second 4 to get a point, and then I play 2, and Nene plays 3, and I play 3 to get another point.

But, according to the problem, the maximum I can get is 1 point.

Wait, maybe Nene would play in a way to prevent me from getting more than 1 point.

Perhaps, if I play 1 first, Nene would play 3 instead of 4, to deny me the second point.

Let's see:

I play 1.

Table:1

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,3

I play 1, get a point.

Table:1,3,1

Nene plays 4.

Table:1,3,1,4

I play 2.

Table:1,3,1,4,2

Nene plays 4, get a point.

Table:1,3,1,4,2,4

In this case, I only get 1 point.

So, perhaps Nene, by playing 3 instead of 4, prevents me from getting the second point.

So, Nene, being optimal, would choose to play in a way that minimizes my points beyond her own maximization.

Hence, in this case, I can get at most 1 point.

Similarly, in the second test case, with n=8, and specific cards, the output is 2.

I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum points I can get, given that Nene plays optimally.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

First, let's think about the numbers that appear twice in my hand.

If I have both cards of a number, then I can play them in such a way that I get a point from the second one, provided that Nene doesn't interfere.

But Nene can interfere by playing a card that denies me the point.

Wait, but if I have both cards of a number, and I play one first, and then the second, I can get a point from the second one, unless Nene plays a card that already has a match on the table.

But Nene would try to play in a way that minimizes my points.

Similarly, for numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, when I play my card, I don't get a point unless Nene has already played her card.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems quite complex to model directly.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the frequencies.

Let me count, for each number, how many cards I have.

Then, for numbers where I have both cards, I can potentially get one point from the second card.

For numbers where I have one card, and Nene has the other, I can get a point only if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial game theory.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Sample Output:

1

2

1

0

0

Looking at the first test case:

n=4

My cards:1,1,2,3

Nene's cards:2,3,4,4

Output:1

Second test case:

n=8

My cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards would be the remaining cards:3,6,6,7,4,1,2,3

Wait, hold on.

Wait, the deck has 2n=16 cards, with numbers from 1 to 8, each appearing twice.

My cards are:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene has the other copies:3,6,6,7,4,1,2,3

Wait, but 7 appears twice in my hand, so Nene has only one 7.

Wait, no, wait, each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, if I have two 8's and two 5's, then Nene has none of those.

Wait, no, wait, each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

So, if I have two 8's, then Nene has none of the 8's.

Similarly, if I have two 5's, Nene has none of the 5's.

If I have one 7, Nene has the other 7.

If I have one 4, Nene has the other 4.

And so on.

Wait, let's tally:

Numbers from 1 to 8, each appearing twice.

My cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have:

- 7:1

- 4:1

- 1:1

- 2:1

- 8:2

- 5:2

Therefore, Nene has:

- 7:1

- 4:1

- 1:1

- 2:1

- 8:0

- 5:0

Plus, for numbers 3 and 6, since I have none, Nene has both.

So, Nene's cards are:7,4,1,2,3,3,6,6

Wait, no, wait, each number appears exactly twice.

So, Nene's cards are:7,4,1,2,3,3,6,6

Because I have none of 3 and 6.

Output for this case is 2.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=8

My cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have:

-7:1

-1:1

-4:2

-5:1

-3:1

-2:1

-6:1

Nene's cards are:

-7:1

-1:1

-4:0

-5:1

-3:1

-2:1

-6:1

Plus, for numbers where I have none, Nene has both.

But in this case, I have one of each number from 1 to 7, and one 6.

Wait, no, looking back:

n=8, so numbers from 1 to 8.

I have:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have:

-1:1

-2:1

-3:1

-4:2

-5:1

-6:1

-7:1

-8:0

So, Nene has:

-1:1

-2:1

-3:1

-4:0

-5:1

-6:1

-7:1

-8:2

Wait, but each number appears exactly twice.

So, Nene's cards are:1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8

Because I have one of each except for 4 and 8.

I have two 4's, so Nene has none of 4's.

I have no 8's, so Nene has both 8's.

Output for this case is 1.

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

Nene's cards:1,2,3

Output:0

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards:1

Nene's cards:1

Output:0

From these examples, it seems that the output is related to the number of numbers that I have both cards of.

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, but n=4, and output is 1.

Wait, but n=4, and I have two 8's and two 5's, but n=4, so numbers are from 1 to 4.

Wait, no, n=4, numbers are from 1 to 4.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

So, I have two 1's, and one 2, one 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

Output is 1.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, I have two 8's and two 5's, and one each of 7,4,1,2.

Nene has one each of 7,4,1,2, and two 3's and two 6's.

Output is 2.

In the third test case, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, I have two 4's, and one each of 7,1,5,3,2,6.

Nene has one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7, and two 8's.

Output is 1.

Fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

Nene's cards are 1,2,3.

Output is 0.

Fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1.

Nene's cards are 1.

Output is 0.

Looking at these, it seems that the output is equal to the number of numbers that I have two cards of, minus something.

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has two 4's.

Output is 1.

In the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, so four cards in total, but only two pairs.

Output is 2.

In the third test case, I have two 4's.

Output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, output is 0.

Wait, but in the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), and output is 2.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), and output is 1.

In the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, output is 0.

So, it seems that the output is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, wait, in the second test case, output is 2, which matches the number of pairs I have.

In the third test case, output is 1, which matches the number of pairs I have.

In the first test case, output is 1, which matches the number of pairs I have.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, output is 0, which matches having no pairs.

But, wait, in the sample explanation for the first test case, it says that I can get only 1 point, even though I have one pair.

But according to the output, it's indeed 1.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, is that always true?

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and output is 1.

In the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), and output is 2.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), and output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, and output is 0.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, is this always the case?

Wait, perhaps Nene can interfere and prevent me from getting points from some of my pairs.

But, in the second test case, with two pairs, output is 2, meaning I can get points from both pairs.

In the first test case, with one pair, output is 1.

So, perhaps, if I have multiple pairs, I can get points from all of them, provided that Nene doesn't interfere.

But in the first test case, Nene cannot prevent me from getting at least one point from my pair.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that I can get only 1 point, even with one pair.

But according to the output, it's 1, which matches the number of pairs.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, let's think about a scenario where Nene can prevent me from getting a point from one of my pairs.

Suppose n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,2.

Then, Nene has 3,3,4,4.

In this case, I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

Nene has two pairs: two 3's and two 4's.

If I play one 1, Nene plays one 3.

Then, I play the other 1, get a point.

Then, I play one 2, Nene plays one 4.

Then, I play the other 2, get a point.

So, I get two points.

But, Nene could try to play in a way to minimize my points.

Suppose Nene plays one 3 when I play one 1.

Then, I play the other 1, get a point.

Then, Nene plays one 4.

I play one 2.

Nene plays the other 4, gets a point.

I play the other 2, get a point.

So, I still get two points.

Alternatively, if Nene plays one 3 when I play one 1.

Then, I play one 2.

Nene plays one 4.

I play the other 1, get a point.

Nene plays the other 3, gets a point.

I play the other 2, get a point.

Again, I get two points.

It seems that with two pairs, I can get two points.

Similarly, in the first test case, with one pair, I can get one point.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, in the fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

Nene's cards are 1,2,3.

I have no pairs.

Output is 0.

Which makes sense.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1.

Nene's cards are 1.

I have no pairs.

Output is 0.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, is this always true?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=3, my cards are 1,1,2.

Nene's cards are 2,3,3.

So, I have one pair (two 1's), and Nene has one pair (two 3's).

What is the maximum points I can get?

If I play one 1 first.

Table:1

Nene plays 2.

Table:1,2

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:1,2,1

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,2,1,3

I play 2.

Table:1,2,1,3,2

Nene plays 3, get a point.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,3

So, I get one point.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first.

Table:2

Nene plays 2.

Table:2,2

I play one 1.

Table:2,2,1

Nene plays 3.

Table:2,2,1,3

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:2,2,1,3,1

Nene plays 3, get a point.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,3

Again, I get one point.

So, regardless of the order, I can get only one point.

Which matches the number of pairs I have.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But, let's think about another scenario.

Suppose n=5, my cards are 1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,5,5.

So, I have one pair (two 1's), and Nene has one pair (two 5's).

What is the maximum points I can get?

If I play one 1.

Table:1

Nene plays 2.

Table:1,2

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:1,2,1

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,2,1,3

I play 2.

Table:1,2,1,3,2

Nene plays 4.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,4

I play 3.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,4,3

Nene plays 5.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,4,3,5

I play 4.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,4,3,5,4

Nene plays 5, get a point.

Table:1,2,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,5

So, I get one point.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first.

Table:2

Nene plays 2.

Table:2,2

I play one 1.

Table:2,2,1

Nene plays 3.

Table:2,2,1,3

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:2,2,1,3,1

Nene plays 4.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,4

I play 3.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,4,3

Nene plays 5.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,4,3,5

I play 4.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,4,3,5,4

Nene plays 5, get a point.

Table:2,2,1,3,1,4,3,5,4,5

Again, I get one point.

So, in this case, with one pair, I can get one point.

So, it seems consistent.

Let me think about a case where I have two pairs.

Suppose n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,2.

Nene's cards are 3,3,4,4.

If I play one 1.

Table:1

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,3

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:1,3,1

Nene plays 3, get a point.

Table:1,3,1,3

I play one 2.

Table:1,3,1,3,2

Nene plays 4.

Table:1,3,1,3,2,4

I play the other 2, get a point.

Table:1,3,1,3,2,4,2

Nene plays 4, get a point.

Table:1,3,1,3,2,4,2,4

So, I get two points.

Alternatively, if Nene plays differently.

If I play one 1.

Table:1

Nene plays 4.

Table:1,4

I play the other 1, get a point.

Table:1,4,1

Nene plays 3.

Table:1,4,1,3

I play one 2.

Table:1,4,1,3,2

Nene plays 3, get a point.

Table:1,4,1,3,2,3

I play the other 2, get a point.

Table:1,4,1,3,2,3,2

Nene plays 4, get a point.

Table:1,4,1,3,2,3,2,4

Again, I get two points.

So, with two pairs, I can get two points.

Hence, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Therefore, the solution is to count the number of numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand, which means I have both cards of that number.

But, in the problem statement, it says that each number appears exactly twice in the deck, and I have n cards.

So, in my hand of n cards, some numbers appear once, some appear twice, and some don't appear at all.

I need to count how many numbers appear twice in my hand, because for each such number, I can play the first card, and then the second card to get a point, assuming Nene doesn't interfere.

But in the earlier examples, it seems that Nene cannot prevent me from getting a point from each of my pairs.

Hence, the answer should be the number of pairs I have.

In programming terms, I need to count the frequency of each number in my hand and count how many numbers appear exactly twice.

But, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))

It's reading every second line starting from the third line (since the first line is the number of test cases, and then for each test case, the first line is n, and the second line is the list of cards in my hand).

Then, for each test case, it splits the line into tokens, which are the numbers on the cards in my hand.

It then computes the length of the list of tokens minus the number of unique tokens.

Which is equivalent to counting the number of duplicates in the list.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, which is the number of numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

But, in the provided program, it's doing len(tokens) - len(unique tokens), which counts the total number of duplicates, not the number of pairs.

Wait, in Python, len(tokens) is the total number of cards I have, which is n.

len({*tokens}) is the number of unique numbers in my hand.

So, len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) is n - number of unique numbers.

But, in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

Number of unique numbers is 3.

So, 4 - 3 =1, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Number of unique numbers is 7 (7,4,1,2,8,5).

So, 8 - 7 =1, but the output is 2.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, in the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Number of unique numbers is 7 (7,4,1,2,8,5).

So, 8 -7=1, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not just n - number of unique numbers.

Wait, but in the provided program, it's doing len(tokens) - len({*tokens}), which is n - number of unique numbers.

But in the second test case, that would be 8 -7=1, but the output is 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's counting the number of duplicates, but considering that each pair contributes one point.

But in this case, I have two pairs (8 and 5), so output is 2.

But n - number of unique numbers is 8 -7=1, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's counting the number of duplicates divided by 2.

But 8 -7=1, which would be floor division of total duplicates by 2.

But in this case, total duplicates are 2 (two 8's and two 5's), so 2//2=1, which matches the output of 2.

Wait, no, in this case, total duplicates are 2 (one duplicate for 8 and one for 5), but n - number of unique numbers is 8 -7=1, which is not equal to 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Number of unique numbers is 7.

n - number of unique numbers is 8 -7=1.

But the output is 2.

So, the provided program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but according to the problem, the output should be 2 for this test case.

But according to the program, it's printing 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back, the program is:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))

So, it's reading every second line starting from the third line.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

Number of unique numbers is 3.

n - number of unique numbers is 1, which matches the output of 1.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Number of unique numbers is 7.

n - number of unique numbers is 1, but the output is 2.

So, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding.

Wait, perhaps len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) is counting the number of duplicates, but not exactly the number of pairs.

In the first test case, duplicates are only the two 1's, so len(tokens)=4, len({*tokens})=3, so 4-3=1, which matches the number of pairs I have.

In the second test case, duplicates are two 8's and two 5's, so total duplicates are 2 (since each pair contributes one duplicate).

But len(tokens)=8, len({*tokens})=7, so 8-7=1, but the output is 2.

So, it doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

In the first test case, only one number (1) appears twice.

Output is 1.

In the second test case, two numbers (8 and 5) appear twice.

Output is 2.

So, the correct approach is to count the numbers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

But the provided program is counting n - number of unique numbers, which is not necessarily equal to the number of numbers that appear exactly twice.

In the first test case, n=4, unique numbers=3, n - unique=1, which matches the number of pairs.

In the second test case, n=8, unique numbers=7, n - unique=1, but actually, I have two pairs, so it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in some cases n - unique numbers equals the number of pairs, but not always.

So, the provided program is incorrect for the second test case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
