Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with a certain durability, arranged in a line from 1 to n. The Kraken attacks these ships k times, alternating between the first and the last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the target ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. After each pair of attacks (first and last), it continues until it has performed k attacks in total.

I should think about how to simulate this process efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15. Simulating each attack one by one would be too slow for such large inputs, so I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let's consider that each cycle of attacking the first and the last ship can be treated together. In each cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship and the last ship once, unless one of them has already been sunk.

But wait, the problem allows for multiple attacks, up to k times, and k can be very large, up to 10^15. So, I need a way to handle a large number of attacks efficiently.

Let me think about the process:

1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability by 1.

2. Then, it attacks the last ship, reducing its durability by 1.

3. This alternates until k attacks are done or all ships are sunk.

However, if a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the line, which affects subsequent attacks.

Given the constraints, simulating each attack individually would be too slow. I need a way to handle this in a more batched manner.

Perhaps I can consider the number of times the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in each cycle and find a way to compute how many ships are sunk without simulating each attack.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Use two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.

- In each step, determine how many attacks to allocate to the current first and last ships.

- Calculate the number of attacks needed to sink one or both of them.

- Subtract the number of attacks performed from k.

- Repeat until k is exhausted or all ships are sunk.

This seems promising. Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize left and right pointers:

- left = 0

- right = n - 1

Initialize sunks = 0

While left <= right and k > 0:

- If left == right:

- If k >= a[left]:

- sunks += 1

- break

- Else:

- break

- Else:

- Attack the first ship (a[left]) and the last ship (a[right]).

- Determine the number of attacks needed to sink one or both of them.

- If a[left] <= a[right]:

- If k >= a[left] * 2:

- k -= a[left] * 2

- a[right] -= a[left]

- If a[right] <= 0:

- sunks += 1

- right -= 1

- sunks += 1

- left += 1

- Else:

- k -= a[right] * 2

- a[left] -= a[right]

- If a[left] <= 0:

- sunks += 1

- left += 1

- If a[right] <= 0:

- sunks += 1

- right -= 1

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each full cycle (attack first and last), the Kraken reduces the durability of both ships by 1 each, but since k can be up to 10^15, I need a way to handle multiple cycles at once.

Perhaps I can calculate how many full cycles can be performed before one of the current first or last ships is sunk.

For example, if a[left] is the durability of the first ship and a[right] is the durability of the last ship, the number of full cycles I can perform before one of them sinks is min(a[left], a[right]).

Each full cycle consists of two attacks (one on the first and one on the last), so the number of attacks needed for these full cycles is 2 * min(a[left], a[right]).

If k is greater than or equal to this amount, I can perform all these full cycles, sink both ships if their durability reaches zero, and update k accordingly.

If k is less than this amount, I need to see who would be sunk first based on the remaining attacks.

This seems more efficient.

Let me try to formalize this approach:

while left <= right and k > 0:

if left == right:

if k >= a[left]:

sunks += 1

k -= a[left]

else:

break

else:

# Both left and right are different

full_cycles = min(a[left], a[right])

if 2 * full_cycles <= k:

# Can perform full cycles to sink both ships

k -= 2 * full_cycles

a[left] -= full_cycles

a[right] -= full_cycles

if a[left] == 0:

sunks += 1

left += 1

if a[right] == 0:

sunks += 1

right -= 1

else:

# k is not enough to perform full cycles

# Determine how many attacks can be performed

attacks_possible = k // 2

# Attacks on left and right

a[left] -= attacks_possible

a[right] -= attacks_possible

k -= 2 * attacks_possible

# Check if any ship is sunk

if a[left] <= 0:

sunks += 1

left += 1

if a[right] <= 0:

sunks += 1

right -= 1

# If k is odd, perform one more attack on the first ship

if k == 1:

if left <= right:

a[left] -= 1

if a[left] == 0:

sunks += 1

left += 1

break

This seems better. Let's test this logic with the first example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Initial state:

left=0, right=3, a=[1,2,4,3]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(1,3) = 1

2 * 1 = 2 <= 5: yes

k -= 2 => k=3

a[left] -=1 => a[0]=0

a[right] -=1 => a[3]=2

sunks +=1 (a[0]=0), left +=1

Now, left=1, right=3, a=[0,2,4,2]

Second iteration:

full_cycles = min(2,2) =2

2*2=4 <=3: no

So, attacks_possible = k //2 =1

k -=2 => k=1

a[left] -=1 => a[1]=1

a[right] -=1 => a[3]=1

Check if a[left]<=0: a[1]=1, no

Check if a[right]<=0: a[3]=1, no

Since k=1 is odd, perform one more attack on first ship (a[1]-=1 => a[1]=0)

sunks +=1 (a[1]=0), left +=1

Now, left=2, right=3, a=[0,0,4,1]

Third iteration:

full_cycles = min(4,1)=1

2*1=2 > k=0: no

k=0, break

Total sunks=2, which matches the example.

Good, seems correct.

Let's try another example:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Following the same steps as above, after two iterations, sunks=2, left=2, right=3, a=[0,0,4,1]

Third iteration:

full_cycles = min(4,1)=1

2*1=2 > k=0: no

k=0, break

Total sunks=2, but according to the example output, it should be 3.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the logic.

Wait, in the first example, with k=5, sunks=2, and with k=6, it should be 3.

So, with k=6, after the first two iterations, k=0, but actually, with k=6, we should have one more attack pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the remaining k after full_cycles.

Let me think again.

Maybe instead of checking if 2 * full_cycles <= k, I should calculate how many full cycles can be performed based on k.

Let me try a different approach:

while left <= right and k > 0:

if left == right:

if k >= a[left]:

sunks +=1

k -= a[left]

else:

break

else:

# Calculate how many full cycles can be performed

full_cycles = min(a[left], a[right], k // 2)

a[left] -= full_cycles

a[right] -= full_cycles

k -= 2 * full_cycles

if a[left] == 0:

sunks +=1

left +=1

if a[right] == 0:

sunks +=1

right -=1

# If k is odd after full cycles, perform one more attack on the first ship

if k ==1 and left <= right:

a[left] -=1

if a[left] ==0:

sunks +=1

left +=1

Let's try this with n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(1,3,6//2)=min(1,3,3)=1

a[left]-=1 => a[0]=0

a[right]-=1 => a[3]=2

k -=2 => k=4

sunks +=1 (a[0]=0), left +=1

Now, left=1, right=3, a=[0,2,4,2]

Second iteration:

full_cycles = min(2,2,4//2)=min(2,2,2)=2

a[left]-=2 => a[1]=0

a[right]-=2 => a[3]=0

k -=4 => k=0

sunks +=1 (a[1]=0), left +=1

sunks +=1 (a[3]=0), right -=1

Now, left=2, right=2, a=[0,0,4,0]

Third iteration:

left == right

k=0, so break

Total sunks=3, which matches the example.

Better, this seems correct.

Let's try another example:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(2,2,20//2)=min(2,2,10)=2

a[left]-=2 => a[0]=0

a[right]-=2 => a[4]=0

k -=4 => k=16

sunks +=1 (a[0]=0), left +=1

sunks +=1 (a[4]=0), right -=1

Now, left=1, right=3, a=[0,7,1,8,0]

Second iteration:

full_cycles = min(7,8,16//2)=min(7,8,8)=7

a[left]-=7 => a[1]=0

a[right]-=7 => a[3]=1

k -=14 => k=2

sunks +=1 (a[1]=0), left +=1

sunks +=1 (a[3]=1), right -=1

Now, left=2, right=2, a=[0,0,1,1,0]

Third iteration:

left == right

k=2 >= a[2]=1

sunks +=1, k -=1 => k=1

But k is still greater than 0, so continue

Wait, according to the code, if left == right and k >= a[left], sunks +=1, k -= a[left]

So, sunks=5, k=1-1=0

Total sunks=5, which matches the example.

Good.

Another example:

n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(3,2,2//2)=min(3,2,1)=1

a[left]-=1 => a[0]=2

a[right]-=1 => a[1]=1

k -=2 => k=0

No ships sunk, since a[0]=2 and a[1]=1

So, sunks=0, which matches the example.

Another example:

n=2, k=15, a=[1,5]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(1,5,15//2)=min(1,5,7)=1

a[left]-=1 => a[0]=0

a[right]-=1 => a[1]=4

k -=2 => k=13

sunks +=1 (a[0]=0), left +=1

Now, left=1, right=1, a=[0,4]

Second iteration:

left == right

k=13 >= a[1]=4

sunks +=1, k -=4 => k=9

But in the code, if k >= a[left], sunks +=1, k -= a[left]

So, sunks=2, k=9-4=5

But according to the example, output is 2, which matches.

Wait, but k=5 is still greater than 0, but since all ships are sunk, it stops.

Hence, sunks=2.

Good.

Last example:

n=2, k=7, a=[5,2]

First iteration:

full_cycles = min(5,2,7//2)=min(5,2,3)=2

a[left]-=2 => a[0]=3

a[right]-=2 => a[1]=0

k -=4 => k=3

sunks +=1 (a[1]=0), right -=1

Now, left=0, right=0, a=[3,0]

Second iteration:

left == right

k=3 >= a[0]=3

sunks +=1, k -=3 => k=0

Total sunks=2, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

So, the function seems to be working correctly based on the examples.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func_1(n, k, a):

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

sunks = 0

while l <= r:

if k == 0:

break

if l == r:

if k >= a[r]:

sunks += 1

break

else:

break

if a[l] <= a[r]:

if k >= a[l] * 2:

k -= a[l] * 2

a[r] -= a[l]

if a[r] == 0:

sunks += 1

r -= 1

sunks += 1

l += 1

continue

elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:

sunks += 1

break

else:

break

if k == 0:

break

if a[r] < a[l]:

if k >= a[r] * 2:

k -= a[r] * 2

a[l] -= a[r]

if a[l] == 0:

sunks += 1

l += 1

sunks += 1

r -= 1

continue

elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:

sunks += 1

break

else:

break

return sunks

This seems similar to my initial thoughts but a bit more complicated.

Let's see if it matches the correct approach.

In the correct approach, I calculated full cycles based on the minimum durability of left and right, considering k//2.

In the given function, it seems to check if k >= a[l] * 2, then subtract a[l]*2 from k and reduce a[r] by a[l], then check if a[r] ==0, increment sunks and move r.

This seems to be handling the case where a[l] is smaller than a[r], and we can perform a[l] full cycles.

Similarly, if a[r] < a[l], it does the opposite.

But I need to verify if this handles all cases correctly.

Let's test it with n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

First iteration:

a[l]=1, a[r]=3, a[l] <= a[r]

k=5 >= 1*2=2: yes

k -=2 => k=3

a[r] -=1 => a[3]=2

if a[r]==0: no

sunks +=1 (for l), l +=1

Now, l=1, r=2, a=[1,2,4,2]

Second iteration:

a[l]=2, a[r]=4, a[l] <= a[r]

k=3 >=2*2=4: no

else: break

Wait, but according to the correct approach, it should have continued.

Wait, in the correct approach, full_cycles = min(2,4,3//2=1)=1

a[l]-=1 =>2-1=1

a[r]-=1 =>4-1=3

k -=2 =>1

Then, check if a[l]<=0 or a[r]<=0: neither, so move to next iteration.

But in the given function, it breaks here because k >= a[l]*2 is not satisfied.

So, it seems to be incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ships are sunk after a series of attacks by the Kraken, given the ships' durabilities and the number of attacks. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship in the line until it has performed the specified number of attacks or all ships are sunk.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to track the current first and last ships respectively.
   - We maintain a counter `sunks` to count the number of ships that have been sunk.
   
2. **Simulate Attacks Efficiently**:
   - We process the ships in pairs (first and last) in each iteration to handle the alternating attacks efficiently.
   - Calculate the number of full cycles of attacks (each cycle consists of one attack on the first ship and one on the last ship) that can be performed based on the minimum durability of the current first and last ships and the remaining attacks.
   - Update the durability of the ships and the number of attacks performed.
   - Sink the ships if their durability drops to zero and adjust the pointers accordingly.
   
3. **Handle Remaining Attacks**:
   - If there are remaining attacks after processing pairs, handle the attacks on the remaining ship (if only one ship is left).
   
4. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until all ships are sunk or the Kraken has no more attacks.

## Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while left <= right and k > 0:
        if left == right:
            if k >= a[left]:
                sunks += 1
                k -= a[left]
            break
        full_cycles = min(a[left], a[right], k // 2)
        a[left] -= full_cycles
        a[right] -= full_cycles
        k -= 2 * full_cycles
        if a[left] == 0:
            sunks += 1
            left += 1
        if a[right] == 0:
            sunks += 1
            right -= 1
    return sunks

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        print(func_1(n, k, a))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list `a` (durabilities of the ships).

2. **Simulate Attacks**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to track the current first and last ships.
   - Calculate the number of full cycles of attacks that can be performed on the current first and last ships.
   - Update the durability of the ships and the remaining attacks.
   - Sink the ships if their durability drops to zero and adjust the pointers.

3. **Handle Remaining Attacks**:
   - If only one ship remains and there are still attacks left, sink it if the remaining attacks are sufficient.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the number of ships that were sunk after the Kraken's attacks.
