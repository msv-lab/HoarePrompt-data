Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a 2xN grid filled with 0s and 1s. There's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) and it needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or down. For each path it takes, we construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, each path from (1,1) to (2,N) will consist of exactly N-1 right moves and 1 down move, making a total of N moves.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. Starting at (1,1), to reach (2,N), the grasshopper needs to move down to row 2 at some point and then move right to column N. So, in general, any path will consist of a sequence of right and down moves, but there are constraints because there are only two rows.

Actually, in this 2xN grid, the grasshopper has to make exactly one down move to go from row 1 to row 2, and the rest are right moves. So, the path can be characterized by the position where the down move occurs.

Wait, no. Actually, from row 1, the grasshopper can move right or down. If it moves down, it goes to row 2 and then can only move right. If it stays in row 1 and moves right, it can still choose to move down later.

Wait, but in a 2xN grid, once the grasshopper moves down to row 2, it can't move up back to row 1. So, effectively, the path is a sequence where there is exactly one down move, and the rest are right moves.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The grasshopper can move down at any point, but since there are only two rows, once it moves down, it can't move up. So, the path can have multiple down moves only if it moves down and then moves right in row 2, but since there are only two rows, moving down from row 1 to row 2, and then moving right in row 2.

But actually, from row 1, it can move right or down. From row 2, it can only move right. So, effectively, the down move can happen at most once per path, but actually, it can choose to move down at any step, but once it moves down, it stays in row 2.

Wait, but in reality, in a 2xN grid, the grasshopper can be in row 1 or row 2. If it's in row 1, it can choose to move right or down. If it's in row 2, it can only move right.

So, for each path, the sequence of moves is a sequence of right and down moves, starting from (1,1), ending at (2,N), with the constraint that down moves can only be from row 1 to row 2.

Given that, the number of down moves is exactly one, because it has to go from row 1 to row 2 exactly once.

Wait, no. Actually, it can choose to move down at any step, but in practice, it can only move down once because there are only two rows.

Wait, actually, no. From row 1, it can move right or down. If it moves down, it goes to row 2 and can only move right from there. So, effectively, each path has exactly one down move.

Wait, but what if it moves right in row 1 multiple times before moving down? Then it moves down once and then right in row 2. So, each path has exactly one down move.

Wait, but what if it moves down immediately to row 2 and then moves right all the way? Or moves right in row 1 a few times and then moves down and then right in row 2.

In any case, each path has exactly one down move.

So, the total number of paths is N, because the down move can be at any position from the first move to the Nth move.

Wait, no. Wait, total number of moves is N steps: N-1 right moves and 1 down move.

Wait, no. Wait, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make N-1 horizontal moves (right) and 1 vertical move (down). So, total moves are N.

But in terms of choices, since the down move can be at any step from 1 to N, there are N possible paths.

Wait, no. Wait, in a 2xN grid, from (1,1), it can choose to move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1). If it moves right in row 1, it can continue moving right or down at each step.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to model the paths.

Letâ€™s denote the position as (row, column).

Starting at (1,1).

At each step, if in row 1, can move right to (1, column+1) or down to (2, column).

If in row 2, can only move right to (2, column+1).

Goal is (2,N).

So, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves: a sequence of R (right) and D (down), starting with either R or D, but with the constraint that D can only happen when in row 1.

Moreover, since you have to reach row 2, you must have at least one D move.

Actually, you must have exactly one D move because once you move down from row 1 to row 2, you can't move back up.

So, each path corresponds to choosing at which step you perform the D move.

Therefore, the total number of paths is N, because the D move can be at any step from 1 to N.

Wait, but is that correct?

Let me see for N=2.

Paths:

1. R to (1,2), then D to (2,2)

2. D to (2,1), then R to (2,2)

So, two paths, which matches N=2.

For N=3:

1. RRRDD

Wait, no. Wait, in N=3, paths are:

1. R to (1,2), R to (1,3), D to (2,3)

2. R to (1,2), D to (2,2), R to (2,3)

3. D to (2,1), R to (2,2), R to (2,3)

So, three paths for N=3.

Hence, in general, for N, there are N paths.

Wait, but in N=2, there are 2 paths; in N=3, 3 paths; so yes, N paths in general.

So, the number of paths is N.

Now, for each path, we collect the cells visited in order, and form a binary string.

Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest such string among all paths, and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

Given that there are N paths, and each path corresponds to a different sequence of cells, we need to identify which of these paths gives the smallest string.

Lexicographical order means that we compare strings position by position, and the smallest string is the one that has the smallest character at the first position where they differ.

So, to find the smallest string, we need to choose the path that results in the smallest possible sequence of 0s and 1s.

Given that, perhaps there is a way to determine the optimal path without enumerating all paths.

Given that N can be up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, with the sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient algorithm, preferably linear in N.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, observe that the grasshopper starts at (1,1). It can either move right in row 1 or down to row 2.

If it moves right in row 1, it collects a_{11}, then a_{12}, and so on, until it decides to move down to row 2, and then collects the remaining cells in row 2.

If it moves down to row 2 early, it collects a_{11}, then a_{21}, and then a_{22}, and so on.

So, for each possible position k where the down move occurs (1 <= k <= N), the path would be:

- Collect a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, then a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}.

Our goal is to choose k such that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.

To find the smallest string, we need to compare the strings for different k values and find the minimum.

But comparing strings directly would be inefficient for large N.

Is there a smarter way to find the smallest string without generating all strings and comparing them?

Let's consider that for two different k values, say k1 and k2, we need to compare the strings generated by these k values.

To find the lexicographically smallest string, we need to find the path where the earliest positions have the smallest possible values.

So, we should prefer a path where the initial part of the string has as many 0s as possible, and as early as possible.

Let me think about an example.

Suppose N=4, s1 = 1 1 0 1, s2 = 1 1 0 0.

From the example, the smallest string is 11000, and there is only one path that yields this string.

Let me see what that path is.

Wait, in the example provided in the problem, for N=4, s1=1101, s2=1100, the smallest string is 11000, and it's achieved by one specific path.

Let me try to see which k corresponds to this string.

If k=2:

Collect a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24} => 1,1,0,0

Wait, that's 1100, but the output is 11000, which has 5 characters. Wait, N=4, so the path should have N+1=5 characters.

Wait, wait, in the example, the output is 11000, which has 5 characters, which matches N+1=5.

Wait, but for k=2, collecting a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}, that's 1,1,0,0, which is only 4 characters. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the path has N steps, but the string has N+1 characters because it includes the starting cell.

Wait, let's see: from (1,1), each move is either right or down, and each move collects the value of the cell it moves to.

Wait, no, the problem says "the binary string of length N+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So, it includes the starting cell plus N moves, totaling N+1 cells.

Therefore, each path corresponds to a sequence of N+1 cells: starting cell plus N moves.

Given that, for k=2 in N=4, the path would be:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Collecting a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}, a_{24}

Which for N=4 would be 5 cells, matching N+1.

Similarly, for k=1:

(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Collecting a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}

For k=2:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Collecting a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}

And so on.

So, for each k from 1 to N, the path is:

- Move right in row 1 for k-1 steps, then move down to row 2, then move right in row 2 for N - k steps.

- Collecting a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

Wait, but in the example, for N=4, s1=1101, s2=1100, the smallest string is 11000.

Let me see what strings are produced for each k:

For k=1: 1,1,1,0,0 -> 11100

For k=2: 1,1,1,0,0 -> 11100

For k=3: 1,1,0,0,0 -> 11000

For k=4: 1,1,0,1,0 -> 11010

So, the smallest is for k=3: 11000.

Indeed, in the example, it's stated that there is only one path that yields this string.

Wait, but according to this, for k=3, the string is 11000, and for k=4, it's 11010, which is larger.

So, 11000 is the smallest.

Now, to generalize, I need a way to find the k that gives the smallest string.

But comparing strings for each k is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the string for each k is composed of:

- The prefix from s1 up to a_{1k}, followed by the suffix from s2 starting from a_{2k}.

So, string_k = s1[1..k] + s2[k..N]

Our goal is to find the k that gives the lexicographically smallest string among all possible k.

Given that, perhaps I can find the k that minimizes the concatenation of s1[1..k] and s2[k..N].

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the k where s1[1..k] is as small as possible, considering s2[k..N].

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider the strings for all possible k and find the minimal one.

But again, that's O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the current minimal string.

But I need to do it efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute suffixes of s2 and prefixes of s1 and compare them efficiently.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are given as strings of length N.

Let me denote s1 = s1[0..N-1], s2 = s2[0..N-1].

For each k from 1 to N, string_k = s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1]

Wait, Python uses 0-based indexing, so s1[0..k-1] and s2[k-1..N-1].

Our task is to find the minimal string among these possibilities.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string found so far.

But this is O(N^2) in time, which is too slow for N up to 2*10^5 per test case.

I need a linear time solution.

Is there a way to find the minimal concatenation of prefix of s1 and suffix of s2 in linear time?

Let me consider that the string_k can be seen as the concatenation of s1[0..k-1] and s2[k-1..N-1].

I need to find the k that minimizes this concatenation.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and choose the k where s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1] is minimal.

But directly comparing strings for each k is too slow.

Is there a way to compare them smarter?

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings of length N.

I can concatenate s1 and s2, and look for the minimal suffix of this concatenated string.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the string s = s1 + s2, and find the minimal substring of s of length N+1.

Wait, but it's not exactly that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of suffixes.

Let me consider that for each k, string_k = s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1]

Which is equivalent to s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1]

So, it's like taking a prefix of s1 and appending the suffix of s2 starting from the same index.

To find the minimal such string, perhaps I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But I need to do it efficiently.

Let me try to find a way to compute this in linear time.

One idea is to iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compare string_k with the current minimal string.

But comparing strings naively is O(N), making the total time O(N^2).

I need a way to compare them in constant time or logarithmic time.

Perhaps I can find a way to compare the strings based on their differences at the earliest positions.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal string by comparing the strings position by position.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the strings share some prefix or suffix.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through possible k values and keep track of the current minimal string by maintaining a window of some sort.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k and consider string_k = s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1]

I can iterate through k from 1 to N and compute string_k each time, but that's too slow.

Is there a way to compute all string_k in linear time or linearithmic time?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute suffixes of s2 and prefixes of s1.

Let me precompute prefix_s1 up to k, and suffix_s2 from k-1 to N-1.

Then, for each k, string_k = prefix_s1[0..k-1] + suffix_s2[k-1..N-1]

I need to find the minimal such string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string.

But I need to optimize this.

Let me consider that the strings differ at certain positions, and I can find the k that minimizes the string based on the earliest differing positions.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the possible string_k and take the minimal one.

But sorting strings would still be O(N^2 log N), which is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where the earliest positions have the smallest possible values.

So, I should try to make the first character as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through positions and decide the optimal k based on the values in s1 and s2.

Let me try to think of it step by step.

The first character is always s1[0], since all paths start at (1,1).

So, the first character is fixed for all paths.

Then, for the second character, the grasshopper can either move right to s1[1] or down to s2[0].

So, the second character in the string can be either s1[1] or s2[0].

I should choose the smallest possible second character.

If s1[1] < s2[0], then choose to move right to s1[1].

If s2[0] < s1[1], then choose to move down to s2[0].

If they are equal, then I need to consider further characters to decide.

Wait, this seems like building a minimal string by choosing at each step the smallest possible character, considering the future moves.

This sounds similar to building a minimal string by choosing the smallest available character at each position, with constraints on future choices.

Let me formalize this.

I can think of this as building the string position by position, choosing the smallest possible character at each position, given the possible moves.

At each step, I have to decide whether to move right in row 1 or down to row 2.

Once I move down to row 2, I have to continue moving right in row 2.

So, I need to choose the sequence of moves that allows me to pick the smallest possible characters at each position in the string.

Let me try to build the string step by step.

Initialize an empty string and an empty path.

At step 1: start at (1,1), collect s1[0].

At step 2: choose to move right to (1,2) and collect s1[1], or move down to (2,1) and collect s2[0].

Choose the smallest available character.

If s1[1] < s2[0], choose to move right to s1[1].

If s2[0] < s1[1], choose to move down to s2[0].

If s1[1] == s2[0], choose the path that leads to the smallest string in the future.

This seems similar to choosing the minimal path in a graph where edges are labeled with characters, and we want the lexicographically smallest path from start to end.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that at each step, I have a current position, and I can choose to move right or down (if possible), and I choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

I need to make choices that not only look at the current character but also consider future characters.

This seems like a classic greedy approach for building minimal strings.

In general, for such problems, a greedy algorithm can be used where at each step, you choose the smallest possible character that allows the remaining string to be built correctly.

In this case, since the grid is only 2 rows, it's manageable.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize an empty list to build the string.

Start at position (1,1), collect s1[0].

Then, at each step, decide whether to move right or down based on which choice gives the smallest possible next character.

But, since moving down commits me to row 2 for all remaining moves, I need to consider the entire remaining path when choosing to move down.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two options at each step: move right in row 1 or move down to row 2.

Once I move down to row 2, I have to continue moving right in row 2.

So, the decision to move down is irrevocable.

Therefore, I need to choose the optimal step to move down to minimize the string.

To find the optimal k (the step where I move down), I need to find the k that minimizes the string s1[0..k-1] + s2[k-1..N-1].

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal string by maintaining a window of the concatenation of s1[0..k-1] and s2[k-1..N-1].

To optimize this, perhaps I can precompute suffixes of s2 and prefixes of s1.

Let me precompute prefix_s1 = [s1[0..k-1] for k in 1 to N]

And suffix_s2 = [s2[k-1..N-1] for k in 1 to N]

Then, string_k = prefix_s1[k-1] + suffix_s2[k-1]

But still, comparing these strings for each k is too slow.

Is there a way to find the minimal concatenation efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose k based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions and find the first position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose k based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can find the longest common prefix of s1 and s2, and then decide based on the next character.

Wait, but s1 and s2 are of length N, and I need to consider their concatenation in different ways.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix the first position where s1 and s2 differ.

Then, I can choose k such that I stay in s1 as long as s1 is smaller than s2, and switch to s2 when necessary.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions and keep choosing s1[i] until s1[i] is smaller than s2[i], and then switch to s2 at that point.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that at each position, I have a choice: stay in s1
