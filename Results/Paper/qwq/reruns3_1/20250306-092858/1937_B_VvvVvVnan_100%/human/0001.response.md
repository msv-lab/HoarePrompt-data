Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper that starts at the top-left cell (1,1) and wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when compared character by character. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in trying to find the smallest string, I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Given that the grid is only 2 rows high, the paths are relatively straightforward. The grasshopper can move right or down, so the path can be represented by a sequence of right and down moves, with the constraint that it starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N). Since it has to go from row 1 to row 2, it has to make exactly one down move at some point.

Wait, actually, it can make multiple down moves, but given that there are only 2 rows, it can only make at most one down move because after going down to row 2, it can't go back up. So, more precisely, the path consists of moving right in row 1 for some steps, then moving down to row 2, and then moving right in row 2 to the end.

So, the paths can be characterized by the column where the down move occurs. For example, if N=4, and the down move is at column 2, the path would be: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). The corresponding string would be a_{11} a_{12} a_{22} a_{23} a_{24}.

Similarly, if the down move is at column 3, the path would be: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). The string would be a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{23} a_{24}.

And so on.

So, to find the lexicographically smallest string, I need to consider all possible down move columns and generate the corresponding strings, then choose the smallest one.

But generating all possible strings and comparing them would be inefficient, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5 and the total sum of N across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. So, I need a smarter way to find the smallest string without generating all of them.

Let me think about how the strings are formed. For each possible down move column, say at column K, the string is composed of:

- The elements from row 1, columns 1 to K (inclusive)

- The elements from row 2, columns K to N (inclusive)

So, the string is: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} a_{2(k+1)} ... a_{2n}

I need to choose K such that this string is lexicographically smallest.

To find the smallest string, I can iterate through the possible down move columns and keep track of the smallest string found so far.

But again, this approach is too slow for large N. I need a better way.

Let me consider that the string is built by concatenating parts of row 1 and row 2. Specifically, for each K from 1 to N, the string is row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

I need to find the K that gives the smallest possible concatenation.

I recall that in string comparison, the smaller the initial characters, the smaller the string. So, I should try to make the first characters as small as possible.

Let me consider the strings starting from the first character.

The first character is always a_{11}, since the path starts at (1,1).

The second character depends on whether the first move is right or down.

- If the first move is right, then the second character is a_{12}.

- If the first move is down, then the second character is a_{21}.

So, the first two characters can be either a_{11} a_{12} (if move right first) or a_{11} a_{21} (if move down first).

I need to choose the smaller of these two options.

Wait, but actually, the down move can happen at any step, not just the first one. So, I need a more systematic way to find the smallest possible string.

Let me think about merging two sequences: row1 and row2, with the constraint that elements from row1 come before the elements from row2 in the string, up to the point where the down move occurs.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as merging row1 and row2, but with the constraint that the elements from row1 up to K are taken, and then elements from row2 from K to N.

Actually, perhaps I can find the point K where the concatenation of row1[1..K] and row2[K..N] is lexicographically smallest.

To optimize this, I need to find a way to compare these concatenations efficiently.

Let me consider that the string is built by taking a prefix of row1 up to some K, and then the suffix of row2 from K to N.

So, I need to choose K that minimizes row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

I need an efficient way to find the K that gives the smallest such string.

One way to approach this is to iterate through K from 1 to N and keep track of the smallest string found.

But again, this is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the string is determined by the point where we switch from row1 to row2.

I need to find the switch point K that results in the smallest possible string.

Let me try to find K such that row1[1..K] + row2[K..N] is minimized.

To do this efficiently, I can consider the difference between choosing K and K+1.

Specifically, changing from K to K+1 means replacing a_{1k} with a_{2(k+1)} in the string.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix K, and look at the string row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

I need to find the K that minimizes this string.

To find the minimal lexicographical string, I should prioritize having smaller characters at the beginning of the string.

So, I should try to make the first characters as small as possible.

Therefore, I should choose the smallest possible a_{11}, which is already determined.

Then, for the second character, I have a choice: a_{12} or a_{21}.

I should choose the smaller one between a_{12} and a_{21}.

If a_{12} < a_{21}, then I should move right to (1,2), and the second character is a_{12}.

If a_{21} < a_{12}, then I should move down to (2,1), and the second character is a_{21}.

If they are equal, then I need to look further to decide.

Wait, this seems like building the string step by step, choosing at each step the smallest available character.

This sounds like building the string greedily, choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the possible moves.

So, perhaps I can simulate the path step by step, always choosing the move that leads to the smallest possible character at the current step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the current position at (1,1).

Initialize an empty string.

At each step, consider the possible moves: right or down.

- If moving right is possible, look at the character in that cell.

- If moving down is possible, look at the character in that cell.

Choose the move that leads to the smallest character.

If both leads to the same character, choose any (or consider both paths).

Wait, but since I have to count the number of paths that lead to the smallest string, I need to keep track of the number of paths that result in the same smallest string.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I build the string step by step, always choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering the possible moves.

I need to ensure that I'm building the lexicographically smallest string.

To do this, I need to prioritize choosing '0's over '1's as early as possible in the string.

Given the grid structure, I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[r][c] as the smallest string that can be obtained from position (r,c) to the end (2,N).

But maybe that's not the most efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current possible positions.

Given that at each step, the grasshopper can move right or down, I can model this as a state machine.

Let me try to think of it in terms of states.

At any point, the grasshopper is in either row 1 or row 2.

Initially, it's in row 1, column 1.

At each step, it can either move right in the current row or move down to the other row.

But since there are only 2 rows, I can keep track of the current row and the column.

I need to build the string by collecting the values at each step.

To find the minimal string, I need to choose the path that results in the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, but with lexicographical order instead of sum of weights.

I need to find the path with the smallest lexicographical order.

I recall that in string comparison, smaller strings come first, and if prefixes are equal, then the comparison proceeds to the next characters.

So, to find the smallest string, I need to choose the path that has the smallest characters at each position, considering all possible paths.

Given the grid is only 2 rows, perhaps I can find a way to determine the optimal path by comparing the options at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, deciding at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, always choosing the option that gives the smallest character at the current step.

But I need to be careful because choosing to stay in the current row affects future choices.

Let me consider that at each column, I can be in either row 1 or row 2.

I need to keep track of the possible rows I can be in at each column, and choose the one that gives the smallest character at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two variables: the current minimal string for being in row 1 and in row 2 at each column.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define two strings:

- s1[j]: the minimal string from column 1 to j, ending in row 1.

- s2[j]: the minimal string from column 1 to j, ending in row 2.

At each column j from 1 to N, I can compute s1[j] and s2[j].

The final answer would be the smaller of s1[N] and s2[N].

Moreover, I need to keep track of the number of paths that achieve this minimal string.

This seems promising.

Let me try to define the recurrence relations for s1[j] and s2[j].

For s1[j]:

- If I came from s1[j-1] by moving right, then s1[j] = s1[j-1] + a_{1j}

- If I came from s2[j-1] by moving up (but wait, can I move up from row 2 to row 1? No, the grasshopper can only move down, not up. So, I can only come to row 1 from row 1 by moving right.

Therefore, s1[j] = s1[j-1] + a_{1j}

Similarly, for s2[j]:

- I can come from s1[j] by moving down and adding a_{2j}

- Or, I can come from s2[j-1] by moving right and adding a_{2j}

So, s2[j] = min(s1[j] + a_{2j}, s2[j-1] + a_{2j})

Wait, but I need to concatenate the characters, not sum them.

Wait, no, in terms of strings, it's about concatenating the characters in order.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the path that gives the smallest concatenated string.

Let me try to redefine this.

Let me define:

- path1[j]: the minimal string from column 1 to j, ending in row 1.

- path2[j]: the minimal string from column 1 to j, ending in row 2.

Then:

- path1[j] = path1[j-1] + a_{1j}

- path2[j] = min(path1[j] + a_{2j}, path2[j-1] + a_{2j})

Then, the overall minimal string is min(path1[N], path2[N])

But I need to implement this in code efficiently, considering that N can be up to 2*10^5.

Moreover, I need to count the number of paths that achieve this minimal string.

So, I need to keep track of the number of paths that achieve path1[j] and path2[j].

Let me define:

- count1[j]: number of paths to reach column j in row 1 with the minimal string path1[j]

- count2[j]: number of paths to reach column j in row 2 with the minimal string path2[j]

I need to initialize:

- path1[1] = a_{11}

- path2[1] = a_{11} + a_{21}

- count1[1] = 1

- count2[1] = 1 (only one way: right to (1,1) then down to (2,1))

Wait, no.

Wait, at column 1:

- In row 1: path1[1] = a_{11}, count1[1] = 1

- In row 2: path2[1] = a_{11} + a_{21}, count2[1] = 1

Then, for j from 2 to N:

- path1[j] = path1[j-1] + a_{1j}, count1[j] = count1[j-1]

- path2[j] = min(path1[j] + a_{2j}, path2[j-1] + a_{2j})

  - If path1[j] + a_{2j} < path2[j-1] + a_{2j}, then count2[j] = count1[j]

  - Else if path1[j] + a_{2j} > path2[j-1] + a_{2j}, then count2[j] = count2[j-1]

  - Else, count2[j] = count1[j] + count2[j-1]

Wait, but this is comparing strings, not numerical values.

So, I need a way to compare string concatenations.

I need a way to efficiently compare path1[j] + a_{2j} with path2[j-1] + a_{2j}.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5, I can't store the entire strings; I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can represent the strings in a way that allows efficient comparison and counting.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of suffixes or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal string and the counts.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns from left to right and decide at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, always choosing the option that gives the smallest possible character at each step.

I need to keep track of the current minimal string and the number of paths that achieve it.

I can maintain two candidates:

- Continuing in the current row

- Switching to the other row

And choose the one that gives the smallest character at the current column.

If there's a tie, I need to consider both options and keep track of the counts accordingly.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach where I keep track of the minimal string and the counts at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- current_string = a_{11}

- current_counts = [1, 0] # counts for row 1 and row 2 at column 1

Then, for each column j from 2 to N:

- Consider the possible moves to reach column j in row 1 and row 2.

- For row 1:

  - Can only come from row 1 in column j-1.

  - So, new_string_row1 = current_string + a_{1j}

  - new_counts_row1 = current_counts[0]

- For row 2:

  - Can come from row 1 or row 2 in column j-1.

  - So, option1 = current_string + a_{2j}

  - option2 = current_string_row2 + a_{2j} (where current_string_row2 is the string ending in row 2 at column j-1)

  - Choose the smaller of option1 and option2.

  - If option1 < option2, then new_counts_row2 = current_counts[0]

  - If option1 > option2, then new_counts_row2 = current_counts[1]

  - If option1 == option2, then new_counts_row2 = current_counts[0] + current_counts[1]

- Update current_string and current_counts accordingly.

Wait, but I need to keep track of the strings for both rows separately.

Maybe I should maintain two strings and two counts: one for each row.

Let me define:

- string_row1[j]: minimal string ending in row 1 at column j

- string_row2[j]: minimal string ending in row 2 at column j

- count_row1[j]: number of paths for string_row1[j]

- count_row2[j]: number of paths for string_row2[j]

Initialize for j=1:

- string_row1[1] = a_{11}

- string_row2[1] = a_{11} + a_{21}

- count_row1[1] = 1

- count_row2[1] = 1

Then, for j from 2 to N:

- string_row1[j] = string_row1[j-1] + a_{1j}

- For string_row2[j]:

  - option1 = string_row1[j] + a_{2j}

  - option2 = string_row2[j-1] + a_{2j}

  - string_row2[j] = min(option1, option2)

  - If option1 < option2:

    - count_row2[j] = count_row1[j]

  - Elif option1 > option2:

    - count_row2[j] = count_row2[j-1]

  - Else:

    - count_row2[j] = count_row1[j] + count_row2[j-1]

Finally, the overall minimal string is min(string_row1[N], string_row2[N]), and the count is count_row1[N] + count_row2[N] if they have the same minimal string, or the count corresponding to the smaller one.

Wait, but actually, string_row1[N] and string_row2[N] might be different.

I need to choose the smallest one between them and then sum the counts that lead to that smallest string.

So, after filling these arrays, I can compare string_row1[N] and string_row2[N], and choose the smaller one, and take the corresponding count.

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Given that N can be up to 2*10^5, I need to handle string comparisons efficiently.

Storing entire strings for each column is not feasible, as it would require O(N^2) space and time.

I need a way to compare the strings without storing the entire strings.

I recall that in suffix arrays or prefix arrays, we can represent strings in a way that allows efficient comparison.

Perhaps I can represent the strings by their prefixes and compare them character by character.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the differences between the strings at each step.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns one by one, keeping track of the minimal string so far and the counts.

At each step, I can decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smallest character at the current position.

If I have a way to look ahead and decide the best move, that would be ideal.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where row1 and row2 differ, and make a decision based on that.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider that at each step, I have a current minimal string and I extend it by choosing the smallest possible character at the next position.

I need to choose the path that allows me to have the smallest character at each position.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 based on which choice gives the smallest character at the current column.

If the characters are equal, I need to look ahead to see which path gives a smaller string later on.

This seems similar to building a minimal string by choosing the smallest available character at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach, always choosing the smallest available character at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- current_string = ''

- counts = 1

Then, for each column j from 1 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

  - Add a_{1j} to current_string

  - Check if a_{1j} < a_{2j}:

    - If yes, stay in row 1

    - Else, switch to row 2

- Else (current_row == 2):

  - Add a_{2j} to current_string

  - Must stay in row 2 (since we can't go back up)

Wait, but this doesn't account for the possibility of switching rows at different columns.

I need a way to decide when to switch to row 2.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the column K where I switch from row 1 to row 2.

Then, the string is row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

I need to choose K that minimizes this string.

To find the minimal K, I can iterate through K from 1 to N and find the minimal concatenation.

But again, this is O(N), which is too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching to row 2 gives a better string than staying in row 1.

To do this, I can compare row1[j+1] with row2[j+1] for each j, and decide based on that.

But I need to consider the entire suffix.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the minimal suffix for row2 starting from each j.

Let me try to precompute for each j, the string row1[1..j] + row2[j..N], and find the minimal one.

But again, storing these strings is not feasible.

I need a way to compare these concatenations efficiently.

Let me consider that the comparison of row1[1..j] + row2[j..N] and row1[1..k] + row2[k..N] can be done by comparing row1[1..j] with row1[1..k], and if they are equal up to min(j,k), then comparing row2[j..N] with row2[k..N].

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where row1 starts being larger than row2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal j where row1[1..j] + row2[j..N] is minimal.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider an example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first sample input:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Possible paths:

- (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string = 0 0 0

- (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string = 0 0 0

Both paths give the same string '000', which is the minimal possible.

The number of such paths is 2.

Another sample:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Possible paths:

- Down at column 1: string = 1 1 0 0 0

- Down at column 2: string = 1 1 1 0 0

- Down at column 3: string = 1 1 0 0 0

- Down at column 4: string = 1 1 0 1 0

The minimal string is '11000', which is achieved only by down at column 1.

So, the minimal string is '11000' with count=1.

Another sample:

n=8

s1=00100111

s2=11101101

Possible paths:

- Down at column 1: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

- Down at column 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1

- Down at column 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1

- Down at column 4: 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1

- Down at column 5: 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1

- Down at column 6: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

- Down at column 7: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

- Down at column 8: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

The minimal string is '001001101' with count=4.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal string is achieved by choosing the path that allows the earliest '0's possible.

Looking at the first sample, both paths give the same string.

In the second sample, down at column 1 gives the minimal string.

In the third sample, down at column 4 gives the minimal string.

So, perhaps the strategy is to delay the down move as much as possible while ensuring that the string remains minimal.

Wait, but in the second sample, down at column 1 gives the minimal string.

In the third sample, down at column 4 gives the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps it's about finding the column where s1[j+1] > s2[j], and down at that column.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal string is achieved by choosing the path that has the smallest possible characters at the earliest positions.

To do this, I need to prioritize '0's over '1's as early as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide to switch to row 2 when row2 has a '0' while row1 has a '1', and row2 from that point has a better suffix.

But this is still vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize:

- current_string = ''

- current_row = 1

- counts = 1

Then, for each column j from 1 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

  - Add a_{1j} to current_string

  - If a_{1j} > a_{2j}:

    - Switch to row 2

    - Update counts based on the number of paths that can make this switch

  - Else:

    - Stay in row 1

- If current_row == 2:

  - Add a_{2j} to current_string

  - Must stay in row 2

Wait, but this doesn't account for the fact that switching to row 2 affects the future path.

I need a way to look ahead and decide whether switching at this column would lead to a smaller string.

This seems similar to choosing the path with the smallest labels at each step, considering the future implications.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimal string and counts.

Define dp[j][r], where j is the column and r is the row, storing the minimal string and counts to reach column j in row r.

Initialize dp[1][1] = a_{11}, count=1

dp[1][2] = a_{11} + a_{21}, count=1

Then, for j from 2 to N:

- dp[j][1] = dp[j-1][1] + a_{1j}, count = dp_count[j-1][1]

- dp[j][2] = min(dp[j-1][1] + a_{2j}, dp[j-1][2] + a_{2j})

  - If dp[j-1][1] + a_{2j} < dp[j-1][2] + a_{2j}:

    - dp[j][2] = dp[j-1][1] + a_{2j}, count = dp_count[j-1][1]

  - Elif dp[j-1][1] + a_{2j} > dp[j-1][2] + a_{2j}:

    - dp[j][2] = dp[j-1][2] + a_{2j}, count = dp_count[j-1][2]

  - Else:

    - dp[j][2] = dp[j-1][1] + a_{2j}, count = dp_count[j-1][1] + dp_count[j-1][2]

Finally, the minimal string is min(dp[N][1], dp[N][2]), and the count is the corresponding count.

But again, storing the entire strings would be too slow.

I need a way to represent the strings in a way that allows efficient comparison without storing the entire string.

Perhaps I can use a tuple that represents the string up to the current column, but that might not be efficient enough.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the differences between the strings.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of "suffixes" or "prefixes" and compare them based on certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal path based on the characters seen so far.

Let me try to implement the DP approach, but optimize the string comparison.

I can represent the strings as tuples of characters, which allow for efficient comparison.

So, instead of storing the entire string as a list, I can store a tuple of characters up to the current column.

But even then, for N=2*10^5, storing tuples of size up to N would be inefficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that at each step, I only need to compare the strings up to the point where they differ.

I can keep track of a "difference index" where the strings start to differ.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of "lexicographical order" by comparing the strings character by character.

To optimize this, perhaps I can keep track of the current minimal string and a "candidate" string, and update them as I iterate through the columns.

But I'm still stuck on how to implement this efficiently.

Let me look back at the problem constraints.

Each test case has N up to 2*10^5, and the sum of N over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

This suggests that the solution should be linear in N.

So, I need an O(N) solution per test case.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns once, making decisions based on the current and next characters.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching to row 2 gives a better string than staying in row 1.

To do this, I can look for the first column where a_{2j} < a_{1j}, and switch there.

But that might not always be correct, because even if a_{2j} < a_{1j}, the future columns in row2 might be worse.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the first column where a_{2j} < a_{1j} and the suffix of row2 from j onwards is better than the suffix of row1 from j+1 onwards.

But again, this is too vague and not efficient.

Let me consider that the minimal string is achieved by choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering the future implications.

Perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible character at each position, considering the switch to row2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where the cumulative string from row1 starts being larger than the cumulative string from row2.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider that the path is determined by the point where we switch from row1 to row2.

So, for each possible switch point K, the string is row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

I need to find the K that minimizes this string.

To find the minimal K, I can iterate through K from 1 to N and find the minimal concatenation.

But again, this is O(N), which is acceptable since N is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but with the sum of N over all test cases being up to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

Wait, but t is up to 10^4, and N is up to 2*10^5 with sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, so per test case, N can be up to 2*10^5, but in practice, t is up to 10^4 with small N's summing up to 2*10^5.

So, an O(N) solution per test case should be acceptable.

Therefore, perhaps it's acceptable to iterate through K from 1 to N, compute the concatenation row1[1..K] + row2[K..N], and find the minimal one.

But storing the entire strings would be too slow.

Wait, but I don't need to store the entire strings; I can compare them character by character.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the strings as lists and compare them as needed.

But even better, perhaps I can find a way to compare the concatenations without storing them.

Let me try to implement this.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Read N

- Read s1 and s2 as lists of characters ('0' or '1')

- Initialize a list to store the candidate strings and their counts

- For K from 1 to N:

- candidate_string = s1[0 to K-1] + s2[K-1 to N-1]

- Add (candidate_string, count) to the list

- Find the minimal string among all candidates

- Count the number of paths that achieve this minimal string

- Output the minimal string and the count

But again, storing all candidate strings is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the smallest among all possible row1[1..K] + row2[K..N].

So, I can iterate through K from 1 to N, generate row1[0..K-1] + s2[K-1..N-1], and keep track of the minimal one.

But I need to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal concatenation by comparing the strings character by character.

To optimize, I can precompute the suffixes of s2 and prefix of s1.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix of s1 and suffix of s2.

Let me precompute:

- prefix1[j] = s1[0..j-1]

- suffix2[j] = s2[j-1
