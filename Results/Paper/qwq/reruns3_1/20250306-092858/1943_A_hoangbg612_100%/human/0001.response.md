Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to find the final score of the game when both play optimally. The score is defined as the MEX of the array that Alice collects. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

First, I need to understand the game rules clearly:

1. The game is played on an array `a` of size `n`.

2. Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

3. Players take turns, with Alice going first.

4. On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

5. On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a`, and deletes it from `a`.

6. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

7. Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.

Given that both play optimally, I need to find the final score.

Alright, so the key here is to understand what "optimal play" means for both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible, ideally in order starting from 0. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to disrupt Alice's efforts and prevent her from collecting a complete sequence.

Let me think about how the game progresses:

- The game alternates between Alice and Bob, with Alice going first.

- Alice can choose any element from `a` and add it to `c`.

- Bob can choose any element from `a` and remove it, without adding to `c`.

Given that, Bob can interfere with Alice's collection by removing elements that Alice might need to achieve a higher MEX.

I need to model their strategies:

- Alice will try to collect as many of the smaller numbers as possible, especially the ones that are missing in `c`.

- Bob will try to prevent Alice from collecting certain numbers, possibly by removing them from `a` before Alice can pick them.

I need to find out what the final MEX would be when both play optimally.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's analyze the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

Possible moves:

- Alice picks 1, a becomes [0, 0, 1], c = [1]

- Bob picks 0, a becomes [0, 1], c = [1]

- Alice picks 0, a becomes [1], c = [1, 0]

- Bob picks 1, a becomes empty, c = [1, 0]

MEX of c = [1, 0] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, 2 is the smallest missing.

Another possible sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a becomes [0, 1, 1], c = [0]

- Bob picks 1, a becomes [0, 1], c = [0]

- Alice picks 1, a becomes [0], c = [0, 1]

- Bob picks 0, a becomes empty, c = [0, 1]

Again, MEX is 2.

What if Alice picks differently?

- Alice picks 1, a = [0, 0, 1], c = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0, 0], c = [1]

- Alice picks 0, a = [0], c = [1, 0]

- Bob picks 0, a = empty, c = [1, 0]

Still MEX is 2.

Seems like in this case, MEX is 2 regardless of the moves.

Second test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Possible moves:

- Alice picks 0, a = [1, 2, 3], c = [0]

- Bob picks 1, a = [2, 3], c = [0]

- Alice picks 2, a = [3], c = [0, 2]

- Bob picks 3, a = empty, c = [0, 2]

MEX of c = [0, 2] is 1, since 0 is present, 1 is missing.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a = [0, 2, 3], c = [1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [2, 3], c = [1]

- Alice picks 2, a = [3], c = [1, 2]

- Bob picks 3, a = empty, c = [1, 2]

MEX is 0, since 0 is missing.

Wait, but in the output, it's 1. So perhaps the first sequence is what happens.

I need to see what happens when both play optimally.

Third test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 1]

Possible moves:

- Alice picks 1, a = [1], c = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = empty, c = [1]

MEX of c = [1] is 0, since 0 is missing.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a = [1], c = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = empty, c = [1]

Same result.

So, output is 0.

From these examples, I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think about the MEX concept. MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer in the collection `c`. To maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many of the smaller integers as possible in `c`. Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would try to prevent Alice from collecting certain numbers.

Given that Alice can only add to `c` and Bob can only remove from `a`, Bob can strategically remove elements that Alice needs to achieve a higher MEX.

I need to think about the optimal strategies for both players.

Let me consider the game as a two-player game where one tries to maximize and the other minimizes the MEX.

I recall that in such games, the outcome depends on the possible moves and the players' objectives.

Perhaps I can model this as a game where Alice tries to collect a set of numbers that maximizes the MEX, while Bob tries to disrupt this by removing numbers that could help Alice.

I need to find the optimal MEX that Alice can achieve despite Bob's attempts to minimize it.

Let me think about the frequency of each number in the array.

Suppose I count the frequency of each number in `a`.

Let's define `freq[i]` as the frequency of number `i` in `a`.

Now, Alice and Bob will be picking elements from `a` in turns, with Alice picking first.

Alice can choose to add an element to `c`, while Bob just removes an element.

I need to see how many times each number appears and how Alice can collect them, considering Bob's interference.

Let me consider that for each number `i`, if `freq[i]` is the count in `a`, then Alice needs to collect at least one `i` to include it in `c`. However, Bob can try to prevent Alice from collecting `i` by removing them.

Wait, but Alice can also choose to collect other numbers.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the MEX is determined by the smallest missing number in `c`. So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many consecutive numbers starting from 0 in `c` as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to disrupt Alice's collection of these consecutive numbers.

I need to find out, given the frequencies of numbers in `a`, and the turns of Alice and Bob, what is the highest MEX Alice can achieve.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can collect them before Bob can interfere.

Suppose I sort the numbers and see how many of each are available.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the possible MEX values and see if Alice can achieve them.

Let's consider that the MEX is `k`, which means that all numbers from 0 to k-1 are present in `c`, and k is missing.

So, for Alice to achieve a MEX of `k`, she needs to have all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c`.

Bob will try to prevent this by removing those numbers from `a` before Alice can pick them.

I need to model this.

Let me consider that for each number `i` from 0 to k-1, Alice needs at least one copy of `i` in `c`.

Bob can try to remove those copies from `a`.

Given that Alice picks first, and they alternate turns, Alice has a slight advantage.

I need to see, for each `i` from 0 to k-1, if there are enough copies in `a` such that Alice can pick at least one, even if Bob tries to remove them.

Let me formalize this.

For a given `k`, to achieve MEX `k`, Alice must have collected all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c`.

For each `i` in 0 to k-1, the number of times `i` appears in `a` must be greater than the number of times Bob can remove it before Alice picks at least one.

Since Alice picks first, for each `i`, if `freq[i] >= 1`, Alice can always pick one, unless Bob removes all `i`s before Alice can pick one.

Wait, but Bob can only remove one element per turn, just like Alice, but Alice also adds to `c`.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total number of turns needed for Alice to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1.

Each number `i` from 0 to k-1 needs at least one pick by Alice.

The total number of turns needed is the sum of ceil(freq[i]/2), since Alice and Bob alternate turns.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think again.

For each `i` from 0 to k-1, if `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `a`, then Alice needs to collect at least one `i`.

Bob can try to prevent this by removing `i`s.

But since Alice picks first, she has the first move.

So, for each `i`, if `freq[i] >= 1`, Alice can pick one `i` unless Bob removes all `i`s before Alice can pick one.

But Bob can only remove one element per turn.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of elements and the turns.

Total number of turns is `n`, since in each turn one element is removed from `a`.

Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, since she picks first.

Wait, no, since Alice picks first, and then Bob, then Alice, and so on.

So, if `n` is even, Alice and Bob each have `n/2` turns.

If `n` is odd, Alice has `(n+1)/2` turns, and Bob has `(n-1)/2` turns.

Wait, but in terms of picking elements, Alice picks once per turn, and Bob picks once per turn.

So, total turns are `n`, with Alice picking on odd turns (1st, 3rd, etc.) and Bob on even turns (2nd, 4th, etc.).

So, Alice picks floor((n+1)/2) times, and Bob picks floor(n/2) times.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total elements: `n`.

Each turn, one element is removed.

So, total turns: `n`.

Alice picks on turns 1,3,5,... (odd turns).

Bob picks on turns 2,4,6,... (even turns).

So, number of Alice's picks: ceil(n/2).

Number of Bob's picks: floor(n/2).

Wait, no.

Actually, if `n` is even, both have `n/2` picks.

If `n` is odd, Alice has (n/2)+0.5, which is ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2 picks, and Bob has floor(n/2) = n/2 picks.

Yes, that's correct.

So, Alice has ceil(n/2) picks, and Bob has floor(n/2) picks.

Now, for Alice to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1, she needs to pick at least one of each of these numbers, provided they are still in `a` when it's her turn.

Bob, to prevent this, will try to remove those numbers when it's his turn.

So, for each `i` from 0 to k-1, the number of times `i` appears in `a` must be more than the number of times Bob can remove it.

Since Bob has floor(n/2) picks, and Alice has ceil(n/2) picks.

Wait, but Bob can only remove one element per turn, and Alice can pick one element per turn and add it to `c`.

So, for each `i`, if freq[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can pick at least one `i`, because Bob can remove at most floor(n/2) elements.

Wait, but it's not that simple, because Bob can choose to remove `i`s or other elements.

Bob will try to remove the elements that Alice needs, i.e., the numbers from 0 to k-1, to prevent her from collecting them.

So, for each `i` from 0 to k-1, the number of times `i` appears in `a` must be greater than the number of times Bob can remove it.

Since Bob has floor(n/2) picks, if freq[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can pick at least one `i`.

But if freq[i] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can potentially remove all `i`s before Alice can pick one.

Wait, but Alice picks first, so she has a slight advantage.

Wait, more carefully:

For a specific `i`, if freq[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can always pick at least one `i`, because Bob can remove at most floor(n/2) elements.

Similarly, if freq[i] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can potentially remove all `i`s before Alice can pick one, by always removing `i` when available.

Wait, but Alice picks first, so perhaps there are some nuances.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of `n`.

Let me consider a simple case.

Suppose n=1:

- Alice picks the only element, adds it to `c`.

- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

- If the element is 0, MEX is 1.

- If the element is not 0, MEX is 0.

But in this case, Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she would pick 0 if available.

Wait, but in n=1, if a=[0], c=[0], MEX=1.

If a=[1], c=[1], MEX=0.

So, depending on the element, MEX is different.

But in this case, Alice has only one pick, and Bob has zero picks.

So, she can choose the element that maximizes the MEX.

If 0 is present, she picks 0, MEX=1.

If 0 is not present, she picks the available element, MEX=0.

So, in this case, she can achieve MEX=1 if 0 is present, else MEX=0.

So, in this case, she can achieve MEX=1 if 0 is present.

Wait, but in the problem, both want to play optimally.

So, if 0 is present, she picks 0, MEX=1.

If not, she picks whatever is there, MEX=0.

So, in this case, she can achieve MEX=1 if 0 is present, else MEX=0.

Another case, n=2:

- Alice picks one element, adds to `c`.

- Bob picks one element, removes it.

- a is now empty.

So, c has one element, chosen by Alice.

- If that element is 0, MEX=1.

- If that element is not 0, MEX=0.

But in this case, Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she would pick 0 if available.

So, if 0 is present, MEX=1.

If not, MEX=0.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], output is 0.

Which matches this.

Another example, n=4, a=[0,0,1,1].

Possible sequences:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0].

- Bob picks 1, a=[0,1].

- Alice picks 0, c=[0,0].

- Bob picks 1, a empty.

- MEX is 1, since 1 is missing in c.

Wait, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can collect both 0 and 1.

Wait, in the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1].

If Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But if Alice picks two 0's, c=[0,0], MEX=1.

So, Alice, wanting to maximize MEX, would pick 0 and 1.

But Bob can try to prevent her from getting certain numbers.

Wait, in this case, it seems that Alice can always pick one 0 and one 1, achieving MEX=2.

So, perhaps in this case, MEX=2 is achievable.

Wait, but in the sequence I thought earlier, if Alice picks 0 and 0, MEX=1.

But Alice, being optimal, would pick 0 and 1.

So, perhaps in this game, Alice can achieve MEX=2.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3].

Alice can pick 0,1,2, and Bob removes one of them.

Wait, no, Bob only has floor(n/2)=2 picks.

Alice has ceil(n/2)=2 picks.

So, Alice picks two elements, Bob picks two elements.

Alice wants to collect as many of 0,1,2,3 as possible.

If Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1].

Bob picks 2 and 3.

MEX is 2.

Wait, but in the example, output is 1.

Wait, maybe I need to see what Bob does.

Wait, perhaps Bob can pick in such a way to minimize the MEX.

Wait, in this case, if Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

If Alice picks 0 and 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

If Alice picks 0 and 3, c=[0,3], MEX=1.

If Alice picks 1 and 2, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

If Alice picks 1 and 3, c=[1,3], MEX=0.

If Alice picks 2 and 3, c=[2,3], MEX=0.

So, among these, the highest MEX Alice can achieve is 2, by picking 0 and 1.

But in the example, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice hasn't picked yet.

Wait, in the first move:

- Alice picks 0, a becomes [1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a becomes [2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a becomes [3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a becomes empty, c=[0,2]

MEX is 1.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 2, a=[0,1,3], c=[2]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3], c=[2]

- Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[2,1]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[2,1]

MEX is 0.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 3, a=[0,1,2], c=[3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,2], c=[3]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2], c=[3,1]

- Bob picks 2, a empty, c=[3,1]

MEX is 0.

So, in this case, the best Alice can do is MEX=1, by picking 0 and 2.

Wait, but in the example, output is 1.

So, perhaps MEX=1 is the optimal.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2.

I must have miscalculated.

Wait, in the first sequence where Alice picks 0 and 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

In another sequence where Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from getting both 0 and 1.

Wait, in the first sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,2]

MEX=1

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[1,2]

MEX=0

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 2, a=[0,1,3], c=[2]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3], c=[2]

- Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[2,1]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[2,1]

MEX=0

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 3, a=[0,1,2], c=[3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,2], c=[3]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2], c=[3,1]

- Bob picks 2, a empty, c=[3,1]

MEX=0

So, the best Alice can do is MEX=1, by picking 0 and 2.

Wait, but in the first sequence I thought of earlier, where Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But in reality, Bob can prevent that by picking 1 after Alice picks 0.

Wait, let's see:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,2]

MEX=1

So, in this sequence, Alice ends up with c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 2, a=[1,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,1]

MEX=2

So, in this sequence, Alice ends up with c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Similarly:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 3, a=[1,2], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 2, a empty, c=[0,1]

MEX=2

So, in some sequences, Alice can achieve MEX=2, while in others, MEX=1.

Bob wants to minimize, so he would choose the sequence where MEX=1.

Therefore, the optimal MEX is 1.

Wait, but in the example, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob cannot prevent Alice from getting both 0 and 1 in this case.

Wait, in the sequence where Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Bob can try to pick 1 after Alice picks 0, but Alice can then pick 2, and Bob picks 3, resulting in c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, Bob can pick 2 after Alice picks 0, then Alice picks 1, and Bob picks 3, resulting in c=[0,1], MEX=2.

So, depending on Bob's choices, MEX can be 1 or 2.

Since Bob wants to minimize, he would choose the sequence where MEX=1.

But in this case, it seems that Alice can force MEX=2 by picking 0 and 1 in her two picks.

Wait, but Bob can try to prevent that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of who picks first and the number of picks.

In this case, n=4, Alice has ceil(4/2)=2 picks, Bob has floor(4/2)=2 picks.

Alice picks two elements, Bob picks two elements.

Alice needs to collect both 0 and 1 to achieve MEX=2.

Bob can try to prevent this by picking one of them.

Wait, but in the sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,2]

MEX=1

In this sequence, Alice didn't get to pick 1 because Bob picked it.

But in another sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 2, a=[1,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,1]

MEX=2

So, Alice can achieve MEX=2 if she picks 0 and 1.

Bob can try to prevent this by picking 1 after Alice picks 0, but if Alice then picks 1 in her second pick, she can still get it.

Wait, but in the first sequence, Bob picks 1 after Alice picks 0, and then Alice picks 2.

So, Alice doesn't get to pick 1.

But in the second sequence, Bob picks 2, and Alice picks 1.

So, it seems that Alice can achieve MEX=2 if she picks 0 and 1 in her two picks.

Bob can't prevent her from picking both 0 and 1, because he can only pick two elements himself.

Wait, but in the first sequence, Bob picks 1, which is one of the elements Alice needs.

But Alice can still pick another element.

So, perhaps Alice can strategize to pick the elements she needs in her picks.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

In this case, 0 appears twice, 1 appears twice.

So, even if Bob picks one 1, there's still one 1 left for Alice to pick.

Wait, but in the first sequence, Bob picks 1 after Alice picks 0, so a=[2,3], c=[0].

Then Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3.

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But in this case, Alice didn't pick 1 because it was removed by Bob.

But since there were two 1's, Alice could have picked one 1, but Bob picked it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if a number appears multiple times, Alice can still get at least one even if Bob removes some.

Wait, in this specific case, since both 0 and 1 appear twice, Alice can ensure to pick at least one of each.

Wait, but in the first sequence, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

So, Alice didn't pick 1 because it was removed.

But since there were two 1's, and Bob picked one, there's still one 1 left.

So, perhaps Alice could have picked 1 in her second pick.

Wait, in the sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,1]

- Alice picks 3, a empty, c=[0,1,3]

But wait, n=4, so total picks are 4, Alice picks ceil(4/2)=2 times, Bob picks floor(4/2)=2 times.

So, in this case, Alice can only pick two elements.

So, in this alternative sequence:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,1]

- Alice picks 3, a empty, c=[0,1,3]

But this would be five picks, which is more than n=4.

Wait, no, with n=4, total picks are 4.

So, Alice picks twice, Bob picks twice.

So, in this sequence, Alice picks 0 and 1, Bob picks 1 and 2.

But since there's only one 1 left after Bob picks one, this might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

I need to find a way to determine the highest MEX Alice can achieve, considering Bob's interference.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the frequency of each number.

Let me sort the numbers and see how many of each are available.

Suppose I have a frequency array freq[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

Alice needs to collect as many consecutive numbers starting from 0 as possible.

Bob wants to prevent this.

I need to find the smallest k such that Alice cannot collect all numbers from 0 to k-1.

Wait, no, I need to find the highest k such that Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1, despite Bob's efforts.

So, I need to find the largest k where, for all i from 0 to k-1, freq[i] > floor(n/2).

Because if freq[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can always pick at least one i, even if Bob removes floor(n/2) elements.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=4, a=[0,0,1,1], freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2.

floor(n/2)=2.

So, for k=2, we need freq[0]>2 and freq[1]>2, which is not true.

But in reality, Alice can achieve MEX=2.

Wait, perhaps my condition is too strict.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be that the total number of elements from 0 to k-1 is greater than floor(n/2).

Because Alice needs to collect one of each, and Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements.

So, if the total number of elements from 0 to k-1 is greater than floor(n/2), Alice can collect at least one of each.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for k=2, total elements from 0 and 1 are 4, which is greater than floor(4/2)=2.

So, Alice can collect at least two elements from 0 and 1.

But she needs to collect both 0 and 1.

So, if freq[0]+freq[1] > floor(n/2), and freq[0]>0 and freq[1]>0, then Alice can collect both.

Wait, but in this case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, total=4 >2.

So, Alice can collect both 0 and 1.

Similarly, for k=3, total elements from 0,1,2 would be freq[0]+freq[1]+freq[2].

But in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1.

Total for k=2 is freq[0]+freq[1]=2 > floor(4/2)=2.

But in reality, Alice can only achieve MEX=2 in some sequences, but Bob can force MEX=1.

Wait, but according to my condition, total for k=2 is 2 >2, which is not true.

Wait, 2 >2 is false.

Wait, no, 2 >2 is false.

So, according to this condition, Alice cannot collect both 0 and 1, which contradicts the earlier sequence where she can achieve MEX=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to use >= instead of >.

So, if freq[0]+freq[1] >= floor(n/2)+1, then Alice can collect at least two elements, one of each.

Wait, in the first test case, freq[0]+freq[1]=4 >= floor(4/2)+1=3, which is true.

In the second test case, freq[0]+freq[1]=2 >= floor(4/2)+1=3, which is false.

So, according to this, in the first test case, Alice can achieve MEX=2, and in the second test case, she cannot.

Which matches the example output.

Wait, in the second test case, output is 1, meaning MEX=1.

But according to this condition, since freq[0]+freq[1]=2 >= floor(4/2)+1=3 is false, Alice cannot achieve MEX=2.

So, the highest MEX she can achieve is 1.

Which matches the example.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], freq[1]=2.

For k=1, freq[0]=0, which is not present.

So, MEX=0.

Wait, but according to the condition, for k=1, freq[0] >= floor(2/2)+1=1+1=2, which is false, since freq[0]=0.

So, Alice cannot achieve MEX=1.

Hence, MEX=0.

Which matches the example.

So, this seems to be a correct condition.

So, generalizing, for a given k, to achieve MEX=k, Alice needs to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1, and the total frequency of numbers from 0 to k-1 should be >= floor(n/2)+1.

If that's the case, then Alice can collect at least one of each from 0 to k-1.

Hence, the highest k where this condition holds is the answer.

So, I can iterate k from 0 upwards, and find the highest k where sum(freq[0 to k-1]) >= floor(n/2)+1.

Wait, but k starts from 0.

Wait, for k=0, sum is 0 >= floor(n/2)+1, which is false.

For k=1, sum(freq[0]) >= floor(n/2)+1.

For k=2, sum(freq[0]+freq[1]) >= floor(n/2)+1.

And so on.

So, I can find the maximum k where this condition holds.

Then, the MEX would be k.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=2, sum(freq[0]+freq[1])=4 >=2+1=3, which is true.

Hence, MEX=2.

In the second test case, k=2, sum=2 >=2+1=3, false.

Hence, MEX=1.

In the third test case, k=1, sum(freq[0])=0 >=1+1=2, false.

Hence, MEX=0.

Which matches the examples.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Hence, the strategy is:

- Compute floor(n/2)+1.

- Sort the frequencies of a in ascending order.

- Iterate k from 0 upwards, accumulating the sum of frequencies from 0 to k-1.

- The largest k where sum >= floor(n/2)+1 is the MEX.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum(freq[0]+freq[1])=4 >=2+1=3, which is true, so MEX=2.

In the second test case, sum(freq[0]+freq[1])=2 >=2+1=3, false, so MEX=1.

In the third test case, sum(freq[0])=0 >=1+1=2, false, so MEX=0.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, sum(freq[0]+freq[1])=2 >=2+1=3 is false, so MEX=1.

Which matches the example output of 1.

Similarly, in the first test case, sum(freq[0]+freq[1])=4 >=2+1=3, so MEX=2.

Which matches the example output of 2.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Hence, in the code, I need to:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Compute floor(n/2)+1.

- Sort the frequencies of a.

- Iterate k from 0 upwards, accumulating sum of frequencies from freq[0] to freq[k-1].

- Find the largest k where sum >= floor(n/2)+1.

- Output k.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to do something different.

Let me look at the given code:

def func():

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

S = int(input())

N = list(map(int, input().split()))

N.sort()

cur = -1

M = {}

for num in N:

if num > cur:

if num > cur + 1:

cur += 1

break

cur = num

M[cur] = 1

else:

M[cur] += 1

if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:

cur +=
