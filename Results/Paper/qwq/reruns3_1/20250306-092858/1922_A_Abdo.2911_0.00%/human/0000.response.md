Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th character.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find such a template t for each test case, and if it exists, print "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to generate a template t based on strings a and b, such that both a and b match this template, and c does not.

Let's consider each position i from 1 to n.

For each position i, I have the characters a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I make t[i] lowercase, then for both a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i]. Also, for c not to match, c[i] should not be equal to t[i].

If I make t[i] uppercase, then for a and b to match, a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to the lowercase version of t[i]. For c not to match, c[i] should be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] must not be equal to t[i].lower().

- Similarly, b[i] must not be equal to t[i].lower().

- For c not to match, c[i] should be equal to t[i].lower().

Wait, actually, for c not to match, at least one position should not satisfy the template's condition.

But to ensure that c does not match, I need to make sure that there is at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i].lower() == t[i].lower().

So, my goal is to construct t in such a way that both a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Let me think about each position independently.

For each position i, I have the following possibilities:

1. a[i] == b[i]:

   - In this case, to make both a and b match the template, I can set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), provided that c[i] != a[i].

   - Alternatively, I can set t[i] to a[i].upper() (uppercase), but then c[i] must be equal to a[i].

   - Wait, if t[i] is a[i].upper(), then for a and b to match, a[i] != a[i].lower(), which is not true, since a[i] is already lowercase. Wait, no.

   - Actually, if t[i] is uppercase, say A, then for a string to match, its i-th character must not be 'a'.

   - But a[i] is 'a', so if t[i] is 'A', then a[i] == 'a', which is different from 'A'.lower() == 'a', so it doesn't match. Wait, that's not right.

   - Wait, the condition is: if t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from t[i].lower().

   - So, if t[i] is 'A', then s[i] must not be 'a'.

   - So, for a and b to match, a[i] must not be equal to t[i].lower().

   - But a[i] is 'a', so t[i].lower() must not be 'a'.

   - Wait, that would mean t[i] cannot be 'a' or 'A'.

   - Wait, no. If t[i] is 'A', then a[i] must not be 'a'.

   - But a[i] is 'a', so a wouldn't match.

   - So, if a[i] == b[i], and I set t[i] to a[i].upper(), then a and b would not match, because a[i] == t[i].lower().

   - Therefore, to make a and b match, if a[i] == b[i], I must set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), and ensure that c[i] != a[i].

   - Alternatively, if c[i] == a[i], then I cannot set t[i] to a[i] lowercase, so I need to see if setting t[i] to a[i].upper() would work.

   - If t[i] is a[i].upper(), then for a and b to match, a[i] != a[i].lower(), which is not true, since a[i] is already lowercase.

   - Wait, no. If t[i] is 'A' (uppercase), then for a string to match, its i-th character must not be 'a'.

   - But a[i] is 'a', so a wouldn't match if t[i] is 'A'.

   - Therefore, if a[i] == b[i], the only way to make both a and b match is to set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), and c[i] != a[i].

   - If c[i] == a[i], then I cannot make both a and b match while c doesn't match at this position.

   - Therefore, for positions where a[i] == b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] to have a possibility of making a and b match while c doesn't.

2. a[i] != b[i]:

   - In this case, I need to make both a and b match the template, but they have different characters at this position.

   - If t[i] is lowercase, then both a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], but a[i] != b[i], which is impossible.

   - Therefore, t[i] must be uppercase.

   - If t[i] is uppercase, then for a and b to match, a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower().

   - So, I need to choose t[i].lower() such that neither a[i] nor b[i] is equal to t[i].lower().

   - That is, t[i].lower() should not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

   - Since a[i] != b[i], there are 25 other lowercase letters I can choose for t[i].lower() (assuming lowercase letters only).

   - Then, for c not to match, c[i] should be equal to t[i].lower().

   - So, I can choose t[i].lower() to be equal to c[i], provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

   - If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot choose t[i].lower() to be c[i], because that would make c match the template.

   - Wait, no. If I set t[i].lower() to c[i], then for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower(), which is c[i], so it matches, which is not what I want.

   - Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then for c not to match, c[i] must be equal to 'x'.

   - So, to make c not match, I need c[i] == t[i].lower().

   - Therefore, I should set t[i].lower() to c[i].

   - But, to make a and b match, I need a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower().

   - So, t[i].lower() cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i].

   - Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can set t[i].lower() to c[i], provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

   - If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then setting t[i].lower() to c[i] would make a and b match (since a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]), and c does not match because c[i] == c[i].

   - So, in this case, I can set t[i] to c[i].upper(), and it satisfies the conditions.

   - If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot set t[i].lower() to c[i], because that would make a or b not match.

   - In such cases, I need to choose t[i].lower() to be something other than a[i], b[i], or c[i], but ensuring that c[i] != t[i].lower() to make c not match.

   - Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower() to not match.

   - So, to make c not match, c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower().

   - But to make a and b match, t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

   - So, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can set t[i].lower() to c[i], satisfying both conditions.

   - If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot set t[i].lower() to c[i], because that would make a or b not match.

   - In such cases, I need to choose t[i].lower() to be something other than a[i], b[i], or c[i], but then c[i] != t[i].lower(), which would make c match, which is not desired.

   - Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] to be able to set t[i].lower() to c[i], making a and b match and c not match.

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Must have c[i] != a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions hold for all positions, then I can construct such a template t.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Wait, but actually, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] to set t[i].lower() to c[i], making c not match.

If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot make c not match while a and b match.

Therefore, for all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions hold for all positions, then I can construct such a template t.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Wait, but in the second case, if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can set t[i].lower() to c[i], making a and b match (since a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]), and c not match (since c[i] == c[i]).

Wait, but c not matching requires that at least one position doesn't satisfy the template's condition.

But in this setup, for each position, I'm ensuring that c doesn't match at that position.

But actually, the c string must not match the template, which means that there exists at least one position where c doesn't satisfy the template's condition.

So, in my earlier approach, I'm making sure that for each position, c doesn't match the template.

But perhaps it's sufficient to make just one position where c doesn't match, while a and b match at all positions.

So, maybe I can relax the conditions.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, I'm trying to make t such that a and b match at all positions, and c doesn't match at all positions.

But actually, c only needs to not match at least one position.

So, perhaps I can construct t such that:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), and ensure that c[i] != a[i].

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Set t[i] to some uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i] or b[i], and hope that c[i] != t[i].lower().

Wait, but c needs to not match the template, which means there exists at least one position where the template's condition is not satisfied.

So, perhaps I can set t[i] for some positions to make c not match at that position, while ensuring a and b match at all positions.

This seems more flexible.

Let me think differently.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template at all positions.

Then, I need to ensure that c does not match the template, meaning there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

So, I need to find a template t such that:

1. For all i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

2. For all i, if t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower().

3. There exists at least one i where:

   - If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i].

   - If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == t[i].lower().

So, I need to choose t[i] for each position i to satisfy the above.

Let me consider each position independently and see what choices I have for t[i].

For each position i:

- Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

  - Subcase 1: c[i] == a[i]

    - If I set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), then a and b match, but c also matches because c[i] == t[i], which violates the condition for c.

    - If I set t[i] to a[i].upper(), then a and b would not match because a[i] == t[i].lower(), which is not allowed for uppercase in the template.

    - So, no valid t[i] in this subcase.

  - Subcase 2: c[i] != a[i]

    - If I set t[i] to a[i] (lowercase), then a and b match, and c does not match because c[i] != a[i].

    - If I set t[i] to a[i].upper(), then a and b do not match because a[i] == t[i].lower(), which is not allowed.

    - So, only t[i] = a[i] (lowercase) is valid in this subcase.

- Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

  - Subcase 1: c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]

    - If c[i] == a[i], and I set t[i] to some uppercase letter whose lower() is not a[i] or b[i], then:

      - For a to match, a[i] != t[i].lower().

      - For b to match, b[i] != t[i].lower().

      - For c not to match, c[i] == t[i].lower().

    - But if c[i] == a[i], and t[i].lower() != a[i], then c[i] != t[i].lower(), which means c matches the template, which is not what I want.

    - Similarly, if c[i] == b[i], same issue.

    - So, in this subcase, I cannot make c not match the template while a and b match.

  - Subcase 2: c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

    - I can set t[i] to c[i].upper(), so t[i].lower() == c[i].

    - Then, for a and b to match, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which is true in this subcase.

    - For c not to match, c[i] == t[i].lower(), which satisfies the condition.

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] == a[i], then no valid t[i].

  - If c[i] != a[i], then set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then no valid t[i].

  - If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then set t[i] = c[i].upper().

Therefore, to have a valid template t, the following must hold:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i].

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If these conditions are satisfied, then I can construct t as described, and "YES" is the answer; otherwise, "NO".

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1:

n=1

a='a'

b='b'

c='c'

Here, a[0] == 'a', b[0] == 'b', c[0] == 'c'

Since a[0] != b[0], and c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0], so set t[0] = 'C'

Then, a[0] != 'c', b[0] != 'c', c[0] == 'c', so a and b match, c does not match.

Hence, "YES"

Test case 2:

n=2

a='aa'

b='bb'

c='aa'

Position 1: a[0]=='a', b[0]=='b', c[0]=='a'

Here, a[0] != b[0], but c[0] == a[0], so no valid t[i].

Hence, "NO"

Test case 3:

n=10

a='mathforces'

b='luckforces'

c='adhoccoder'

Compare each position:

Positions where a[i] == b[i]: 'h', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'c', 'e', 's'

For these positions, c[i] must != a[i]

Check:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Compare:

Pos 0: m != l, c==a? a!='m' -> ok

Pos 1: a != u, c==a? a=='a' -> not ok

Already fails here.

But in the note, it says "YES", which contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in position 1:

a[0]=='m', b[0]=='l', c[0]=='a'

a[0] != b[0], and c[0] != a[0] and c[0] != b[0] -> 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' -> yes.

Wait, 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' is true.

Wait, but in position 1 (index 0):

a='m', b='l', c='a'

a != b, and c != a and c != b -> 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l' -> true.

Similarly, position 1 (index 1):

a='a', b='u', c='d'

a != b, c != a and c != b -> 'd' != 'a' and 'd' != 'u' -> true.

Position 2: t vs c -> t vs h, c='h' != a='t' and != b='c' -> 'h' != 't' and 'h' != 'c' -> true.

Position 3: h vs k, c='o' != 'h' and != 'k' -> 'o' != 'h' and 'o' != 'k' -> true.

And so on.

So, in this case, for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

And for positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i].

Hence, "YES"

Wait, but in the note, it says "YES", which aligns with my corrected thought.

Another test case:

n=3

a='acc'

b='abd'

c='abc'

Positions:

0: a == a, c=='a' != a -> ok

1: c != b, c=='c' != a and != b -> 'c' != 'a' and 'c' != 'b' -> true

2: c != d, c=='c' != c or != d -> 'c' == 'c', which violates the condition.

Wait, c[i] == c, and a[i]=c, b[i]=d.

So, c[i] == a[i] ('c' == 'c'), which violates the condition for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Here, a[2] == c[2], so condition fails.

Hence, "NO"

So, my earlier conclusion seems correct.

Therefore, the approach is:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i], ensure c[i] != a[i].

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], ensure c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- If both conditions hold for all positions, then "YES"; else, "NO".

Now, looking at the given program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

template = []

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

template.append(a[i])

else:

template.append(a[i].upper())

match_a_b = True

for i in range(n):

if template[i].islower():

if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:

match_a_b = False

break

elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():

match_a_b = False

break

match_c = True

for i in range(n):

if template[i].islower():

if c[i] != template[i]:

match_c = False

break

elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():

match_c = False

break

if match_a_b and (not match_c):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

This program constructs the template by:

- If a[i] == b[i], set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase)

- Else, set t[i] = a[i].upper()

Then, it checks if both a and b match this template, and c does not match.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, when a[i] != b[i], setting t[i] to a[i].upper() may not ensure that a and b match, because if t[i].lower() == a[i], then for b[i] != a[i], b[i] != t[i].lower(), which is okay.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, say t[i] = a[i].upper(), then for a to match, a[i] != t[i].lower(), which is a[i] != a[i], which is false. So a doesn't match.

Hence, this program is incorrect because it sets t[i] to a[i].upper() when a[i] != b[i], which makes a not match the template.

Wait, in the code, it sets template[i] to a[i].upper() when a[i] != b[i].

Then, in the match_a_b check:

- If template[i] is uppercase, it checks if a[i].lower() != template[i].lower() and b[i].lower() != template[i].lower().

Wait, no. In the code:

elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():

match_a_b = False

break

But template[i] is a[i].upper(), so template[i].lower() == a[i].

So, a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() is true (since a[i] is lowercase), which sets match_a_b to False.

Hence, the program correctly identifies that a doesn't match when t[i] is set to a[i].upper().

Wait, but according to the problem, if t[i] is uppercase, s[i] must not be equal to t[i].lower().

So, for a to match, a[i] != t[i].lower().

But a[i] == t[i].lower(), so a doesn't match.

Similarly, for b to match, b[i] != t[i].lower().

If b[i] != a[i], then b[i] != t[i].lower(), so b matches.

But a doesn't match.

So, the program is trying to set t[i] to a[i].upper() when a[i] != b[i], which makes a not match, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is flawed in its approach to constructing the template.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. 

### Approach

1. **Understanding Matching Rules**:
    - If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` must match exactly.
    - If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` must differ from the lowercase version of the template's i-th character.

2. **Template Construction**:
    - For positions where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, set the template character to `a[i]` (lowercase), provided `c
