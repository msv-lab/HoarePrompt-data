Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a one-dimensional grid of length n, and each cell has either a '<' or a '>'. When a pinball is placed on a cell, it moves according to the direction of the arrow. But here's the twist: after moving, the arrow inverts. So, if it was '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa. The pinball keeps moving until it falls off the grid either from the left or the right.

I need to handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have a grid of length n with a string of '<' and '>', and I have to answer for each position from 1 to n, how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid if placed there.

First, I need to understand how the pinball moves and how the inversion affects its path. Let's consider a simple example to get a feel for it.

Take n=3 with s="><<".

If I place the pinball at position 1 (which has '>'), it will move right to position 2. After moving, the '<' at position 2 inverts to '>', and the '>' at position 1 inverts to '<'. So now the string is "<><". The pinball is now at position 2, which has '>', so it moves right to position 3. The '<' at position 3 inverts to '>', and the '>' at position 2 inverts to '<'. Now the string is "<><". The pinball is at position 3, which has '>', so it moves right and falls off the grid. Total time: 3 seconds.

Wait, but according to the example, for i=1, the answer is 3, which matches this.

Let me try i=2.

Position 2 has '<', so it moves left to position 1. The '<' at position 2 inverts to '>', and the '>' at position 1 inverts to '<'. Now the string is "<><". The pinball is at position 1, which has '<', so it moves left and falls off the grid. Total time: 1 second.

But according to the example, for i=2, the answer is 6. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the inversion.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted."

So, s_i is the cell from which the pinball moved.

Wait, in my earlier example for i=2:

- Pinball at position 2 ('<'), moves left to position 1.

- The cell from which it moved is position 2, so s_2 inverts from '<' to '>'.

- The cell it moved to, position 1, does not invert unless the pinball moves from there.

So, after moving, s becomes ">><" (assuming initial was "><<").

Wait, no: only the cell from which it moved inverts. So, s_2 inverts from '<' to '>', so s becomes ">><".

Then, pinball is at position 1, which has '>', so it moves right to position 2 ('>'), which is now '>', so it moves right to position 3 ('<'), which inverts to '>', and so on.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let's simulate it step by step.

Initial grid: "><<"

Place pinball at position 2 ('<').

- Moves left to position 1.

- Invert s_2 from '<' to '>', so grid becomes ">><"

- Pinball is at position 1 ('>'), moves right to position 2 ('>'), inverts s_1 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('>'), moves right to position 3 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<<>"

- Pinball at position 3 ('<'), moves left to position 2 ('<'), inverts s_3 from '<' to '>', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('<'), moves left to position 1 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '<' to '>', grid becomes ">><"

- Pinball at position 1 ('>'), moves right to position 2 ('>'), inverts s_1 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('>'), moves right to position 3 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<<>"

- Pinball at position 3 ('<'), moves left to position 2 ('<'), inverts s_3 from '<' to '>', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('<'), moves left to position 1 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '<' to '>', grid becomes ">><"

- Pinball at position 1 ('>'), moves right to position 2 ('>'), inverts s_1 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('>'), moves right to position 3 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<<>"

- Pinball at position 3 ('<'), moves left to position 2 ('<'), inverts s_3 from '<' to '>', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('<'), moves left to position 1 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '<' to '>', grid becomes ">><"

- Pinball at position 1 ('>'), moves right to position 2 ('>'), inverts s_1 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<><"

- Pinball at position 2 ('>'), moves right to position 3 ('<'), inverts s_2 from '>' to '<', grid becomes "<<>"

- Pinball at position 3 ('<'), moves left to position 2 ('<'), inverts s_3 from '<' to '>', grid becomes "<><"

This seems to be cycling without the pinball ever leaving the grid, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed to leave in finite time. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the inversion affects the path in a way that eventually leads to the pinball exiting.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe I need to model the movement without keeping track of the grid's state changes, but instead find a pattern or mathematical formula that can predict the number of steps without simulating each move.

Given the constraints, with n up to 5*10^5 and t up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to calculate the answer for each position using some precomputed prefix and suffix sums involving positions of '>' and '<'.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, let's understand the provided code.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and s1.

Then it calls func_2(s1, n), which seems to compute the answers for each position.

func_1 seems to be a helper function that computes something based on an array and a number of times.

In func_2:

- It creates a list 'pre' of positions where s1 has '>', indexed from 1.

- It computes the total number of '>' (totalOne).

- It computes prefix sums of 'pre' with an initial 0.

- It initializes suffZero as [0].

- It initializes ans as a list of zeros with length n.

Then, it iterates from n-1 down to 0:

- If the current character is '>', it does some calculations involving func_1 on suffZero and preOne.

- If the current character is '<', it appends the cumulative sum to suffZero and does similar calculations.

Finally, it prints the answers for each position.

This seems quite optimized, but I need to verify if the logic is correct.

I need to understand what func_1 does.

func_1(arr, times):

- It takes an array and a number of times.

- It returns arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)], where n is len(arr).

So, it's returning the difference between the last element and the element at position times from the end.

Wait, max(-n, -1 - times): if times is less than n-1, it's -1 - times, else -n.

I think this is to handle cases where times is larger than the array length.

But I'm not fully following this yet.

Maybe I need to look into how this is used in func_2.

In func_2:

For each position from n-1 to 0:

- If s1[i] is '>', it does some calculations involving suffZero and preOne.

- Else, it appends the cumulative sum to suffZero and does other calculations.

I need to understand what preOne and suffZero represent.

pre is the list of positions (1-indexed) where s1 has '>'.

preOne is the prefix sum of pre, with an initial 0.

suffZero starts with [0], and for each i from n-1 to 0, if s1[i] is '<', it appends suffZero[-1] + i+1.

So, suffZero seems to be accumulating the positions of '<' from the end.

I think the idea is to precompute the positions of '>' and '<', and then for each starting position, calculate the number of steps based on how many '>' or '<' are before or after it.

But the exact logic is a bit unclear.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the pinball bouncing between '>' and '<', and the inversions changing the direction over time.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or try to find a mathematical formula.

Let me consider that each move and inversion effectively changes the direction of the arrow the pinball just left.

This is similar to a system where the pinball is reflecting off the arrows.

Perhaps I can model this as a series of reflections until it exits.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Another idea: since the grid is one-dimensional, and the pinball moves left or right based on the current arrow, and the arrow inverts after moving, this might be modeled as a finite state machine, where each state represents the current configuration of the grid and the position of the pinball.

But with n up to 5*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each '>' moves the pinball right, and each '<' moves it left, and the inversion changes the direction for future moves.

But keeping track of all inversions seems too time-consuming.

Maybe I can find a way to calculate the net movement for each starting position.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be using some form of prefix and suffix sums to calculate the answer for each position.

Given that, perhaps it's correct, but I need to verify it with the sample input.

Let's take the first sample input:

3

><<

According to the sample, the answers are 3, 6, 5.

Let me simulate it step by step for i=1.

Place pinball at position 1 ('>'):

- Move right to position 2, s1[1] inverts to '<', s1 becomes "<<"

- At position 2 ('<'), move left to position 1, s1[2] inverts to '>', s1 becomes "<>"

- At position 1 ('<'), move left and fall off the grid.

Total steps: 3, which matches the sample.

For i=2:

Place pinball at position 2 ('<'):

- Move left to position 1, s1[2] inverts to '>', s1 becomes ">><"

- At position 1 ('>'), move right to position 2, s1[1] inverts to '<', s1 becomes "<><"
