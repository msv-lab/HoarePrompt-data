Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. So, it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem. Everule starts from island 1 and can travel through bridges to other islands. Dominater wants to restrict this movement by destroying up to k bridges, but Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can still reach.

So, Dominater's goal is to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying at most k bridges.

I need to figure out, given n and k, what's the smallest number of islands Everule can still reach.

Let me think about small cases to get an intuition.

Take n=2, k=0.

If there are 2 islands and no bridges can be destroyed, Everule can reach both islands via the bridge. So, the answer is 2.

n=2, k=1.

There's only one bridge. If Dominater destroys it, Everule can only stay on island 1. So, the answer is 1.

n=3, k=1.

There are 3 islands and 3 bridges. If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between island 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3 if the other bridges are intact. So, it's not straightforward.

Wait, in the third test case of the example, n=4, k=1, and the output is 4, meaning that even after destroying one bridge, Everule can still reach all islands.

So, in general, Dominater needs to strategy to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying up to k bridges.

I recall that in graph theory, to disconnect a node from as many other nodes as possible, you can try to cut its connections.

In a complete graph, to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, you need to destroy all bridges connected to island 1, which is (n-1) bridges.

So, if k >= (n-1), Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

Otherwise, if k < (n-1), Dominater can only disconnect some bridges from island 1, but Everule can still reach some other islands through indirect paths.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4, k=1, and the output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands even after one bridge is destroyed.

Let me think about n=4.

Islands 1,2,3,4. Initially, all are connected.

If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3 or 4.

So, indeed, Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, for n=5, k=3.

The total number of bridges is 10. If Dominater destroys 3 bridges, can they disconnect enough islands to minimize the reachable islands for Everule?

In the example, for n=5, k=10, which is all bridges, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

Another test case is n=5, k=3, and the output is 5, meaning that even after destroying 3 bridges, Everule can still reach all islands.

So, I need a general approach.

Let me think about how many bridges need to be destroyed to disconnect island 1 from as many islands as possible.

In a complete graph, the connectivity is very high, so it's hard to isolate island 1 by destroying just a few bridges.

I need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, which means I need to maximize the number of islands that are disconnected from island 1.

But Dominater can only destroy up to k bridges.

I need to find a way to compute how many islands can be disconnected by destroying up to k bridges.

Alternatively, think about how many bridges are needed to keep a certain number of islands connected to island 1.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of bridges connected to island 1.

Island 1 has (n-1) bridges connected to it.

If Dominater destroys some of these bridges, Everule can still reach other islands through paths that don't directly go through island 1.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, the graph remains connected even after removing many bridges, especially if we don't remove all bridges connected to island 1.

So, perhaps the key is to see if Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands by destroying up to k bridges.

To completely disconnect island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all (n-1) bridges connected to it.

If k >= (n-1), then Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

If k < (n-1), then island 1 is still connected to at least (n-1 - k) islands directly.

But even if some direct bridges are destroyed, Everule might still reach other islands through indirect paths.

In a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two islands, so it's resilient to bridge destruction.

In fact, a complete graph is highly connected; it remains connected unless all bridges connected to a node are destroyed.

So, unless Dominater destroys all (n-1) bridges connected to island 1, Everule can still reach all other islands through some path.

Therefore, if k < (n-1), the number of islands Everule can visit is n (including island 1).

If k >= (n-1), Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, k=3, the output is 5, meaning Everule can still visit all islands.

But according to my reasoning, for k >= (n-1), which is 4 for n=5, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands.

But in the example, for n=5, k=10, which is all bridges, Dominater can indeed disconnect island 1 from others.

But for k=3, which is less than (n-1)=4, Everule can still reach all islands.

So, my initial reasoning seems consistent with the examples.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, k=1, Dominater destroys the only bridge, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

Here, (n-1)=1, and k=1, which matches my reasoning.

Another test case: n=4, k=4.

Total bridges: 6.

(n-1)=3.

Since k=4 >=3, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

But in the example, for n=4, k=4, the output is 1, which matches.

Wait, but in the program, for n=4, k=1, it prints 4, which matches the example.

In the program, it seems to implement:

if n - k <=1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, k=3, it prints 5, which matches because k=3 < (n-1)=4.

Wait, but according to the program, n - k <=1 should be 5 - 3 =2 <=1? No, 2 >1, so print n=5, which matches the example.

Wait, but in the program, it's n - k <=1, which seems correct based on my reasoning.

Wait, but in the program, it's written as n - k <=1, which for n=5, k=3, 5-3=2 >1, so print n.

For n=2, k=1, 2-1=1 <=1, so print 1.

For n=4, k=1, 4-1=3 >1, print 4.

For n=5, k=10, 5-10=-5 <=1, print 1.

Yes, this seems consistent with the examples and my reasoning.

Wait, but in the program, it's written as:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, no, let's see.

In Python, the expression is n if condition else 1.

Condition is n - k <=1.

So, if n - k <=1, print n, else print 1.

But in my earlier reasoning, if k >= (n-1), print 1, else print n.

Wait, in the program, it's n - k <=1, which is equivalent to n -1 <=k, which is k >= n-1.

So, if k >= n-1, print n, else print 1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit 1 island, which is island 1.

So, the program seems to have it backwards.

Wait, in the program, it's:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

According to my reasoning, it should be:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

Which is equivalent to:

print(n if k < n-1 else 1)

But in the program, it's n if n - k <=1 else 1, which is n if k >= n-1 else 1.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

So, the program is printing n if k >= n-1, else 1.

But according to my reasoning, if k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit 1 island.

So, the program is printing n when k >= n-1, but according to my reasoning, it should print 1.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

My earlier reasoning was:

If k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, so Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can visit all islands via some paths.

So, the correct output should be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But in the program, it's:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Which is the same as:

if k >= n -1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to my reasoning, it should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

So, the program seems to have the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the condition.

Let me double-check.

n - k <=1 is equivalent to n -1 <=k, which is k >= n-1.

So, the program is:

if k >= n-1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to my reasoning, it should be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

So, the program seems incorrect.

But in the example, for n=5, k=3, n - k = 2 >1, so print 1, but according to the example, it should print 5.

Wait, no, in the example, for n=5, k=3, it prints 5, and according to the program, n - k =2 >1, so it should print 1, but the example shows 5.

Wait, no, in the example, for n=5, k=3, output is 5.

But according to the program, it's print(n if n - k <=1 else 1), which is n=5, k=3, 5 -3=2 >1, so print 1, but the example output is 5.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but perhaps I misread the program.

Let me check the program again.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

So, for n=5, k=3, n - k =2 >1, so print 1, but according to the example, it should print 5.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

But perhaps there's another way to interpret it.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me re-read the problem.

We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, given that Dominater destroys up to k bridges optimally to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

In other words, Dominater wants to maximize the isolation of island 1 by destroying up to k bridges.

In a complete graph, to isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all (n-1) bridges connected to it.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, and Everule can visit all islands via some paths.

Hence, the output should be:

if k >= n-1:

1

else:

n

But according to the program, it's:

n if n - k <=1 else 1

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

n

else:

1

Which is the same as:

if k >= n-1:

n

else:

1

But according to my reasoning, it should be:

if k >= n-1:

1

else:

n

So, the program is indeed incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

Wait, but perhaps there's another perspective.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying up to k bridges.

In a complete graph, the graph is highly connected, so unless Dominater destroys all (n-1) bridges connected to island 1, Everule can still reach all other islands via alternative paths.

Hence, if k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot fully isolate island 1, so Everule can visit all islands.

Hence, the output should be:

if k >= n-1:

1

else:

n

But the program is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

n

else:

1

Which is the same as:

if k >= n-1:

n

else:

1

So, it's printing n when k >= n-1, but according to my reasoning, it should print 1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

But in the example, for n=5, k=3, according to the program, it should print 1, but the example output is 5.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1, it should print 1, and the example output is 1.

For n=4, k=1, it should print 4, and the example output is 4.

For n=5, k=10, it should print 1, and the example output is 1.

Wait, but for n=5, k=3, the program would print 1, but the example output is 5, which matches my earlier reasoning that it should print n when k < n-1.

Hence, the program is indeed incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, k=3, output is 5, which according to my reasoning, k=3 < n-1=4, so print n=5.

But according to the program, it's print(n if n - k <=1 else 1), which for n=5, k=3, n - k =2 >1, so print 1, which doesn't match the example output of 5.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but perhaps the problem is different.

Maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Let me read the problem again.

"Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges. Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges."

"Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally."

So, Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying up to k bridges.

In other words, Dominater wants to make the connected component containing island 1 as small as possible.

In a complete graph, the only way to disconnect islands from island 1 is to destroy all (n-1) bridges connected to island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, so Everule can still reach all islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Hence, the output should be:

if k >= n-1:

1

else:

n

But the program is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

n

else:

1

Which is the same as:

if k >= n-1:

n

else:

1

So, it's printing n when k >= n-1, but according to my reasoning, it should print 1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the condition.

Let me check with another example.

Take n=3, k=1.

According to the program, n - k =2 >1, so print 1.

But according to my reasoning, k=1 < n-1=2, so Everule can visit all islands, so should print 3.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but in the example provided, for n=4, k=1, output is 4, which matches my reasoning, but according to the program, n - k =3 >1, so print 1, which contradicts the example.

Hence, the program is indeed incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit starting from island 1, given that Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges optimally to minimize the number of reachable islands.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Graph Structure:**
   - We have a complete graph with \( n \) islands, meaning there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) bridges initially.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can traverse any path formed by the remaining bridges.

2. **Dominater's Strategy:**
   - Dominater aims to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying at most \( k \) bridges.
   - To completely isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all \( n-1 \) bridges connected to it.

3. **Determination of Reachable Islands:**
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), Dominater can destroy all \( n-1 \) bridges connected to island 1, making it impossible for Everule to reach any other island. Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely. Since the graph is complete, there will always be multiple paths connecting island 1 to other islands, ensuring that Everule can reach all islands.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Condition Check:**
   - We check if the number of bridges Dominater can destroy, \( k \), is greater than or equal to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), print 1 because island 1 is isolated.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), print \( n \) because Everule can reach all islands.

2. **Optimal Bridge Destruction:**
   - Destroying up to \( k \) bridges cannot prevent Everule from finding alternative paths to other islands if \( k < n-1 \), due to the high connectivity of the complete graph.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution runs in \( O(1) \) time per test case, making it efficient even for the upper limit of \( t = 10^3 \).

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on Dominater's optimal bridge destruction strategy.
