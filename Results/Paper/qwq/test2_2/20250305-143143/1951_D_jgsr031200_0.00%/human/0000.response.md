Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with values of n and k, both can be up to 10^18. The number of test cases is up to 1000, which is manageable.

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 7, k = 3

Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Alice buys:

- At stall 1: 7 // 2 = 3 jewels, remaining coins = 7 - 3*2 = 1

- Since 1 coin is less than any other stall's price, she stops.

Total jewels bought: 3, which matches k.

In the third test case:

n = 255, k = 8

Bob sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Alice buys:

- At stall 1: 255 // 128 = 1 jewel, remaining = 255 - 128 = 127

- At stall 2: 127 // 64 = 1, remaining = 127 - 64 = 63

- At stall 3: 63 // 32 = 1, remaining = 63 - 32 = 31

- At stall 4: 31 // 16 = 1, remaining = 31 - 16 = 15

- At stall 5: 15 // 8 = 1, remaining = 15 - 8 = 7

- At stall 6: 7 // 4 = 1, remaining = 7 - 4 = 3

- At stall 7: 3 // 2 = 1, remaining = 3 - 2 = 1

- At stall 8: 1 // 1 = 1, remaining = 1 - 1 = 0

Total jewels bought: 8, which matches k.

The second test case is "NO", which means it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=6 coins.

Let me think about the general approach.

First, Alice buys jewels greedily, meaning she always buys as many as possible from the current stall before moving to the next one.

Bob needs to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Constraints:

- At most 60 stalls.

- Each stall has a price between 1 and 10^18.

- Alice doesn't need to spend all her coins, just buy exactly k jewels.

I need to find a way to choose prices for the stalls such that the total number of jewels Alice buys is exactly k.

Let me consider some simple cases.

Case 1: k = 1

Bob can set up one stall with price n, so Alice buys one jewel.

But wait, if n is large, and k is 1, Bob can set up one stall with price n, and Alice buys one jewel.

Case 2: n = k

Bob can set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n jewels, which is equal to k.

Wait, no. If n = k, and Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice buys n jewels, which is k. So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but in the program above, it checks if n == k, then outputs "YES" with one stall of price 1.

But according to the problem, if n = k, setting one stall with price 1 will make Alice buy n jewels, which is k. So, that seems correct.

Case 3: n < k

This seems impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

Wait, but if n < k, and Bob sets up stalls with prices less than or equal to n, Alice can buy at most n jewels, which is less than k.

But in the program above, it checks if n < k, then outputs "NO". That seems correct.

Case 4: n > k

This is the general case. Bob needs to set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Looking at the first example:

n = 7, k = 3

Stalls: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

Alice buys 3 jewels at stall 1 (7//2 = 3), remaining 1 coin, which is less than any other stall's price, so she stops.

Total jewels: 3, which matches k.

Another example:

n = 255, k = 8

Stalls: 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1

Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, total 8 jewels.

This seems like a binary representation approach.

Wait, 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255, which is n.

So, if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from the largest power less than or equal to n, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, spending exactly n coins and buying k jewels.

In this case, k is the number of stalls, which is the number of bits in n's binary representation.

Wait, but in this case, k is 8, and n is 255, which is 2^8 - 1, so it has 8 bits set.

So, if n has b bits set in its binary representation, then setting up stalls with prices as the powers of 2 corresponding to those bits would make Alice buy one jewel from each stall, totaling b jewels.

But in this case, k is given, and it might not match the number of bits set in n.

Wait, but in the third test case, k=8, which is the number of bits in 255 (which is 255 = 11111111 in binary), so 8 bits set.

But k can be any value between 1 and n, not necessarily related to the binary representation.

Wait, n can be up to 10^18, which is fine for binary representation.

But I need a general approach that works for any n and k, not just specific cases.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

So, the approach here is:

- If n == k, set one stall with price 1.

- If n < k, impossible, output "NO".

- Otherwise, set two stalls: one with price n - k + 1 and one with price 1.

- Then, calculate how many jewels Alice buys from each stall.

- If the total jewels bought is less than k, output "NO"; else, output "YES" with the two stall prices.

Wait, but in the first test case, they used 10 stalls, not just 2.

But according to this program, it's using only 2 stalls.

In the first test case, n=7, k=3.

According to this program:

costs = [7 - 3 + 1 = 5, 1]

So, stalls with prices 5 and 1.

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (price 5): 7 // 5 = 1 jewel, remaining 7 - 5 = 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (price 1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 2 - 2*1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

So, it works for this case.

In the third test case, n=255, k=8.

According to this program:

costs = [255 - 8 + 1 = 248, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (248): 255 // 248 = 1 jewel, remaining 255 - 248 = 7 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 7 // 1 = 7 jewels, remaining 7 - 7*1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

So, it works for this case as well.

Now, let's consider the second test case:

n=6, k=4.

According to this program:

costs = [6 - 4 + 1 = 3, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (3): 6 // 3 = 2 jewels, remaining 6 - 6 = 0.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=4.

So, it outputs "NO", which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

But is this approach always correct?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=10, k=3.

According to the program:

costs = [10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (8): 10 // 8 = 1 jewel, remaining 10 - 8 = 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 2 - 2*1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Another example:

n=5, k=2.

costs = [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (4): 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, remaining 5 - 4 = 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 - 1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Seems good.

Another example:

n=10, k=4.

costs = [10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (7): 10 // 7 = 1 jewel, remaining 10 - 7 = 3 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, remaining 3 - 3*1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k=4.

Wait, but what if n=10, k=5?

costs = [10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (6): 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, remaining 10 - 6 = 4 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, remaining 4 - 4*1 = 0.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Another example:

n=10, k=6.

costs = [10 - 6 + 1 = 5, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (5): 10 // 5 = 2 jewels, remaining 10 - 10 = 0.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=6.

So, it outputs "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to buy 6 jewels with 10 coins.

Wait, but maybe with more stalls it's possible?

Let me see.

If I set up three stalls: 4, 3, 1.

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (4): 10 // 4 = 2 jewels, remaining 10 - 8 = 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (3): 2 // 3 = 0 jewels, remaining 2.

- From stall 3 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, which is less than 6.

Another setup: 5, 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (5): 10 // 5 = 2 jewels, remaining 0.

- From stall 2 (2): 0 // 2 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2, still less than 6.

Another setup: 3, 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (3): 10 // 3 = 3 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (2): 1 // 2 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0.

- Total jewels: 3 + 0 + 1 = 4, still less than 6.

Another setup: 4, 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (4): 10 // 4 = 2 jewels, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (2): 2 // 2 = 1 jewel, remaining 0.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3, still less than 6.

Another setup: 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (2): 10 // 2 = 5 jewels, remaining 0.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 5 + 0 = 5, still less than 6.

Another setup: 1.

- From stall 1 (1): 10 // 1 = 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

But in this case, since Alice buys 10 jewels, which is more than k=6, but the program would output "NO" because with only two stalls, it can't achieve exactly k=6.

But in reality, it's impossible with any number of stalls because the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy is determined by the stall with the lowest price.

If the lowest price is 1, she can buy up to n jewels, which is 10 in this case.

But to buy exactly k=6, she needs to buy 6 jewels and have some coins left that aren't enough to buy the cheapest jewel.

But if the cheapest jewel is 1 coin, she can always buy up to n jewels, which is 10, and can't stop at 6 unless there's a setup where she buys exactly 6.

But in the program, it only sets up two stalls: [n - k + 1, 1] = [10 - 6 + 1 = 5, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (5): 10 // 5 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 < 6, so "NO".

But maybe with more stalls, it's possible.

Let's try setting up more stalls.

Suppose stalls: 5, 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (5): 10 // 5 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (2): 0 // 2 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 < 6.

Another setup: 4, 3, 1.

- From stall 1 (4): 10 // 4 = 2 jewels, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (3): 2 // 3 = 0 jewels, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 3 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 < 6.

Another setup: 3, 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (3): 10 // 3 = 3 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (2): 1 // 2 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 3 + 0 + 1 = 4 < 6.

Another setup: 2, 1.

- From stall 1 (2): 10 // 2 = 5 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 5 + 0 = 5 < 6.

Another setup: 1.

- From stall 1 (1): 10 // 1 = 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

But Alice can't stop buying jewels until she has less than the cheapest jewel's price.

So, if the cheapest jewel is 1, she'll buy as many as possible until she has less than 1 coin, which is 0.

Hence, with stalls having price 1, she'll buy as many as possible, which is n jewels.

So, in this case, n=10, k=6, it's impossible because she'll either buy 10 jewels or less than 6, depending on the setup.

Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

Another example:

n=10, k=5.

According to the program:

costs = [10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (6): 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, remaining 4 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

So, it works.

Another example:

n=10, k=1.

According to the program:

costs = [10 - 1 + 1 = 10, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (10): 10 // 10 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another example:

n=1, k=1.

costs = [1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another example:

n=5, k=1.

costs = [5 - 1 + 1 = 5, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (5): 5 // 5 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another example:

n=5, k=2.

costs = [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (4): 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another example:

n=5, k=3.

costs = [5 - 3 + 1 = 3, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (3): 5 // 3 = 1 jewel, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Good.

Another example:

n=5, k=4.

costs = [5 - 4 + 1 = 2, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (2): 5 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 2 + 1 = 3 < 4.

So, it outputs "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to buy exactly 4 jewels with n=5.

Wait, but maybe with more stalls?

Let's try:

Stalls: 2, 1, 1.

But prices must be unique? Wait, no, prices can be the same.

But in this setup:

Stalls: 2, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (2): 5 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 < 4.

Another setup: 2, 1, 2.

- From stall 1 (2): 5 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 3 (2): 0 // 2 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 < 4.

Another setup: 3, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (3): 5 // 3 = 1 jewel, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 < 4.

Another setup: 4, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (4): 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 < 4.

Seems impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with n=5 coins.

Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

So, the approach seems correct.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, but the program only uses 2 stalls.

Is it always possible to achieve the desired k with just 2 stalls?

Wait, in the first test case, they used 10 stalls, but according to the program, it's using only 2 stalls.

But in that case, with 2 stalls, it's achieving the desired k.

Hence, it's sufficient to use only 2 stalls in some cases.

But is it always sufficient?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=100, k=10.

According to the program:

costs = [100 - 10 + 1 = 91, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (91): 100 // 91 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 91 = 9 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 9 // 1 = 9 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 9 = 10, which matches k=10.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=50.

costs = [100 - 50 + 1 = 51, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (51): 100 // 51 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 51 = 49 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 49 // 1 = 49 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 49 = 50, which matches k=50.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=100.

According to the program:

if n == k:

print 'YES'

print 1

print 1

So, it outputs "YES", 1 stall with price 1.

Alice buys 100 // 1 = 100 jewels, which matches k=100.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=1.

costs = [100 - 1 + 1 = 100, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (100): 100 // 100 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=2.

costs = [100 - 2 + 1 = 99, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (99): 100 // 99 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=3.

costs = [100 - 3 + 1 = 98, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (98): 100 // 98 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 98 = 2 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=4.

costs = [100 - 4 + 1 = 97, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (97): 100 // 97 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 97 = 3 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k=4.

Good.

Seems consistent.

Another example:

n=100, k=101.

Since n < k, output "NO", which is correct.

Another example:

n=100, k=5.

costs = [100 - 5 + 1 = 96, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (96): 100 // 96 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 96 = 4 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=6.

costs = [100 - 6 + 1 = 95, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (95): 100 // 95 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 95 = 5 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 5 // 1 = 5 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 5 = 6, which matches k=6.

Good.

Another example:

n=100, k=7.

costs = [100 - 7 + 1 = 94, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (94): 100 // 94 = 1 jewel, remaining 100 - 94 = 6 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 6 // 1 = 6 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 6 = 7, which matches k=7.

Good.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think about n=1, k=1.

costs = [1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=2, k=1.

costs = [2 - 1 + 1 = 2, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (2): 2 // 2 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another case: n=2, k=2.

costs = [2 - 2 + 1 = 1, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (1): 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another case: n=3, k=2.

costs = [3 - 2 + 1 = 2, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (2): 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another case: n=4, k=2.

costs = [4 - 2 + 1 = 3, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (3): 4 // 3 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another case: n=4, k=3.

costs = [4 - 3 + 1 = 2, 1]

Alice buys:

- From stall 1 (2): 4 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 < 3.

So, it outputs "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to buy exactly 3 jewels with n=4.

Wait, but maybe with more stalls?

Let's try:

Stalls: 2, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (2): 4 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 < 3.

Another setup: 3, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (3): 4 // 3 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2 (1): 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 < 3.

Another setup: 4, 1, 1.

- From stall 1 (4): 4 // 4 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- From stall 3 (1): 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 < 3.

Seems impossible to buy exactly 3 jewels with n=4.

Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

So, overall, the approach seems correct.

But I need to confirm if using only two stalls is always sufficient.

From the above examples, it seems that with two stalls: [n - k + 1, 1], Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me try to generalize this.

Let p1 = n - k + 1, p2 = 1.

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: floor(n / p1) jewels, remaining n - (floor(n / p1) * p1) coins.

- From stall 2: floor(remaining / p2) jewels.

Total jewels: floor(n / p1) + floor(remaining / p2).

We need this to be equal to k.

In the program's approach, p1 = n - k + 1.

Let's see how many jewels Alice buys from stall 1:

floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Let me denote m = n - k + 1.

So, p1 = m.

floor(n / m) = floor((m + k - 1) / m)

Since m = n - k + 1, then n = m + k - 1.

So, floor((m + k - 1) / m) = floor(m / m) + floor(k - 1 / m) = 1 + floor((k - 1)/m)

Now, remaining coins after stall 1:

n - (floor(n / m) * m) = (m + k - 1) - (1 + floor((k - 1)/m)) * m

= m + k - 1 - m - floor((k - 1)/m) * m

= k - 1 - floor((k - 1)/m) * m

But m = n - k + 1, and n = m + k - 1.

Wait, this seems messy.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: k = 1

Then p1 = n - 1 + 1 = n

Alice buys floor(n / n) = 1 jewel from stall 1, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels: 1, which matches k=1.

Case 2: k = n

p1 = n - n + 1 = 1

Alice buys floor(n / 1) = n jewels from stall 1, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels: n, which matches k=n.

Case 3: k = n - 1

p1 = n - (n - 1) + 1 = 2

Alice buys floor(n / 2) jewels from stall 1, remaining n - 2 * floor(n / 2) coins.

Then, from stall 2 (price 1), she buys floor(remaining / 1) jewels.

Total jewels: floor(n / 2) + (n - 2 * floor(n / 2))

If n is even: floor(n / 2) = n / 2, remaining = 0, total jewels = n / 2 + 0.

But k = n - 1, so n / 2 should be equal to n - 1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe this approach doesn't work for k = n - 1.

Wait, in the earlier example with n=4, k=3:

p1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2, p2 = 1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 4 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 0 coins.

- From stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 < 3.

Hence, it's not possible, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

Another example: n=5, k=4.

p1 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2, p2 = 1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 5 // 2 = 2 jewels, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining 0 coins.

- Total: 2 + 1 = 3 < 4.

Hence, "NO", which is correct.

So, in cases where k > floor(n / p1) + floor(remaining / p2), it outputs "NO", which is correct.

But is there any case where k is achievable with more than 2 stalls, but the program outputs "NO" because with 2 stalls it's not achievable?

Let me think about n=10, k=4.

With 2 stalls: p1=10-4+1=7, p2=1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 10 // 7 = 1 jewel, remaining 3 coins.

- From stall 2: 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, total 4 jewels.

Wait, in earlier thinking, I thought it was impossible, but actually, with p1=7 and p2=1, it works.

Wait, in earlier manual calculation, with p1=7 and p2=1:

10 // 7 = 1 jewel, remaining 3 coins.

3 // 1 = 3 jewels.

Total: 4 jewels, which matches k=4.

But earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, with p1=7 and p2=1, Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, the program would output "YES" with 2 stalls: 7 and 1.

Hence, it's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was "NO", but actually, it's "YES".

I must have miscalculated earlier.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Is there any case where k cannot be achieved with 2 stalls, but can be achieved with more stalls?

Let me think about n=10, k=3.

With 2 stalls: p1=10-3+1=8, p2=1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 10 // 8 = 1 jewel, remaining 2 coins.

- From stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, total 3 jewels.

Hence, "YES".

Another case: n=10, k=2.

p1=10-2+1=9, p2=1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 10 // 9 = 1 jewel, remaining 1 coin.

- From stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, total 2 jewels.

"YES".

Another case: n=10, k=5.

p1=10-5+1=6, p2=1

Alice buys:

- From stall 1: 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, remaining 4 coins.

- From stall 2: 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, total 5 jewels.

"YES".

Hence, it seems that with p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1, Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Hence, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
