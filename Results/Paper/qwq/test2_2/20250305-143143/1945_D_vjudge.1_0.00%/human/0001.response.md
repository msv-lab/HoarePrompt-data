Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes late and stands at the end. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, but he doesn't want to spend too much. His goal is to be among the first m people in the queue.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to swap places with someone ahead of him, say person j, he has to pay a_j coins to that person, and to everyone between j and his current position, he has to pay their b_k coins.

I need to find the minimum number of coins Kirill has to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that is ahead of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j, paying a_j coins to that person, and for each k such that j < k < i, paying b_k coins to the person at position k.

So, if Kirill is at position i, and he chooses to swap with position j (j < i), he pays a_j to the person at position j, and for each k between j and i, he pays b_k to the person at position k.

I need to think about how to model this problem. It seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I need to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me consider the positions in the queue as indices from 1 to n, with 1 being the front of the queue.

Kirill starts at position n. He wants to reach a position between 1 and m, inclusive.

He can perform swaps that involve moving from his current position i to a position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

I should think about the queue in reverse order, starting from the end where Kirill is, and moving towards the front.

Let me try to model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from position i to positions j < i, with edge costs equal to a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum cost path from position n to any position from 1 to m.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph with edges from each i to all j < i is not feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Maybe I can use dynamic programming, where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to n, and then take the minimum of dp[1] to dp[m].

But I need to define the transitions properly.

Let me think about how to compute dp[i].

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j where j > i, and perform the swap operation, paying a_i (since he's swapping with person i) and sum of b_k from k = i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no. In the problem, it's specified that he chooses j < i, swaps with j, pays a_j and sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

So, in terms of dp, to reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j where j > i, and perform the swap with position j, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

Wait, no. The problem says he chooses j < i, exchanges places with j, paying a_j and for each k such that j < k < i, paying b_k.

So, in terms of moving from position i to j, where j < i.

But in DP, I need to think about reaching position i from positions ahead of it.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0, since he's already there.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j > i, and the cost to go from j to i is a_i plus sum of b_k from k = i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no. The problem says he chooses j < i, exchanges with j, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to rephrase it.

Kirill is at position i, and he can choose any j < i, swap with j, paying a_j and for each k between j and i, pay b_k.

Wait, more precisely, for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k.

So, to perform this operation, he pays a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

After this operation, he is now at position j.

Wait, but in terms of DP, I need to think about reaching position i from positions ahead of it.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of moving forward, starting from position n.

But I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the positions in reverse order, from n to 1.

At each step, I can choose to either stay at the current position or perform a swap with some j < i.

If I choose to stay at position i, then the cost to reach position i is the same as the cost to reach position i+1, plus the cost to move from i+1 to i, which would involve swapping with position i, paying a_i and sum of b_k from k=i+1 to i, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of cumulative sums.

Let me define prefix sums for b_k.

Let's compute the prefix sums of b_k, say prefix_b[i] = sum_{k=1 to i} b_k.

Then, sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from position i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Hmm.

Now, I need to find a way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Maybe I can iterate from position n to position 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

But with n up to 200,000, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform any number of operations, choosing any j < i each time, paying the corresponding costs.

This seems like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

But with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute the minimum cost without explicitly considering all possible swaps.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps to move forward in the queue, and he wants to minimize the total cost.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Maybe I can use the concept of minimum cost to reach each position and update it based on possible swaps.

But I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps to jump from his current position to any position ahead, paying the corresponding costs.

I need to find an efficient way to compute the minimum cost to reach each position.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k is the difference of prefix sums, as I defined earlier.

So, for each position i, the cost to reach it is the minimum over all j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=200,000.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the minimum over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i-1].

Then, dp[i] = min_over_j (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i-1].

So, define a variable m = min_over_j (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j), then dp[i] = m + prefix_b[i-1].

This way, I can compute m once and then for each i, dp[i] is m + prefix_b[i-1].

But I need to update m as I iterate through j from 1 to i-1.

So, if I iterate i from 1 to n, keeping track of m = min(m, dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) for j < i.

Wait, but dp[j] depends on earlier positions, so I need to make sure that dp[j] is already computed when I compute dp[i].

This seems like a viable approach.

Let me try to formalize it.

Compute prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b_i for i from 1 to n

Then, initialize m = 0

Set dp[1] = m + prefix_b[0] = 0 + 0 = 0

Then, for i from 2 to n:

m = min(m, dp[i-1] - prefix_b[i-1] + a_{i-1})

dp[i] = m + prefix_b[i-1]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me iterate from i = n down to 1.

Compute prefix_b[n] = 0

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i+1] + b_i for i from n-1 down to 1

Then, dp[n] = 0

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]) for all j from i+1 to n

This is still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Perhaps I can use a sliding window minimum, taking advantage of the fact that prefix_b[i] is monotonic in some way.

Wait, prefix_b[i] is the sum from i to n of b_k, so as i increases, prefix_b[i] decreases.

Wait, no, prefix_b[i] = sum_{k=i to n} b_k, so as i increases, prefix_b[i] decreases or stays the same, depending on b_i.

Wait, actually, b_k can be any positive integer, so prefix_b[i] decreases by b_i when i increases.

So, prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] - b_{i-1}

Wait, no, if prefix_b[i] = sum from i to n of b_k, then prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i+1] + b_i

So, prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i+1] + b_i

Yes, that's correct.

Now, in the DP approach, dp[i] = min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j])

Which is min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[i]

So, define m[i] = min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)

Then, dp[i] = m[i] + prefix_b[i]

Now, m[i] can be computed recursively:

m[i] = min(m[i+1], dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_{i+1})

Because m[i] is the minimum of m[i+1] and the new term for j=i+1.

Wait, no, m[i] is the minimum over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)

So, m[i] = min(m[i+1], dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_{i+1})

Yes, that makes sense.

So, I can compute m[i] recursively from i=n-1 down to 1.

Set m[n] = infinity, since there is no j > n.

Wait, no, m[n] = 0, because there are no j > n.

Wait, actually, m[n] is not defined, since there are no j > n.

So, set m[n] = infinity, but dp[n] = 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Let me set dp[n] = 0, and m[n] = 0.

Then, for i from n-1 down to 1:

m[i] = min(m[i+1], dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_{i+1})

dp[i] = m[i] + prefix_b[i]

Wait, let me test this with a small example.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix_b from i to n:

prefix_b[4] = 0

prefix_b[3] = b[3] + prefix_b[4] = 5 + 0 = 5

prefix_b[2] = b[2] + prefix_b[3] = 8 + 5 = 13

prefix_b[1] = b[1] + prefix_b[2] = 3 + 13 = 16

prefix_b[0] = b[0] + prefix_b[1] = 4 + 16 = 20

Wait, but in the code, the list is reversed, so let's see.

In the code, lista_A and lista_B are reversed.

So, lista_A = [9,6,3,7]

lista_B = [5,8,3,4]

Then, soma_b = 0

pref = 0

For i in range(n - k):

Which is range(4 - 2) = range(2), so i=0 and i=1

If lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:

pref += soma_b

pref += lista_A[i]

soma_b = 0

Else:

soma_b += lista_B[i]

So, for i=0:

lista_A[0] = 9, lista_B[0] =5

9 >=5, so soma_b += lista_B[0] = 5

For i=1:

lista_A[1] =6, lista_B[1]=8

6 <8, so pref += soma_b =5, pref += lista_A[1]=6, soma_b=0

Now, resultado = infinity

For i in range(n - k, n):

i from 2 to 4:

i=2: pref + soma_b + lista_A[2] =5 +6 +3=14

resultado = min(inf,14)=14

i=3: pref + soma_b + lista_A[3]=5 +6 +7=18 >14

i=4: same

So, resultado=14

Which matches the first sample output.

Okay, so the code seems to work for this case.

Let me see how it works in general.

In the code, lista_A and lista_B are reversed, so lista_A[0] corresponds to the last person in the original queue, which is Kirill's starting position.

Then, soma_b accumulates the sum of b_k from the last position to the current position.

pref accumulates the costs when lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to understand the logic in the code.

The code reverses lista_A and lista_B, so that lista_A[0] is the last person in the queue (Kirill's starting position), lista_A[1] is the person before Kirill, and so on.

Then, it iterates from i=0 to n-k-1, which is n - k positions.

In each step, if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i], it adds soma_b and lista_A[i] to pref, and resets soma_b to 0.

Else, it adds lista_B[i] to soma_b.

Then, it computes the resultado as the minimum of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i from n - k to n -1.

I need to see why this works.

Wait, perhaps the reversal is to start from Kirill's position and move towards the front of the queue.

Let me consider that.

After reversing, position 0 is Kirill's starting position.

Then, position 1 is the person in front of him, and so on, up to position n-1, which is the first person in the queue.

So, the goal is to reach position m, which after reversal is position n - m.

Wait, no.

Wait, original positions:

1 to n, with 1 being the front.

After reversal, position 0 is original position n, which is Kirill's starting position.

Position 1 is original position n-1, and position n-1 is original position 1.

So, in the reversed list, positions from n - m to n -1 are the first m positions in the original queue.

Wait, no.

Original positions:

1 (front) to n (back, Kirill's position).

After reversal, position 0 is n, position 1 is n-1, ..., position n-1 is 1.

So, the first m positions in the original queue correspond to positions n - m to n -1 in the reversed list.

Wait, let's see:

Original positions: 1,2,3,...,n

After reversal: position 0 -> n, position 1 -> n-1, ..., position n-1 ->1

So, the first m positions in the original queue (1 to m) correspond to positions n -m to n-1 in the reversed list.

Yes.

So, in the code, n - k is the starting index for the final loop that computes the resultado.

Wait, in the code, it's range(n - k), which is from 0 to n -k -1, and then the final loop is from n -k to n -1.

So, in the first loop, it processes from i=0 to i=n -k -1.

For each i in this range:

if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:

pref += soma_b

pref += lista_A[i]

soma_b =0

else:

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Then, in the second loop, from i=n -k to n -1:

resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])

soma_b += lista_B[i]

So, in the first loop, it's processing the positions from Kirill's starting position up to position n -k.

And in the second loop, it's processing positions from n -k to n -1, which correspond to the first m positions in the original queue.

I need to see why this logic works.

I think the idea is to keep track of the minimum cost to reach the current position by either accumulating the b_k costs or making a jump by paying a_j.

In the first loop, for i from 0 to n -k -1, it's building up the pref and soma_b values.

When lista_A[i] < lista_B[i], it means that paying a_j is cheaper than accumulating the b_k costs, so it's better to make a jump at that position, adding soma_b and lista_A[i] to pref, and resetting soma_b.

Otherwise, it's better to accumulate the b_k costs.

Then, in the second loop, for i from n -k to n -1, it's computing the final cost to reach each of these positions, which are the positions Kirill wants to reach, and taking the minimum among them.

This seems to be an optimized way to compute the DP without explicitly iterating over all possible j for each i.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the DP approach I was considering earlier, where dp[i] = min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]), and then simplifying it using m[i] = min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j), and dp[i] = m[i] + prefix_b[i], with m[i] = min(m[i+1], dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_{i+1}).

Comparing this with the code's logic, it seems that the code is implementing a similar idea, but in a more optimized way, avoiding explicit computation of m[i] for each i.

By reversing the lists, it starts from Kirill's position and moves towards the front, keeping track of the accumulated costs in soma_b and pref.

When lista_A[i] < lista_B[i], it's analogous to choosing to jump to position j and paying a_j plus the accumulated b_k costs up to that point.

Otherwise, it continues accumulating the b_k costs.

Then, for the final positions that Kirill wants to reach, it computes the total cost as pref + soma_b + lista_A[i], and takes the minimum among them.

This seems to correctly capture the minimum cost to reach any of the first m positions.

Given that the code produces the correct output for the sample input and seems to follow a logical approach based on DP optimization, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
