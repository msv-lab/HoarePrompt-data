Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, making it n+1 people in line. But Kirill doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people ahead of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values associated with them: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with someone at position j (where j < i), he has to pay a_j to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k to each of them.

My task is to find out the minimum amount of money Kirill needs to spend to get into one of the first m positions.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that is ahead of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first m positions.

Let me think about this step by step.

Let's consider Kirill's initial position is n (since he's at the end of the queue). He wants to reach position m or better, meaning positions 1 through m.

He can perform swaps with anyone ahead of him, and each swap has a cost based on a_j and the sum of b_k for those in between.

I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from position i to position j (j < i) with a cost of a_j plus the sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum cost path from position n to any of the positions 1 through m.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph explicitly is not feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m and then take the minimum among them.

The recurrence would be:

dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.

If Kirill is at position j and swaps with position i (j > i), then the cost is a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

After the swap, Kirill is now at position i, and the person who was at position i is now at position j.

But in the problem, it says Kirill can perform this action any number of times. So, it's like he can keep swapping with people ahead of him, moving forward in the queue.

I need to model the possible sequences of swaps that get him from position n to some position between 1 and m, minimizing the total cost.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that Kirill can skip over multiple people in one swap, not just swap with immediate neighbors.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as choosing a sequence of positions to swap to, each position being ahead of the current one, and summing up the costs accordingly.

But again, with large n, I need an efficient algorithm, preferably linear or logarithmic per test case.

Looking at the example, maybe I can get some insight.

Take the first test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

After reversing, as per the code, it becomes:

9 6 3 7

5 8 3 4

So, positions 1 to 4 have a_i: 9,6,3,7 and b_i:5,8,3,4

Kirill starts at position 5 (n=4), and wants to be in the first 2 positions.

He can perform swaps with positions 1 through 4, paying a_j and sum of b_k between j and 5.

Wait, but in the code, they're reversing the lists. I need to understand why.

By reversing, position 1 becomes the last one, and position n becomes the first one. Maybe it's easier to process from Kirill's starting position.

Let me try to think in terms of the reversed positions.

After reversing, position 1 is what was originally position 4, and so on.

So, in the reversed list, position 1 is the one closest to Kirill's starting position.

In the reversed list, Kirill starts at position 0 (since he's at the end), and he wants to reach position n - m.

In the first test case, n=4, m=2, so n - m = 2.

So, he wants to reach position 2 in the reversed list.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the code provided.

The function func_1 reads n and m, then reads list a and list b, reverses them, and then proceeds with some calculations.

It computes a sum_b and a prefix sum, and then computes the result as the minimum of pref + sum_b + a[i] for i from n - k to n - 1.

Wait, I need to understand what k is here.

In the code, k is read as k = m, but in the problem, m is the maximum allowable final position.

Wait, in the code, it's (n, k) = map(int, input().split()), and k is m.

So, k is m.

Then, it reverses a and b.

I need to understand why reversing is done.

Maybe reversing makes it easier to process from Kirill's starting position.

Let's consider that after reversing, position 0 is Kirill's starting position, and positions 1 to n are the people in front of him.

Then, to reach position m, he needs to be within the first m positions, meaning his final position should be less than or equal to m - 1.

Wait, in the code, it's ranging from n - k to n - 1, which corresponds to the last k positions in the reversed list.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after reversing, position 0 is Kirill, position 1 is the person just in front of him, position 2 is the next one, and so on.

Then, to be among the first m positions, his final position should be less than or equal to m - 1.

But in the code, it's considering positions from n - k to n - 1, which are the last k positions in the original list, but after reversing, these are the first k positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to map the positions correctly.

Suppose original positions are 1 to n, with 1 being the front.

After reversing, position 1 becomes position n, position 2 becomes position n-1, and so on, position n becomes position 1.

Kirill is at position n+1, which after reversing would be position 0.

So, in the reversed list, position 0 is Kirill, position 1 is original position n, position 2 is original position n-1, and so on.

He wants to reach position m or better, meaning position <= m.

In the reversed list, position m corresponds to original position n - m + 1.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Maybe I should try to understand the logic in the code.

The code reverses a and b, then initializes sum_b = 0 and pref = 0.

Then, it loops from i in 0 to n - k - 1:

If a[i] < b[i], it adds pref + a[i], sets sum_b = 0

Else, adds b[i] to sum_b

Then, it computes the result as the minimum of pref + sum_b + a[i] for i from n - k to n - 1

This seems like some kind of dynamic programming, where pref accumulates some cost, and sum_b accumulates the b_k's.

But I'm not fully grasping it.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill starts at position n.

He can swap with any position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach position <= m.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where each position is a node, and there are directed edges from i to j for j < i, with edge cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But with n up to 2e5, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can compute for each possible target position j (1 to m), the cost to go directly from n to j, and then take the minimum among these costs.

But that might not be optimal, because swapping to an intermediate position k first might lead to a lower total cost.

Wait, maybe I can find a way to compute the minimal cost for each position, considering the possible previous positions.

This sounds like dynamic programming.

Let me try to define dp[j]: the minimum cost to reach position j from position n.

Then, dp[j] = min over i > j (dp[i] + a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1)

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need to optimize this.

Maybe I can find a way to compute dp[j] in O(n) time.

Let me consider that sum b_k from j+1 to i-1 can be expressed as sum from 1 to i-1 minus sum from 1 to j.

So, if I precompute the prefix sums of b, say prefix_b[k] = sum of b_1 to b_k.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

But in the problem, b_k is associated with each position k, but in the swap from i to j, it's sum of b_k for k between j and i.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, yes, it's sum from k = j+1 to i-1.

So, using prefix sums, it's feasible.

But in the code, they reverse a and b, which confuses me.

Wait, maybe I should consider the positions in reverse order.

Let me try to model this differently.

Suppose I consider positions from n down to 1.

I can think of Kirill moving from position n to position 1, performing swaps.

At each step, he can choose to stop at a position >= m, but since he wants to be <= m, perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider positions from 1 to n, and think about moving forward.

Wait, maybe I should consider that Kirill can perform swaps to move forward in the queue, from position i to position j where j < i.

Each such swap costs a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach position <= m, starting from position n.

This seems like a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where edges are from i to j for j < i, with edge weights a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1.

In such a DAG, the shortest path can be found in O(V + E) time with BFS-like approach, since edge weights are non-negative.

But with n up to 2e5, and edges being all j < i, it's still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can find a way to express dp[j] in terms of dp[j+1] and so on, using some kind of sliding window or monotonic queue.

Let me consider that.

First, compute sum_b[j][i] = sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But precomputing sum_b for all pairs j, i is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to express dp[j] in terms of dp[j+1] and a_j plus sum_b from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me consider dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

I need to minimize dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

Let me define sum_b[j][i] = sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, perhaps I can define a cumulative sum of b.

Let prefix_b[i] = sum of b_1 to b_i.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rearranged as:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Now, observe that a_j - prefix_b[j] is a term that depends only on j, and min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) is a term that depends on i.

So, if I can precompute the min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]), then I can compute dp[j].

But dp[i] depends on dp[j] for j > i, which creates a circular dependency.

Wait, perhaps I can compute dp[j] in increasing order of j, i.e., from j = n down to j = 1.

Wait, no, in the expression above, dp[j] depends on dp[i] for i > j, so I need to compute dp[i] before dp[j], meaning I should compute dp[j] in decreasing order of j.

So, start from j = n, and go down to j = 1.

Initialize dp[j] for j = n, and then compute dp[j] for j = n-1 down to j = 1.

But in this problem, Kirill wants to be in position <= m, meaning j <= m.

So, I need to compute dp[j] for j from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

For j > m, I don't need to compute dp[j], because Kirill doesn't want to be beyond position m.

Wait, but in the code, it's considering positions from n - k to n - 1, where k = m.

Wait, n - k corresponds to positions from m to n in the original list.

But I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to swap directly to position j, where j <= m.

The cost would be a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

But he can also choose to swap to an intermediate position k, where m <= k <= n, and then from k swap to j.

But since he wants to minimize the cost, perhaps swapping directly is better, but I need to verify that.

Wait, maybe not, because sum of b_k from j+1 to k-1 plus sum of b_k from k+1 to n might be less than sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

So, there might be overlapping costs, and choosing an intermediate k could lead to lower total cost.

Hence, I need to consider all possible sequences of swaps.

This seems complicated.

Let me look back at the code.

In the code, after reversing a and b, it initializes sum_b = 0 and pref = 0.

Then, for i in range(n - k):

if a[i] < b[i]:

pref += sum_b

pref += a[i]

sum_b = 0

else:

sum_b += b[i]

Then, resultado is the minimum of pref + sum_b + a[i] for i in range(n - k, n)

This seems like it's trying to group positions where a[i] >= b[i], accumulating sum_b, and when a[i] < b[i], it adds sum_b and a[i] to pref, and resets sum_b.

I need to understand what this corresponds to.

Maybe it's considering that if a[i] < b[i], it's better to swap directly to that position, paying a_i and accumulating the sum_b up to that point.

Otherwise, it's better to keep accumulating sum_b.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2

a = [7,3,6,9] after reversing: [9,6,3,7]

b = [4,3,8,5] after reversing: [5,8,3,4]

So, a = [9,6,3,7]

b = [5,8,3,4]

n - k = n - m = 4 - 2 = 2

So, loop from i = 0 to 1:

i=0: a[0]=9 >= b[0]=5, so sum_b += b[0]=5, sum_b=5

i=1: a[1]=6 >= b[1]=8, so sum_b += b[1]=8, sum_b=13

Then, resultado is min of pref + sum_b + a[i] for i=2 to 3:

i=2: pref=0 + sum_b=13 + a[2]=3 → 16

i=3: pref=0 + sum_b=13 + a[3]=7 → 20

So, min is 16, but in the sample output it's 14.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the indices.

Wait, in the code, lista_A and lista_B are reversed, and n - k is the starting point for the loop.

Wait, in the code, it's for i in range(n - k):

if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:

pref += soma_b

pref += lista_A[i]

soma_b = 0

else:

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Then, resultado is min of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i in range(n - k, n)

So, in this case, n - k = 2, so loop from i=0 to 1:

i=0: a[0]=9 >= b[0]=5 → soma_b += 5 → soma_b=5

i=1: a[1]=6 < b[1]=8 → pref += soma_b=5 → pref=5

pref += a[1]=6 → pref=11

soma_b = 0

Then, for i=2 to 3:

i=2: pref=11 + soma_b=0 + a[2]=3 → 14

i=3: pref=11 + soma_b=0 + a[3]=7 → 18

So, min is 14, which matches the sample output.

Okay, now I see. The code seems to be doing something like accumulating sums based on comparisons between a[i] and b[i], and then computing the final result as the minimum of pref + soma_b + a[i] for the last k positions.

But I still need to understand why this works.

Let me try to think in terms of the problem.

Kirill can swap with anyone ahead of him, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

He wants to minimize the total cost to reach position <= m.

In the code, after reversing, position 0 is the person who was originally at position n, and so on.

Kirill starts at position n, which is now position 0 after reversing.

He wants to reach position m or better, which after reversing corresponds to positions n - m to n - 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after reversing, the positions are in the opposite order.

Let me try to map the positions:

Original positions: 1 to n, with 1 being the front.

After reversing, position 1 becomes position n, position 2 becomes n-1, etc., position n becomes position 1.

Kirill is at position n+1, which after reversing would be position 0.

So, in the reversed list, position 0 is Kirill, position 1 is original position n, position 2 is original position n-1, and so on.

He wants to reach position m or better, meaning positions 1 to m in the original list, which after reversing correspond to positions n - m + 1 to n in the reversed list.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of indices.

Let me try to reindex the positions after reversing.

Suppose original positions are 1 to n.

After reversing, position 0 is Kirill, position 1 is original position n, position 2 is original position n-1, ..., position n is original position 1.

He wants to reach positions 1 to m in the original list, which after reversing are positions n - m + 1 to n in the reversed list.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in the reversed list, position i corresponds to original position n - i + 1.

So, in the reversed list, positions from n - m + 1 to n in the original list correspond to positions m to n in the reversed list.

Wait, no.

Original positions:

1,2,3,...,n

After reversing:

position 0: Kirill

position 1: original position n

position 2: original position n-1

...

position n: original position 1

He wants to be in positions 1 to m in the original list, which correspond to positions n - m + 1 to n in the reversed list.

Wait, positions in the reversed list:

- position 0: Kirill

- position 1: original position n

- position 2: original position n-1

...

- position n: original position 1

He wants to reach positions 1 to m in the original list, which are positions n - m + 1 to n in the reversed list.

So, in the reversed list, his target positions are from n - m + 1 to n.

But in the code, it's considering positions from n - k to n - 1, where k = m.

Since in Python, lists are 0-indexed, n - k to n - 1 corresponds to positions n - m to n - 1 in the reversed list.

Wait, perhaps there's a mismatch in indexing.

I need to clarify the indexing.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed, so positions are from 0 to n-1.

But in the problem, positions are from 1 to n.

In the code, after reversing, position 0 corresponds to Kirill.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that after reversing, the list starts from Kirill at position 0, then position 1 is original position n, position 2 is original position n-1, etc.

He wants to reach positions 1 to m in the original list, which correspond to positions n - m + 1 to n in the reversed list.

In 0-indexing, positions n - m to n - 1.

So, in the code, n - k to n - 1, with k = m.

Yes, that matches.

So, in the code, it's considering positions from n - k to n - 1 in the reversed list as the target positions.

Now, back to the algorithm.

The code seems to be accumulating sums in soma_b when a[i] >= b[i], and when a[i] < b[i], it adds soma_b and a[i] to pref and resets soma_b.

Then, for the target positions, it computes pref + soma_b + a[i] and takes the minimum.

I need to understand why this works.

Perhaps it's modeling the idea that when a[i] >= b[i], it's better to accumulate the b[i]'s, meaning to keep moving forward without swapping, while when a[i] < b[i], it's better to swap to that position, paying a[i] and the accumulated sum_b up to that point.

Then, pref accumulates the costs of such swaps, and for the target positions, it adds the current a[i] and the remaining sum_b.

This seems plausible, but I need to verify it with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9] (original), after reversing: [9,6,3,7]

b = [4,3,8,5] (original), after reversing: [5,8,3,4]

So, lista_A = [9,6,3,7], lista_B = [5,8,3,4]

n - k = 4 - 2 = 2

Loop from i=0 to 1:

i=0: a[0]=9 >= b[0]=5 → soma_b += 5 → soma_b=5

i=1: a[1]=6 < b[1]=8 → pref += soma_b=5 → pref=5

pref += a[1]=6 → pref=11

soma_b = 0

Then, for i=2 to 3:

i=2: pref=11 + soma_b=0 + a[2]=3 → 14

i=3: pref=11 + soma_b=0 + a[3]=7 → 18

So, min is 14, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=6, m=2

a = [6,9,7,1,8,3] → reversed: [3,8,1,7,9,6]

b = [5,8,8,1,4,1] → reversed: [1,4,1,8,8,5]

n - k = 6 - 2 = 4

Loop from i=0 to 3:

i=0: a[0]=3 >= b[0]=1 → soma_b +=1 → soma_b=1

i=1: a[1]=8 >= b[1]=4 → soma_b +=4 → soma_b=5

i=2: a[2]=1 < b[2]=1 → pref += soma_b=5 → pref=5

pref += a[2]=1 → pref=6

soma_b = 0

i=3: a[3]=7 >= b[3]=8 → soma_b +=8 → soma_b=8

Then, for i=4 to 5:

i=4: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[4]=9 → 23

i=5: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[5]=6 → 20

Min is 20, but the sample output is 22.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sample output for the second test case, it's 22.

So, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, let's check again.

a reversed: [3,8,1,7,9,6]

b reversed: [1,4,1,8,8,5]

n - k = 6 - 2 = 4

Loop from i=0 to 3:

i=0: a[0]=3 >= b[0]=1 → soma_b +=1 → soma_b=1

i=1: a[1]=8 >= b[1]=4 → soma_b +=4 → soma_b=5

i=2: a[2]=1 < b[2]=1 → pref += soma_b=5 → pref=5

pref += a[2]=1 → pref=6

soma_b = 0

i=3: a[3]=7 >= b[3]=8 → soma_b +=8 → soma_b=8

Then, for i=4 to 5:

i=4: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[4]=9 → 23

i=5: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[5]=6 → 20

So, min is 20, but sample output is 22.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in this approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after adding pref += soma_b and pref += a[i], and resetting soma_b, I need to continue accumulating soma_b for the remaining i.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how soma_b is handled after adding to pref.

Let me look back at the code.

In the code, for i in range(n - k):

if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:

pref += soma_b

pref += lista_A[i]

soma_b = 0

else:

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Then, for i in range(n - k, n):

resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])

In my previous calculation, I had:

i=0: soma_b=1

i=1: soma_b=5

i=2: pref=6, soma_b=0

i=3: soma_b=8

Then, for i=4: pref=6, soma_b=8, a[4]=9 → 6+8+9=23

i=5: pref=6, soma_b=8, a[5]=6 → 6+8+6=20

But sample output is 22.

Wait, perhaps I need to update soma_b after adding to pref.

Wait, maybe I need to accumulate soma_b only when a[i] >= b[i], and when a[i] < b[i], add soma_b and a[i] to pref, and reset soma_b.

But in the second test case, it seems like the code is producing 20, but the sample output is 22.

Maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how pref and soma_b are handled.

Let me try to simulate the code step by step for the second test case.

Initialize:

lista_A = [3,8,1,7,9,6]

lista_B = [1,4,1,8,8,5]

n - k = 6 - 2 = 4

Loop from i=0 to 3:

i=0: a[0]=3 >= b[0]=1 → soma_b +=1 → soma_b=1

i=1: a[1]=8 >= b[1]=4 → soma_b +=4 → soma_b=5

i=2: a[2]=1 < b[2]=1 → pref += soma_b=5 → pref=5

pref += a[2]=1 → pref=6

soma_b = 0

i=3: a[3]=7 >= b[3]=8 → soma_b +=8 → soma_b=8

Then, for i=4 to 5:

i=4: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[4]=9 → 23

i=5: pref=6 + soma_b=8 + a[5]=6 → 20

So, min is 20, but sample output is 22.

This suggests that the code might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after adding pref += soma_b and pref += a[i], I need to continue accumulating soma_b for the remaining i.

But in the code, soma_b is reset to 0 when a[i] < b[i].

Wait, perhaps that's the issue.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the correct approach is to keep track of the minimal pref + soma_b + a[i] for each i in the target range.

But perhaps the way pref and soma_b are updated is not accurate.

Let me consider another approach.

Let's consider that Kirill can choose to swap directly to any position j <= m, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

But he might find it cheaper to swap to an intermediate position k, then from k to j.

So, I need to consider all possible sequences of swaps.

This seems similar to the shortest path problem again, which is too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, maybe I can find a way to compute the minimal cost by considering that sum of b_k from j+1 to i is the same as sum from 1 to i minus sum from 1 to j.

So, if I precompute prefix sums of b, say prefix_b[i] = sum of b_1 to b_i.

Then, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

But in this problem, it's sum from j+1 to i-1.

So, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

Then, the total cost to reach j from n is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) for some i > j.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to define dp[j] = minimal cost to reach position j from position n.

Then, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] - prefix_b[j] + prefix_b[i-1])

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange it.

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

This way, min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) can be precomputed from right to left.

Let me define mini[i] = min over k >= i (dp[k] + prefix_b[k-1])

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + mini[j+1]

And mini[j] = min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1], mini[j+1])

This seems promising.

I can compute mini from right to left.

But dp[j] depends on mini[j+1], which in turn depends on dp[k] for k > j.

So, I need to compute dp[j] and mini[j] in a single pass.

Let me try to see.

Start from j = n-1 down to 1.

Compute dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + mini[j+1]

Then, mini[j] = min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1], mini[j+1])

Wait, but prefix_b[j-1] is the sum from 1 to j-1.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Reversed a: [9,6,3,7]

Reversed b: [5,8,3,4]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 5

prefix_b[2] = 5 + 8 = 13

prefix_b[3] = 13 + 3 = 16

prefix_b[4] = 16 + 4 = 20

Now, compute dp[j] for j from 4 down to 1.

j=4:

dp[4] = a[4] - prefix_b[4] + mini[5]

Assuming mini[5] = infinity or 0, since there's no position 5.

Let's assume mini[n+1] = 0.

So, dp[4] = 7 - 20 + 0 = -13

Then, mini[4] = min(dp[4] + prefix_b[3], mini[5]) = -13 + 16 + 0 = 3

j=3:

dp[3] = a[3] - prefix_b[3] + mini[4] = 6 - 16 + 3 = -7

mini[3] = min(dp[3] + prefix_b[2], mini[4]) = -7 + 13, 3 → min(6,3) = 3

j=2:

dp[2] = a[2] - prefix_b[2] + mini[3] = 3 - 13 + 3 = -7

mini[2] = min(dp[2] + prefix_b[1], mini[3]) = -7 + 5, 3 → min(-2,3) = -2

j=1:

dp[1] = a[1] - prefix_b[1] + mini[2] = 9 - 5 + (-2) = 2

mini[1] = min(dp[1] + prefix_b[0], mini[2]) = 2 + 0, -2 → min(2,-2) = -2

Then, the minimal dp[j] for j from 1 to m=2 is min(dp[1], dp[2]) = min(2, -7) = -7

But the sample output is 14, so this can't be right.

Something is wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining dp[j].

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose dp[j] is the minimal cost to reach position j from position n.

Then, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b from j+1 to i-1)

sum_b from j+1 to i-1 = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

To minimize dp[j], I need to choose the i that minimizes dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

This is similar to what I had before.

Then, to compute dp[j], I need to know mini[j+1] = min over i >= j+1 (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + mini[j+1]

And mini[j] = min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1], mini[j+1])

This seems correct.

In the earlier calculation, I got dp[1] = 2 and dp[2] = -7, dp[3] = -7, dp[4] = -13, which doesn't make sense because costs can't be negative.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that dp[j] is at least 0 or handle negative costs appropriately.

But in the problem, a_i and b_i are positive, so the costs are positive.

Wait, in my calculation, dp[j] became negative, which shouldn't happen.

Perhaps I need to adjust the initial condition for mini[n+1].

Maybe it should be 0, but in reality, it should be infinity because there's no position beyond n.

Wait, perhaps I should set mini[n+1] = 0.

Let me try again.

Set mini[n+1] = 0.

Then, for j from n down to 1:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + mini[j+1]

mini[j] = min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1], mini[j+1])

Let's compute for the first test case:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4+3=7

prefix_b[3] = 7+8=15

prefix_b[4] = 15+5=20

Initialize mini[5] = 0

j=4:

dp[4] = 7 - 20 + 0 = -13

mini[4] = min(-13 + 15, 0) = min(2,0) = 0

j=3:

dp[3] = 6 - 15 + 0 = -9

mini[3] = min(-9 + 7, 0) = min(-2,0) = -2

j=2:

dp[2] = 3 - 7 + (-2) = -6

mini[2] = min(-6 + 4, -2) = min(-2, -2) = -2

j=1:

dp[1] = 9 - 4 + (-2) = 3

mini[1] = min(3 + 0, -2) = min(3, -2) = -2

Then, the minimal dp[j] for j=1 and j=2 is min(3, -6) = -6, but again, this is invalid.

This suggests that my approach is flawed.

Perhaps I need to reconsider the definition of dp[j].

Let me try defining dp[j] as the minimal cost to go from position j to some position <= m.

Wait, perhaps dp[j] should be the minimal cost to reach from position j to any position <= m.

Then, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

This is similar to before.

But clearly, my earlier calculations are leading to negative costs, which doesn't make sense.

Maybe I need to handle the base cases differently.

For positions j <= m, dp[j] = 0, since he's already in the desired positions.

Wait, no. If he's at position j <= m, he doesn't need to pay anything more, so dp[j] = 0 for j <= m.

For j > m, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

Then, I can compute dp[j] for j from n down to 1.

Set dp[j] = 0 for j <= m.

Wait, no. If j <= m, dp[j] = 0.

For j > m, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

Wait, but in the first test case, m=2, n=4.

So, dp[1] = 0

dp[2] = 0

dp[3] = a[3] + min over i > 3 (dp[i] + sum_b[4 to i-1])

But i > 3, and i <= n=4.

So, i=4:

sum_b[4 to 3] is empty sum, 0

dp[4] = a[4] + dp[4] + 0 = a[4] + dp[4]

But dp[4] is yet to be computed.

Wait, this seems circular.

Let me try to compute dp[j] for j from n down to 1.

Set dp[j] = 0 for j <= m.

For j > m:

dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (dp[i] + sum_b[j+1 to i-1])

So, for j=4:

dp[4] = a[4] + dp[5] + sum_b[5 to 4], but dp[5] is undefined.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[n+1] = 0.

Then, dp[4] = a[4] + dp[5] + sum_b[5 to 4], which is a[4] + 0 + 0 = a[4]

Similarly, dp[3] = a[3] + min over i > 3 (dp[i] + sum_b[4 to i-1]) = a[3] + dp[4] + sum_b[4 to 3], which is a[3] + a[4]

dp[2] = 0

dp[1] = 0

Then, the minimal dp[j] for j <= m is min(dp[1], dp[2]) = 0

But this can't be right, because in the sample input, the output is 14.

I'm clearly misunderstanding something.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum_b[j+1 to i-1].

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal cost path from n to any node <= m.

This can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm, but with n up to 2e5, it's too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that sum_b[j+1 to i-1] is the same as prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, the cost from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Then, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j (
