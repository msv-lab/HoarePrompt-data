Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this thing called a "progressive square," which is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers: a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructs this square based on some rules. From the example, when n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, and d=3, the square looks like this:

But wait, the actual example isn't shown here, so I need to understand how the square is constructed from a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Looking back at the problem, it mentions that for any n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules. So, the construction must be unique based on these parameters.

Last month, Maxim constructed such a square and remembered n, c, and d. Now, he found an array of n^2 integers in random order and wants to check if these are the elements of that specific square.

So, my task is to determine, for each test case, whether the given array b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square defined by n, c, and d.

First, I need to understand how the progressive square is constructed from a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Wait a minute, in the problem statement, it says Maxim chooses a_{1,1}, c, and d, but in the input, we only get n, c, and d, and the array b. It doesn't provide a_{1,1}, which seems crucial because it's the starting value of the square.

Looking back, it says "It can be shown that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules." So, even without knowing a_{1,1}, there's only one possible square for given n, c, and d. That suggests that a_{1,1} can be determined from n, c, and d, or perhaps it's irrelevant.

But wait, in the example, a_{1,1} is given as 1, and with c=2 and d=3, they construct a specific square. So, a_{1,1} seems to be a necessary parameter for construction. However, in the input, we don't have a_{1,1}; we only have n, c, d, and the array b.

Wait, perhaps a_{1,1} is not needed because we can derive it from the other values. Let's see.

Looking at the construction rules (which aren't explicitly stated here, only in the full problem description), perhaps a_{1,1} is the smallest element in the square, or something like that.

In the given code, the function func_1 seems to assume that a is the minimum value in the array b, and then constructs the progressive square based on that a, c, and d, and checks if sorting both lists matches.

So, the approach in the given code is:

1. Find the minimum value in b, assume it's a_{1,1}.

2. Construct the progressive square using a_{1,1}, c, and d.

3. Sort both the constructed square and the array b.

4. Check if they match.

If they do, output "yes"; otherwise, "no".

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, is it always true that the minimum value in the progressive square is a_{1,1}? If so, then this approach makes sense because once we know a_{1,1}, and given c and d, we can reconstruct the entire square and check if it matches the sorted array b.

But is this assumption valid? Let's think about how the progressive square is constructed.

From the example, with a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3, and n=3, the square is:

Let's reconstruct it:

Assuming the square is filled in a specific way, perhaps row-wise or column-wise, using a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Wait, perhaps the value at position (i,j) is a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d.

Let me check:

For (1,1): a_{1,1} + 0*c + 0*d = 1

(1,2): 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 0 + 3 = 4

(1,3): 1 + 0*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 0 + 6 = 7

(2,1): 1 + 1*2 + 0*3 = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

(2,2): 1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

(2,3): 1 + 1*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9

(3,1): 1 + 2*2 + 0*3 = 1 + 4 + 0 = 5

(3,2): 1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8

(3,3): 1 + 2*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11

So, the square is:

1 4 7

3 6 9

5 8 11

Now, if we look at the first test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

According to the code, it finds a=min(b)=1, then constructs the square with a=1, c=2, d=3, which should be the same as above.

Then, it sorts both lists and checks if they match.

In this case, the constructed square is [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11], sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

The array b sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Which do not match, so it should output "NO", which matches the first "NO" in the sample output.

The second test case is n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

Sorted b is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], which matches the constructed square, so "YES".

The third test case is n=2, c=100, d=100, b=[400,300,400,500]

Construct the square with a=min(b)=300, c=100, d=100.

So, positions:

(1,1): 300

(1,2): 300 + 0*100 + 1*100 = 400

(2,1): 300 + 1*100 + 0*100 = 400

(2,2): 300 + 1*100 + 1*100 = 500

So, the square is [300,400,400,500], sorted is [300,400,400,500]

The array b is [300,400,400,500], sorted is the same, so "YES".

The fourth test case is n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

Sorted b is [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

Constructed square is [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11], sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

These do not match, so "NO".

The fifth test case is n=4, c=4, d=4, b=[15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

This seems more complex, but following the same logic.

So, from these examples, the approach seems to work.

But is it always correct to assume that the minimum value in b is a_{1,1}?

Is it possible for a_{1,1} not to be the minimum value in the square?

Looking back at the construction formula: a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d

Given that c and d are positive integers (as per the constraints: 1 <= c, d <= 10^6), each increment in i or j increases the value.

Therefore, a_{1,1} is indeed the smallest value in the square.

Hence, it's correct to take the minimum value in b as a_{1,1}.

Then, constructing the square using this a_{1,1}, c, and d, and comparing the sorted lists should correctly determine if b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
