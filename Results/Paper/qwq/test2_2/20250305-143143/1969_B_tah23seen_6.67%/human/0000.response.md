Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. That means I have to do these shifts in such a way that the total cost is as low as possible.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. It's simply that all '0's are before any '1'. So, in the first test case, "10", to make it "01", I can shift the entire string, which costs 2, and that's the answer given.

In the second test case, "0000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, hence the cost is 0.

The third test case, "11000", needs to be transformed into "00011". The sample explanation shows three shifts, each of length 3, totaling 9.

I need to find a general way to calculate this minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about this is to count how many '1's are after '0's in the string, because those are the ones that need to be moved to fix the ordering.

Wait, but it's not that simple because moving a '1' after a '0' might require shifting a substring that contains other characters.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have a string like "101011". To sort it, I need all '0's before '1's. So, the final string should be "001111".

To achieve this, I need to move the '0's to the front, which involves moving them past the '1's.

Each time I move a '0' past a '1', it costs something. But how do I minimize the total cost?

Maybe I can think in terms of inversions. In a sorted string, there should be no '1' before a '0'. So, every '1' that is before a '0' is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

The number of such inversions would be the number of '1's before some '0'.

But in this problem, I can perform cyclic shifts on substrings, and each shift costs the length of the substring.

I need to find a way to correct all inversions with minimum total shift cost.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case:

"10" -> "01" with cost 2.

Second test case:

"0000" is already sorted, cost 0.

Third test case:

"11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011", cost 3+3+3=9.

Fourth test case:

"101011" -> some operations to "001111", cost 5.

Fifth test case:

"01101001" -> some operations to "00001111", cost 11.

I need to find a general method to calculate this cost.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have a '0' at position i and a '1' at position j, with i < j. This is okay because '0's should be before '1's.

But if I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, with i < j, that's an inversion that needs to be corrected.

The number of such inversions is equal to the number of '1's before some '0'.

Wait, but I need to consider the cost of correcting these inversions.

Each cyclic shift operation can correct certain inversions.

I need to find a way to group these inversions and correct them efficiently.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want all '0's to be before all '1's. Let me find the position where the '0's end and '1's start.

In other words, find the maximum position where '0's are before '1's.

This is similar to finding the point where the string transitions from '0's to '1's.

Let me find the index where the string changes from '0' to '1' in the sorted string.

Wait, in the sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, in the sorted string, there is a certain point where '0's end and '1's start.

In the original string, this might not be the case.

Let me find, in the original string, the positions where '0's and '1's are not in their sorted positions.

I need to move the '0's that are after the point where '1's start in the sorted string, to before that point.

Similarly, I need to ensure that '1's that are before that point are moved after.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the final positions of each character.

Each '0' that is after the point where '1's start in the sorted string needs to be moved to before that point.

Similarly, each '1' that is before the point where '1's start needs to be moved after.

But how does this relate to cyclic shifts?

Maybe I need to find blocks of characters that are out of place and shift them as substrings.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as reversing certain substrings, but in this problem, it's cyclic shifts.

Cyclic shifts are different from reversals.

Wait, but in the problem, it's a cyclic shift, which is different from a rotation.

In a cyclic shift, you take the last character and move it to the front of the substring.

Wait, no, let's see the definition again.

"A cyclic shift of some string s is a transformation from s1 s2 … sn−1 sn into sn s1 s2 … sn−1."

So, it's taking the last character and moving it to the front.

So, for a substring, say s[l..r], a cyclic shift would transform it into s[r] s[l] s[l+1] … s[r-1].

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "you take one last character sn and place it before the first character while moving all other characters to the right."

So, for a substring s[l..r], it becomes s[r] s[l] s[l+1] … s[r-1].

Got it.

So, it's like rotating the substring to the left by one position.

Each such shift costs the length of the substring.

I need to perform these shifts to make the string sorted.

I need to find the minimum total cost to do so.

This seems tricky.

Let me see if there's a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First test case:

"10" -> "01" with one shift of length 2, cost 2.

Second test case:

"0000" is already sorted, cost 0.

Third test case:

"11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011", with three shifts of length 3 each, cost 9.

Fourth test case:

"101011" -> some operations, cost 5.

Fifth test case:

"01101001" -> some operations, cost 11.

I need to see if there's a general formula or algorithm that can achieve the sorted string with minimum total cost.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's again.

Suppose I have a '1' before a '0'. To move the '1' after the '0', I can perform a cyclic shift on the substring that includes both characters.

For example, in "10", shifting the whole string: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

In "11000", I can shift "110" to "011", cost 3, then shift "110" to "011", cost 3 again, and so on.

But in the sample explanation, they shifted [1,3]: "11000" -> "01100", then [2,4]: "01100" -> "00110", then [3,5]: "00110" -> "00011", total cost 9.

Is there a better way?

Wait, maybe there is.

Let me think about the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have a '0' at position i and a '1' at position j, with i < j.

To make '0' come before '1', I don't need to do anything.

But if I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, with i < j, I need to swap them.

But in this problem, I can't directly swap two characters; I can only perform cyclic shifts on substrings.

So, to swap two characters, I might need to perform multiple shifts.

Wait, but in the first test case, shifting the whole string once achieves the swap.

So, perhaps for each inversion (a '1' before a '0'), I need to perform a shift that moves the '1' after the '0'.

But I need to do this efficiently, minimizing the total cost.

Let me consider the positions where '1's and '0's are out of order.

Suppose I have a '1' that needs to be moved after a certain point.

I can perform a shift on the substring that includes this '1' and the '0's before it.

Wait, maybe it's better to find all the '1's that are before some '0's and move them after those '0's.

But how do I group these shifts to minimize the total cost?

Perhaps I can iterate through the string and keep track of the '1's that need to be moved.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of inversion counts.

In sorted order, all '0's are before '1's, so any '1' before a '0' is an inversion.

The total number of inversions would be the number of '1's before the first '0'.

Because once a '0' appears, all '1's before it are inversions.

So, perhaps the minimum cost is equal to the number of inversions multiplied by something.

But I need to consider the cost of shifts.

Wait, perhaps I can find runs of '1's before '0's and shift them as a group.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the prefix of '1's and move them to the end.

But that might not be optimal.

Let me consider the positions.

Suppose I have a string like "11000".

The sorted string should be "00011".

So, I need to move the two '1's to the end.

I can perform a shift on the first three characters "110" to get "01100", cost 3.

Then, the string is "01100".

Now, I need to move the '1's in "1100" to the end.

I can shift the substring [2,4]: "110" to "011", making the string "00110", cost 3.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" to "011", making "00011", cost 3.

Total cost is 9.

Is there a better way?

Wait, what if I shift the entire string from position 1 to 5: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, shift substring [2,4]: "110" to "011", making "00110", cost 3.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" to "011", making "00011", cost 3.

Total cost is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, which is higher than the sample's 9.

Wait, but in the sample, they did three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, maybe shifting larger substrings could be more efficient.

Wait, but in this case, shifting smaller substrings seems to be better.

Let me see.

Another approach: think of the string as a sequence of '0's and '1's, and I need to move all '1's after all '0's.

So, find the point where '0's end and '1's start.

In the sorted string, it's after the last '0'.

So, in "11000", the sorted version has '0's first, then '1's.

I need to move the '1's to the end.

To move a '1' to the end, I can perform a shift that includes that '1' and some '0's before it, and move the '1' to the end of that substring.

Each such shift can move one '1' to the end, or multiple '1's.

Wait, no, in a single shift, I'm just moving the last character to the front.

Wait, no, in a cyclic shift, I'm moving the last character of the substring to the front.

So, if I have "11000", and I shift the first three characters "110" to "011", then the '0' moves to the front, and the other characters shift to the right.

So, in this shift, I moved the last character '0' to the front, and the '1's shifted to the right.

This seems like a way to move '0's to the front.

So, perhaps I can repeatedly perform shifts to move '0's to the front.

In "11000", shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100", cost 3.

Now, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110", cost 3.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 9.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, what if I shift larger substrings.

For example, shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", but wait, no, cyclic shift of "0110" would be "0011", which is "0011", cost 4.

Now, the string is "00110".

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 4 + 3 = 7, which is better than 9.

But in the sample, they did three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9.

So, perhaps there is a better strategy.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they did three shifts of cost 3 each, totaling 9, but maybe a different sequence of shifts can achieve a lower total cost.

So, perhaps the minimum cost is not necessarily 9 for "11000".

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 9.

But in my calculation, I found a way to do it with total cost 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me check my shifts.

First, shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", cost 4.

Now, the string is "00110".

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Now, the string is "00011", which is sorted.

Total cost 7.

But according to the sample, it's 9.

Maybe the sample provided is not the minimal, but just one possible way.

But the problem asks for the minimal total cost.

So, perhaps the answer should be 7 for that test case, but the sample output is 9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cyclic shift.

Wait, let's see.

Original string: "11000"

Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100", cost 3.

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110", cost 3.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 9.

But in my previous approach, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", resulting in "00110", cost 4.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 7.

Is this correct?

Wait, in the first shift, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", is that a cyclic shift?

Wait, let's confirm.

Cyclic shift means taking the last character and moving it to the front of the substring.

So, for substring "0110", cyclic shift would be moving the '0' to the front, making it "0011".

Yes, that's correct.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Total cost 7.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is 7, not 9.

But in the sample, they did it with cost 9.

Maybe there are multiple ways, and 7 is better.

So, perhaps the answer should be 7 for that test case.

But the sample output says 9.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for different sequences of shifts, and the minimal total cost is what's required.

So, in this case, 7 is better than 9.

Hence, the sample provided a valid sequence with cost 9, but the minimal cost is 7.

So, I need to find the minimal possible total cost.

How can I generalize this?

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I want to move all '0's to the front.

Each '1' that is before some '0' needs to be moved after those '0's.

Each such move can be done by performing shifts that involve the '1' and the '0's before it.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps, I can think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of inversions, where an inversion is a '1' before a '0', and each inversion costs something.

But I need to group these inversions into shifts to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to sorting inversions in a string, but with a specific cost for each shift operation.

Wait, maybe I can model this as reversing substrings, but since it's cyclic shifts, it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each cyclic shift as a way to move a '1' past a '0', and calculate the minimal number of such shifts needed.

But I need to be careful with the costs.

Let me consider that each '1' that needs to be moved past '0's can be moved by performing shifts that involve the '1' and the '0's before it.

Each such shift can move the '1' past one or more '0's, depending on the substring chosen.

To minimize the total cost, I should try to move multiple '1's in a single shift if possible.

Wait, but in a cyclic shift, I'm only moving the last character of the substring to the front.

So, it's not directly moving a '1' past '0's in a straightforward way.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Suppose I find the position where the '0's end and '1's start in the sorted string.

In the sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, in the original string, any '1' before this position needs to be moved after it.

Similarly, any '0' after this position needs to be moved before it.

But in practice, since the string is binary, moving '1's after '0's is sufficient.

So, perhaps I can count the number of '1's before the first '0', and each '1' before the first '0' needs to be moved to the end, each costing a certain amount.

Wait, but in reality, it's not just the '1's before the first '0', but all '1's before any '0'.

Because even if there are '1's after some '0's, they still need to be moved.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the total number of '1's that are before any '0', and each such '1' needs to be moved past those '0's.

But I need to group these moves efficiently.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, with i < j.

To make the '1' come after the '0', I need to perform shifts that effectively move the '1' past the '0'.

Each shift can move the '1' past one or more '0's, depending on the substring chosen.

To minimize the total cost, I should try to move the '1' past as many '0's as possible in a single shift.

So, if I have a '1' followed by multiple '0's, I can perform a shift that includes the '1' and all the '0's, moving the '1' to the end of that substring.

This would effectively move the '1' past all those '0's in one shift, costing the length of the substring.

But is this the most efficient way?

Wait, perhaps not.

Because if I have multiple '1's before '0's, I can group them in a single shift if they are adjacent.

Wait, for example, in "11000", shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which moves one '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", moving another '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Finally, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving the last '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 9.

But in my earlier approach, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", moving two '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving one '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 7.

This seems better.

So, perhaps grouping the shifts to move multiple '1's past multiple '0's in a single shift is more efficient.

Hence, I need to find a way to group these shifts optimally.

This sounds like a greedy approach, where I try to move as many '1's as possible past as many '0's as possible in each shift.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think in terms of finding blocks of '1's that need to be moved past blocks of '0's.

So, in "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's.

To move both '1's past all three '0's, I can perform shifts that cover these blocks efficiently.

In my earlier approach, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", which moves two '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving one '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 7.

Is there a better way?

Wait, is there a way to move all '1's past all '0's in one shift?

In "11000", shifting the entire string [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "00110".

Finally, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

Which is higher than the previous approach.

So, the earlier approach with shifting [1,4] and then [3,5] is better.

Is there a general way to find such optimal shifts?

Let me consider that for each '1' that is before some '0', I need to move it past those '0's.

If I group '1's that are adjacent, I can move them together in one shift.

But in the earlier example, shifting [1,4] moves two '1's past two '0's.

Wait, in "11000", shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", which moves the first '1' past two '0's and the second '1' past one '0'.

Wait, but the cost is 4, which is less than shifting each '1' separately.

If I shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3, which moves one '1' past one '0'.

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3, which moves one '1' past one '0'.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3, which moves one '1' past one '0'.

Total cost 9.

But in the first approach, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4, which effectively moves two '1's past two '0's.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3, which moves one '1' past one '0'.

Total cost 7.

So, grouping the shifts allows for a lower total cost.

Hence, perhaps I should look for runs of '1's before '0's and shift them together.

Wait, in "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's.

Shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", moves two '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moves one '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 7.

Is there a better way?

Wait, what if I shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

Which is higher than 7.

So, 7 seems better.

Is there a way to do it with cost less than 7?

Wait, perhaps shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "01100".

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 9.

Still higher than 7.

Another approach: shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 7.

Seems better.

Is there a way to do it with cost less than 7?

Wait, perhaps shifting [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, string is "00110".

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.

Which is higher than 7.

Another approach: shift [1,2]: "11" -> "11", which doesn't change the string, so no point.

Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "01100".

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 9.

Still higher than 7.

So, 7 seems better.

Is there a way to do it with cost less than 7?

Wait, perhaps shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 7.

Is there a way to do it with cost 6?

For example, shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Then, shifting [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, string is "00110", which is sorted.

Total cost 3 + 4 = 7.

Still 7.

Is there a way to do it with cost 6?

Wait, maybe shifting [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Total cost 5 + 3 = 8.

Higher than 7.

So, 7 seems better.

Is there a way to do it with cost 6?

Wait, perhaps shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Then, shifting [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, string is "00110", sorted.

Total cost 3 + 4 = 7.

Still 7.

Is there a way to do it with cost 6?

I don't see it right now.

So, perhaps 7 is the minimal total cost for this test case.

But according to the sample explanation, it's 9, but that's just one possible way, not necessarily the minimal.

Hence, perhaps the minimal total cost is less than or equal to 9.

In this case, it's 7.

So, perhaps I need to find a general way to calculate this minimal total cost.

Let me try to think of an algorithm.

I need to move all '1's that are before some '0's to after those '0's.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the string and keep track of the positions where '1's need to be moved.

Then, group these '1's into shifts that cover multiple '1's and '0's efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find all the '1's that are before '0's and group them into contiguous blocks.

Then, for each block, perform a shift that covers the block and the '0's after it.

Wait, in "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's.

So, I can perform a shift that covers the two '1's and two '0's, moving the two '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, there is one remaining '1' before one '0', so shift that, costing 3.

Total cost 7.

Similarly, in "101011", I can identify blocks of '1's before '0's.

Let's see: positions 1: '1', 2: '0', 3: '1', 4: '0', 5: '1', 6: '1'.

So, '1' at position 1 before '0' at position 2.

'1' at position 3 before '0' at position 4.

'1's at positions 5 and 6 are after all '0's, so they don't need to be moved.

So, I have two '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

I can group them together if possible.

For example, shift [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", costing 4.

Now, string is "010111".

Then, shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Now, string is "001111", sorted.

Total cost 4 + 2 = 6.

But according to the sample output, it's 5.

So, perhaps there is a better way.

Wait, maybe shifting [1,3]: "101" -> "110", costing 3.

Now, string is "110011".

Then, shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, string is "011011".

Then, shift [2,5]: "1101" -> "1011", costing 4.

Now, string is "001111", sorted.

Total cost 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.

Which is higher than the sample's 5.

So, perhaps my first approach is better.

Wait, shifting [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", costing 4.

Then, shifting [2,3]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Total cost 6.

But the sample output is 5.

So, perhaps there is a better sequence.

Wait, what if I shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Now, string is "011011".

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "001111", sorted.

Total cost 5.

Perfect, matches the sample output.

So, in this case, shifting [1,2]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5.

This is better than the previous approach's cost of 6.

Hence, grouping shifts optimally is crucial.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to group shifts such that I move multiple '1's past '0's in a single shift.

Wait, in this case, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4, which would be better, but in this specific case, shifting [1,2] and [2,4] gives a total cost of 5, which is higher than 4.

Wait, but in the previous example, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4, and then [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3, total 7.

But in this case, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4, and then [3,6]: "111" -> "111", which doesn't change, so not necessary.

Wait, in "11000", shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 7.

But perhaps there is a better way.

Wait, what if I shift [1,5]: "01100" -> "00110", costing 5.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 8.

Worse than 7.

So, 7 seems better.

But in "101011", shifting [1,2]: "10" -> "01", costing 2.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost 5.

This seems optimal.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through the string and perform shifts whenever I find a '1' before a '0', trying to move as many '1's as possible past '0's in each shift.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think in terms of pointers or indices.

I can keep two pointers: one for the leftmost '1' that needs to be moved, and one for the rightmost '0' before any '1's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the left, and whenever I find a '1' before a '0', I perform a shift that moves that '1' past the '0's.

But I need to group these shifts efficiently.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I want to move all '1's after all '0's.

I can count the number of '1's that are before some '0's.

Each such '1' needs to be moved past all the '0's that come after it.

So, the cost for moving one '1' past one '0' is the length of the substring that includes the '1' and the '0's it needs to be moved past.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as inverting substrings that contain these '1's and '0's.

But since the operation is a cyclic shift, not a reversal, it's different.

This is tricky.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the positions where '1's and '0's are out of order.

Then, perform shifts to correct these positions in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

1. Find the leftmost '1' that is before some '0'.

2. Find the rightmost '0' that is after this '1'.

3. Perform a shift that includes this '1' and the '0's up to the rightmost '0'.

4. Repeat until the string is sorted.

But I need to see if this minimizes the total cost.

Let's try this on "11000".

Step 1: Leftmost '1' is at position 1.

Rightmost '0' after it is at position 5.

Perform shift on [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", costing 5.

Now, string is "01100".

Step 2: Leftmost '1' before '0' is at position 2.

Rightmost '0' after it is at position 4.

Perform shift on [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00110".

Step 3: Leftmost '1' before '0' is at position 3.

Rightmost '0' after it is at position 5.

Perform shift on [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, string is "00011", which is sorted.

Total cost 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

But earlier, I found a way to do it with cost 7.

So, this approach is not optimal.

Hence, perhaps finding the minimal cost requires a different strategy.

Let me consider another idea.

Suppose I treat this as a series of independent operations, each moving a '1' past a '0'.

Each such operation can be performed by a shift that includes the '1' and the '0's it needs to be moved past.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent the positions of '1's and '0's, and edges represent the cost to move a '1' past a '0'.

But this might be too time-consuming.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, with i < j.

To move this '1' past this '0', I can perform a shift on substring [i, j], which moves the '1' past this '0', costing j - i + 1.

But perhaps there are overlapping shifts that can be combined to reduce the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can group consecutive '1's before '0's and perform a single shift to move them all past the '0's.

For example, in "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's.

So, I can perform a shift that moves both '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, perform another shift to move the remaining '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 7.

This seems better than the previous approaches.

Hence, perhaps the algorithm should be:

- Iterate through the string and identify blocks of '1's before '0's.

- For each such block, perform a shift that moves the '1's past as many '0's as possible.

- Calculate the cost accordingly.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize cost to 0.

Iterate through the string, find runs of '1's that are before '0's.

For each such run, find the number of '0's after it, and perform a shift that moves the '1's past those '0's.

The cost of such a shift would be the length of the substring that includes the '1's and the '0's.

Wait, but in the earlier example, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", which moves two '1's past two '0's, costing 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", moving one '1' past one '0', costing 3.

Total cost 7.

This seems to work.

So, perhaps I can implement this logic.

But I need to make sure that this is indeed the minimal total cost.

Is there a way to prove that this is the minimal cost?

I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's and calculate the cost accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the cost as the sum of the lengths of the substrings involved in the shifts.

But I need to find a way to group these shifts optimally.

This seems similar to grouping inversions in sorting.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a series of shifts that each correct a certain number of inversions.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following:

- Find all positions where '1's are before '0's.

- For each such '1', count the number of '0's after it, and sum up the costs accordingly.

But this might not directly give me the minimal total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimum number of shifts required, each shift covering as many inversions as possible.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think in terms of dynamic programming.
