Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. Each time I do this, there's a cost equal to the length of the substring I'm shifting.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the substring "101". If I perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "110". Wait, no, actually, cyclic shift means taking the last character and moving it to the front. So "101" becomes "110". Hmm, is that correct? Let's see: the last character is '1', moving it to the front makes it '1' + '10' = '110'. Yeah, that makes sense.

Another example: "100". Cyclic shift would make it "010". Wait, no: take the last character '0' and move it to the front: '0' + '10' = '010'. Okay.

So, the operation allows me to rearrange parts of the string, but with a cost based on the substring's length.

Now, I need to find a way to make the entire string sorted with the least possible cost.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. Input: "10"

   Output: 2

   Explanation: Perform a cyclic shift on the whole string "10" to get "01". The cost is 2, which is the length of the substring.

That makes sense.

2. Input: "0000"

   Output: 0

   Explanation: It's already sorted, so no operation is needed.

3. Input: "11000"

   Output: 9

   Explanation: Perform three operations, each with a cost of 3, totaling 9.

I need to see if there's a more efficient way, but apparently, in this case, 9 is the minimum cost.

So, I need to find a general approach that works for any binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about this is to consider the positions where the string is not sorted, i.e., where a '1' appears before a '0'. These are the places where I need to make adjustments.

I need to move those '1's that are before '0's to positions after those '0's.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move one character from the end of the substring to the front, which can be used to rearrange the substring.

But I need to find the most efficient way to do this, minimizing the total cost.

Another way to look at it is to count the number of inversions, where a '1' appears before a '0', and find a way to correct these inversions with the least cost.

Wait, but it's not exactly inversions because the operation is not just swapping two elements; it's a cyclic shift on a substring.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to move a '1' from position i to position j, where j > i, using cyclic shifts. How can I do that?

Well, one way is to perform cyclic shifts on the substring from i to j, which would move the '1' to the front of the substring, effectively moving it to position j.

But that would cost j - i + 1.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, maybe by performing multiple shifts on smaller substrings.

But I need to find the minimum total cost, so perhaps finding the most direct way is best.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula based on the number of '1's and '0's that need to be moved.

Let me consider the positions of '0's and '1's.

In the final sorted string, all '0's should be before all '1's.

So, I need to move all '1's that are before some '0' to positions after those '0's.

Each such move can be done by performing a cyclic shift on the substring from that '1' to the '0' it needs to pass.

But that might not be the most efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the positions where the string changes from '1' to '0', and count how many such changes there are, and somehow calculate the cost based on that.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have a string like "101011".

I need to move the '1's that are before '0's to positions after those '0's.

Let's identify the positions where '1's and '0's are not in the desired order.

In "101011", the desired order is all '0's before '1's.

So, in the final string, all '0's should be at the beginning, followed by all '1's.

To achieve this, I need to move the '1's that are after some '0's to positions after those '0's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of '1's that are after each '0', and sum them up.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to simulate the process.

Take the first example: "10".

I perform one cyclic shift on the whole string, costing 2, to get "01".

That's the desired result.

In the third example: "11000".

One optimal way is to perform three operations, each costing 3:

1. Shift substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

2. Shift substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

3. Shift substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

Is there a better way? Let's see.

Alternatively, can I shift a larger substring to correct multiple positions at once?

For example, shift substring [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100"

Then, shift substring [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011"

Then, shift substring [2,5]: "0110" -> "0011"

Wait, that seems suboptimal.

Wait, actually, in the first step, shifting [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100" (cost 5)

Then, shifting [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110" (cost 4)

But "0110" is already sorted, so total cost is 5 + 4 = 9, which is the same as the example.

So, perhaps 9 is indeed the minimum cost.

But is there a way to get it cheaper?

Wait, maybe by shifting larger substrings.

Suppose I shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100" (cost 5)

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011" (cost 3)

Total cost: 5 + 3 = 8, which is better than 9.

But in the example, they did three shifts of 3 each, costing 9.

So, maybe there is a better way.

Wait, but according to the example, the cost is 9, but I found a way to do it with 8.

Is that possible?

Let's see:

Original: "11000"

Step 1: Shift [1,5] to get "01100" (cost 5)

Step 2: Shift [2,4] to get "00110" (cost 3)

Now, the string is "00110", which is not fully sorted yet.

I need one more step:

Step 3: Shift [4,5] to get "00101" (cost 2)

But that's not sorted yet.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Alternatively, after step 1: "01100"

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110" (cost 4), resulting in "00110"

Now, it's sorted.

Total cost: 5 + 4 = 9, same as the example.

So, my earlier attempt was incorrect.

So, the minimum cost is indeed 9.

Wait, but in my first attempt, I thought of shifting [1,5] and then [2,4], but that didn't lead to a sorted string.

So, perhaps 9 is the minimum.

Another thought: maybe the minimum cost is equal to the number of inversions, where each inversion costs the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

But I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Looking at the problem constraints, t can be up to 10^4, and the sum of lengths of s over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it's correct.

The program is:

t = int(input())

while t:

s = input()

print(func_1(s))

t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):

s = []

for i in sChar:

s.append(i)

left = 0

cost = 0

right = 1

while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):

if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':

(s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])

cost += right - left + 1

while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':

right += 1

while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':

left += 1

return cost

So, this function seems to be trying to swap '1's and '0's when necessary and accumulate the cost based on the substring length.

But wait, the operation is a cyclic shift, not a swap.

In the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is different from a cyclic shift.

A cyclic shift would involve moving the last character of the substring to the front.

But in the code, it's directly swapping s[left] and s[right], which seems incorrect because that's not a cyclic shift.

Wait, maybe it's trying to simulate the effect of a cyclic shift.

Let me see.

In the first test case, "10":

left = 0, right = 1

s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0'

So, swap them: s becomes ['0', '1']

cost += 1 - 0 + 1 = 2

Then, find the next '0' to the right: right = 1 (but s[right] = '0', so stay)

Find the next '1' to the left: left = 1 (s[left] = '1')

Now, since left <= right and right < len(s), and left < len(s), continue

if s[right] = '0' and s[left] = '1', swap them: s becomes ['0','1'] (no change)

cost += 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

Wait, but in the first test case, the output should be 2, which matches the initial swap, but in this iteration, it adds another 1 to the cost, making it 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, the cost is 2.

So, perhaps there's an error in the code.

Wait, maybe the condition should be adjusted.

Let me check the logic again.

Initialize left = 0, right =1

If s[left] = '1' and s[right] = '0', swap them, cost += right - left +1 = 2

Now, s = ['0','1']

Then, find the next '0' to the right: right =1, s[right] = '1', so right +=1, but right =2, which is len(s), so stop

Similarly, left remains at 0

Condition left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):

0 <= 2 and 2 < 2, which is False, so exit the loop

So, cost =2, which matches the first test case.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, it seemed to add another 1, but actually, after the first swap, right and left are adjusted, and the loop exits.

So, perhaps it's correct for the first test case.

Let's check the second test case: "0000"

left =0, right=1

s[left]='0', s[right]='0'

No swap

Move right to the next '0', which is right=2

s[left]='0', s[right]='0'

No swap

Move right to 3

s[left]='0', s[right]='0'

No swap

Move right to 4, which is len(s), stop

So, cost=0, which matches the second test case.

Third test case: "11000"

left=0, right=1

s[left]='1', s[right]='1'

No swap

Move right to 2, s[right]='0'

Now, s[left]='1', s[right]='0', swap them: s becomes ['1','0','1','0','0']

cost +=2-0+1=3

Now, find the next '0' to the right: right=2, s[right]='1' → right=3, s[right]='0'

left=0, s[left]='1'

Swap s[left] and s[right]: ['0','0','1','1','0']

cost +=3-0+1=4, total cost=7

Now, find next '0' to the right: right=4, s[right]='0'

left=0, s[left]='0' → left=1, s[left]='0' → left=2, s[left]='1'

Swap s[left] and s[right]: ['0','0','0','1','1']

cost +=4-2+1=3, total cost=10

Now, find next '0' to the right: right=5, which is len(s), stop

So, total cost=10, but the expected output is 9.

So, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to do it, but the code's output is different from the example.

So, maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation of the third test case, they performed three operations, each costing 3, totaling 9.

But according to the code, it's giving 10.

So, perhaps the code is not optimal.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me see what the operation really does.

The operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, not a swap.

But in the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is different from a cyclic shift.

A cyclic shift would involve moving the last character of the substring to the front.

So, the code is incorrect because it's not performing a cyclic shift; it's performing a swap.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
