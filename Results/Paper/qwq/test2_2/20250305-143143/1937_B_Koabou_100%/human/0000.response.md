Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump one cell right or downwards. The goal is to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N), and along the way, collect the binary digits in the cells of the path to form a string. I need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible and also count how many paths produce this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string in dictionary order. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Now, the grid is only 2 rows high but N columns wide. The grasshopper can move right or down, so from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

I need to consider all possible paths from (1,1) to (2,N) and find the path that gives the smallest binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to simulate the path choices and keep track of the string formed along the way, always choosing the path that leads to the smallest string.

But considering that N can be up to 2*10^5, and T (number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(N) per test case.

Let me think about the structure of the grid. Since there are only two rows, the paths are relatively straightforward to analyze.

From (1,1), the grasshopper can either go right to (1,2), or down to (2,1).

If it goes right to (1,2), then from there it can again go right to (1,3), or down to (2,2).

Similarly, if it goes down to (2,1), then it must go right to (2,2), and so on.

So, in general, the path consists of a sequence of right and down moves, ending at (2,N).

The total number of down moves must be 1, because it starts at row 1 and ends at row 2.

The total number of right moves must be N-1, since it starts at column 1 and ends at column N.

So, each path is a sequence of N moves, consisting of N-1 right moves and 1 down move, in some order.

Wait, actually, that's not quite right. The grasshopper must make exactly one down move to go from row 1 to row 2, and the rest are right moves.

But in reality, the down move can be at any position in the path, as long as it's only once.

So, the path can have the down move at any point, and the rest are right moves.

But I need to consider the order in which the cells are visited, because the string is formed by the cells in the order they are visited.

So, for example, if N=3, and the grid is:

0 0 0

0 0 0

Then any path will give the string "000", and there are several paths that do this.

But if the grid has some 1's, then different paths may give different strings, and I need to find the smallest one.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose N=2, and the grid is:

0 0

0 0

Then, possible paths are:

1. Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2). String: 0 0 0

2. Down to (2,1), then right to (2,2). String: 0 0 0

So, both paths give the same string "000".

Now, suppose the grid is:

0 1

1 0

Then, path 1: right to (1,2), down to (2,2). String: 0 1 0

Path 2: down to (2,1), right to (2,2). String: 0 1 0

Again, both paths give the same string "010".

Another example:

0 1

0 1

Path 1: right to (1,2), down to (2,2). String: 0 1 1

Path 2: down to (2,1), right to (2,2). String: 0 1 1

Again, both give "011".

Another example:

1 0

0 1

Path 1: right to (1,2), down to (2,2). String: 1 0 1

Path 2: down to (2,1), right to (2,2). String: 0 1 1

Here, "011" is lexicographically smaller than "101", so the smallest string is "011", and only one path gives this string.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, when the grid is all zeros, both paths give "000", and there are two paths.

But in this case, both paths give the same string, so the number of paths is two.

In the second example I just did, only one path gives the smallest string.

So, I need a way to find the smallest possible string and count how many paths produce it.

I need an efficient way to do this for large N.

Let me think about the general approach.

I can model the paths as sequences of moves, but with only two rows, it's manageable.

At each step, the grasshopper can choose to go right or down, but it can only go down once.

So, I can think of the down move happening at some column index, say k, where 1 <= k <= N.

If the down move is at column k, then the path is:

- Right from (1,1) to (1,k)

- Down to (2,k)

- Right from (2,k) to (2,N)

So, the string formed would be:

- a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

Wait, no.

Actually, when you move right on row 1, you visit a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, then down to a_{2k}, then right to a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}.

But in the string, you include all the cells in the path in order.

Wait, but in the first move, from (1,1):

- If you go right to (1,2), you include a_{12}

- If you go down to (2,1), you include a_{21}

Wait, actually, in the path, you include all the cells you visit, in order.

So, starting at (1,1), include a_{11}.

Then, choose to go right to (1,2), include a_{12}, and so on, until you decide to go down.

When you go down, include the cell you land on, and then continue rightwards on the second row.

So, for a down move at column k, the string is:

a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each possible k from 1 to N, there is a path corresponding to down move at column k, and the string is as above.

My task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all these possible k's, and count how many k's produce this smallest string.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing k, because in some cases, multiple k's can lead to the same string.

But in the first example, when N=2 and both grids are all zeros, k=1 and k=2 both give "000".

But in the second example I did, with grid:

0 1

0 1

For k=1: string is a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22} -> 0,0,1 -> "001"

For k=2: string is a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22} -> 0,1,1 -> "011"

So, "001" is lexicographically smaller than "011", so the smallest string is "001", and only one path (k=1) gives this string.

Wait, but in the problem's first test case, when the grid is all zeros, both k=1 and k=2 give "000".

So, in that case, both paths give the smallest string, so the number of paths is 2.

So, in general, I need to find the smallest string among all possible k's, and count how many k's give that string.

So, the key is to find, for each k from 1 to N, the string corresponding to that k, and then find the minimum string and count how many k's give that string.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to represent the strings for different k's.

For each k from 1 to N, the string is:

a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

So, for k=1: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N}

For k=2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{2N}

...

For k=N: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, a_{2N}

I need to find the lexicographically smallest among these strings.

Lexicographical comparison means comparing the strings character by character from left to right, and the first position where they differ determines the order.

So, to find the smallest string, I need to find the path (choice of k) that gives the smallest possible sequence of characters.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to compare these strings without generating all of them explicitly, because that would be too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way to find the minimal string and count the number of k's that produce it.

Let me consider the strings for different k's and see how they compare.

Let's look at the strings for k=1 to k=N, and see how they differ.

For k=1: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N}

For k=2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{2N}

For k=3: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}, a_{24}, ..., a_{2N}

...

For k=N: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, a_{2N}

I need to find the smallest string among these.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the positions in the strings and find the earliest position where the strings differ, and choose the path that has the smallest character at that position.

But since the strings share many characters, especially towards the beginning, I can find a way to skip through positions where all strings have the same character.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define, for each position p in the string, what characters it would have for different k's.

But that might be too slow.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for k from 1 to N, the strings differ in the way the transition from row 1 to row 2 happens.

Specifically, in the string for k=i, the transition from row 1 to row 2 happens at position i.

So, the strings up to position i are a_{11} to a_{1i}, and then from position i+1 to the end, it's a_{2i} to a_{2N}.

Wait, no.

Wait, the string for k=i is:

a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1i}, a_{2i}, a_{2(i+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

So, positions 1 to i: a_{11} to a_{1i}

Position i+1: a_{2i}

Positions i+2 to N+1: a_{2(i+1)} to a_{2N}

Wait, but the string has length N+1, since you visit N+1 cells: starting from (1,1), making N moves to reach (2,N).

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, in the path, you start at (1,1), and make N moves: N-1 right moves and 1 down move.

But the number of cells visited is N+1, because you start at (1,1), and each move adds one cell.

Wait, actually, no.

Wait, in a grid from (1,1) to (2,N), with only right and down moves, the number of cells visited in any path is N+1: starting at (1,1), making N moves to reach (2,N), visiting N+1 cells.

So, the string has length N+1.

Now, for k from 1 to N:

- For k=1: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N} (N+1 cells)

- For k=2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{2N} (N+1 cells)

- ...

- For k=N: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, a_{2N} (N+1 cells)

I need to find the minimal string among these N strings.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to find the minimal path without generating all strings.

Let me consider that the strings differ in the way the transition from row 1 to row 2 occurs.

So, for k=1, it transitions early, at the first column.

For k=N, it transitions late, at the last column.

I need to find the path where the transition occurs such that the resulting string is lex smallest.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest string.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through the columns, trying to delay the transition as long as possible, but ensuring that transitioning early gives a smaller string if needed.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to transition down or continue right, based on which choice gives the smallest character at the current position.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider position by position in the string.

Position 1: always a_{11}, since starting at (1,1).

Position 2: can be a_{12} (if moving right) or a_{21} (if moving down).

I need to choose the smaller of a_{12} and a_{21}.

Suppose a_{12} < a_{21}: choose to move right.

Suppose a_{12} > a_{21}: choose to move down.

Suppose a_{12} == a_{21}: need to look ahead to decide.

Wait, but it's not that simple, because moving down affects the subsequent positions.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as merging two sequences: one sequence if I stay on row 1 as long as possible, and another if I switch to row 2 early.

But I need a systematic way.

Let me consider that the strings for different k's are:

For k=1: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N}

For k=2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{2N}

...

For k=N: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, a_{2N}

I need to find the minimal string among these.

I can think of it as finding the path that minimizes the string at each position.

Let me try to iterate through the positions and decide at each step which choice (right or down) gives the smallest possible character.

But since the grid has only two rows, I can keep track of the current row I'm in and decide whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a finite state machine or use dynamic programming.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the row and j is the column, but since N can be large, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the possible rows I can be in at each column.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me look at the strings for different k's and see how they compare.

Let me consider two consecutive k's, say k and k+1, and see how their strings differ.

For k: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

For k+1: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{1(k+1)}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

So, up to position k, they are the same.

At position k+1:

- For k: a_{2k}

- For k+1: a_{1(k+1)}

So, the strings differ at position k+1.

Therefore, to choose between k and k+1, I need to compare a_{2k} and a_{1(k+1)}.

If a_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, then k's string is smaller.

If a_{2k} > a_{1(k+1)}, then k+1's string is smaller.

If a_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, then I need to look further.

Wait, this seems promising.

So, I can start with k=1, and then compare with k=2, and so on, merging them based on the comparisons.

This sounds like finding the minimal string among a set of strings that differ after a certain point.

In other words, it's similar to finding the minimal string in a list where each string shares a common prefix and differs afterwards.

This can be modeled using a suffix array or some similar data structure, but I need something more straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay on row 1 or switch to row 2 based on the current and next values.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm.

Initialize the current row as row 1.

Initialize the current string as empty.

Initialize a counter for the number of paths that give the minimal string.

Iterate from column 1 to column N:

- If current row is 1:

- Option 1: stay on row 1, append a_{1j} to the string.

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2j} to the string, and set current row to 2.

- Choose the option that gives the smallest possible character at this position.

- If the characters are equal, choose the option that allows more flexibility later.

- If current row is 2:

- Must stay on row 2, append a_{2j} to the string.

But since once we switch to row 2, we have to stay there, the decision is to choose the switch point k where the string is minimized.

So, perhaps I can find the k that minimizes the string by choosing the earliest possible k such that the string is minimized.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal string by choosing the k that has the smallest a_{2k}, considering the previous choices.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one that has the smallest possible character at each position, considering the possible choices of k.

To achieve this, I need to choose the path that gives the smallest character at the earliest positions.

Given that, I can iterate through the columns and decide whether to switch to row 2 or stay on row 1 based on which choice gives the smallest character at the current position.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Start at (1,1), append a_{11} to the string.

Then, for each subsequent position, choose to move right on the current row or down to the other row, selecting the move that gives the smallest possible character at that position.

If the characters are equal, choose the move that allows the smallest possible characters in the subsequent positions.

But to implement this efficiently, I need a way to decide at each step without looking too far ahead.

Given that there are only two rows, I can precompute for each column j, which row gives the smallest character at that position, considering the previous choices.

Wait, maybe I can find the first column where a_{1j} > a_{2(j-1)}, meaning that switching to row 2 at column j would give a smaller string.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider maintaining two pointers or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can merge the two rows in a way that gives the minimal string.

Let me consider that the string is built by taking elements from row 1 up to some point and then switching to row 2.

I need to find the optimal switching point.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by finding the minimal possible sequence by choosing the smallest available character at each step, considering the constraints of the path.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current row I'm in, and decide whether to stay or switch based on which choice gives the smallest character at the current position.

But since row 1 can only be used up to the point where I switch to row 2, and after that, I must use row 2.

So, perhaps I can find the position where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible character in the string.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and find the position where switching to row 2 is beneficial.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the current row as row 1.

Initialize an empty string.

Append a_{11} to the string.

Set a counter for the number of paths that give this minimal string.

Iterate from column 2 to column N:

- If staying on row 1 gives a smaller character than switching to row 2, stay on row 1.

- If switching to row 2 gives a smaller character, switch to row 2.

- If both choices give the same character, choose the one that allows more flexibility later.

But I need to define this more precisely.

Let me consider that at each step, I have the option to stay on the current row or switch to the other row (if I haven't switched yet).

Once I switch to row 2, I must stay on row 2.

So, I need to decide, for each column, whether to stay on the current row or switch to row 2.

I need to choose the switch point k that minimizes the string.

To do this efficiently, I can find the first position where switching to row 2 gives a smaller character than staying on row 1.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just the current position.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible a_{2k} among all possible k's, considering the previous positions.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one that has the smallest possible prefix.

So, I can iterate through the columns and compare the choices at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the strings for different k's differ only after position k.

So, I can find the position where the strings start to differ and choose the one with the smallest character at that position.

But I need a way to find the minimal string without generating all of them.

Let me consider merging the two rows in a way that produces the smallest possible string.

I can think of it as merging two sequences: the sequence from row 1 and the sequence from row 2, with the constraint that I can switch from row 1 to row 2 only once.

This is similar to merging two sorted lists, but in this case, the lists are not sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue or some sorting mechanism.

But sorting would be too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the switch point k.

Then, the string is a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest possible string.

To find the minimal string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and find the minimal string among these.

But that would be O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compare the strings for different k's efficiently.

Let me consider that for k=1 to k=N, the strings are:

s1: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N}

s2: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{2N}

s3: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}, a_{24}, ..., a_{2N}

...

sN: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, a_{2N}

I need to find the minimal string among s1 to sN.

To do this efficiently, I can find the position where these strings differ and choose the one with the smallest character at the earliest differing position.

To optimize this, I need a way to find the minimal string without generating all of them.

Let me consider that the strings s1 to sN have a common prefix, and differ starting from some position.

So, I can iterate through the positions and find the first position where the strings differ, and then choose the string with the smallest character at that position.

But since generating all strings is too slow, I need a way to find this minimal string by inspecting the grid.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay on row 1 or switch to row 2 based on which choice gives the smallest possible character at that position.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize the current row as row 1.

Initialize an empty string.

Initialize a counter for the number of paths that give this minimal string.

Append a_{11} to the string.

Set the switch point to -1 (meaning not switched yet).

Iterate from column 2 to column N:

- If current row is 1:

- Option 1: stay on row 1, append a_{1j}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2j}, and set switch point to j

- Choose the option that gives the smallest character at this position.

- If the characters are equal, choose to stay on row 1 to keep more flexibility.

- If current row is 2:

- Must stay on row 2, append a_{2j}

This seems reasonable.

So, in code, I can keep track of the current choice and the switch point.

Wait, but I need to find the minimal string among all possible k's, not just find one minimal path.

I need to find the minimal string and then count how many k's give that string.

So, perhaps I can find the minimal string first, and then count the number of k's that produce that string.

To find the minimal string:

- Start with k=1 (earliest switch)

- Then, consider k=2, k=3, ..., up to k=N

- Find the k that gives the smallest string

To do this efficiently, I need a way to compare the strings for different k's without generating them fully.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where the strings for different k's differ and compare them there.

But that still seems too slow.

Let me consider that for k from 1 to N, the strings are:

s_k = a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

I can think of s_k as being determined by the prefix up to a_{1k} and then the suffix from a_{2k} to a_{2N}.

To find the minimal s_k, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal s_k.

But again, this is O(N^2).

I need a way to find the minimal s_k in O(N) time.

Let me consider that the strings s_k and s_{k+1} differ starting from position k+1.

Because:

s_k: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

s_{k+1}: a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{1(k+1)}, a_{2(k+1)}, ..., a_{2N}

So, up to position k, they are the same.

At position k+1:

- s_k has a_{2k}

- s_{k+1} has a_{1(k+1)}

So, to choose between s_k and s_{k+1}, I need to compare a_{2k} and a_{1(k+1)}.

- If a_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, then s_k is smaller.

- If a_{2k} > a_{1(k+1)}, then s_{k+1} is smaller.

- If a_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, then I need to look at further positions.

But looking at further positions would involve comparing a_{2(k+1)} and a_{2(k+1)}, which are the same, and so on.

Wait, no.

Wait, in s_k, after position k+1, it's a_{2(k+1)}, a_{2(k+2)}, ..., a_{2N}

In s_{k+1}, after position k+1, it's a_{2(k+1)}, a_{2(k+2)}, ..., a_{2N}

So, if a_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, then the strings are equal from position k+1 onwards, so s_k == s_{k+1}.

Therefore, in this case, both s_k and s_{k+1} are equal.

So, in general:

- If a_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, s_k < s_{k+1}, so s_k is better.

- If a_{2k} > a_{1(k+1)}, s_{k+1} < s_k, so s_{k+1} is better.

- If a_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, s_k == s_{k+1}, so both are equal.

Therefore, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_k.

To do this efficiently, I can start with k=1, and then for each k from 2 to N, compare a_{2(k-1)} and a_{1k}.

- If a_{2(k-1)} < a_{1k}, then s_k is worse than s_{k-1}, so keep s_{k-1}.

- If a_{2(k-1)} > a_{1k}, then s_k is better than s_{k-1}, so switch to s_k.

- If a_{2(k-1)} == a_{1k}, then s_k == s_{k-1}, so both are equal.

Therefore, the minimal s_k is the one where a_{2(k-1)} > a_{1k}, and among all such k's, choose the smallest k.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Initialize minimal string as s1.

Then, for k from 2 to N:

- Compare s_k with the current minimal string.

- If s_k < current minimal, update the minimal string to s_k.

But as we've seen, s_k and s_{k+1} differ at position k+1.

So, to compare s_k and s_{k+1}, we look at position k+1.

- If a_{2k} < a_{1(k+1)}, s_k < s_{k+1}, so s_k is better.

- If a_{2k} > a_{1(k+1)}, s_{k+1} < s_k, so s_{k+1} is better.

- If a_{2k} == a_{1(k+1)}, s_k == s_{k+1}.

Therefore, as I iterate k from 1 to N, I can keep track of the current minimal s_k, and update it when I find a s_k that is smaller.

Moreover, I can keep track of the range of k's that give the same minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the range of k's where s_k remains the minimal string.

Let me try to find the minimal s_k and the range of k's that give that string.

Initialize minimal_string = s1

Initialize start_k = 1

Then, for k from 2 to N:

- Compare a_{2(k-1)} and a_{1k}

- If a_{2(k-1)} > a_{1k}, then s_k < minimal_string, so set minimal_string = s_k, and start_k = k

- Else, if a_{2(k-1)} == a_{1k}, then s_k == minimal_string, so continue

- Else, a_{2(k-1)} < a_{1k}, so s_k > minimal_string, so skip

Then, the minimal string is minimal_string, and the number of k's that give this string is N - start_k + 1, provided that for all k from start_k to N, a_{2(k-1)} >= a_{1k}.

Wait, but this might not be correct, because at some point, a_{2(k-1)} could be equal to a_{1k}, maintaining the same string, but then later, a_{2k} could be different.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the largest k such that a_{2(k-1)} == a_{1k}.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the strings s_k and s_{k+1} are equal if and only if a_{2(k-1)} == a_{1k}.

Otherwise, s_k < s_{k+1} if a_{2(k-1)} < a_{1k}, else s_k > s_{k+1}.

Therefore, the minimal s_k is the first s_k in the sequence where a_{2(k-1)} >= a_{1k}, and a_{2k} <= a_{1(k+1)}.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window approach.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal s_k by finding the smallest a_{2(k-1)} among all k's, considering that a_{2(k-1)} is the point where the string differs.

But I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to implement the above idea in code.

Initialize minimal_string as s1

Initialize start_k = 1

Then, iterate k from 2 to N:

- If a_{2(k-1)} > a_{1k}, then s_k < minimal_string, so set minimal_string = s_k and start_k = k

- Else if a_{2(k-1)} == a_{1k}, then s_k == minimal_string, so continue

- Else, a_{2(k-1)} < a_{1k}, so s_k > minimal_string, so break

Wait, no, I need to find all k's where s_k == minimal_string.

So, I need to find the range of k's where s_k == minimal_string.

To do this, I can iterate k from 1 to N, and find the first k where s_k is minimal, and then find the largest range where s_k remains equal to this minimal string.

But I need a way to efficiently compare s_k and s_{k+1}.

Given that s_k and s_{k+1} differ at position k+1, I can compare a_{2k} and a_{1(k+1)}.

So, to find the minimal s_k, I can iterate k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal a_{2(k-1)}.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the switch point k.

Let me consider that the string s_k is determined by the switch point k.

To minimize s_k, I need to choose k such that the transition from row 1 to row 2 is optimal.

Wait, maybe I can find the k where a_{2(k-1)} is minimized, but considering the previous choices.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that the minimal string is the one that has the smallest possible characters as early as possible.

So, I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay on row 1 or switch to row 2 based on which choice gives the smallest character at that position.

To implement this, I can keep track of the current row and the minimal string built so far.

Initialize current_row = 1

Initialize string = a_{11}

Initialize count = 1 (number of paths giving this string)

Then, for each column j from 2 to N:

- If current_row == 1:

- Option 1: stay on row 1, append a_{1j}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2j}, and set current_row = 2

- Choose the option with the smaller character.

- If both options have the same character, choose both options and update count accordingly.

- Else, set current_row to the row with the smaller character and update count.

- If current_row == 2:

- Must stay on row 2, append a_{2j}

This seems like a dynamic programming approach.

Let me try to formalize it.

Define dp[j][r], where j is the column and r is the current row, and dp[j][r] is the minimal string up to column j when ending in row r.

But since strings can be large, I need a way to represent them efficiently.

Alternatively, I can keep track of the minimal character at each position.

But perhaps I can use a tuple (string, count), where string is the minimal string up to column j, and count is the number of paths giving that string.

But this seems too slow for large N.

Let me consider that since there are only two rows, I can keep track of the possible rows at each step.

Initialize current_strings = [a_{11}] from row 1

Initialize count = 1

Then, for each column j from 2 to N:

- If current_strings[1][j-1] < current_strings[2][j-1]:

- Choose to stay on row 1: append a_{1j} to the string

- Else if current_strings[1][j-1] > current_strings[2][j-1]:

- Choose to switch to row 2: append a_{2j} to the string, and set current_row = 2

- Else (current_strings[1][j-1] == current_strings[2][j-1]):

- If a_{1j} < a_{2j}:

- Choose to stay on row 1: append a_{1j}

- Else if a_{1j} > a_{2j}:

- Choose to switch to row 2: append a_{2j}, set current_row = 2

- Else (a_{1j} == a_{2j}):

- Both choices are equal, so keep both options and double the count.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that at each step, I have a current set of possible rows I can be in, and I choose the next row based on which gives the smallest character at the current position.

Given that, perhaps I can maintain a flag indicating whether I have switched to row 2 or not.

Wait, perhaps I can use a variable to track whether I have switched to row 2 or not.

Initialize switched = False

Initialize string = a_{11}

Initialize count = 1

Then, for each column j from 2 to N:

- If not switched:

- Option 1: stay on row 1, append a_{1j}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2j}, set switched = True

- Choose the option with the smaller character.

- If both options have the same character, choose both and update count accordingly.

- Else, choose the row with the smaller character and update count.

- If switched:

- Must stay on row 2, append a_{2j}

This seems similar to the earlier idea.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize switched = False

Initialize string = a_{11}

Initialize count = 1

For j from 2 to N:

if not switched:

option1 = a_{1j}

option2 = a_{2j}

if option1 < option2:

string += option1

else if option1 > option2:

string += option2

switched = True

else:

# option1 == option2

string += option1

if option1 == option2:

count *= 2

else:

# already switched

string += a_{2j}

This seems like it could work, but I need to verify it with some examples.

Take the first example from the problem:

N=2

a1 = 00

a2 = 00

So, a1 = [0,0]

a2 = [0,0]

Initialize switched = False

string = '0'

count = 1

For j=2:

not switched

option1 = a1[2] = '0'

option2 = a2[2] = '0'

option1 == option2

string += '0'

count *= 2 => count = 2

Then, switched remains False

So, final string = '000', count = 2

Which matches the first test case.

Another example:

N=4

a1 = 1101

a2 = 1100

So, a1 = [1,1,0,1]

a2 = [1,1,0,0]

Initialize switched = False

string = '1'

count = 1

For j=2:

not switched

option1 = a1[2] = '1'

option2 = a2[2] = '1'

option1 == option2

string += '1'

count *= 2 => count = 2

For j=3:

not switched

option1 = a1[3] = '0'

option2 = a2[3] = '0'

option1 == option2

string += '0'

count *= 2 => count = 4

For j=4:

not switched

option1 = a1[4] = '1'

option2 = a2[4] = '0'

option2 < option1

string += '0'

switched = True

count remains 4

Then, for j=5 to N=4, nothing more.

Wait, N=4, so j from 2 to 4.

So, final string = '1100', count=4

But according to the problem's second test case, the output is '11000' with count=1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the problem's second test case, N=4, a1='1101', a2='1100', output is '11000' with count=1.

But according to my algorithm, I got '1100' with count=4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the string construction.

Wait, the string has length N+1, since you start at (1,1) and make N moves to reach (2,4), visiting N+1 cells.

So, in this case, N=4, string length should be 5.

In my earlier calculation, I only built a string of length 4.

Wait, I see, I need to adjust my algorithm to build a string of length N+1.

Let me correct that.
