Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to figure out the minimum cost to sort this string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. Sorting in non-descending order means arranging the string so that all 0s come before all 1s.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the problem, it says that a cyclic shift of a substring means taking the last character of the chosen substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have the substring "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Wait, no, let's see: taking the last character '1' and moving it before the first character '1', so it becomes '1' + '10' = '110'. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the operation allows me to choose any substring and perform this cyclic shift, and the cost of that operation is the length of the substring. I can do this operation any number of times, and I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For "10", the minimum cost is 2. By performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, "10" becomes "01", which is sorted.

- For "0000", it's already sorted, so the cost is 0.

- For "11000", the solution provided is 9, achieved through a series of shifts.

I need to find a general approach that can calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me think about how to approach this problem.

First, since the string consists only of 0s and 1s, sorting it in non-descending order means moving all the 0s to the front and all the 1s to the back.

So, the target configuration is a string where all 0s are before any 1s.

Now, the operation allowed is cyclic shifting of any substring, and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find a sequence of such operations that transforms the given string into the target configuration with the minimum total cost.

I should consider what effect a cyclic shift has on the string. Each cyclic shift moves the last character of the chosen substring to the front of that substring.

I need to see how this operation can help me rearrange the string to have all 0s before 1s.

Perhaps I can think in terms of inversions or misplaced characters and figure out how to correct them with these operations.

Let me consider the positions where 1s appear before 0s, as these are the inversions I need to fix.

Each time I have a '1' before a '0', I need to find a way to move that '1' after the '0' with minimal cost.

Now, cyclic shifts affect a substring, so maybe I can find a way to shift substrings that contain these inversions to correct them.

But it's not straightforward how to minimize the total cost by choosing which substrings to shift and how many times.

Maybe I can model this as moving the 1s to the end of the string, and calculate the cost based on how many positions each 1 needs to be moved.

Wait, but cyclic shifts are not the same as just swapping or moving characters individually; they affect multiple characters at once.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the string "10". To sort it, I can perform one cyclic shift on the entire string, changing "10" to "01", with a cost of 2.

In the third example, "11000", the solution provided is 9, which seems like performing three shifts on substrings of length 3 each.

But is there a better way to calculate this without simulating the operations?

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of 1s that need to be moved past certain positions.

Let me consider the positions where 0s and 1s are misplaced.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of inversions that need to be corrected, where an inversion is a '1' that appears before a '0'.

Each such inversion needs to be corrected by moving the '1' after the '0'.

Now, each cyclic shift operation can correct certain inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

But it's still unclear how to minimize the total cost.

Maybe I can look at the problem differently.

Suppose I want all 0s to be before all 1s.

Let me find the position where the first '1' appears in the sorted string.

In the sorted string, all 0s are at the beginning, followed by all 1s.

So, if I know the number of 0s in the string, say 'z', then in the sorted string, the first 'z' characters are '0's, and the rest are '1's.

Now, to transform the given string into this sorted string, I need to move the '0's to their correct positions.

Alternatively, I can think of moving the '1's to their correct positions.

Perhaps it's similar to bubble sort, where each operation moves a '1' past a '0' at a certain cost.

But in this case, the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, which affects multiple characters at once.

I need to find a way to model this.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or prefix sums can help here.

Let me try to think about prefix sums.

Let me consider the number of '1's to the left of each position.

If I can calculate, for each '0', how many '1's are to its left, perhaps that can indicate the number of shifts needed to move those '1's past this '0'.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting inversions.

In inversion counting, for each pair of elements, if they are out of order, it's considered an inversion.

In this case, for each '1' that appears before a '0', it's an inversion that needs to be corrected.

If I can count the number of such inversions, and each operation can correct a certain number of inversions, perhaps I can find the minimal cost.

But I need to relate this to the cost, which is the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find a way to correct all inversions with minimal total cost.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation on a substring can correct the inversions within that substring.

But the cost is the length of the substring, and I need to cover all inversions with as few operations as possible, preferably operations on smaller substrings.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of swapping adjacent elements, but in this case, the operation is a cyclic shift on any substring, not just swapping adjacent elements.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the first example again.

For "10", cost is 2.

By shifting the entire substring, I correct the only inversion.

So, cost is 2, which is the length of the substring.

In the third example, "11000", the solution is 9.

They performed three shifts on substrings of length 3 each.

But is there a way to do it with fewer operations or smaller substrings?

Wait, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern here.

Looking at the problem, it seems that for each '1' that appears before a '0', I need to move it past that '0' to the right.

Each such move can be thought of as swapping the '1' and '0', but in this case, the operation is a cyclic shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of '1's that need to be moved past certain positions.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion based on positions.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the string "101011".

I need to move the '1's before the '0's to after the '0's.

So, for each '0', I need to count how many '1's are before it, and somehow accumulate the cost.

But how does that relate to the operations allowed?

Wait, maybe for each '1' that should be after a '0', I can calculate the cost to move it there.

But I need to find a way to group these moves into cyclic shifts of substrings.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the code provided and see what it's doing.

The code is:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

s = list(map(int, input().strip()))

zeroes = s.count(0)

cnt = [0, 0]

ans = 0

for c in s:

cnt[c] += 1

if c == 0:

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0

else:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

print(ans)

So, for each test case, it reads the string, converts it to a list of integers, counts the number of zeroes, initializes a count array for 0 and 1, and initializes ans to 0.

Then, it iterates through the string, updating the count of 0s and 1s.

For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it (cnt[1] > 0), it adds 1 to ans.

For each '1' encountered, it adds (zeroes - cnt[0]) to ans.

Wait, let's see with an example.

Take "101011".

s = [1,0,1,0,1,1]

zeroes = 2

cnt = [0,0]

ans = 0

Iterate through s:

- c=1: cnt[1] +=1 => cnt=[0,1]

since c==1, ans += (2 - 0) => ans=2

- c=0: cnt[0] +=1 => cnt=[1,1]

since c==0 and cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 => ans=3

- c=1: cnt[1] +=1 => cnt=[1,2]

since c==1, ans += (2 -1) => ans=4

- c=0: cnt[0] +=1 => cnt=[2,2]

since c==0 and cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 => ans=5

- c=1: cnt[1] +=1 => cnt=[2,3]

since c==1, ans += (2 -2) => ans=5

- c=1: cnt[1] +=1 => cnt=[2,4]

since c==1, ans += (2 -2) => ans=5

Final ans=5, which matches the third test case.

Similarly, for "10", zeroes=1

s=[1,0]

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

- c=1: cnt=[0,1], ans += (1 -0) => ans=1

- c=0: cnt=[1,1], since cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 => ans=2

Which matches the first test case.

For "0000", zeroes=4

- c=0: cnt=[1,0], ans +=0 (since cnt[1]==0)

- c=0: cnt=[2,0], ans +=0

- c=0: cnt=[3,0], ans +=0

- c=0: cnt=[4,0], ans +=0

Total ans=0, which matches the second test case.

So, the formula seems to be working for these cases.

But I need to understand why this formula gives the minimum cost.

Let's try to understand the logic behind this formula.

It seems that for each '1' encountered, it adds (zeroes - cnt[0]) to ans, and for each '0' with cnt[1]>0, it adds 1 to ans.

Wait, perhaps it's counting the number of '1's that are before their final positions and need to be moved past '0's.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a '1' at a position where, in the sorted string, there should be a '0'.

I need to move that '1' to a position where it should be, which is after all the '0's.

Each such move can be thought of as shifting the '1' past the '0's.

Similarly, for '0's that are after the point where all '0's should be, I need to move them before the '1's.

But in this code, it's seems to be counting, for each '1', how many '0's are before its final position.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the number of inversions that need to be corrected.

But I need to see exactly what ans represents.

In the "101011" example:

- First '1': ans += (2 - 0) = 2

- First '0': cnt[1]=1 >0, ans +=1 => ans=3

- Second '1': ans += (2 -1) =1, ans=4

- Second '0': cnt[1]=2 >0, ans +=1 => ans=5

- Third '1': ans += (2 -2) =0, ans=5

- Fourth '1': ans += (2 -2) =0, ans=5

Total ans=5, which matches the example.

In the "11000" example:

s=[1,1,0,0,0], zeroes=3

- c=1: ans += (3 -0)=3, ans=3

- c=1: ans += (3 -1)=2, ans=5

- c=0: cnt=[1,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=6

- c=0: cnt=[2,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=7

- c=0: cnt=[3,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=8

But according to the example, the answer should be 9, but here ans=8.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the third example, the answer is 9, but according to this formula, it's giving 8.

Wait, no, in the third example, s='11000', zeroes=3

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

- c=1: cnt=[0,1], ans += (3 -0)=3, ans=3

- c=1: cnt=[0,2], ans += (3 -0)=3, ans=6

- c=0: cnt=[1,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=7

- c=0: cnt=[2,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=8

- c=0: cnt=[3,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=9

So, ans=9, which matches the example.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, it's adding up some values based on the positions of '1's and '0's.

But I still don't understand why this formula gives the minimum cost.

Let me think about what each part of the formula represents.

For each '1' encountered, it adds (zeroes - cnt[0]) to ans.

- zeroes is the total number of '0's in the string.

- cnt[0] is the number of '0's encountered so far.

- So, (zeroes - cnt[0]) is the number of '0's that come after the current position.

Similarly, for each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it (cnt[1]>0), it adds 1 to ans.

- This seems to be accounting for the '0's that are before some '1's and need to be moved.

Wait, perhaps the total cost is equivalent to the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's after them, plus the number of '0's that have '1's before them.

But I need to see how this relates to the operations allowed.

Each operation allows shifting a substring cyclically, and the cost is the length of the substring.

I need to see how these operations can be used to move '1's past '0's.

Wait, maybe each operation corresponds to moving a '1' past a '0', and the cost is the number of positions moved.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is calculating the total number of inversions, where each inversion is a '1' before a '0', and assigning a cost based on the positions.

But in the provided formula, for each '1', it adds the number of '0's after it, and for each '0', if there are '1's before it, it adds 1.

So, for each '1', it's considering the number of '0's after it, which is the number of positions it needs to be moved past the '0's.

And for each '0', if there are '1's before it, it needs to be moved after those '1's, hence adding 1 for each such '0'.

But I'm still not entirely sure why this gives the minimal cost.

Let me think about another example.

Take "01", which is already sorted, so cost should be 0.

According to the formula:

s=[0,1], zeroes=1

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

- c=0: cnt=[1,0], since c=0 and cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 => ans=0

- c=1: cnt=[1,1], since c=1, ans += (1 -1)=0 => ans=0

Total ans=0, which is correct.

Another example: "10"

s=[1,0], zeroes=1

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

- c=1: cnt=[0,1], ans += (1 -0)=1 => ans=1

- c=0: cnt=[1,1], cnt[1]=1>0, ans +=1 => ans=2

Which matches the first test case.

Another example: "0000", already sorted, cost=0.

As we saw earlier, ans=0.

Another example: "11000", ans=9, which matches the third test case.

So, the formula seems consistent with the examples.

But I need to understand why this formula gives the minimal cost.

Perhaps it's because each '1' that appears before a '0' needs to be moved past that '0', and the cost is proportional to the number of positions it needs to be moved.

But in this operation, shifting a substring cyclically, it's moving multiple characters at once.

I need to see how this operation can be used to move '1's past '0's efficiently.

Wait, maybe each cyclic shift can move a '1' past a '0' in one operation, with cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

So, if I can group multiple shifts together in one operation, I can minimize the total cost.

But I need to find an optimal way to group these shifts.

Perhaps the formula is calculating the minimal cost based on some optimal grouping of shifts.

Looking back at the formula:

For each '1', add the number of '0's after it.

For each '0', if there are '1's before it, add 1.

So, total cost is sum over all '1's of (number of '0's after it) plus sum over all '0's of (number of '1's before it).

Wait, that seems similar to the total number of inversions, where each inversion is a '1' before a '0'.

In that case, the total cost would be equal to the number of inversions.

But in the first test case, "10", number of inversions is 1 (the '1' before the '0'), but the cost is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not simply the number of inversions.

Wait, maybe it's the sum over all inversions of the distance they need to be moved.

But in that case, for "10", the '1' needs to be moved one position to the right to become "01", with cost 2 (shifting the entire string).

But according to the formula, ans=2, which matches.

In "11000", ans=9.

Let's see:

- First '1': number of '0's after it is 3

- Second '1': number of '0's after it is 3

- Third '1': number of '0's after it is 2

- Fourth '1': number of '0's after it is 1

- Fifth '1': number of '0's after it is 0

Wait, no, in "11000", there are two '1's followed by three '0's.

So, for each '1', add the number of '0's after it:

- First '1': 3 '0's after

- Second '1': 3 '0's after

Total from '1's: 3 + 3 = 6

For each '0', if there are '1's before it, add 1:

- First '0': two '1's before

- Second '0': two '1's before

- Third '0': two '1's before

Total from '0's: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Total ans = 6 + 3 = 9, which matches the example.

So, it's sum of, for each '1', the number of '0's after it, plus, for each '0', the number of '1's before it.

But why does this give the minimal cost?

Maybe because each '1' that is before a '0' needs to be moved past that '0', and the cost is proportional to the number of positions it needs to be moved.

But in this operation, shifting a substring cyclically, it can move multiple characters at once.

I need to see how this operation can be used to move '1's past '0's efficiently.

Wait, perhaps each cyclic shift can correct multiple inversions at once, and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

So, to minimize the total cost, I need to maximize the number of inversions corrected per operation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as reversing substrings or using other string transformation techniques.

But I'm stuck on understanding why this formula gives the minimal cost.

Let me consider a smaller example.

Take "1010".

According to the formula:

s=[1,0,1,0], zeroes=2

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

- c=1: cnt=[0,1], ans += (2 -0)=2 => ans=2

- c=0: cnt=[1,1], cnt[1]=1>0, ans +=1 => ans=3

- c=1: cnt=[1,2], ans += (2 -1)=1 => ans=4

- c=0: cnt=[2,2], cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 => ans=5

So, ans=5.

But let's see what operations can be performed.

One possible sequence:

1. Shift substring [1,3]: "1010" -> "1001" (cost=3)

2. Shift substring [1,2]: "1001" -> "0011" (cost=2)

Total cost=5, which matches the formula.

Another sequence:

1. Shift substring [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101" (cost=4)

2. Shift substring [2,4]: "0101" -> "0011" (cost=3)

Total cost=7, which is higher.

So, the first sequence is better.

Hence, the minimal cost is indeed 5.

So, the formula seems to be correct.

But I still don' t understand why it works.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a '1' at position i, and there are k '0's after it.

To move this '1' past these k '0's, I need to perform k operations, each costing 2 (shifting a substring of length 2).

But according to the formula, it's adding k to the cost, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' contributes 1 to the cost, and the total cost is the sum over all such '1's and '0's.

But in the formula, for each '1', it adds the number of '0's after it, and for each '0', if there are '1's before it, it adds 1.

So, it's summing these two quantities.

But I need to see how this relates to the operations allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions, where each inversion is a '1' before a '0', and the cost is the number of positions the '1' needs to be moved past the '0's.

But in the operation, shifting a substring cyclically moves multiple characters at once.

I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps the formula is calculating the total number of such shifts needed.

But I'm still not fully understanding it.

Given that the formula matches the examples provided, and I couldn't find any counterexamples where it doesn't work, I'll assume that it's correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
