Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would make it "110". Each time I do this, there's a cost equal to the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. So, I need to figure out the sequence of shifts that will result in a sorted string with the least possible cost.

First, I need to understand what operations can achieve the sorting. Since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, I need to see how these shifts can rearrange the characters to get all '0's before '1's.

Let me think about the properties of cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift on a substring essentially rotates the substring by one position. So, if I have a substring "10", shifting it cyclically would make it "01", which swaps the two characters. That seems useful because swapping '1' and '0' can help in rearranging the string.

But, cyclic shifts are not just limited to substrings of length 2; they can be on any length. So, for a longer substring, like "1010", a cyclic shift would turn it into "0101". This seems like it could help in rearranging multiple characters at once.

Now, I need to find a way to calculate the minimum cost to achieve the desired sorted string.

Let's consider the positions where '1's and '0's should be in the final sorted string. In the sorted string, all '0's come before any '1's. So, if I have a '1' before a '0' in the original string, I need to move that '1' after the '0'.

Each cyclic shift operation can be seen as moving the last character of the substring to the front. So, if I choose a substring that includes a '1' that needs to be moved and some '0's, I can potentially move the '1' past those '0's in one operation.

But, I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings I shift each time.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider the positions of '1's and '0's. Suppose I have the string "101011". In the sorted string, it should be "001111". So, I need to move the '1's that are before any '0's to after all '0's.

One way to think about this is to count how many '1's are before each '0' in the original string, because each '1' before a '0' will need to be moved past that '0', which would require some operation that involves the substring containing that '1' and that '0'.

But, since I can perform operations on any substring and the cost is proportional to the length of the substring, I need to find a way to group these moves efficiently to minimize the total cost.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of inversions. In sorting algorithms, inversions are pairs of elements that are out of order and need to be swapped. Here, an inversion would be a '1' that appears before a '0'.

So, for each '0' that has '1's before it, I need to move those '1's past that '0'. Each such move can be done through a series of cyclic shifts, but I need to find a way to do this with minimal cost.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have a string s of length n.

I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of '1's I've seen so far. When I encounter a '0', any '1's before it need to be moved after this '0'. So, for each '0', the number of '1's before it represents how many times I need to "move" a '1' past this '0'.

But, since I can perform cyclic shifts on substrings, moving a '1' past a '0' can be done in one operation by selecting a substring that includes both the '1' and the '0', and performing a cyclic shift that effectively swaps them.

However, the cost of such an operation is the length of the substring. To minimize the total cost, I need to maximize the number of such moves in each operation, meaning selecting substrings that cover multiple '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the positions where '1's and '0's are misaligned.

Suppose I have the string "101011". The sorted version is "001111". To transform the original string into the sorted one, I need to move the '1's that are before any '0's to after all '0's.

In "101011", the first character is '1', which should be after all '0's. So, I need to move it to the end. Similarly, the third character is '1', which should also be after all '0's, but in this case, it's already after the first '0'. The fifth character is '1', which should be after all '0's, and it is. The sixth character is '1', which is also correct.

So, in this case, I need to move the first '1' past the '0's. One way to do this is to select the substring from the first '1' to the last '0' and perform a cyclic shift.

Wait, but in the example provided, they chose substring [1,3], which is "101", shifted it to "011", then [2,4], which is "110", shifted to "011", and so on. This seems a bit inefficient in terms of cost.

Maybe there's a better strategy.

Let me think differently. Since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, perhaps I can think in terms of bubble sort, where elements are swapped to put them in the correct order, and the cost is similar to the number of swaps.

But in this case, each cyclic shift can be seen as a series of swaps, moving the last character to the front.

However, that might not be directly helpful.

Another approach: since the string is binary, and I just need to sort it, maybe I can count the number of '0's and '1's and determine how many '1's need to be moved past '0's.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or something similar can be applied here.

Let me try to come up with a formula or an algorithm that can compute the minimal cost.

Let's consider that in the final sorted string, all '0's are before '1's. So, the position where the first '1' appears in the sorted string is the position after all '0's.

In the original string, if there are '1's before this position, they need to be moved to after the position where '1's start in the sorted string.

So, for each '1' that needs to be moved, I can calculate how much it costs to move it past the '0's.

But, since moving a '1' past a '0' can be done in one operation with cost equal to the length of the substring that includes both, I need to find an optimal way to group these moves.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift operation can be used to move a '1' past a '0', but the cost is the length of the substring.

To minimize the total cost, I should try to maximize the number of '1's moved past '0's in each operation.

But, since the operations are on substrings, and the cost is proportional to the substring length, I need to find a way to cover multiple shifts in one operation.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of blocks.

Let me see.

Suppose I have the string "101011".

I can visualize it as positions:

1: '1'

2: '0'

3: '1'

4: '0'

5: '1'

6: '1'

In the sorted string, it should be "001111", so '0's first, then '1's.

To achieve this, I need to move the '1's that are before any '0's to after all '0's.

In this case, the first '1' is at position 1, which needs to be after position 4.

The third '1' is at position 3, which needs to be after position 4.

The fifth and sixth '1's are already in the correct position.

So, I need to move the '1's at positions 1 and 3 to after position 4.

One way to do this is to perform operations that shift these '1's to the right past the '0's.

But, since cyclic shifts rotate the substring, it's not straightforward.

Looking back at the example in the problem, for "11000", the operations were:

1. Choose [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100"

2. Choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110"

3. Choose [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011"

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

But is there a way to do this with less cost?

If I choose the entire string "11000", which has length 5, and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01100", cost is 5.

Then, choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110", cost 3.

Then, choose [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 3 = 11, which is higher than 9.

Wait, but in the problem's note, they chose substrings [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], each with cost 3, total 9.

Is there a better sequence?

What if I choose [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "01100", cost 4.

Then, choose [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "00110", cost 4.

Then, choose [3,6]: "1101" -> "1101", but wait, the string is now "00110", and I need to make it "00011". So, perhaps choose [3,5]: "101" -> "110", which is "00110" -> "00110", no change.

This seems inefficient.

Alternatively, choose [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

Then, choose [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", resulting in "00110", cost 4.

Then, choose [3,6]: "1101" -> "1101", no change.

Again, not helpful.

It seems that the initial approach in the problem's note is better.

So, perhaps their approach is optimal.

But I need a general algorithm that can compute the minimal cost for any given string.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

Suppose I have a string of length n with k '0's and m '1's.

In the sorted string, all '0's come first, then all '1's.

So, I need to move all '1's that are before the k-th position to after the k-th position.

Each cyclic shift operation can move a '1' past some '0's, but the cost is the length of the substring.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or prefix sums can help here.

Let me try to think in terms of inversions.

In a sorted array, the number of inversions is zero. In the given string, the number of inversions is the number of pairs where a '1' appears before a '0'.

Each inversion represents a pair that is out of order and needs to be corrected.

If I can find a way to correct all inversions with minimal cost, that would solve the problem.

Each cyclic shift operation can correct some number of inversions, and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find a sequence of operations that corrects all inversions with the minimal total cost.

This seems similar to sorting algorithms, where the number of swaps or the cost of operations is minimized.

But it's specifically about cyclic shifts on substrings, which is different from standard sorting operations.

Maybe I can model this as reversing substrings, since a cyclic shift can be seen as a rotation, which is similar to reversing.

Wait, but cyclic shifts are rotations, not reversals.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I track the positions of '1's that need to be moved.

For each '1' that needs to be moved, I can calculate the cost to move it past all the '0's.

But, since operations can overlap and affect multiple '1's at once, I need to find a way to group these moves efficiently.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimal cost to sort the substring s[1..i].

Then, I can try to find a recurrence relation.

But I'm not sure how to define the transitions.

Wait, maybe dp[i] = dp[j] + cost to sort s[j+1..i], for some j < i.

But I need to find a way to compute cost to sort s[j+1..i].

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that in the final sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, the position where the first '1' appears in the sorted string is the position after the last '0'.

In the original string, if there are '1's before this position, they need to be moved.

Each such '1' needs to be moved past all the '0's that are after it.

So, for each '1' that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of '0's after it plus one (itself).

But, since operations can affect multiple '1's at once, I need to find a way to group these moves.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions, where each inversion is a pair of '1' and '0' with '1' before '0'.

But in this problem, each operation can correct multiple inversions at once, so the minimal cost might be less than the number of inversions.

In the example, the number of inversions is 3 (for "101011": the first '1' has two '0's after it, the third '1' has one '0' after it, and the fifth '1' has none, the sixth '1' has none), so total inversions are 3. But the minimal cost in the note is 5, which is more than the number of inversions.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Unless my understanding of inversions is incorrect in this context.

Maybe each inversion requires a certain cost to correct, and the cost is related to the substring length.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to look for a different pattern.

Suppose I have the string "10", which needs to be sorted to "01". The minimal cost is 2, by shifting the entire string.

But, if I think about it, shifting the entire string "10" to "01" costs 2, which is equal to the length of the string.

In general, for a string of length n, the cost to sort it by shifting the entire string is n.

But, there might be more efficient ways by shifting smaller substrings multiple times.

In the example "11000", the minimal cost is 9, which is 3 shifts of substrings of length 3.

Wait, is there a formula based on the number of '1's and '0's?

Let me try to see.

In "10", one '1' and one '0', minimal cost 2.

In "1100", two '1's and two '0's, perhaps minimal cost is 4?

Wait, but in the example "11000", which has two '1's and three '0's, the minimal cost is 9.

Wait, but in "10", one '1' and one '0', cost 2.

In "1100", let's see: sorted version is "0011".

One way is to shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "0110", cost 3.

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "0011", cost 3.

Total cost: 6.

But is there a better way?

If I shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "0011", cost 3.

Total cost: 7, which is higher than 6.

So, 6 seems better.

But according to the problem's note, for "11000", it's 9.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's times the number of '0's.

In "10", it's 1*1=1, but the minimal cost is 2, which is not equal.

In "1100", it's 2*2=4, but the minimal cost is 6, not matching.

In "11000", it's 2*3=6, but the minimal cost is 9, again not matching.

So, that doesn't seem right.

Maybe it's the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's after them.

In "10", there is one '1' with one '0' after it: 1.

But the minimal cost is 2, not matching.

In "1100", the first '1' has two '0's after it, the second '1' has one '0' after it: 2 + 1 = 3.

But the minimal cost is 6, not matching.

In "11000", the first '1' has three '0's after it, the second '1' has two '0's after it: 3 + 2 = 5.

But the minimal cost is 9, again not matching.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider that each '1' that needs to be moved past '0's requires a certain cost, and the operations can overlap in a way that reduces the total cost.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the operations differently.

Each cyclic shift on a substring can be seen as moving the last character of the substring to the front, which affects the positions of all characters in the substring.

This is similar to rotating the substring by one position.

I need to find a sequence of such rotations that will rearrange the string into the sorted order.

This seems too vague to lead to a direct algorithm.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to sort the string, I need to move all '1's that are before any '0's to after all '0's.

So, the minimal cost would be equal to the sum over all '1's that need to be moved of the number of '0's after them plus one.

Wait, but in the example, that doesn't hold.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the positions.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let s be the string of length n.

Let z be the number of '0's in s.

In the sorted string, the first z positions are '0's, and the rest are '1's.

So, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If s[i] is '1' and i <= z, then this '1' needs to be moved to some position after z.

- If s[i] is '0' and i > z, then this '0' needs to be moved to some position within the first z.

But in the problem, since we're only dealing with '0's and '1's, and we're sorting in non-descending order, only '1's before the first '0' need to be moved past all '0's.

Wait, actually, any '1' that is before the position where '1's start in the sorted string needs to be moved.

So, in the sorted string, '1's start at position z+1.

Therefore, any '1' in the original string before position z+1 needs to be moved to after position z.

So, for each '1' in positions 1 to z, I need to move it to some position from z+1 to n.

Each such move can be done via a series of cyclic shifts.

But, again, I need to find the minimal cost to do all these moves.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the positions of '0's and '1's in the sorted string and see how much it costs to transform the original string into the sorted one using cyclic shifts.

But, cyclic shifts are rotations on substrings, which makes it difficult to track the movement of individual characters.

Maybe I need to consider the string as a sequence of blocks of '0's and '1's and find a way to rearrange these blocks with minimal cost.

But, since cyclic shifts can only rotate substrings, it's not straightforward how to rearrange blocks.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach.

I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of '1's that need to be moved.

For each '0' encountered after a '1' that needs to be moved, I can consider the cost to move those '1's past this '0'.

But, I need to find a way to group these moves efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them.

In "10", there is one '1' before one '0', so cost is 1*1=1, but the minimal cost is 2, which doesn't match.

In "1100", there are two '1's before two '0's, so 2*2=4, but the minimal cost is 6, which doesn't match.

In "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's, so 2*3=6, but the minimal cost is 9, which again doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps there's a multiplier involved.

Wait, in "10", sum is 1, minimal cost is 2.

In "1100", sum is 4, minimal cost is 6.

In "11000", sum is 6, minimal cost is 9.

It seems like the minimal cost is sum + something.

In "10", sum=1, minimal cost=2, which is sum +1.

In "1100", sum=4, minimal cost=6, which is sum +2.

In "11000", sum=6, minimal cost=9, which is sum +3.

Not sure if that's a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe it's sum plus the number of '1's, or something similar.

In "10", sum=1, number of '1's=1, total=2.

In "1100", sum=4, number of '1's=2, total=6.

In "11000", sum=6, number of '1's=2, but minimal cost is 9, which doesn't match.

Hmm, not matching.

Maybe it's sum plus the number of '0's.

In "10", sum=1, number of '0's=1, total=2.

In "1100", sum=4, number of '0's=2, total=6.

In "11000", sum=6, number of '0's=3, total=9.

Ah, that matches the examples.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them, plus the number of '0's.

In other words, minimal_cost = sum_{i=1 to n} (number of '1's before i, where s[i] is '0') + number of '0's.

In "10", sum is 1, number of '0's is 1, total 2.

In "1100", sum is 2*'1's before '0' + 2*'1's before '0' = 2+2=4, number of '0's is 2, total 6.

In "11000", sum is 2+2+2=6, number of '0's is 3, total 9.

This matches the examples.

But, why is this the case?

Let's think about it.

The sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them represents the total number of inversions that need to be corrected.

Each inversion corresponds to a '1' that needs to be moved past a '0'.

Each such move can be done via a cyclic shift that includes both the '1' and the '0', with a cost equal to the length of the substring.

If I perform operations that target specific substrings to correct these inversions, the total cost would be the sum of the costs of each operation.

However, since operations can correct multiple inversions at once, the total cost might be less than the sum of individual inversion costs.

But in this case, it seems that the minimal cost is exactly the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' plus the number of '0's.

Wait, perhaps it's sum plus the number of '0's.

Wait, in "10", sum is 1, number of '0's is 1, total 2.

In "1100", sum is 4, number of '0's is 2, total 6.

In "11000", sum is 6, number of '0's is 3, total 9.

This seems consistent with the examples.

But, I need to verify if this is indeed the minimal cost.

Let me try another example.

Take "0000", which is already sorted. Sum is 0, number of '0's is 4, total 4.

But according to the problem, the minimal cost is 0, since it's already sorted.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

In "0000", sum is 0 (no '1's before any '0's), number of '0's is 4.

But minimal cost is 0, not 4.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

This suggests that the formula is not sum + number of '0's.

Wait, perhaps it's sum plus the number of '1's.

In "10", sum is 1, number of '1's is 1, total 2.

In "1100", sum is 4, number of '1's is 2, total 6.

In "11000", sum is 6, number of '1's is 2, total 8, but the minimal cost is 9 according to the example.

So, that doesn't match.

Hmm.

Maybe it's sum plus the number of operations needed to move '1's to their positions.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I count the number of '0's and '1's in the string.

Let z be the number of '0's, o be the number of '1's.

In the sorted string, the first z positions are '0's, and the last o positions are '1's.

I need to move all '1's that are in the first z positions to the last o positions.

Each such move can be done via a series of cyclic shifts.

The cost of moving one '1' from position i (where i <= z) to position j (where j > z), is equal to the length of the substring that includes both positions.

But, since cyclic shifts can affect multiple characters at once, I need to find a way to group these moves to minimize the total cost.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift on a substring of length l costs l, and it can be used to move one '1' past one '0' within that substring.

So, the cost per inversion corrected is l.

But, if I can correct multiple inversions in one shift, the cost per inversion decreases.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should try to correct as many inversions as possible in each shift.

But, since l is the length of the substring, and the number of inversions corrected in one shift is dependent on the number of '1's and '0's in the substring, it's still not clear.

This seems too complex for a programming problem.

Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to sort the string is equal to the number of positions that are incorrectly placed multiplied by the average substring length needed to correct them.

But, I don't know how to quantify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '1's that need to be moved of the number of '0's they need to pass, plus the cost to move them.

But, again, this seems too vague.

I need to find a formula or an algorithm that can compute the minimal cost efficiently, considering the constraints.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking back at the initial approach, perhaps the provided code is correct, and I just need to understand it.

Let's look at the provided code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

s = list(map(int, input().strip()))

zeroes = s.count(0)

cnt = [0, 0]

ans = 0

for c in s:

cnt[c] += 1

if c == 0:

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0

else:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

print(ans)

So, for each test case:

- Read the string and convert it to a list of integers.

- Count the number of '0's in the string.

- Initialize a counter cnt for '0's and '1's, starting at 0.

- Initialize ans to 0.

- Iterate through each character in the string:

- Increment the count for that character.

- If the character is '0', and there are '1's before it (cnt[1] > 0), add 1 to ans.

- If the character is '1', add the number of '0's not yet seen (zeroes - cnt[0]) to ans.

- Print the final ans.

So, for each '0', if there are any '1's before it, add 1 to the answer.

For each '1', add the number of '0's that come after it to the answer.

In the end, sum these up.

Let's see how this works with the example "101011".

s = [1,0,1,0,1,1]

zeroes = 2

cnt = [0,0]

ans = 0

Iterate through s:

c=1: cnt=[0,1]; c=1, ans += 2 - 0 = 2 → ans=2

c=0: cnt=[1,1]; c=0, cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 → ans=3

c=1: cnt=[1,2]; c=1, ans += 2 -1 =1 → ans=4

c=0: cnt=[2,2]; c=0, cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 → ans=5

c=1: cnt=[2,3]; c=1, ans += 2 -2 =0 → ans=5

c=1: cnt=[2,4]; c=1, ans += 2 -2 =0 → ans=5

Total ans=5, which matches the example's minimal cost.

Another example, "11000":

s=[1,1,0,0,0]

zeroes=3

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

c=1: cnt=[0,1]; c=1, ans +=3-0=3 → ans=3

c=1: cnt=[0,2]; c=1, ans +=3-0=3 → ans=6

c=0: cnt=[1,2]; c=0, cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 → ans=7

c=0: cnt=[2,2]; c=0, cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 → ans=8

c=0: cnt=[3,2]; c=0, cnt[1]>0, ans +=1 → ans=9

Total ans=9, which matches the example.

One more example, "0000":

s=[0,0,0,0]

zeroes=4

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

c=0: cnt=[1,0]; c=0, cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 → ans=0

c=0: cnt=[2,0]; c=0, cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 → ans=0

c=0: cnt=[3,0]; c=0, cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 → ans=0

c=0: cnt=[4,0]; c=0, cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 → ans=0

Total ans=0, which is correct.

Another example, "01101001":

s=[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]

zeroes=4

cnt=[0,0]

ans=0

c=0: cnt=[1,0]; c=0, cnt[1]=0, ans +=0 → ans=0

c=1: cnt=[1,1]; c=1, ans +=4-1=3 → ans=3

c=1: cnt=[1,2]; c=1, ans +=4-1=3 → ans=6

c=0: cnt=[2,2]; c=0, cnt[1]=2>0, ans +=1 → ans=7

c=1: cnt=[2,3]; c=1, ans +=4-2=2 → ans=9

c=0: cnt=[3,3]; c=0, cnt[1]=3>0, ans +=1 → ans=10

c=0: cnt=[4,3]; c=0, cnt[1]=3>0, ans +=1 → ans=11

c=1: cnt=[4,4]; c=1, ans +=4-4=0 → ans=11

Total ans=11, which matches the example.

So, in all these cases, the provided code gives the correct minimal cost.

Therefore, the provided code is correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
