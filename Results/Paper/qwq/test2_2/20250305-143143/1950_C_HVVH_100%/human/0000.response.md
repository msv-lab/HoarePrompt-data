Alright, I've got this problem to solve. The task is to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a time in "hh:mm" format, and I need to output the equivalent time in 12-hour format, including "AM" or "PM" accordingly.

First, I need to understand the difference between 24-hour and 12-hour formats. In 24-hour format, the hours range from 00 to 23, and minutes from 00 to 59. In 12-hour format, the hours range from 1 to 12, and we use "AM" for the first half of the day (midnight to noon) and "PM" for the second half (noon to midnight).

So, my goal is to take the hour part from the 24-hour format and adjust it to fit into the 12-hour format, along with appending the correct meridiem, "AM" or "PM".

Looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    day = 'AM'

    n = int(input())

    for _ in range(n):

        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))

        if h == 0:

            h = 12

            day = 'AM'

        elif h > 12:

            h = h - 12

            day = 'PM'

        else:

            day = 'AM'

            if h == 12:

                day = 'PM'

        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

```

I need to verify if this function correctly converts 24-hour times to 12-hour format for all possible cases.

Let me think step by step.

1. **Input Handling:**

- The function reads an integer `n`, which is the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it reads a string in "hh:mm" format, splits it into hour `h` and minutes `m`, both as integers.

This seems correct.

2. **Hour Conversion:**

- If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and sets `day` to 'AM'. This makes sense because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM.

- If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. For example, 13:00 becomes 1:00 PM.

- If `h` is 12 or less but not 0, it sets `day` to 'AM', unless `h` is 12, in which case it sets `day` to 'PM'. So, 12:00 is PM, and anything from 1:00 to 11:59 is AM.

This logic seems accurate.

3. **Output Formatting:**

- It prints the hour and minute formatted to always have two digits, followed by a space and the meridiem ('AM' or 'PM').

The formatting using f-strings with `{h:02d}` and `{m:02d}` ensures that leading zeros are included, which matches the required output format.

Let me consider some edge cases to confirm:

- **00:00** should be **12:00 AM**

- **12:00** should be **12:00 PM**

- **24:00** (which is the same as 00:00) would be **12:00 AM**. But since the problem states that the input is always a valid 24-hour time, and 24:00 is not a valid time, I don't need to handle it separately.

- **23:59** should be **11:59 PM**

- **13:45** should be **1:45 PM**

- **01:00** should be **01:00 AM**

- **11:59** should be **11:59 AM**

- **12:01** should be **12:01 PM**

Looking back at the code, I see that the variable `day` is initialized to 'AM' at the beginning. However, within the loop, it gets updated based on the hour `h`.

I need to ensure that `day` is reset appropriately for each test case.

Wait, actually, in the code, `day` is set inside the loop based on the conditions, so it should be correctly updated for each time input.

Let me walk through an example:

Take **18:06**.

- `h = 18`, `m = 06`

- Since `h > 12`, set `h = 18 - 12 = 6` and `day = 'PM'`

- Output: **06:06 PM**

Which matches the expected output.

Another example: **00:59**

- `h = 0`, `m = 59`

- Set `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'`

- Output: **12:59 AM**

Correct.

Edge case: **12:00**

- `h = 12`, `m = 00`

- Falls into the else clause, sets `day = 'AM'`, then checks if `h == 12` and sets `day = 'PM'`

- Output: **12:00 PM**

Correct.

Another edge case: **01:01**

- `h = 1`, `m = 1`

- Falls into else clause, sets `day = 'AM'`

- Output: **01:01 AM**

Correct.

Seems like the logic covers all cases appropriately.

Also, the formatting with `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that hours and minutes are always two digits, with leading zeros if necessary.

For example, if `h = 1` and `m = 1`, it prints **01:01 AM**, which is correct.

I don't see any flaws in the logic or implementation. The code appears to handle all scenarios correctly based on the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
