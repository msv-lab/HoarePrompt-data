Alright, I've got this problem to solve. The task is to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a time in "hh:mm" format, and I need to output the equivalent time in 12-hour format, including "AM" or "PM".

First, I need to understand the difference between 24-hour and 12-hour formats. In 24-hour format, the hours range from 00 to 23, and minutes from 00 to 59. In 12-hour format, the hours range from 1 to 12, and we use "AM" for the first half of the day (midnight to noon) and "PM" for the second half (noon to midnight).

So, for example, 09:41 in 24-hour format should be 09:41 AM in 12-hour format, and 18:06 should be 06:06 PM.

Looking at the program provided:

```python

def func():

    day = 'AM'

    n = int(input())

    for _ in range(n):

        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))

        if h == 0:

            h = 12

            day = 'AM'

        elif h > 12:

            h = h - 12

            day = 'PM'

        else:

            day = 'AM'

            if h == 12:

                day = 'PM'

        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

```

I need to verify if this function correctly converts the given 24-hour times to 12-hour format.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initialization:**

   - `day = 'AM'`: This sets the initial period to 'AM'.

   - `n = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.

2. **Loop through each test case:**

   - `(h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))`: This reads the hour and minute for each time.

3. **Conversion logic:**

   - If `h == 0`:

     - Set `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'`.

   - Elif `h > 12`:

     - Set `h = h - 12` and `day = 'PM'`.

   - Else:

     - Set `day = 'AM'`.

     - If `h == 12`, set `day = 'PM'`.

4. **Output:**

   - Print the formatted time in 12-hour format with the appropriate period.

Now, let's test this logic with some examples to see if it works correctly.

**Test Case 1:**

- Input: 09:41

- Expected Output: 09:41 AM

- According to the code:

  - h = 9

  - Since h <= 12 and h != 12, day = 'AM'

  - Output: 09:41 AM

- Correct.

**Test Case 2:**

- Input: 18:06

- Expected Output: 06:06 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 18

  - Since h > 12, set h = 18 - 12 = 6 and day = 'PM'

  - Output: 06:06 PM

- Correct.

**Test Case 3:**

- Input: 12:14

- Expected Output: 12:14 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 12

  - Since h <= 12 and h == 12, set day = 'PM'

  - Output: 12:14 PM

- Correct.

**Test Case 4:**

- Input: 00:59

- Expected Output: 12:59 AM

- According to the code:

  - h = 0

  - Set h = 12 and day = 'AM'

  - Output: 12:59 AM

- Correct.

**Test Case 5:**

- Input: 00:00

- Expected Output: 12:00 AM

- According to the code:

  - h = 0

  - Set h = 12 and day = 'AM'

  - Output: 12:00 AM

- Correct.

**Test Case 6:**

- Input: 14:34

- Expected Output: 02:34 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 14

  - Since h > 12, set h = 14 - 12 = 2 and day = 'PM'

  - Output: 02:34 PM

- Correct.

**Test Case 7:**

- Input: 01:01

- Expected Output: 01:01 AM

- According to the code:

  - h = 1

  - Since h <= 12 and h != 12, set day = 'AM'

  - Output: 01:01 AM

- Correct.

**Test Case 8:**

- Input: 19:07

- Expected Output: 07:07 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 19

  - Since h > 12, set h = 19 - 12 = 7 and day = 'PM'

  - Output: 07:07 PM

- Correct.

**Test Case 9:**

- Input: 11:59

- Expected Output: 11:59 AM

- According to the code:

  - h = 11

  - Since h <= 12 and h != 12, set day = 'AM'

  - Output: 11:59 AM

- Correct.

**Test Case 10:**

- Input: 12:00

- Expected Output: 12:00 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 12

  - Since h <= 12 and h == 12, set day = 'PM'

  - Output: 12:00 PM

- Correct.

**Test Case 11:**

- Input: 21:37

- Expected Output: 09:37 PM

- According to the code:

  - h = 21

  - Since h > 12, set h = 21 - 12 = 9 and day = 'PM'

  - Output: 09:37 PM

- Correct.

All the test cases seem to be handled correctly by the provided code. The logic appears to be sound, and it correctly identifies whether the time should be 'AM' or 'PM', and adjusts the hour accordingly for times greater than 12.

Additionally, the code uses string formatting to ensure that hours and minutes are always two digits, which matches the expected output format.

I don't see any issues with this code based on the provided problem description and examples. Therefore, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
