Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Bernard is always late when visiting Rudolf because he has to cross a river on a ferry. Rudolf decides to help by building bridges across the river to save time. The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell has a depth value a_{i,j}. The depths on the first and last columns are always 0 because those are the banks.

Rudolf can build a bridge on any row, but he has to place supports for the bridge. The rules are:

1. A support must be placed at the first and last columns of the chosen row.

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.

The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

Moreover, Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows and minimize the total cost of supports for these k bridges.

Given multiple test cases, I need to find the minimum total cost for each case.

First, I need to understand how to calculate the cost for a single bridge on a single row. Then, since bridges are built on consecutive rows, I need to choose a sequence of k consecutive rows where the sum of the individual bridge costs is minimized.

Let's focus on a single row first. Given a row with m columns, where a_{i,1} and a_{i,m} are 0, and I need to place supports at columns 1 and m, with additional supports possibly placed in between such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

The goal is to place the minimum number of supports while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d, and calculate the total cost accordingly.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. I need to find the minimal cost to place supports in a row such that all supports are at most d columns apart, and supports are mandatory at the first and last columns.

Let me think about how to model this.

Letâ€™s define dp[j] as the minimal cost to build a bridge from column 1 to column j, inclusive, following the rules.

Base case:

- dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1, since a support must be placed at column 1.

For j from 2 to m:

- dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1) for all k from max(1, j - d) to j - 1, because the last support before j must be at least d columns away, but not further than d columns back.

Wait, actually, the distance between adjacent supports should be at most d, meaning that the gap between two supports is at most d - 1 columns without supports in between.

So, for column j, the previous support can be at column k, where j - k - 1 <= d - 1, which simplifies to j - k <= d.

Therefore, k >= j - d.

But since supports must be placed at column 1 and column m, and m is always the last column, we need to ensure that dp[m] gives us the minimal cost for the entire row.

Wait, but in the problem, a_{i,1} and a_{i,m} are always 0, and supports must be placed at these columns.

So, in dp[j], if j is m, then dp[m] should include the support at column m, which costs a_{i,m} + 1 = 1, since a_{i,m} = 0.

But we also need to ensure that there's a support at column 1, which costs a_{i,1} + 1 = 1.

So, perhaps dp[j] represents the minimal cost to build a bridge from column 1 to column j, including supports at both columns.

Wait, but in the dp transition, when we go from k to j, we're adding a support at j, which costs a_{i,j} + 1.

But if j is m, then we're adding the support at m, which is required.

Similarly, at column 1, we have dp[1] = 1, since a_{i,1} = 0.

For columns in between, we need to place supports such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

Wait, but the distance between supports is defined as |j1 - j2| - 1.

So, if two supports are at columns j1 and j2, the distance between them is |j1 - j2| - 1.

The condition is that this distance should not exceed d - 1, meaning |j1 - j2| - 1 <= d - 1, which simplifies to |j1 - j2| <= d.

Therefore, in the dp transition, when moving from k to j, we need to ensure that j - k <= d.

Wait, but j - k - 1 <= d - 1 is equivalent to j - k <= d.

So, in dp[j], we can take the minimum over dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1 for all k where k <= j - 1 and j - k <= d.

In other words, k >= j - d.

But k must also be at least 1.

Therefore, k ranges from max(1, j - d) to j - 1.

Then, dp[j] = min over k in [max(1, j - d), j - 1] of dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1.

And dp[1] = 1.

Finally, the cost for the row is dp[m].

Wait, but in the code provided, there's a function func_1(row, d) that seems to implement this dp.

Let me look at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

Hmm, this looks similar to what I described.

But let's verify.

First loop:

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

What's the purpose of this? In dp terms, it's setting dp[j] = a_{i,j} + 1 for j from 0 to d-1.

But according to the dp transition, for j from 2 to m, dp[j] should be min over k from max(1, j - d) to j - 1 of dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1.

Wait, but in the code, for i in range(0, d - 1), it sets row[i] = row[i] + 1.

Is this correct?

Wait, perhaps the indexing is off.

In Python, list indices start from 0, so row[0] corresponds to column 1, row[m-1] corresponds to column m.

Given that a_{i,1} and a_{i,m} are 0.

So, row[0] = 0, row[m-1] = 0.

In dp terms, dp[0] should be 1, since support is mandatory at column 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's setting row[i] = row[i] + 1 for i from 0 to d-1.

If d - 1 >= m - 1, this might overwrite the last element, which is not desired.

Wait, no, if d - 1 < m - 1, then the second loop will handle i from d - 1 to m - 1.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to rewrite the dp in a clearer way.

Define dp[j] as the minimal cost to build a bridge from column 1 to column j, inclusive, with supports at column 1 and column j.

Then:

- dp[0] = 1, since a_{i,1} = 0, and support costs 1.

- For j from 1 to m - 1:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a_{i,j+1} + 1 for k in range(max(0, j - d + 1), j))

Wait, adjusting for 0-based indexing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use 1-based indexing for clarity.

Let me redefine dp[j] as the minimal cost to build a bridge from column 1 to column j, inclusive, with supports at column 1 and column j.

Then:

- dp[1] = 1

- For j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1 for k in range(max(1, j - d), j))

In code, with 0-based indexing:

dp[0] = 1

for j in range(1, m):

start = max(0, j - d)

dp[j] = min(dp[start:j]) + a_{i,j} + 1

Finally, the cost for the row is dp[m - 1]

Now, looking back at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

This seems slightly different.

In the first loop, for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

This sets row[0] to 1 (since row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1), which is correct for dp[0] = 1.

For i from 1 to d - 2 (assuming d >= 2), it sets row[i] = row[i] + 1.

But according to the dp, dp[j] for j from 2 to m should consider the minimum over dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1 for k in range(max(1, j - d), j).

In the code, for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

Wait, i - (d + 1):i means looking back d + 1 columns, but in the dp, we should look back d columns.

Wait, in dp[j], k ranges from max(0, j - d) to j - 1.

In 0-based indexing, for j from 1 to m - 1:

start = max(0, j - d)

dp[j] = min(dp[start:j]) + a_{i,j} + 1

So, in the code, it should be min(row[max(0, j - d):j])

But in the code, it's min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)) : i])

Which is equivalent to looking back d + 1 columns, which is incorrect.

It should be looking back d columns.

Wait, perhaps it's an off-by-one error.

Let me check with an example.

Take the first test case:

3 11 1 4

Rows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

k = 1, so we just need to choose one row with the minimal cost.

Let's compute the cost for the first row:

m = 11, d = 4

Compute dp[j] for j from 0 to 10.

dp[0] = 1

For j = 1 to 10:

j=1: max(0,1-4)=0, so min(row[0:1]) = 1, dp[1] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

j=2: max(0,2-4)=0, min(row[0:2]) = 1, dp[2] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=3: max(0,3-4)=0, min(row[0:3]) = 1, dp[3] = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

j=4: max(0,4-4)=0, min(row[0:4]) = 1, dp[4] = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

j=5: max(0,5-4)=1, min(row[1:5]) = min(2,3,4,5) = 2, dp[5] = 2 + 5 + 1 = 8

j=6: max(0,6-4)=2, min(row[2:6]) = min(3,4,5,4) = 3, dp[6] = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8

j=7: max(0,7-4)=3, min(row[3:7]) = min(4,5,4,3) = 3, dp[7] = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

j=8: max(0,8-4)=4, min(row[4:8]) = min(5,4,3,2) = 2, dp[8] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5

j=9: max(0,9-4)=5, min(row[5:9]) = min(4,3,2,1) = 1, dp[9] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

j=10: max(0,10-4)=6, min(row[6:10]) = min(3,2,1,2) = 1, dp[10] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

So, dp[10] = 2

Wait, but according to the code:

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

d - 1 = 3, so i from 0 to 2:

row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1

row[1] = 1 + 1 = 2

row[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

Then, for i in range(3, 11):

row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - 5):i]) + row[i] + 1

Wait, i - (d + 1) = i - 5

So, for i=3:

row[3] = min(row[-2:3]) = min(row[0:3]) = min(1,2,3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

j=4:

row[4] = min(row[-1:4]) = min(2,3,4) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7

j=5:

row[5] = min(row[0:5]) = min(1,2,3,4,5) = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7

j=6:

row[6] = min(row[1:6]) = min(2,3,4,5,4) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7

j=7:

row[7] = min(row[2:7]) = min(3,4,5,4,3) = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

j=8:

row[8] = min(row[3:8]) = min(5,4,3,2,1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=9:

row[9] = min(row[4:9]) = min(4,3,2,1,2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

j=10:

row[10] = min(row[5:10]) = min(3,2,1,2,0) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

So, according to the code, row[10] = 1

But according to the dp I calculated earlier, dp[10] = 2

Wait, which one is correct?

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, the minimal total cost is 4, which corresponds to the second row.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the second row.

Second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

Compute dp[j] for j from 0 to 10.

dp[0] = 1

j=1: min(row[0:1])=1, dp[1]=1+0+1=2

j=2: min(row[0:2])=1, dp[2]=1+2+1=4

j=3: min(row[0:3])=1, dp[3]=1+3+1=5

j=4: min(row[0:4])=1, dp[4]=1+2+1=4

j=5: min(row[1:5])=min(2,3,2,1)=1, dp[5]=1+1+1=3

j=6: min(row[2:6])=min(3,2,1,2)=1, dp[6]=1+2+1=4

j=7: min(row[3:7])=min(2,1,2,3)=1, dp[7]=1+3+1=5

j=8: min(row[4:8])=min(1,2,3,3)=1, dp[8]=1+3+1=5

j=9: min(row[5:9])=min(1,2,3,2)=1, dp[9]=1+2+1=4

j=10: min(row[6:10])=min(2,3,2,0)=0, dp[10]=0+0+1=1

So, dp[10]=1

But according to the example, the minimal total cost is 4, which seems to correspond to the second row's cost being 4.

Wait, but according to the dp calculation, dp[10]=1, but the example output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, the output for the first test case is 4, which corresponds to building the bridge on the second row.

But according to the dp calculation above, dp[10]=1, which contradicts the example.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dp calculation.

Let me recalculate for the second row:

Row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

dp[0] = 1 (support at column 1)

j=1: min(dp[0:1]) = 1, dp[1] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

j=2: min(dp[0:2]) = 1, dp[2] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=3: min(dp[0:3]) = 1, dp[3] = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

j=4: min(dp[0:4]) = 1, dp[4] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=5: min(dp[1:5]) = min(2,4,5,4)=2, dp[5] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

j=6: min(dp[2:6]) = min(4,5,4,4)=4, dp[6] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

j=7: min(dp[3:7]) = min(5,4,4,7)=4, dp[7] = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

j=8: min(dp[4:8]) = min(4,4,7,8)=4, dp[8] = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

j=9: min(dp[5:9]) = min(4,7,8,8)=4, dp[9] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

j=10: min(dp[6:10]) = min(7,8,8,7)=7, dp[10] = 7 + 0 + 1 = 8

Wait, now dp[10]=8, but according to the example, the minimal total cost is 4.

Wait, what's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that supports can be placed at columns between 1 and m, but they are not mandatory unless at the banks.

Wait, but according to the problem, supports must be placed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.

So, in the dp approach, I need to ensure that supports are placed at both ends and that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

In the dp calculation above, it seems I'm only considering the minimal cost path, but perhaps I'm missing some constraints.

Wait, maybe the dp approach is not correctly capturing the adjacency constraints.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I need to place supports at columns 1 and m, and possibly at some columns in between, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

The cost is the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for each support placed at column j.

This sounds like selecting a subset of columns from 1 to m, inclusive, with the following properties:

- Column 1 and m are always selected.

- For any two consecutive selected columns, their indices differ by at most d.

- Minimize the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for all selected columns j.

This is similar to selecting a path through the columns with step sizes up to d, starting at 1 and ending at m, and minimizing the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for the selected columns.

In this context, the dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach column j from column 1, with supports placed at column 1 and j, and possibly at some columns in between, following the adjacency constraints.

Given that, perhaps my earlier dp approach is correct, and the discrepancy lies in misinterpreting the example.

Looking back at the first test case, the minimal total cost is 4, which corresponds to building the bridge on the second row.

According to my dp calculation for the second row, dp[10]=8, which doesn't match the example's output of 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dp calculation.

Let me recalculate dp[j] for the second row step by step.

Row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

dp[0] = 1 (support at column 1)

j=1: min(dp[0:1]) = 1, dp[1] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

j=2: min(dp[0:2]) = 1, dp[2] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=3: min(dp[0:3]) = 1, dp[3] = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

j=4: min(dp[0:4]) = 1, dp[4] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

j=5: min(dp[1:5]) = min(2,4,5,4)=2, dp[5] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

j=6: min(dp[2:6]) = min(4,5,4,4)=4, dp[6] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

j=7: min(dp[3:7]) = min(5,4,4,7)=4, dp[7] = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

j=8: min(dp[4:8]) = min(4,4,7,8)=4, dp[8] = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

j=9: min(dp[5:9]) = min(4,7,8,8)=4, dp[9] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

j=10: min(dp[6:10]) = min(7,8,8,7)=7, dp[10] = 7 + 0 + 1 = 8

So, dp[10]=8, but according to the example, the minimal total cost is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that supports can be placed only at specific columns to minimize the cost, not necessarily at every column in between.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the dp to only place supports where necessary.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns and decide whether to place a support at each column or not, given that supports must be at columns 1 and m, and the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

This sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem where dp[j] represents the minimal cost to build the bridge up to column j, with supports placed appropriately.

In this case, dp[j] can be calculated based on the previous columns where supports were placed, ensuring that the distance to the current support is at most d.

In code, this would involve, for each j from 1 to m:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] + cost of placing a support at j) for all k where j - k <= d.

Wait, but in the earlier dp approach, I was adding a support at j every time, which might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that supports are only placed at certain columns, and not at every column.

In that case, the dp should account for whether a support is placed at j or not.

This seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as finding a path from column 1 to column m, where each step is of size at most d, and the cost is the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for each step.

But in this model, each step corresponds to placing a support at j.

Wait, perhaps that's what the dp is doing.

In that case, dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach j from 1, placing supports at 1 and j, and possibly at other columns in between, with step sizes up to d.

Given that, dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1) for all k where j - k <= d.

This seems correct.

So, in the second row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = dp[0] + a[1] + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

dp[2] = min(dp[0], dp[1]) + a[2] + 1 = min(1,2) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[3] = min(dp[0], dp[1], dp[2}) + a[3] + 1 = min(1,2,4) + 3 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

dp[4] = min(dp[1], dp[2], dp[3}) + a[4] + 1 = min(2,4,5) + 2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5

dp[5] = min(dp[2], dp[3], dp[4}) + a[5] + 1 = min(4,5,5) + 1 + 1 = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

dp[6] = min(dp[3], dp[4], dp[5}) + a[6] + 1 = min(5,5,6) + 2 + 1 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8

dp[7] = min(dp[4], dp[5], dp[6}) + a[7] + 1 = min(5,6,8) + 3 + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

dp[8] = min(dp[5], dp[6], dp[7}) + a[8] + 1 = min(6,8,9) + 3 + 1 = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10

dp[9] = min(dp[6], dp[7], dp[8}) + a[9] + 1 = min(8,9,10) + 2 + 1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11

dp[10] = min(dp[7], dp[8], dp[9}) + a[10] + 1 = min(9,10,11) + 0 + 1 = 9 + 0 + 1 = 10

Wait, now dp[10]=10, which is different from both my previous calculations and the example's output of 4.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the support is placed at column m, regardless of the previous supports.

In other words, dp[j] includes the cost of placing a support at j.

So, dp[m - 1] would include the cost of placing a support at m.

But in the example, the minimal total cost is 4, which is less than the dp[10]=10 I just calculated.

Something's wrong here.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Build just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n - k + 1) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1, â€¦, i + k - 1. Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing supports."

Wait, in the first test case, n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4

So, k=1, meaning Rudolf builds only one bridge on one row, and we need to choose which row to build on to minimize the cost.

The example output is 4, which corresponds to building the bridge on the second row.

So, the minimal cost for the second row should be 4.

But according to my dp calculation, dp[10]=10, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the dp calculation.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should not include the cost of placing a support at j every time.

Wait, no, according to the problem, supports must be placed at the first and last columns, and possibly at some columns in between, with the distance constraint.

Each time we place a support at j, we pay a cost of a_{i,j} + 1.

So, in dp[j], we are considering placing a support at j, and connecting it to the previous support at some k where j - k <= d.

Therefore, dp[j] includes the cost of placing a support at j.

Given that, dp[m - 1] should include the cost of placing a support at m.

In the second row, to achieve a total cost of 4, perhaps supports are placed only at columns 1 and m.

Let's check if that's possible.

In the second row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

If supports are placed at columns 1 and 11, the distance is 11 - 1 - 1 = 9, which is greater than d=4.

So, this violates the distance constraint.

Hence, we need to place additional supports in between.

Let's see:

If we place supports at columns 1, 5, and 11.

Distance between 1 and 5 is 3, which is <=4.

Distance between 5 and 11 is 5, which is >4. Not allowed.

So, need to place another support between 5 and 11.

For example, place supports at columns 1, 5, 9, and 11.

Distances: 4, 4, 2 <=4.

Total cost: supports at columns 1,5,9,11.

Costs: a[1]+1=1, a[5]+1=1+1=2, a[9]+1=2+1=3, a[11]+1=0+1=1.

Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7, which is still higher than the example's 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a better selection.

Let's try placing supports at columns 1,6,11.

Distances: 5-1-1=3 <=4, 11-6-1=4 <=4.

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[6]+1=2+1=3, a[11]+1=1.

Total: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, which is better but still not 4.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,7,11.

Distances: 7-1-1=5 >4. Not allowed.

Not good.

Wait, perhaps supports at columns 1,4,7,11.

Distances: 3,3,3 <=4.

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[4]+1=2+1=3, a[7]+1=3+1=4, a[11]+1=1.

Total: 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 9.

Worse than before.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,5,9,11.

As before, total cost 7.

Is there a way to achieve a total cost of 4?

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[3]+1=3+1=4, a[5]+1=1+1=2, a[7]+1=3+1=4, a[9]+1=2+1=3, a[11]+1=1.

Total: 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 15. Worse.

Wait, perhaps supports at columns 1,2,5,9,11.

Distances: 1,3,4,2 <=4.

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[2]+1=1+1=2, a[5]+1=1+1=2, a[9]+1=2+1=3, a[11]+1=1.

Total: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a better combination.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,5,11.

But earlier, that was invalid because 11-5-1=5>4.

Alternatively, supports at columns 1,6,11.

Distances: 5 and 5, which is 4 allowed.

Wait, 5-1=4, which is <=4.

11-6=5, which is <=4.

Wait, 11-6-1=4 <=4.

So, it's allowed.

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[6]+1=2+1=3, a[11]+1=1.

Total: 1 + 3 + 1 =5.

Still not 4.

Is there a way to get total cost 4?

This is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is indeed 4, achieved by a different selection.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,5,11.

As before, total cost 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a_{i,j} can be zero, but in this row, a_{i,1}=0, a_{i,6}=2, a_{i,11}=0.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,6,11.

Total cost: 1 + 3 +1=5.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a_{i,j} can be zero at multiple places.

Wait, in the second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

Is there a way to place supports to get total cost 4?

Wait, supports at columns 1,5,9,11.

Cost: 1 + 2 + 2 +1=6.

Better than before.

Wait, supports at columns 1,4,7,10,11.

Distances: 3,3,3,1 <=4.

Cost: 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 +1=10.

Worse.

Wait, perhaps supports at columns 1,3,5,7,9,11.

Cost:1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 +1=13.

Worse.

Wait, maybe supports at columns 1,2,5,9,11.

Cost:1 + 2 + 2 + 3 +1=9.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Maybe the minimal cost is achieved by placing supports only at columns where a_{i,j} is minimal.

But in this row, a_{i,j} is 0 at columns 1,6,11.

Wait, a_{i,6}=1, not 0.

Wait, a_{i,1}=0, a_{i,6}=1, a_{i,11}=0.

So, supports at columns 1,6,11.

Total cost:1 + 2 +1=4.

Ah, there it is.

So, supports at columns 1,6,11.

Distances: 5-1-1=3 <=4, 11-6-1=4 <=4.

Total cost: a[1]+1=1, a[6]+1=2, a[11]+1=1.

Total:1 + 2 +1=4.

That matches the example's output.

So, in my earlier dp calculations, I was not correctly accounting for the minimal cost path that includes placing supports at specific columns to minimize the total cost.

Therefore, perhaps the dp implementation in func_1 is incorrect.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

In the second loop, row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1

But according to the correct dp transition, it should be min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1

Because k should be from i - d to i - 1.

In the code, it's i - (d + 1) to i -1, which is one step further back.

That might be the error.

For example, with d=4, it's looking back d+1=5 steps, but should look back d=4 steps.

This could explain why in the earlier calculation, dp[10]=8, which is higher than the actual minimal cost of 4.

If I adjust the code to look back d steps instead of d+1 steps, it should work correctly.

So, the corrected func_1 should be:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

Let me recalculate dp[j] for the second row with d=4.

Row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

Initialize dp[j] = row[j]

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

So, row[0] = 0 +1=1

row[1] =1 +1=2

row[2] =2 +1=3

Now, for i in range(3,11):

row[i] = min(row[max(0, i -4):i]) + row[i] +1

i=3:

row[3] = min(row[-1:3]) = min(row[0:3])=min(1,2,3)=1 +3 +1=5

i=4:

row[4] = min(row[0:4])=min(1,2,3,5)=1 +2 +1=4

i=5:

row[
