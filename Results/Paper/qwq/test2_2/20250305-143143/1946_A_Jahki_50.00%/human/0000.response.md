Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase its median. An operation is defined as choosing an element in the array and increasing it by 1.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle element in a sorted version of the array. For an array of length n, the median is at position ceil(n/2) when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, if n is 5, the median is at position 3 (since ceil(5/2) is 3). If n is 4, the median is at position 2 (ceil(4/2) is 2).

My goal is to increase the median value by performing the least number of operations. An operation allows me to pick any element and increment it by 1.

I need to think about how increasing elements affects the median.

Let me consider a simple example:

Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The median is 2. If I want to increase the median to 3, I don't need to do anything because the median is already 2, and I can't make it larger than the largest element by only increasing elements.

Wait, no, that's not right. If I increase the smallest element, say 1 to 2, the array becomes [2, 2, 3], and the median is still 2. If I increase the middle element to 3, the array becomes [1, 3, 3], and the median is 3. That seems to directly increase the median.

So, in this case, one operation is enough.

Another example: [1, 2, 2, 2]. n=4, ceil(4/2)=2. The median is the second element in the sorted array, which is 2. To increase the median, I need to make it greater than 2, say 3.

If I increase one of the 2's to 3, the array becomes [1,2,2,3]. Sorted: [1,2,2,3]. Median is still 2.

If I increase two 2's to 3, the array becomes [1,2,3,3]. Sorted: [1,2,3,3]. Median is now 2.5, but since we're dealing with integers, perhaps I need to consider the floor or ceiling.

Wait, the problem defines the median as the element at position ceil(n/2) in the sorted array.

So, for n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, so the median is the second element.

In [1,2,2,3], the second element is 2.

To make the median 3, I need to make sure that the second element in the sorted array is 3.

So, I need to set at least the second element to 3.

In [1,3,2,3], sorted is [1,2,3,3], second element is 2, which is less than 3.

Wait, I need to make sure that after operations, the element at position ceil(n/2) is as large as possible.

I think I need to focus on the elements from position ceil(n/2) to the end and make sure they are as large as possible.

But the problem is to find the minimum operations to increase the median.

Wait, to increase the median, I need to make the median larger than its current value.

So, in the example above, the current median is 2, and I need to make it at least 3.

To do that, I need to make sure that the element at position 2 in the sorted array is at least 3.

To achieve that, I can increase the element at position 2 to 3.

But in the sorted array, if I increase an element, it might shift positions.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I should sort the array first and then focus on the median element.

Let me think about that.

Suppose I sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Then, the median is at position m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

To increase the median, I need to make sure that the element at position m is larger than its current value.

The minimal value I can set for the median is its current value +1.

So, the number of operations needed is the difference between the desired value and the current value of the median element.

Wait, but if I increase the median element directly, that would be the minimal number of operations.

But perhaps there is a smarter way by increasing other elements.

Wait, no. Since I can choose any element to increase, including the median itself, increasing the median directly would be the most efficient way.

So, in that case, the minimal number of operations is the number needed to increase the median to the next integer value.

But wait, the problem allows me to choose any element to increase, not necessarily the median.

So, maybe I can increase other elements to make the median increase indirectly.

But that seems more complicated and likely would require more operations.

So, directly increasing the median element seems optimal.

Let me consider an example.

Take [1,2,3]. n=3, m=1 (ceil(3/2)=2, index 1).

Median is 2. To increase it to 3, I need to increase it by 1.

So, operations = 1.

Another example: [1,2,2,2]. n=4, m=1 (ceil(4/2)=2, index 1).

Median is 2. To increase it to 3, operations = 1.

Another example: [1,1,1,1,1]. n=5, m=2 (ceil(5/2)=3, index 2).

Median is 1. To increase it to 2, operations =1.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the problem description, there is an example:

Input:

8

3

2 2 8

4

7 3 3 1

1000000000

5 5 5 4 5

6

2 1 2 3 1 4

2

1 1

4

5 5 5 5

Output:

1

2

1

3

1

2

3

Let's take the first test case:

n=3, a=[2,2,8]

sorted: [2,2,8], median is 2.

To increase it to 3, operations=1.

Which matches the output.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[7,3,3,1]

sorted: [1,3,3,7], median is 3.

To increase it to 4, operations=2.

Wait, but in the sorted array, the median is the second element, which is 3.

To make it 4, I need to set the second element to 4.

But if I increase one element to 4, let's say increase one 3 to 4, the array becomes [1,3,4,7], sorted: [1,3,4,7], median is still 3.

So, I need to increase two elements to 4.

For example, increase both 3's to 4, so array becomes [1,4,4,7], sorted: [1,4,4,7], median is 4.

So, operations=2.

That matches the output.

Another test case:

n=1, a=[1000000000]

sorted: [1000000000], median is 1000000000.

To increase it, I need to set it to 1000000001, which requires 1 operation.

Matches the output.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5]

sorted: [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To increase it to 6, I need to set the third element to 6.

So, increase it by 1.

But the output is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match my expectation.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

"In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at indices 1,2,3 and obtain the array [6,6,6,4,5], the median of this array is 6"

Wait, but in the sorted array [4,5,6,6,6], the median is 6.

So, to get to this state, they increased a[0], a[1], a[2] by 1 each, totaling 3 operations.

But why not just increase the median element?

In the sorted array [4,5,5,5,5], the median is the third element, which is 5.

To make it 6, I just need to increase this element by 1.

But in the original array, it's not clear which element is which in the sorted array.

Wait, in the original array [5,5,5,4,5], the sorted array is [4,5,5,5,5].

So, to increase the median (which is the third element in the sorted array) from 5 to 6, I need to find which element in the original array corresponds to the third position in the sorted array.

In the sorted array, the third element is 5, which appears multiple times in the original array.

So, to increase this specific element, I need to identify which element in the original array is the third one in the sorted array.

But that's complicated.

Instead, perhaps it's easier to sort the array and then directly increase the median element.

In this case, sorted array is [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To make it 6, I need to increase the third element to 6.

But in the original array, this element could be any of the 5's.

So, I need to find which element in the original array corresponds to the third position in the sorted array.

But to minimize operations, I should choose to increase the element that is currently less than the desired median value.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all elements from the median position to the end.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want the median to be as large as possible with minimal operations.

To maximize the median, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are as large as possible.

So, I need to set the ceil(n/2)-th element to the maximum possible value with minimal operations.

To do that, I should focus on increasing the elements from the median position onwards.

But that seems too vague.

Let me look at the problem again.

The problem is to increase the median value by performing operations on any elements.

I need to find the minimal number of operations to make the median larger than its current value.

An operation is choosing any element and increasing it by 1.

I can choose to increase any element, not necessarily the median.

But to increase the median, it's most efficient to increase the median itself.

But in some cases, increasing other elements might be necessary.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], sorted [1,3,3,7], median is 3.

To make the median 4, I need to set the second element to 4.

But in the sorted array, if I increase one 3 to 4, the sorted array becomes [1,3,4,7], median is still 3.

So, I need to increase both 3's to 4, so that the sorted array is [1,4,4,7], median is 4.

Hence, operations=2.

So, in this case, I had to increase multiple elements to affect the median.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To make the median 6, I need to set the third element to 6.

But in the sorted array, the third element is 5, so I need to increase it by 1.

But to identify which element in the original array corresponds to this position, I need to consider that multiple elements have the value 5.

So, perhaps I need to increase the smallest elements to make the median larger.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the sorted array, to set the third element to 6, I can choose to increase any element that is <=5 to 6.

But since the array is sorted, the third element is 5.

So, I need to make sure that the third element is at least 6.

To do that, I can increase the third element by 1.

But in the original array, I need to identify which element corresponds to the third position in the sorted array.

Alternatively, I can consider that to increase the median, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are greater than or equal to the new median value.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

To make the median at least x, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= x.

So, to find the minimal operations to make the median larger than its current value, I can set x to median +1, and compute the number of operations needed to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >= x.

In the fourth test case, median is 5, so x=6.

I need to make sure that at least 3 elements are >=6.

In the original array, [5,5,5,4,5], only one element is >=6 initially.

So, I need to increase 2 more elements to 6 or higher.

Hence, operations=2.

But in the explanation, they increased three elements to get [6,6,6,4,5], which seems suboptimal.

Wait, perhaps I misread the explanation.

Wait, in the explanation, they increased a[1], a[2], a[3] by 1 each, getting [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

But actually, increasing only two elements would suffice: [5,5,6,4,5] -> sorted [4,5,5,5,6], median is 5, which is not enough.

Wait, no, to make at least three elements >=6, I need to increase at least two elements from 5 to 6.

So, operations=2.

But in the explanation, they increased three elements.

Perhaps it's just one way to do it, but not the minimal.

So, maybe the output of 3 is incorrect, and it should be 2.

Wait, but the problem says it's the minimal number of operations.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the output is 3.

But according to my reasoning, it should be 2.

Wait, maybe because there are multiple elements with the same value, and I need to increase enough of them to ensure the median increases.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that after operations, the median is strictly greater than the original median.

In the fourth test case, original median is 5.

I need to make the new median >=6.

To do that, in the sorted array [4,5,5,5,5], I need to make sure that the third element is at least 6.

So, I need to increase the third element and any elements before it if necessary.

But since there are multiple elements with value 5, I need to increase enough of them to make the third element >=6.

So, if I increase only two elements to 6, the sorted array would be [4,5,6,5,6], which sorted is [4,5,5,6,6], median is 5, which is not enough.

So, I need to increase at least three elements to 6.

Then, the sorted array would be [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Hence, operations=3.

So, my earlier reasoning was incorrect because I didn't account for the fact that increasing only two elements might not be sufficient if there are multiple elements with the same value.

So, in this case, to make the median increase from 5 to 6, I need to perform 3 operations.

Hence, the output is 3.

Okay, so my initial approach was incomplete.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think again.

Given that I can choose any elements to increase, not just the median, I need to find the minimal number of operations to make at least ceil(n/2) elements strictly greater than the current median.

Wait, no.

To make the median larger than its current value, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are strictly greater than the current median.

Because if I have at least ceil(n/2) elements greater than the current median, the new median will be at least the smallest of those ceil(n/2) elements.

So, I need to find the smallest value that is greater than the current median and make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are at least that value.

In other words, I need to set the median to the next unique value greater than the current median.

But handling duplicates is tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array and then find how many operations are needed to make the ceil(n/2)-th element to be at least the next unique value after the current median.

Let me try to formalize this.

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Find the current median value, which is the element at position m = ceil(n/2) -1 (0-based indexing).

3. Find the smallest value that is strictly greater than the current median.

4. Compute how many operations are needed to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >= this smallest value.

Wait, but in the case where there are duplicates, I need to make sure that enough elements are increased to reach this value.

Let me try with the fourth test case.

n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5]

sorted: [4,5,5,5,5], m=2 (ceil(5/2)=3, 0-based index 2).

Current median is 5.

Next unique value greater than 5 is not present in the array, so I need to set the median to 6.

To have at least 3 elements >=6, I need to increase the first three elements to 6.

Original sorted array: [4,5,5,5,5]

Increase the first three elements to 6: [6,6,6,5,5], sorted [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Operations needed: increase 4 to 6 (2 operations), and increase one 5 to 6 (1 operation), total 3 operations.

Which matches the output.

So, in this case, I need to increase the smallest elements to make sure that the ceil(n/2)-th element is at least the next unique value.

Wait, but in this case, increasing the smallest elements is more efficient because they require more operations to reach the target value.

Wait, no, actually, to minimize operations, I should increase the elements that are closest to the target value.

In this case, the target is 6.

So, I have elements [4,5,5,5,5], and I need at least three elements >=6.

The elements that are <6 are 4 and 5.

I need to increase some of them so that at least three elements are >=6.

The minimal operations would be to increase the highest possible elements that are <6.

Wait, but in this case, since 6 is greater than all existing elements except none, because all are 5 or less.

Wait, 4 needs to be increased by 2 to reach 6, and 5 needs to be increased by 1.

So, to make three elements >=6, I can choose to increase:

- one 5 to 6 (1 operation), and increase 4 to 6 (2 operations), total 3 operations.

Or increase two 5's to 6 (2 operations), but then only two elements are >=6, which is not enough.

So, indeed, operations=3.

Hence, the initial approach in the explanation is correct.

So, to generalize, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= some value x, which is the smallest possible value greater than the current median.

To minimize operations, I should choose x to be the smallest possible value greater than the current median.

Then, compute how many elements are currently < x, and how much to increase each of them to reach x.

The total operations would be the sum of (x - a_i) for all a_i < x, considering only the ceil(n/2) elements that need to be >=x.

Wait, but I need to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >=x.

So, I need to find the smallest x such that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >=x.

Then, compute how many operations are needed to make the necessary elements reach x.

But finding x dynamically seems complicated.

An easier way might be:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Find the current median position m = ceil(n/2) -1 (0-based).

3. Find the smallest value in the array that is greater than the current median value.

4. Set x to be this value.

5. Compute how many operations are needed to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >=x.

But in the fourth test case, x=6, and operations=3.

Wait, but in the sorted array [4,5,5,5,5], the smallest value greater than 5 is 6, which is not present in the array.

So, I need to set x=6.

Then, the number of elements <6 is 4 (4,5,5,5), so I need to increase at least (4 - (n - ceil(n/2))) elements to 6.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Perhaps a better way is:

- Sort the array.

- Find the current median value.

- Find the position where the next unique value greater than the current median starts.

- Compute how many elements need to be increased to reach at least ceil(n/2) elements >=x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the sorted array and find the minimal operations to make the m-th element (median position) to be at least the next unique value.

In the fourth test case, sorted array: [4,5,5,5,5], m=2, current median is 5.

Next unique value is 6.

To make the third element 6, I need to increase it by 1, but also ensure that at least two other elements are >=6.

So, I need to increase the third element and possibly others.

Wait, in this case, increasing the third element to 6 and keeping the others as is would make the sorted array [4,5,6,5,5], which sorted is [4,5,5,5,6], median is still 5.

So, that's not enough.

Hence, I need to increase enough elements to ensure that the third element is at least 6.

So, in this case, increasing the third and fourth elements to 6: [4,5,6,6,5], sorted [4,5,5,6,6], median is 5, which is still not enough.

So, I need to increase the third, fourth, and fifth elements to 6: [4,5,6,6,6], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Hence, operations=3.

So, in general, to make the median increase, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >=x, where x is the next unique value greater than the current median.

To find x, I can look for the smallest value in the array that is greater than the current median.

If multiple elements are equal to the current median, I need to increase enough of them to reach x.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, there is no element equal to x=6, so I need to increase elements to 6.

Hence, operations=3.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- Sort the array.

- Find the current median value.

- Find the smallest value x that is greater than the current median.

- Compute how many elements are <x.

- Determine how many of these elements need to be increased to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >=x.

- The number of operations is the sum of (x - a_i) for the elements that need to be increased.

But I need to minimize the operations, so I should prioritize increasing the elements that are closest to x.

In other words, sort the array, find the smallest x greater than the current median, and then calculate the operations needed to make the necessary elements reach x.

Wait, but in practice, it's easier to sort the array and directly compute how many operations are needed to make the ceil(n/2)-th element to be at least x.

In code, this can be implemented by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the current value at the median position and the target value x.

But I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >=x.

So, perhaps I can find the smallest x such that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >=x, and then compute the operations needed to reach x.

Wait, but x should be the minimal possible value greater than the current median.

So, perhaps I can set x = current_median +1.

Then, count how many elements are <x, and compute the operations needed to make ceil(n/2) elements >=x.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, current_median=5, x=6.

Number of elements <6 is 4 (4,5,5,5).

I need to make at least 3 elements >=6.

So, I need to increase 3 elements from <6 to 6.

The elements to increase should be the ones
