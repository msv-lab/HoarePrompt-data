Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the amount I get back is more than the total amount I bet on all outcomes.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- There are t test cases, up to 10,000 of them.

- For each test case, n can be from 1 to 50.

- Each k_i is between 2 and 20.

- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200,000.

- I need to output -1 if it's impossible to find such bets, otherwise, output n integers representing the bets.

It's guaranteed that if a solution exists, there's one where each x_i is between 1 and 1,000,000,000.

Alright, so the problem is to find x_1, x_2, ..., x_n such that for each i, k_i * x_i > sum of all x_j for j from 1 to n.

Let me try to rephrase that:

For each i, k_i * x_i > sum_{j=1 to n} x_j

But sum_{j=1 to n} x_j is the total bet, let's call it S. So for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

Also, S = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j.

So, for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

But S = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j.

I need to find x_i such that for each i, k_i * x_i > sum_{j=1 to n} x_j.

This seems tricky. Let's see if I can find a way to express x_i in terms of others or find some inequalities to work with.

Maybe I can consider expressing all x_j in terms of x_i for some i.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of proportions or something similar.

Let's consider that for each i, x_i is proportional to some value related to k_i.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the inverse of k_i.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I fix x_i for some i, and try to express other x_j in terms of x_i.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me try to manipulate the inequalities.

For each i, k_i * x_i > S.

But S = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j.

So, for each i, k_i * x_i > sum_{j=1 to n} x_j.

I can rearrange this to:

k_i * x_i - x_i > sum_{j ≠ i} x_j

x_i * (k_i - 1) > sum_{j ≠ i} x_j

This seems useful.

So, for each i, x_i * (k_i - 1) > sum_{j ≠ i} x_j

Alternatively, x_i * (k_i - 1) > S - x_i

Because S = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j, and sum_{j ≠ i} x_j = S - x_i.

So, x_i * (k_i - 1) > S - x_i

Let's rearrange this:

x_i * (k_i - 1) + x_i > S

x_i * (k_i - 1 + 1) > S

x_i * k_i > S

Wait, that brings me back to the original inequality.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to find a way to bound S in terms of the k_i's.

Let me consider that for all i, x_i * k_i > S.

So, S < min over i of (x_i * k_i)

But S = sum of x_j.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can use the method of least common multiples or something similar.

Wait, maybe I can assign x_i = L / k_i, where L is the least common multiple of the k_i's.

Wait, but k_i are multipliers, not denominators.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the product of all k_i's.

Let me think about this.

Suppose I set x_i = P / k_i, where P is the product of all k_i's.

Then, for each i, k_i * x_i = k_i * (P / k_i) = P.

And S = sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j).

So, for each i, P > S = sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j).

Dividing both sides by P, we get 1 > sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j).

So, the condition for a solution to exist is that sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

If that's the case, then x_i = P / k_i is a solution, where P is the product of all k_i's.

And since P is divisible by each k_i, x_i will be an integer.

Also, since P is the product of all k_i's, and k_i >= 2, P can be large, but since n <= 50 and k_i <= 20, P can be up to 20^50, which is way beyond 10^9.

Wait, but the problem allows x_i up to 10^9, so maybe I need to scale down P.

Wait, but according to the problem, if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <= 10^9.

So, perhaps I can find a smaller P that satisfies the condition.

Wait, maybe I can set P to be the least common multiple (LCM) of the k_i's.

Then, x_i = P / k_i, and S = sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j).

Again, the condition is P > S = sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j), which simplifies to 1 > sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j).

So, the solution exists only if sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

And in that case, x_i = P / k_i, where P is the LCM of the k_i's, is a valid solution.

But P could still be large, but since n is small (up to 50) and k_i up to 20, the LCM won't be too large.

In Python, handling large integers is fine, so that's not a problem.

So, in the code, for each test case, I need to:

1. Read n.

2. Read the list of k_i.

3. Check if sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

- If not, output -1.

- If yes, compute P = LCM of all k_i.

- Then, set x_i = P / k_i for each i.

- Output the list of x_i.

Seems straightforward.

Looking at the given code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for T in range(t):

bets = int(input())

a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

prod = 1

for i in range(bets):

prod *= a[i]

sumo = 0

for i in range(bets):

a[i] = prod // a[i]

sumo += int(a[i])

if sumo >= prod:

print(-1)

else:

ans = ''

for i in range(bets):

ans += str(a[i]) + ' '

print(ans)

So, the code does the following:

- Reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n (number of outcomes).

- Reads the list of k_i.

- Computes the product of all k_i (prod).

- For each i, sets x_i = prod // k_i.

- Computes sumo = sum of all x_i.

- If sumo >= prod, outputs -1.

- Else, outputs the list of x_i.

Wait, but earlier I thought that P should be the LCM of k_i, not the product.

Is there a difference?

Yes, there is a difference.

For example, if k_i are [2, 4], the product is 8, the LCM is 4.

If k_i are [2, 3], product is 6, LCM is 6.

Wait, in some cases, product and LCM are different.

But in the code, P is set to the product of k_i.

Now, if I set P to the product of k_i, and x_i = P / k_i, then S = sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j).

The condition is S < P.

So, sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j) < P.

Dividing both sides by P, sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

Which is the same condition I derived earlier.

So, using the product works, but it might lead to larger x_i than necessary.

Using the LCM would give smaller x_i, but since the problem allows x_i up to 10^9, using the product is fine as long as it doesn't overflow.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

But according to the problem, if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <= 10^9.

So, using the product might give x_i that are larger than 10^9.

Wait, but the problem says that if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <= 10^9.

So, perhaps using the LCM instead of the product would ensure that x_i are within 10^9.

Because LCM is generally smaller than the product.

For example, for k_i = [2, 3, 4, 5], product is 120, LCM is 60.

So, using LCM would give x_i = 60 / 2 = 30, 60 / 3 = 20, 60 / 4 = 15, 60 / 5 = 12, sum is 30 + 20 + 15 + 12 = 77, which is less than P=60? Wait, no, 30 + 20 + 15 + 12 = 77, which is greater than P=60, so this wouldn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, sum_{j=1 to n} (P / k_j) should be less than P.

In this case, 77 > 60, so it doesn't satisfy.

Wait, but according to the condition, sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

For k_i = [2, 3, 4, 5], sum is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 0.5 + 0.333... + 0.25 + 0.2 = approximately 1.283, which is greater than 1, so no solution should exist, which matches the earlier conclusion that sumo >= P.

Wait, in this case, sumo = 77 >= P=60, so it would output -1, which is correct.

But in the code, P is set to the product, which is 120.

Then x_i = 120 / 2 = 60, 120 / 3 = 40, 120 / 4 = 30, 120 / 5 = 24, sumo = 60 + 40 + 30 + 24 = 154.

Since 154 >= 120, it would output -1, which is correct.

But using LCM=60, sumo=77 >= P=60, same result.

So, using either product or LCM works in terms of correctness.

But the problem allows x_i up to 10^9, so using LCM might be better to keep x_i smaller.

But in the code, P is set to the product, which might be larger, but since Python handles big integers, it's fine.

But perhaps in the problem's solution, using LCM is preferred to ensure x_i are within 10^9.

But according to the problem, if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <= 10^9, so using product might exceed this limit in some cases.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <= 10^9.

So, perhaps using product could lead to x_i larger than 10^9, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the problem says "it can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that satisfies these constraints" meaning x_i <= 10^9.

So, perhaps using product could give x_i larger than 10^9, which is invalid.

Therefore, I need to make sure that x_i <= 10^9.

In the code, P is the product of k_i, which for n=50 and k_i=20, P could be up to 20^50, which is way larger than 10^9.

Then, x_i = P // k_i could still be large.

So, perhaps I need to scale down P by dividing it by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the k_i's or something similar.

Wait, but P is the LCM of k_i's, which is smaller than the product.

So, perhaps I need to compute P as the LCM of all k_i's.

In that case, P would be smaller, and x_i = P // k_i would be smaller.

Let me check an example.

Take n=3, k_i=[2, 3, 7].

Product P=2*3*7=42.

x_i = 42/2=21, 42/3=14, 42/7=6.

Sumo=21+14+6=41, which is less than P=42. So, 41 < 42, which is correct.

But if I use LCM of [2,3,7], which is also 42, same as product.

Wait, in this case, product and LCM are the same.

Another example: n=2, k_i=[2,4].

Product P=8.

x_i=8/2=4, 8/4=2.

Sumo=4+2=6 < P=8. Correct.

But LCM of [2,4] is 4.

x_i=4/2=2, 4/4=1.

Sumo=2+1=3 < P=4. Correct.

So, using LCM=4 instead of product=8 gives smaller x_i, which is better.

Another example: n=5, k_i=[5,5,5,5,5].

Product P=5^5=3125.

x_i=3125/5=625 for each.

Sumo=625*5=3125 >= P=3125. So, no solution.

Which matches the sample input where it outputs -1 for this case.

So, using LCM would be better to keep x_i smaller.

In this case, LCM of [5,5,5,5,5] is 5, x_i=5/5=1 for each.

Sumo=1*5=5 >= P=5, so no solution, correct.

So, in the code, instead of setting P to the product of k_i, I should set P to the LCM of k_i.

Then, x_i = P // k_i.

And check if sumo < P.

If yes, output x_i, else -1.

Also, need to compute LCM of the k_i's.

In Python, math.lcm can be used for this purpose.

But in Python 3.8 and above.

Since this is for Codeforces, which uses Python 3.8, it should be fine.

So, I need to import math and use math.lcm.

But math.lcm can take multiple arguments, or I can compute it iteratively.

First, compute LCM of the first two k_i's, then LCM of that result with the next k_i, and so on.

Yes, that's how I can compute LCM of a list.

So, in the code, instead of prod = 1 and then prod *= a[i], I should compute the LCM of a.

Similarly, in the sample code, it uses prod as the product, but I need to change it to LCM.

Wait, but in the sample code, it's using prod as the product, which in some cases works, but it's not guaranteed to keep x_i within 10^9.

So, I need to modify the code to use LCM instead of product.

But in the sample code, it's using product, and in some cases, it might lead to x_i larger than 10^9.

But according to the problem, if a solution exists, there's one with x_i <=10^9.

So, perhaps using LCM ensures that x_i are within 10^9.

Therefore, I need to compute P as the LCM of all k_i's.

Then, x_i = P // k_i.

Then, sumo = sum of P // k_i for all i.

If sumo < P, output x_i, else -1.

Also, need to make sure that P is an integer and that P // k_i is integer division.

In Python, // is integer division.

Alright, so I need to modify the code to compute P as LCM of a.

Let me see.

In Python 3.9, math.lcm can take multiple arguments.

So, I can do import math, and then P = math.lcm(*a).

But in earlier versions, math.lcm takes only two arguments.

Wait, no, in Python 3.9, math.lcm can take multiple arguments.

According to Python 3.9 documentation, math.lcm(*integers) returns the least common multiple of the integers.

So, it can take a list of integers.

So, I can do P = math.lcm(*a).

But to make it compatible with earlier versions, I can iteratively compute LCM.

Define a function lcm(a, b), and then iterate over the list to compute LCM of all elements.

But since Codeforces uses Python 3.8, I need to implement lcm for multiple arguments.

Wait, no, in Python 3.9, math.lcm was introduced to take multiple arguments.

But Codeforces uses Python 3.8, so I need to use a different approach.

I can use functools.reduce with math.lcm for two arguments.

Wait, but in Python 3.8, math.lcm exists but only takes two arguments.

So, I can do functools.reduce(math.lcm, a).

But actually, in Python 3.8, math.lcm exists and can take multiple arguments.

Wait, checking Python 3.8 documentation, math.lcm was introduced in Python 3.9.

So, in Python 3.8, math.lcm exists but only takes two arguments.

Therefore, I need to use functools.reduce to compute LCM of the list.

So, I can do import math and functools, and then P = functools.reduce(math.lcm, a).

But actually, math.lcm was introduced in Python 3.9.

In Python 3.8, math.lcm exists but only takes two arguments.

So, I need to define a function to compute LCM of two numbers, and then use functools.reduce to compute LCM of the list.

Here's how I can do it:

import math

import functools

def lcm(a, b):

return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

P = functools.reduce(lcm, a)

Then, proceed as before.

Yes, that should work.

So, in the code, I need to import math and functools, define lcm for two arguments, and then compute P = functools.reduce(lcm, a).

Then, set x_i = P // k_i for each i.

Compute sumo = sum of x_i.

If sumo < P, output x_i, else -1.

Looking back at the sample code, it uses prod = product of all k_i, which is larger than necessary, but still correct in terms of the condition sumo < P.

But as discussed, it might lead to x_i being larger than 10^9, which is not allowed.

Therefore, I need to modify the code to use LCM instead of product.

So, the corrected code should be:

import math

import functools

def lcm(a, b):

return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def func():

t = int(input())

for T in range(t):

bets = int(input())

a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

P = functools.reduce(lcm, a)

sumo = 0

for i in range(bets):

x_i = P // a[i]

sumo += x_i

if sumo >= P:

print(-1)

else:

ans = ' '.join(str(P // k) for k in a)

print(ans)

This should ensure that x_i are as small as possible, within the limit of 10^9.

Let me check with the sample input.

Sample Input:

6

3 2 7

1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071

8 18 12 9 24

Let's see for the first test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

Compute P = LCM of 3,2,7.

LCM(3,2)=6, LCM(6,7)=42.

x_i = 42/3=14, 42/2=21, 42/7=6.

sumo=14+21+6=41 < P=42. So, output 14 21 6.

But in the sample output, it's 27 41 12.

Wait, why is that?

Is there something wrong with my understanding?

Wait, but according to the problem, any valid solution is accepted.

So, as long as sumo < P, and x_i are integers within limits, it's fine.

So, 14 21 6 is also a valid solution.

But the sample output is 27 41 12, which sums to 27+41+12=80 < P=81 (if P=81).

Wait, but in this case, P should be LCM of 3,2,7.

But LCM of 3,2,7 is 42.

But in the sample output, P seems to be 81.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the sample output corresponds to a different P.

Wait, in the sample code, P is the product, which for k=[3,2,7], P=3*2*7=42.

x_i=42/3=14, 42/2=21, 42/7=6, sumo=14+21+6=41 <42.

But the sample output is 27 41 12, which sums to 80.

So, perhaps in the sample, they used a different P.

Wait, maybe they scaled up P by a factor.

Since x_i can be scaled by any positive integer, as long as the condition holds.

For example, if x_i=14,21,6 with P=42, which satisfies sumo=41 <42.

But if I multiply x_i by 2, getting 28,42,12, sumo=84 <84? Wait, 28+42+12=84, which is not less than P=84.

Wait, no, the condition is sumo < P.

So, 84 <84 is false.

So, scaling up uniformly might not preserve the condition.

Wait, perhaps I need to scale differently.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have x_i=14,21,6 with P=42.

sumo=14+21+6=41 <42.

Now, if I multiply all x_i by a factor t, then x_i'=t*x_i.

sumo'=t*sumo.

P'=t*P.

So, sumo' < P' becomes t*sumo < t*P, which is equivalent to sumo < P.

So, scaling up uniformly by t preserves the condition.

But in the sample, 27,41,12 sums to 80 < P= something.

Wait, if P=81, then 80 <81.

But 81 is not a multiple of 42.

Wait, perhaps P can be any multiple of the LCM, as long as the condition holds.

Wait, but in the sample code, P is set to the product, which is 42.

But in the sample output, P seems to be 81.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the sample output explanation.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 = 80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back 3 * 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back 2 * 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back 7 * 12 = 84 coins. All these values are strictly greater than 80."

So, in this case, P=81, which is 3*27, 2*41=82, 7*12=84, all greater than S=80.

Wait, but P should be the same for all i, right?

Wait, no, P is the amount received when the i-th outcome wins, which is k_i * x_i.

But in the sample explanation, P is set to k_i * x_i for each i, but P should be the same for all i.

Wait, no, P is the amount received for each i, which should be greater than S.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing P with something else.

In the earlier reasoning, P is the LCM of the k_i's.

But in the sample explanation, P seems to be k_i * x_i for each i.

Wait, but k_i * x_i should be equal to P for all i.

Wait, no, in the sample explanation, P is different for each i.

Wait, but in the condition, for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

So, for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

But in the sample explanation, S=80, and k_i * x_i for each i is 81,82,84, all greater than 80.

So, it's just ensuring that for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

But in my earlier approach, I set P to be the LCM, and x_i = P / k_i, then for each i, k_i * x_i = P, which is greater than S if S < P.

But in the sample, P is set to different values for different i, but in my approach, P is the same for all i.

Wait, perhaps I need to make P = min over i of k_i * x_i.

But in any case, as long as for each i, k_i * x_i > S, it's fine.

So, in the sample, they chose x_i such that k_i * x_i > S, and S < min over i of k_i * x_i.

Which is equivalent to S < P, where P is the minimum k_i * x_i.

In my approach, I set P to be the LCM, and x_i = P / k_i, so k_i * x_i = P for all i.

Then, S = sum of P / k_i for all i.

So, the condition is S < P.

Which is equivalent to sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

Which matches the sample's condition.

So, both approaches are correct.

But in the sample code, P is set to the product, which is larger than necessary.

In the sample explanation, P seems to be set to k_i * x_i for each i, which is not necessarily equal for all i.

But in my approach, P is set to the LCM, and k_i * x_i = P for all i.

Which is a specific case where P is the same for all i.

But the general condition is that for each i, k_i * x_i > S.

So, my approach ensures that k_i * x_i = P > S.

Which is sufficient but not necessary.

So, my approach is correct, but may not find the minimal x_i.

But according to the problem, any solution is acceptable as long as x_i are integers between 1 and 10^9.

So, using P as LCM is fine.

Hence, I need to modify the code to use LCM instead of product.

So, the corrected code should be:

import math

import functools

def lcm(a, b):

return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def func():

t = int(input())

for T in range(t):

bets = int(input())

a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

P = functools.reduce(lcm, a)

sumo = 0

for i in range(bets):

x_i = P // a[i]

sumo += x_i

if sumo >= P:

print(-1)

else:

ans = ' '.join(str(P // k) for k in a)

print(ans)

This should work correctly.

Therefore, the original code is incorrect because it uses the product of k_i instead of the LCM, which may lead to x_i exceeding 10^9.

So, Correctness: **False**
