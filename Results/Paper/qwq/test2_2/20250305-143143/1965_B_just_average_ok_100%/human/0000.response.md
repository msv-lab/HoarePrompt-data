Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

First, I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, I can represent any sum up to the sum of all the numbers in the set. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15 by selecting appropriate subsets.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the possibility of making k, while still being able to make all other values up to n.

One approach could be to start with a set that can make all sums up to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be made.

Let's consider using powers of 2. If I take the first m powers of 2 such that their sum is at least n, I can make all sums up to n. For example, with m=4, I have [1, 2, 4, 8], which sums up to 15, so I can make all sums from 1 to 15.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be made by any subsequence. So, I need to remove or modify some elements so that k cannot be achieved, while keeping the ability to make all other sums up to n.

One idea is to remove the elements that sum up to k and replace them with other elements that allow me to make the other sums.

But this seems tricky. Maybe there's another way.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Output:

1

1

So, the sequence is [1]. There is no subsequence that sums to 2, since the only subsequence is [1], which sums to 1. And for v=1, which is not equal to k, there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Here, no subsequence sums to 1, which is k. And for v=2 to 6, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

For example:

2: [2]

3: [3]

4: [4]

5: [5]

6: [6]

And combinations can make other sums as well, but since n=6, we only need up to 6.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here, all elements are 1, so the only possible sums are 1, 2, 3, ..., 7. There is no subsequence that sums to 8, which is k. And for v from 1 to 7, subsequences can be made by selecting the appropriate number of 1's.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Here, no subsequence sums to 3, but subsequences can sum to all other values from 1 to 9, except 3.

For example:

1: [1]

2: [1,1]

4: [4]

5: [4,1]

6: [7,1,1,1-4]

Wait, I need to check the sums more carefully.

Wait, the sequence is [7,1,4,1]

Possible subsequences:

[7]: 7

[1]:1

[4]:4

[1]:1

[7,1]:8

[7,4]:11

[7,1,1]:9

[1,4]:5

[1,1]:2

[4,1]:5

[7,1,4]:12

[7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums possible: 1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13

But n=9, so we only care up to 9.

So, sums available: 1,2,4,5,7,8,9

Missing 3 and 6.

But k=3, which is missing, as required.

But v=6 is also missing. Is that allowed?

Wait, the problem says that for all v from 1 to n except k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v.

So, in this case, n=9, k=3.

So, v can be from 1 to 9 except 3.

But in the output, sums available are 1,2,4,5,7,8,9.

So, v=6 is missing, but since k=3 and v=6 is not equal to k, it should be possible to have a subsequence that sums to 6.

But in this output, it's missing.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the possible sums.

Let's recalculate:

Possible subsequences and their sums:

[1]:1

[4]:4

[1]:1

[7]:7

[1,4]:5

[1,1]:2

[4,1]:5

[7,1]:8

[7,4]:11

[7,1,1]:9

[7,4,1]:12

[7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums:1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13

Still, 3 and 6 are missing.

But k=3, so 3 is excluded, but v=6 should be possible.

Wait, maybe the sequence provided is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there is a misinterpretation.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"For all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v."

So, for v=6, which is not equal to k=3, there should be a subsequence that sums to 6.

But in the provided sequence [7,1,4,1], there is no subsequence that sums to 6.

Yet, in the sample output, this is accepted.

Wait, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem allows not being able to sum to some v ≠ k, as long as all v ≠ k are covered.

But in this case, v=6 cannot be formed, even though it's not k.

Wait, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back:

"It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists."

But in this case, with n=9 and k=3, is it possible to have a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but subsequences can sum to all other values from 1 to 9 except 3.

Seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element is a non-negative integer up to 10^9.

I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, but for all other v from 1 to n, there exists a subsequence that sums to v.

One approach could be to include elements that cover all sums except k.

One way to cover all sums up to n is to use the minimal number of elements, like using powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

But in that case, it's easy to make any sum up to n by selecting the appropriate subset.

However, I need to exclude the possibility of making k.

So, perhaps I can remove the element that corresponds to the binary representation of k and adjust accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the binary representation of k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

Let me try to think of a general approach.

Suppose I have a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n, like powers of 2 up to n.

Then, to exclude the sum k, I need to modify this set so that no combination sums to k.

One way to do this is to remove certain elements and add others to block the sum k while still allowing other sums.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, efficiency might be a concern, but since n is up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, but m is at most 25, perhaps a precomputed sequence can be used.

Wait, perhaps there's a universal sequence of 25 elements that can be used for all test cases, but I doubt it.

Alternatively, perhaps for each test case, a specific sequence needs to be constructed based on n and k.

But given that t can be up to 1000, and n up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to construct the sequence.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Start with a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

2. Ensure that no subset sums to k.

One way to ensure that no subset sums to k is to make sure that k cannot be formed by any combination of the elements.

But ensuring that all other sums can be formed is tricky.

An idea could be to include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing elements that fill in the gaps.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of inclusion-exclusion or some greedy approach.

Let me consider the following:

- Start with an empty set.

- Iterate through all v from 1 to n, excluding k.

- For each v, if there is no subset that sums to v, add v itself to the set.

This would result in a set where each element is a number from 1 to n (excluding k), and each number is included individually.

However, this could result in a set of size up to n-1, which is too large since m must be at most 25.

So, this approach is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to select the elements.

Let me consider using larger elements to cover multiple sums.

For example, if I include a large number, it can be combined with smaller numbers to make larger sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Another idea: use a combination of small numbers to cover the smaller sums and larger numbers to cover the larger sums, while blocking k.

But this is still vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample input:

n=2, k=2

Output:

1

1

So, sequence [1] cannot sum to 2, and can sum to 1.

Second sample input:

n=6, k=1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Here, no subsequence sums to 1, and subsequences can sum to 2 through 6.

Third sample input:

n=8, k=8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here, all elements are 1, so possible sums are 1 through 7, excluding 8.

Fourth sample input:

n=9, k=3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Possible sums: 1,2,4,5,7,8,9

Missing 3 and 6.

But v=6 should be possible since 6 ≠ k=3.

So, perhaps this output is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing a subsequence that sums to 6.

Wait, [7,1,4,1]:

Possible sums:

[7,1,4,1]: 13

[7,1,4]:12

[7,1,1]:9

[7,4,1]:12

[7,4]:11

[7,1]:8

[4,1]:5

[1,1]:2

[7]:7

[4]:4

[1]:1

Is there a way to make 6?

Wait, [7,1,1,4]:13 - no.

Wait, maybe [7,1,4,1] doesn't sum to 6 directly, but perhaps a different combination.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the sequence can have duplicates.

But in this case, there are two 1's.

So, [4,1,1]:6

Ah, there it is.

So, [4,1,1] sums to 6.

I must have missed that earlier.

So, in this case, v=6 can be formed by [4,1,1].

Therefore, the output is correct.

Fifth sample input:

n=10, k=7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Possible sums:

[1]:1

[2]:2

[8]:8

[3]:3

[1,2]:3

[1,8]:9

[1,3]:4

[2,8]:10

[2,3]:5

[8,3]:11

[1,2,8]:11

[1,2,3]:6

[1,8,3]:12

[2,8,3]:13

[1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing 7, which is k, and also missing 13 and above, but since n=10, we only care up to 10.

So, sums from 1 to 10 except 7 can be formed.

Perfect.

So, in this case, with m=4, the sequence [1,2,8,3] achieves the goal.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such sequences for any n and k within the constraints.

Looking back at the approach in the provided program, it seems to be constructing a sequence based on powers of 2, but modifying it to exclude k.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]

idx = -1

for i in range(len(nums)):

if nums[i] > k:

idx = i - 1

break

nums.append(k - nums[idx])

nums.append(k + 1)

nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)

nums.remove(1 << idx)

print(len(nums))

print(*nums)

So, here's what it's doing:

1. It generates the first 21 powers of 2: [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1<<20].

2. It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, say nums[idx].

3. It appends three numbers to nums:

- k - nums[idx]

- k + 1

- k + nums[idx] + 1

4. It removes nums[idx], which is the power of 2 just below or equal to k.

5. It prints the new nums list, which now has 21 + 3 - 1 = 23 elements.

I need to verify if this approach correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's conditions.

First, let's see what this sequence is supposed to achieve.

By removing nums[idx], which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, and adding k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, the idea might be to block the sum k while still being able to make all other sums.

Let me test this with one of the sample inputs.

Take the first sample input:

n=2, k=2

nums = [1,2,4,...,1<<20]

idx = 1, since nums[1]=2 > k=2, so idx=1-1=0

nums.append(k - nums[0]) = 2 - 1 =1

nums.append(k + 1) =3

nums.append(k + nums[0] +1)=2 +1 +1=4

Then, nums.remove(1<<0)=1

So, nums now is [2,4,...,1<<20,1,3,4], but remove 1, so final nums is [2,4,...,1<<20,3,4]

This seems different from the sample output, which is m=1, a=[1]. So, perhaps this approach is not optimal.

Wait, but the sample output is m=1, a=[1], which is correct for n=2, k=2.

But according to this program, it would output m=23, which is larger than necessary.

So, perhaps this program is not constructing the minimal sequence, but it's acceptable as m can be up to 25.

But I need to check if it satisfies the conditions.

Let me consider n=2, k=2.

Sequence: [2,4,...,1<<20,3,4], after removing 1.

But in this sequence, no subsequence can sum to 2, since the smallest element is 2, and there are no elements that sum to 2.

Wait, [2] sums to 2, which is k, which is not allowed.

Wait, but according to the problem, there should be no subsequence that sums to k.

But in this case, [2] sums to 2, which is k.

So, this sequence is invalid for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the construction.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=2.

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,...,1<<20]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=2, which is i=2 (nums[1]=2 <=2, nums[2]=4>2, so idx=1)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=2-2=0, k+1=3, k+nums[idx]+1=2+4+1=7

Then, remove nums[idx]=2

So, nums becomes [1,4,8,...,1<<20,0,3,7]

Wait, but the sample output is m=1, a=[1], which is correct.

But according to this program, it would output m=23, with a=[1,4,8,...,1<<20,0,3,7]

This seems overly complicated and not minimal.

Moreover, in this sequence, [1] sums to 1, which is allowed, [4] sums to 4, [1,4] sums to 5, and so on.

But [0] sums to 0, which is not relevant since we're dealing with sums from 1 to n.

Also, [3] sums to 3, [7] sums to 7, etc.

But for n=2, k=2, we need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 2, and that subsequences can sum to 1.

In the sequence [1,4,8,...,1<<20,0,3,7], [1] sums to 1, which is good, and there is no subsequence that sums to 2.

So, for this test case, it seems correct, although not minimal.

But perhaps for other test cases, it might fail.

Let's take another test case: n=6, k=1

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<20]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=1, which is i=1 (nums[0]=1 <=1, nums[1]=2>1, so idx=0)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=1-1=0, k+1=2, k+nums[idx]+1=1+1+1=3

Remove nums[idx]=1

So, nums becomes [2,4,8,...,1<<20,0,2,3]

Now, possible sums:

[2]:2

[4]:4

[8]:8

...

[0]:0

[2]:2

[3]:3

Combinations:

[2,3]:5

[2,2]:4 (but 2 appears only once, so no duplicate 2's)

Wait, in this sequence, elements are unique unless explicitly duplicated.

Wait, in the program, nums.append(k - nums[idx]) etc., but nums is initially a list of distinct powers of 2, and then appends new elements.

So, in this case, nums is [2,4,8,...,1<<20,0,2,3]

But 2 is already in the list, so it's [2,4,8,...,1<<20,0,3]

Now, possible sums:

- [2]:2

- [4]:4

- [8]:8

- ...

- [0]:0

- [3]:3

- [2,3]:5

- [2,4]:6

- [3,4]:7

- etc.

So, sums include 2,3,4,5,6,7,...

But k=1 is not present, which is good.

So, for v=2 to 6 (since n=6), excluding k=1, we have sums 2,3,4,5,6.

Perfect.

Another test case: n=8, k=8

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<20]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=8, which is i=4 (nums[3]=8 <=8, nums[4]=16>8, so idx=3)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=8-8=0, k+1=9, k+nums[idx]+1=8+8+1=17

Remove nums[idx]=8

So, nums becomes [1,2,4,16,...,1<<20,0,9,17]

Possible sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [4]:4

- [16]:16

- ...

- [0]:0

- [9]:9

- [17]:17

- Combinations:

- [1,2]:3

- [1,4]:5

- [2,4]:6

- [1,2,4]:7

- [1,2,4,16]:23

- [0] :0

- [9]:9

- [17]:17

- [1,9]:10

- [2,9]:11

- etc.

But we need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 8, and that all other v from 1 to 8 except 8 can be formed.

From the above, sums include 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,... but not 8.

So, this seems correct.

Another test case: n=9, k=3

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<20]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=3, which is i=2 (nums[1]=2 <=3, nums[2]=4>3, so idx=1)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=3-2=1, k+1=4, k+nums[idx]+1=3+2+1=6

Remove nums[idx]=2

So, nums becomes [1,4,8,...,1<<20,1,4,6]

Wait, but 4 is already present, so nums is [1,4,8,...,1<<20,1,6]

Possible sums:

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [8]:8

- ...

- [1]:1

- [6]:6

- Combinations:

- [1,4]:5

- [1,6]:7

- [4,6]:10

- [1,4,6]:11

- etc.

But we need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 3, and that all other v from 1 to 9 except 3 can be formed.

From the above, sums include 1,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,...

But v=2 is missing.

Wait, v=2 is needed, since 2 ≠ k=3.

But in this sequence, there is no way to make 2.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, if nums is [1,4,8,...,1<<20,1,6], then perhaps there are duplicates.

Wait, there are two 1's.

So, [1,1] sums to 2.

Yes, so v=2 can be formed by [1,1].

So, that's covered.

Similarly, [1,4] sums to 5, [1,6] sums to 7, [4,6] sums to 10, etc.

And [1] sums to 1, which is allowed since k=3.

No subsequence sums to 3.

So, this seems correct.

Last test case: n=10, k=7

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<20]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=7, which is i=3 (nums[2]=4 <=7, nums[3]=8>7, so idx=2)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=7-4=3, k+1=8, k+nums[idx]+1=7+4+1=12

Remove nums[idx]=4

So, nums becomes [1,2,8,16,...,1<<20,3,8,12]

Possible sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [16]:16

- ...

- [3]:3

- [8]:8

- [12]:12

- Combinations:

- [1,2]:3

- [1,3]:4

- [2,3]:5

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,8]:9

- [2,8]:10

- [3,8]:11

- [1,2,3,8]:14

- [12]:12

- etc.

So, sums include 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,14,...

But v=7 is missing, which is good since k=7.

But v=7 is missing, which is k, so that's fine.

All other v from 1 to 10 except 7 can be formed.

Wait, but [3,4] would make 7, but 4 is not in the sequence.

Wait, in this sequence, 4 was removed, but 3 and 4 are not both present, so [3,4] is not possible.

Wait, in the modified nums, 4 was removed, so [3,4] is not possible.

Wait, but in the modified nums, after removing 4 and adding 3,8,12, do we have any subset that sums to 7?

Looking at the possible sums above, it seems 7 cannot be formed, which is good.

So, this seems correct.

Given that for the sample inputs, the program's output seems correct, although not minimal, it appears to satisfy the conditions.

However, in the fourth test case, initially, I thought it might be missing v=6, but actually, it includes it through [4,1,1].

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

To generalize, the approach seems to be:

- Start with powers of 2 up to 2^20 (which is over a million, so it can cover n up to 10^6).

- Find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k, say p.

- Remove p from the list.

- Add (k - p), (k + 1), and (k + p + 1) to the list.

The idea might be:

- By removing p, you're preventing the combination that sums to k.

- Adding (k - p) might help in covering other sums without allowing k.

- Adding (k + 1) and (k + p + 1) might be to cover higher sums.

But I'm not entirely sure about the correctness of this approach.

Let me try to think of a case where this might fail.

Suppose n=10, k=5.

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=5, which is i=3 (nums[2]=4 <=5, nums[3]=8>5, so idx=2)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=5-4=1, k+1=6, k+nums[idx]+1=5+4+1=10

Remove nums[idx]=4

So, nums becomes [1,2,8,...,1<<20,1,6,10]

Possible sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- ...

- [1]:1

- [6]:6

- [10]:10

- Combinations:

- [1,2]:3

- [1,6]:7

- [2,6]:8

- [1,10]:11

- [2,10]:12

- [6,10]:16

- [1,2,6]:9

- [1,2,10]:13

- etc.

So, sums include 1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,16,...

Missing 4,5.

But k=5 is missing, which is good, but v=4 should be present.

Wait, v=4 should be present since 4 ≠ k=5.

But in this sequence, [2,2] would be 4, but there's only one 2.

Alternatively, [1,3], but 3 is not in the sequence.

Wait, but in the sequence, there are two 1's and a 2.

Wait, nums is [1,2,8,...,1<<20,1,6,10]

So, there are two 1's and a 2.

So, [1,1,2] sums to 4.

Yes, so v=4 is covered.

Similarly, v=9 can be [1,2,6], and so on.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, k=4

According to the program:

nums = [1,2,4,8,...]

Find idx where nums[i] > k=4, which is i=3 (nums[2]=4 <=4, nums[3]=8>4, so idx=2)

Then, append k - nums[idx]=4-4=0, k+1=5, k+nums[idx]+1=4+4+1=9

Remove nums[idx]=4

So, nums becomes [1,2,8,...,1<<20,0,5,9]

Possible sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [1,9]:10

So, sums include 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,...

Missing 4, which is k, and v=3 is covered by [1,2].

So, this seems correct.

From these observations, it seems that the program's approach is correct.

It constructs a sequence that cannot sum to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n except k.

Moreover, the sequence has at most 25 elements: starting with 21 powers of 2, adding 3 elements, and removing 1, resulting in 23 elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to create a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific sum conditions related to the given values \( n \) and \( k \). 

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need a sequence where no subsequence sums to \( k \).
    - Every integer from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) should be achievable as a sum of some subsequence.
   
2. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
    - Start with the first 21 powers of 2, which allow us to represent any number up to \( 2^{20} \), which is more than sufficient given \( n \leq 10^6 \).

3. **Modifying the Sequence**:
    - Identify the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
    - Remove this power of 2 from the sequence.
    - Add specific values to the sequence to block the sum \( k \) while ensuring other sums are still achievable:
        - Add \( k - \text{removed power of 2} \) to handle cases where \( k \) is a sum involving the removed power.
        - Add \( k + 1 \) and \( k + \text{removed power of 2} + 1 \) to cover higher sums appropriately.

4. **Output the Sequence**:
    - The modified sequence will have at most 23 elements (21 initial powers of 2 minus one removed power plus two new elements), which is within the limit of 25 elements.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Execution**:
    - For each test case, we read \( n \) and \( k \).
    - Generate the first 21 powers of 2.
    - Determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
    - Append \( k - \text{this power of 2} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + \text{this power of 2} + 1 \) to the sequence.
    - Remove the identified power of 2 from the sequence.
    - Output the size of the modified sequence and the sequence itself.

- **Correctness**:
    - By removing a specific power of 2 and adding carefully chosen numbers, we ensure that no subsequence sums to \( k \), while still allowing all other sums from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \).

This approach guarantees a sequence that meets the problem's constraints efficiently and within the specified limits.
