Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into a prefix and a suffix, swap them, and concatenate them back together. For example, if you have [3,1,4,1,5], you can split it into [3,1] and [4,1,5], then swap them to get [4,1,5,3,1]. The question is, can this array become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing this operation some number of times?

First, I need to understand what this operation does. Splitting into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them is essentially rotating the array. For example, splitting [3,1,4,1,5] into [3,1] and [4,1,5], swapping to get [4,1,5,3,1], which is like rotating the array by 2 positions to the left.

Wait, is it exactly like rotation? Let's think about it. Rotation typically means shifting all elements by a certain number of positions, with the elements wrapping around. In this operation, we're splitting at any point and swapping the two parts. So, for example, splitting after the first element and swapping would turn [3,1,4,1,5] into [1,4,1,5,3]. Splitting after the second element and swapping would turn it into [4,1,5,3,1], as in the example. So, yes, it's similar to rotation, but with the swap, it's like rotating and then reversing the order of the two parts.

But actually, since we're swapping the prefix and suffix, it's not exactly a single rotation, but it can be seen as a combination of rotation and reversal. Wait, no. Let's clarify: rotation would be shifting elements in a circular manner, whereas this operation is splitting into two parts and swapping them.

Given that, I need to determine if, by performing this swap operation any number of times, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, let's consider what operations are allowed. Each operation consists of choosing a split point, dividing the array into a prefix and a suffix at that point, and swapping them. For example, with [3,1,4,1,5]:

- Split after index 0: prefix=[] suffix=[3,1,4,1,5], swap gives [3,1,4,1,5] (no change)

- Split after index 1: prefix=[3], suffix=[1,4,1,5], swap gives [1,4,1,5,3]

- Split after index 2: prefix=[3,1], suffix=[4,1,5], swap gives [4,1,5,3,1]

- Split after index 3: prefix=[3,1,4], suffix=[1,5], swap gives [1,5,3,1,4]

- Split after index 4: prefix=[3,1,4,1], suffix=[5], swap gives [5,3,1,4,1]

- Split after index 5: prefix=[3,1,4,1,5], suffix=[], swap gives [3,1,4,1,5] (no change)

So, by performing this operation, we can generate different permutations of the array.

Now, the question is, can we reach a sorted version of the array through these operations?

First, let's consider that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order. That means, after some number of these swap operations, the array should be in a non-decreasing sequence.

I need to find out if it's possible to achieve a non-decreasing sequence through these operations.

Let me think about the properties of these operations. Each operation is splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. This is similar to reversing a substring, but not exactly, because we're only swapping two parts.

Wait, no. Reversing a substring would involve reversing the order of elements within that substring, whereas here, we're swapping two parts of the array.

Let me consider the effect of performing this operation multiple times.

Suppose I have an array [a, b, c, d]. Let's see what operations I can perform:

- Split after index 0: [] and [a,b,c,d], swap gives [a,b,c,d]

- Split after index 1: [a] and [b,c,d], swap gives [b,c,d,a]

- Split after index 2: [a,b] and [c,d], swap gives [c,d,a,b]

- Split after index 3: [a,b,c] and [d], swap gives [d,a,b,c]

- Split after index 4: [a,b,c,d] and [], swap gives [a,b,c,d]

So, the possible arrays after one operation are:

- [a,b,c,d]

- [b,c,d,a]

- [c,d,a,b]

- [d,a,b,c]

Wait, these are exactly the rotations of the array.

Wait, but in rotation, you shift the elements circularly by one position each time. Here, swapping prefix and suffix is equivalent to rotating the array by the length of the prefix.

Wait, let's see:

- Split after index 1: [a] and [b,c,d], swap to [b,c,d,a] — this is rotating left by 1

- Split after index 2: [a,b] and [c,d], swap to [c,d,a,b] — rotating left by 2

- Split after index 3: [a,b,c] and [d], swap to [d,a,b,c] — rotating left by 3

So, indeed, these operations correspond to left rotations by 1, 2, 3 positions, and also doing nothing (split after 0 or n).

Therefore, performing this operation is equivalent to rotating the array to the left by any number of positions.

Wait, but rotation is a cyclic shift, and by performing multiple rotations, you can achieve any cyclic permutation of the array.

But in this problem, can we achieve any permutation of the array through these operations? Wait, no. Because rotation only gives us cyclic permutations, not all possible permutations.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with [3,1,4,1,5], performing the operation multiple times would allow us to rotate the array in cycles, but not to rearrange the elements in any arbitrary order.

Wait, but in the second test case of the example, they perform two operations:

- Start with [7,9,2,2,3]

- Split into [7] and [9,2,2,3], swap to get [9,2,2,3,7]

- Then split into [9] and [2,2,3,7], swap to get [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, in this case, they performed two operations to sort the array.

Wait, but is this equivalent to rotating the array? Let's see:

- Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

- After first operation: [9,2,2,3,7]

- After second operation: [2,2,3,7,9]

Is this achievable through rotations?

Wait, rotating left by 1 from original: [9,2,2,3,7]

Rotating left by 2 from original: [2,2,3,7,9]

So, yes, in this case, sorting is achieved by rotating left by 2 positions.

In the first test case:

- [1,1,4,5,1,4]

- Check if any rotation makes it sorted.

- Rotations:

- [1,1,4,5,1,4] (original)

- [1,4,5,1,4,1]

- [4,5,1,4,1,1]

- [5,1,4,1,1,4]

- [1,4,1,1,4,5]

- [4,1,1,4,5,1]

None of these are sorted in non-decreasing order, so output is "No".

In the third test case:

- [1,2,3]

- Already sorted, so "Yes".

So, the problem seems to be checking if the array can be sorted by rotations.

But in the problem statement, it says "split into a prefix and a suffix, swap them". Which, as we saw, is equivalent to rotating the array.

So, the problem is to check if the array can be sorted by rotating it any number of times.

But in the example, for the second test case, they performed two operations to sort it. But in reality, a single rotation of two positions achieves the same.

So, perhaps the problem allows multiple rotations, but in practice, any number of rotations can be achieved by a single rotation, since rotations are cyclic.

Wait, more precisely, in a cyclic group, any rotation can be achieved by repeated application of a generator rotation.

But in this case, since we can perform any number of operations, each of which is a rotation by any number of positions, it's effectively allowing any rotation.

So, perhaps the problem is to check if there exists a rotation that sorts the array.

But in the first test case, no rotation sorts the array.

In the second test case, rotating left by 2 positions sorts it.

In the third test case, it's already sorted.

So, perhaps the problem is to check if there exists a rotation that sorts the array.

But let's look at the code provided to see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])

if check_all:

print('YES')

else:

for i in range(1, n):

if a[i - 1] > a[i]:

new = a[i:]

check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])

new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])

if check_all_new and new_all:

print('YES')

break

else:

print('NO')

break

So, the code first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it prints 'YES'.

If not, it looks for the first position where a[i-1] > a[i]. Then, it takes the suffix starting from a[i] to the end, and checks two things:

1. That all elements in this suffix are less than or equal to a[0].

2. That the suffix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

If both these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

Wait, but in the example, for the second test case:

Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

First a[i-1] > a[i] at i=2 (9 > 2).

Then, new = a[2:] = [2,2,3]

Check_all_new: a[0] = 7 >= all in new: 7 >=2, 7>=2, 7>=3 → True

New_all: [2,2,3] is sorted → True

So, prints 'YES'

In the first test case:

[1,1,4,5,1,4]

First a[i-1] > a[i] at i=5 (5 > 1).

Then, new = a[5:] = [4]

Check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=4 → False

So, prints 'NO'

In the third test case:

[1,2,3]

Already sorted, prints 'YES'

So, the code seems to be implementing the logic to check if there exists a rotation that sorts the array.

But is this the correct way to check if a rotation exists that sorts the array?

Let me think about it.

Suppose the array is not sorted. Find the first descent, i.e., the first i where a[i-1] > a[i].

Then, take the suffix starting from a[i], and check if:

1. This suffix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. All elements in this suffix are less than or equal to a[0].

If both are true, then it's possible to sort the array by rotating it so that this suffix becomes the prefix.

Wait, why is this the case?

Suppose the array has one descent, and after that descent, the remaining elements are sorted and all less than or equal to a[0].

Then, by rotating the array so that the suffix becomes the prefix, we can achieve a sorted array.

For example, in the second test case:

Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

First descent at i=2 (9 > 2)

Suffix: [2,2,3]

This suffix is sorted, and all elements are less than or equal to a[0]=7.

So, rotating to make [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

Another example:

[3,4,5,1,2]

First descent at i=3 (5 > 1)

Suffix: [1,2]

Sorted, and 1<=3, 2<=3.

So, rotating to [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

But, is this condition sufficient and necessary?

Let me think about a case where the array can be sorted by rotation, but this condition is not met.

Suppose [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

If we rotate it to [7,9,2,2,3], which is the same as the second test case.

Here, a[0]=7 > a[3]=2, a[4]=3.

So, in this case, the condition is met.

Another example: [1,2,3,4,5]

Any rotation:

- [2,3,4,5,1]

Here, a[0]=2 > a[4]=1

Suffix starting from i=4: [5,1]

But 5 >1, so not sorted.

Wait, but in this case, [2,3,4,5,1] cannot be sorted by further rotations that maintain the sorted order.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform the operation any number of times.

But in this case, [2,3,4,5,1] -> [5,1,2,3,4] -> [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

But according to the code, for [2,3,4,5,1], it would find the first descent at i=4 (5>1), take new=[1], check if a[0]=2 >=1 (True), and [1] is sorted (True), so it would print 'YES', which is correct.

But is there any case where this logic fails?

Let me think about an array that cannot be sorted by any rotation.

For example, [1,3,2]

First descent at i=2 (3>2), new=[2]

a[0]=1 >=2? No, 1<2, so check_all_new is False, prints 'NO', which is correct, because no rotation can sort [1,3,2].

Another example: [2,1,3]

First descent at i=1 (2>1), new=[1,3]

Check if a[0]=2 >=1 and 2>=3? 2>=1 is True, but 2>=3 is False, so check_all_new is False, prints 'NO', which is correct.

Another example: [1,3,2,4]

First descent at i=2 (3>2), new=[2,4]

Check if a[0]=1 >=2? No, 1<2, so 'NO'

But wait, can this array be sorted by rotations?

Rotating left by 1: [3,2,4,1]

Rotating left by 2: [2,4,1,3]

Rotating left by 3: [4,1,3,2]

None of these are sorted, so correctly 'NO'

Seems like the logic holds.

Another example: [4,5,1,2,3]

First descent at i=1 (4>1), new=[1,2,3]

Check if a[0]=4 >=1, 4>=2, 4>=3 → True

And [1,2,3] is sorted → 'YES'

Indeed, rotating to [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

Seems correct.

So, the code seems to correctly implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by rotations.

Therefore, I would say the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
