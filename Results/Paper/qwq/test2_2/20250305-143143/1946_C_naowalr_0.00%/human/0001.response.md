Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, and I need to find the maximum number x such that when I remove exactly k edges from the tree, each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. Sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a tree is. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges for n vertices. That means in this problem, for n vertices, there are n-1 edges, as given in the input.

The task is to remove exactly k edges, and after removal, all the resulting connected components should have at least x vertices, where x is as large as possible.

I need to process multiple test cases, up to 10,000 of them, and the total number of vertices across all test cases doesn't exceed 100,000. So, efficiency is key here.

Looking at the example provided:

In the first test case, n=5 and k=1. The tree is:

1-2

| \

3-4 5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: one with vertices 1 and 2, and another with vertices 3,4,5. Both have at least 2 vertices, and apparently, it's not possible to achieve x=3 in this case.

Okay, so I need a systematic way to find the maximum x for each test case.

I think a binary search approach could work here because x can range from 1 to n, and I need to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

So, I'll perform a binary search on x, and for each x, I'll check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To check for a particular x, I need to find out how many edges I need to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices. If the number of edges I need to remove is equal to k, then x is feasible.

How do I find out how many edges to remove for a given x?

I need to perform a DFS on the tree and count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices. The number of edges to remove would be one less than the number of such subtrees, because each removal separates one subtree.

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let's think differently.

In a tree, removing an edge splits the tree into exactly two connected components. So, if I remove k edges, I'll have k+1 connected components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices after removal is n, and each component must have at least x vertices. Therefore, (k+1)*x <= n.

This gives an upper bound for x: x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

So, the maximum possible x cannot exceed floor(n / (k+1)). I can use this to set the upper limit for my binary search.

Now, for each x in the binary search, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can perform a DFS to count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices. The number of edges to remove would be the number of such subtrees minus one, because to separate m subtrees, I need to remove m-1 edges.

Wait, no. Actually, in a tree, the number of connected components is equal to the number of subtrees minus the number of edges removed. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

In a tree, removing one edge increases the number of connected components by one.

Starting from one component (the whole tree), removing k edges will result in k+1 components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices in all components is n, and each component has at least x vertices, so k+1 <= floor(n/x).

Wait, but I need to maximize x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all components with at least x vertices.

I think the correct approach is:

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to floor(n/(k+1)).

- For each x, check if the tree can be divided into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing exactly k edges.

To check this, I can perform a DFS to count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices.

- If the number of such subtrees is m, then I need to remove m-1 edges to separate them.

- So, if m-1 == k, then it's possible for this x.

But wait, in the example, n=5, k=1.

Floor(5/2) = 2, so x can be up to 2.

In the first test case, m should be the number of subtrees with at least 2 vertices.

If x=2, the tree has two such subtrees: {1,2,3} and {3,4,5}, but removing one edge can separate them into {1,2} and {3,4,5}, which are both of size at least 2.

So, m=2, m-1=1=k, so x=2 is possible.

But x=3: floor(5/2)=2, but let's check x=3.

If x=3, then subtrees with at least 3 vertices are {1,2,3,4,5} (the whole tree), and no smaller subtrees have at least 3 vertices.

So, m=1, m-1=0 !=1, so x=3 is not possible.

Hence, x=2 is the maximum possible.

This seems correct.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read n-1 edges and build the adjacency list.

- Set L=1, R=floor(n/(k+1))+1.

- Perform binary search on x.

- For each x, perform DFS to count the number of subtrees with at least x vertices.

- If the number of such subtrees minus one equals k, then x is possible.

- Try to maximize x.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar.

Looking at the provided code:

def func_1():

t = int(sys.stdin.readline())

for z in range(t):

(n, k) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]

for i in range(n - 1):

(a, b) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

adj[a].append(b)

adj[b].append(a)

L = 1

R = int(100000.0 + 1)

numCuts = 0

while R - L > 1:

x = (L + R) // 2

numCuts = 0

leftover = dfs(1, 1)

if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x):

L = x

else:

R = x

print(L)

def dfs(a, p):

global numCuts

vertices = 1

for b in adj[a]:

if b != p:

vertices += dfs(b, a)

if vertices >= x and a != p:

numCuts += 1

return 0

return vertices

So, it's performing a binary search on x from 1 to 100001.

Wait, R is set to 100001, which is larger than n, but n can be up to 100,000.

But floor(n/(k+1)) can be up to floor(100,000 / 2) = 50,000, but in some cases, k=1 and n=2, floor(2/2)=1.

So, setting R to 100,001 might not be precise, but since the while loop continues until R - L > 1, and x is updated as (L + R) // 2, it should still converge correctly.

In the dfs function:

- It counts the number of vertices in the subtree rooted at a.

- If the subtree has at least x vertices and a is not the root (a != p), then it's a candidate for separation, so numCuts +=1 and returns 0 to exclude these vertices from the parent's count.

- Finally, it returns the number of vertices in the subtree.

In the binary search:

- For each x, it calculates numCuts.

- If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), set L = x.

- Else, set R = x.

Wait, what is leftover? In the code, leftover = dfs(1,1), which returns the number of vertices in the component that includes node 1 after accounting for the cuts.

But in the condition, if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), L = x.

This seems to be ensuring that:

- If numCuts > k, meaning we can make more than k cuts for this x, so x is too small.

- If numCuts == k and the leftover component has at least x vertices, then x is feasible.

Hence, moving L to x in these cases means that x is a possible candidate, and we can try larger x.

Otherwise, R is set to x, meaning x is too large.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the first test case:

n=5, k=1

Tree:

1-2

| \

3-4 5

Let's try x=2:

Perform dfs(1,1):

- a=1, p=1

- vertices = 1 + dfs(2,1) + dfs(3,1)

- dfs(2,1):

- a=2, p=1

- vertices = 1 + dfs(1,2) [but 1 is p, so ignored] + dfs(no others)

- return 1

- dfs(3,1):

- a=3, p=1

- vertices = 1 + dfs(4,3) + dfs(5,3)

- dfs(4,3):

- a=4, p=3

- return 1

- dfs(5,3):

- a=5, p=3

- return 1

- so vertices = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

- since vertices >=2 and a != p, numCuts +=1, return 0

- so total vertices from a=1: 1 (from a=1) + 1 (from a=2) + 0 (from a=3, since it was cut) = 2

- numCuts =1

- So, numCuts ==k=1 and leftover=2 >=x=2, so L=x=2

Then, in the next iteration, if R - L >1, continue.

If x=3:

Perform dfs(1,1):

- a=1, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(2,1) + dfs(3,1)

- dfs(2,1):

- a=2, p=1

- return 1

- dfs(3,1):

- a=3, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(4,3) + dfs(5,3)

- return 1 +1 +1 =3

- since vertices >=3 and a != p, numCuts +=1, return 0

- so total vertices from a=1: 1 +1 +0 =1

- numCuts=1

- leftover=1 < x=3, so set R=x=3

Hence, L=2, R=3, R - L =1, stop the loop, output L=2, which is correct.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6, k=1

Tree:

1-2-3-4-5-6

Let's try x=3:

Perform dfs(1,1):

- a=1, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(2,1)

- dfs(2,1):

- a=2, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(3,2)

- dfs(3,2):

- a=3, p=2

- vertices =1 + dfs(4,3)

- dfs(4,3):

- a=4, p=3

- vertices =1 + dfs(5,4)

- dfs(5,4):

- a=5, p=4

- vertices =1 + dfs(6,5)

- dfs(6,5):

- a=6, p=5

- return 1

- so vertices=1+1=2 <3, return 2

- so vertices=1+2=3 >=3 and a != p, numCuts +=1, return 0

- so total vertices from a=1:1 +0=1

- numCuts=1

- leftover=1 < x=3, so set R=x=3

Then, with L=2, R=3, R - L =1, stop, output L=2

But in the sample output, it's 3 for this test case.

Wait, no, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

Output:

2

So, for n=6, k=1, output is 3.

But in my simulation above, it sets L=2, R=3, and outputs L=2, but sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let's try again.

For x=3:

Perform dfs(1,1):

- a=1, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(2,1)

- dfs(2,1):

- a=2, p=1

- vertices =1 + dfs(3,2)

- dfs(3,2):

- a=3, p=2

- vertices =1 + dfs(4,3)

- dfs(4,3):

- a=4, p=3

- vertices =1 + dfs(5,4)

- dfs(5,4):

- a=5, p=4

- vertices =1 + dfs(6,5)

- dfs(6,5):

- a=6, p=5

- return 1

- so vertices=1+1=2 <3, return 2

- so vertices=1+2=3 >=3 and a != p, numCuts +=1, return 0

- so total vertices from a=1:1 +0=1

- numCuts=1

- leftover=1 < x=3, so set R=x=3

Then, L=2, R=3, R - L =1, stop, output L=2

But sample output is 3.

Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Looking back at the code:

if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x):

L = x

else:

R = x

In this case, numCuts ==1 ==k, and leftover=1 <x=3, so R =x=3

Then L=2, R=3, R - L =1, stop, output L=2

But sample output is 3.

So, perhaps the condition should be:

if numCuts >=k and leftover >=x:

L =x

else:

R =x

Wait, in the code, it's:

if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x):

L = x

else:

R = x

In the above simulation, numCuts ==k and leftover <x, so set R=x

Hence, L=2, R=3, output L=2, but sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the condition.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the maximum x such that I can remove exactly k edges to get components with at least x vertices each.

So, for x=3 in the above test case, it's not possible to remove exactly one edge to get both components with at least 3 vertices.

As seen, removing any one edge results in one component with 2 vertices and another with 4 vertices. So, x=3 is not achievable, hence x=2 is correct.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Looking back:

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

2

So, for n=6, k=1, output=3.

Wait, but in my simulation, it seems x=3 is not achievable.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the approach.

Let me look at the tree for n=6, k=1:

1-2-3-4-5-6

If I remove the edge between 3 and 4, I get two components: {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices, which satisfies x=3.

Ah, I see. So, x=3 is achievable by removing the edge between 3 and 4.

In my earlier simulation, I started DFS from 1, and when x=3, it counted the subtree rooted at 2 as having 3 vertices (1,2,3), and numCuts=1, leftover=1 <3, so R=3.

But in reality, x=3 is achievable by removing a different edge.

So, perhaps the DFS approach needs to consider all possible subtrees, not just those rooted at a particular node.

Wait, no. In the DFS approach, starting from any root, it should consider all subtrees.

In this case, starting from 1, when x=3, it counts the subtree rooted at 2 as having 3 vertices, so numCuts +=1, and returns 0, meaning the parent (1) only has 1 vertex left.

But in reality, removing the edge between 2 and 3 would separate {1,2} and {3,4,5,6}, which are sizes 2 and 4, which doesn't satisfy x=3.

But removing the edge between 3 and 4 separates {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both of size 3.

So, the DFS approach might not be correctly capturing this.

Wait, perhaps the DFS approach needs to consider the optimal way to make cuts.

Alternatively, maybe the DFS approach is correct, but I need to adjust the condition in the binary search.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set x=3 for n=6, k=1.

I need to remove exactly one edge such that both resulting components have at least 3 vertices.

As shown, removing the edge between 3 and 4 achieves this.

So, for x=3, it should be possible.

In the DFS approach, when x=3:

- Starting from 1:

- dfs(1,1):

- vertices =1 + dfs(2,1) + dfs(3,2)

- dfs(2,1):

- vertices =1 + dfs(3,2)

- dfs(3,2):

- vertices =1 + dfs(4,3)

- dfs(4,3):

- vertices =1 + dfs(5,4)

- dfs(5,4):

- vertices =1 + dfs(6,5)

- dfs(6,5):

- return 1

- so dfs(5,4)=1+1=2 <3, return 2

- dfs(4,3)=1+2=3 >=3, numCuts +=1, return 0

- dfs(3,2)=1+0=1 <3, return 1

- dfs(2,1)=1+1=2 <3, return 2

- dfs(1,1)=1+2+0=3 >=3, numCuts +=1, return 0

- numCuts=2 >1, so set L=x=3

Wait, in this simulation, numCuts=2 >k=1, so set L=x=3

Then, in the next iteration, R - L =3 -2=1, stop, output L=3, which matches the sample output.

Ah, so my earlier simulation was incorrect because numCuts=2, not 1.

Wait, but according to the code, if numCuts >k, set L=x.

But in this case, numCuts=2 >1, so L=3

Then, if R - L <=1, stop and output L=3

Yes, that matches the sample output.

So, in this case, x=3 is achievable by removing two edges, but the condition is numCuts >k, which suggests that for x=3, numCuts=2 >1, so L=3

Wait, but we need exactly k cuts, not more, not less.

So, perhaps the condition needs to be adjusted.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if numCuts >k or (numCuts ==k and leftover >=x):

L =x

else:

R =x

In this case, numCuts=2 >1, so L=3

Then, in the next iteration, R - L =3 -2=1, stop, output L=3

But in reality, for x=3, numCuts=2 >1, which means we can make more cuts than required, but the condition is to make exactly k cuts.

So, perhaps the condition should be numCuts ==k and leftover >=x to set L=x, else R=x.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the condition.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the maximum x such that by removing exactly k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

So, for a given x, if the number of cuts needed is less than or equal to k, and the leftover component has at least x vertices, then x is feasible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of cuts required for a given x.

If the number of subtrees with at least x vertices is m, then the number of cuts needed is m-1.

So, I need m-1 ==k.

Hence, in the binary search:

- If m-1 ==k, then x is feasible, try larger x.

- If m-1 <k, then it's not possible, so x is too large, set R=x

- If m-1 >k, then x is too small, set L=x

Wait, but in the code, it's:

if numCuts >k or (numCuts ==k and leftover >=x):

L =x

else:

R =x

But in my new understanding:

- If m-1 >k: x is too small, set L=x

- If m-1 <k: x is too large, set R=x

- If m-1 ==k: x is feasible, try larger x

So, in terms of numCuts = m-1:

- If numCuts >k: x is too small, set L=x

- If numCuts <k: x is too large, set R=x

- If numCuts ==k: x is feasible, set L=x

Which matches the code's condition.

Hence, the code seems correct.

In the earlier simulation, for x=3, numCuts=2 >1, so set L=3

Then, R=3, L=2, R - L =1, stop, output L=3

But in reality, for x=3, it's possible by removing one edge to achieve it.

Hence, the code seems correct.

I must have miscounted numCuts in the earlier simulation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
