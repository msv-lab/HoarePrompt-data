Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand the specifics here.

So, the problem is: Given a tree with n vertices, I need to find the maximum number x such that I can remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that every remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

The task is to remove exactly k edges, not less, not more, and after removal, all resulting connected components should have at least x vertices. I need to maximize x.

Let's think about how removing edges affects the tree. Each time I remove an edge, I split the tree into two smaller trees. So, removing one edge from a tree with n vertices will result in two trees, say of sizes a and b, where a + b = n.

If I remove another edge, I can choose to remove it from either of these two trees, further splitting them.

I need to perform exactly k removals, and after that, all resulting components should have at least x vertices.

I need to maximize x, which means I want the smallest possible components after removal, but since x is the minimum size of any component, maximizing x means that even the smallest component should be as large as possible.

Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. Let me rephrase: I need to maximize the minimum size of any component after removing exactly k edges.

So, it's like balancing the sizes of the components, ensuring none are too small.

Given that it's a tree, and removing edges splits it into components, I need a way to split the tree into k+1 components (since each edge removal increases the number of components by one), each with at least x vertices.

But wait, removing k edges will result in k+1 components. So, I need to distribute the n vertices into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Mathematically, (k+1)*x <= n, because the total number of vertices can't exceed n.

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n / (k+1)).

But is it that simple? Probably not, because the tree's structure matters. Maybe not all trees can be split in this way.

Looking back at the problem, it says "exactly k edges", which means I have to remove exactly k edges, not more or less.

Also, the components must each have at least x vertices.

I need to find the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and achieve this.

I should consider that in a tree, the way edges are removed can affect the sizes of the resulting components.

For example, if I have a straight line of n vertices, and I remove k edges in a way that splits it into k+1 components, each component will have roughly n/(k+1) vertices.

But in a more complex tree, the sizes might vary depending on where I remove the edges.

I need a systematic way to find x.

Perhaps a binary search approach on x, where for each x, I check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and t (number of test cases) up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution.

First, I need to process t test cases, each with a tree of up to 1e5 vertices, and k up to n-1.

With t=1e4 and n=1e5, the total input size is up to 1e9 operations, which is too slow for a naive approach. But since t=1e4 and n=1e5 with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, it's manageable.

Wait, the problem says "It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.", so total operations are acceptable.

Now, back to the binary search idea.

I can perform a binary search on x, the minimum size of components.

For each candidate x, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

How can I check this efficiently?

In a tree, the number of edges that need to be removed to split it into components of at least x vertices can be determined by counting the number of edges that, when removed, separate a subtree of size at least x from the rest of the tree.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of edges whose removal results in two components, both of size at least x.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, so I need to choose k such edges.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform a DFS on the tree and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for a candidate x, I can count the number of edges that, when removed, separate a subtree of size at least x.

If the number of such edges is greater than or equal to k, then it might be possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

But I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as: the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size at least x is equal to the number of such edges.

If this number is at least k, then it's possible to remove k such edges.

But I need to make sure that after removing these k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Is this always true?

Maybe not.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that removing an edge that separates a subtree of size at least x from the rest will result in two components, both with at least x vertices, provided that the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Wait, no. If I remove an edge that separates a subtree of size s >= x from the rest, and the rest has n - s >= x, then both components have at least x vertices.

So, for each such edge, if s >= x and n - s >= x, then removing it results in two components, each with at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look at it differently.

Suppose I want to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Then, I need to find if there exists a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each of size at least x.

This is equivalent to finding a way to remove k edges such that each resulting component has at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to find the largest x possible under these constraints.

Given that, perhaps I can use a binary search on x, and for each x, check if the tree can be partitioned into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

How can I check this efficiently?

I can perform a DFS and count the number of subtrees that have size at least x.

Wait, not exactly.

Actually, in tree partitioning, the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size at least x is equal to the number of such subtrees minus one.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, so I need to have k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices.

So, I need to find if there are at least k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices, such that removing k edges separates them.

But this is still vague.

Let me think about the example provided.

In the first example:

5 vertices, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

  ├─4

  └─5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, x=2 is possible.

But x=3 is not possible because {1,2} has only 2 vertices.

Hence, the answer is 2.

From this, I can see that I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the number of components, but since I have to remove exactly k edges, I will have k+1 components.

Each of these must have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices is n, so (k+1)*x <= n.

Hence, x <= floor(n / (k+1))

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n / (k+1)).

But I need to check if it's possible to achieve this x in the tree structure.

In the example, n=5, k=1, k+1=2, floor(5/2)=2, which matches the answer.

In the second test case:

2 vertices, k=1

Edges:

1-2

Removing the only edge results in two components: {1} and {2}.

So, x=1 is possible.

In the third test case:

6 vertices, k=1

A straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6

Removing any edge will result in two components, each with at least 3 vertices.

Wait, no. If I remove edge between 3 and 4, I get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

So, x=3 is possible.

But if I try x=4, I need each component to have at least 4 vertices.

With k=1, I have two components.

n=6, k+1=2, floor(6/2)=3.

But the answer is 3, which matches floor(n/(k+1)).

Wait, but the problem says "maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges so that each component has at least x vertices".

In this case, x=3 is possible, but is x=4 possible?

If I remove one edge, say between 3 and 4, I get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

I can't get components with at least 4 vertices by removing one edge.

Hence, x=3 is the maximum possible.

So, in this case, floor(n/(k+1))=3 is achievable.

Hence, the answer is 3.

In the fourth test case:

3 vertices, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

Removing edge 1-2 results in components {1,3} and {2}, both with at least 1 vertex.

Similarly, removing 1-3 results in {1,2} and {3}.

So, x=1 is possible.

x=2 would require both components to have at least 2 vertices, but in both cases, one component has only one vertex.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum.

In the fifth test case:

8 vertices, k=2

Tree structure is:

1

├─2

│  ├─4

│  └─5

└─3

   ├─6

   ├─7

   └─8

Removing two edges, say 1-2 and 1-3, results in three components: {1}, {2,4,5}, {3,6,7,8}.

But {1} has only one vertex, which is less than x=1, so x=1 is possible but not greater.

Wait, but the answer is 1, meaning x=1 is achievable, but x=2 is not.

If I try x=2, I need all components to have at least 2 vertices.

But one component is {1}, which has only one vertex.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum.

In the sixth test case:

6 vertices, k=2

Tree is:

1

├─2

│  └─3

└─4

   ├─5

   └─6

Removing edges 1-2 and 1-4 results in three components: {1}, {2,3}, {4,5,6}.

x=1 is achievable.

x=2: {1} has only one vertex, so x=2 is not achievable.

Hence, x=1 is the answer.

But according to the output, it's 2.

Wait, the output for the sixth test case is 2.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let me see:

6 vertices, k=2.

Removing edges 2-3 and 4-5.

Then, the components are {1,2}, {3}, {4,5,6}.

But {3} has only one vertex, which is less than x=2.

So, x=2 is not achievable.

Wait, but the output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a different way to remove edges.

If I remove edges 1-2 and 4-5, then components are {1}, {2}, {3}, {4,5,6}.

{1} and {2} have only one vertex.

Not good.

If I remove edges 1-4 and 2-3, then components are {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}.

Both have at least 3 vertices.

Wait, but x=3 is possible.

But according to the output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Wait, the output for all six test cases is:

2

1

3

1

1

2

So, for the sixth test case, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me try again.

In the sixth test case:

6 vertices, k=2.

Edges:

1-2

2-3

1-4

4-5

5-6

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

│  └─3

└─4

   ├─5

   └─6

If I remove edges 1-2 and 4-5, I get components {1,4,5,6} and {2,3}.

{1,4,5,6} has 4 vertices, {2,3} has 2 vertices.

Both have at least 2 vertices.

Is x=3 possible?

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-4, I get {1}, {2,3}, {4,5,6}.

{1} has only one vertex, which is less than 3.

If I remove edges 2-3 and 4-5, I get {1,2}, {3}, {4,5,6}.

{3} has only one vertex.

If I remove edges 1-2 and 5-6, I get {1,4,5,6}, {2,3}.

{1,4,5,6} has 4, {2,3} has 2.

x=2 is achievable.

x=3 is not achievable because any way I remove two edges, I end up with at least one component with only two vertices.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the output, it's 2 for the sixth test case.

Hence, x=2 is the answer.

So, perhaps in some cases, x is limited by the structure of the tree, and floor(n/(k+1)) is not always achievable.

Hence, I need to find the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and all components have at least x vertices, considering the tree's structure.

Hence, a binary search on x seems appropriate.

For each x, I need to check if I can remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To implement this, I can perform a DFS and count the number of subtrees that can be separated by removing edges, each having at least x vertices.

Then, if the number of such edges is at least k, and the remaining components after removing k edges all have at least x vertices, then x is achievable.

But I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cuts I can make.

Each time I remove an edge that separates a subtree of at least x vertices from the rest of the tree (which also has at least x vertices), I can make a cut.

But this might not lead me directly to the solution.

I need a way to count the number of edges that can be removed while ensuring that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number equals k.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, not necessarily the minimal number.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that removing an edge that separates a subtree of size at least x from the rest of the tree (which also has at least x vertices) is a valid removal.

Then, the number of such edges is the number of valid removals.

If the number of valid removals is greater than or equal to k, then I can remove k such edges.

However, I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This might not be directly equivalent.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of edges that can be removed without creating any component smaller than x.

Then, the maximum number of edges I can remove is equal to the number of edges that separate subtrees of size at least x from the rest.

If this number is greater than or equal to k, then I can remove k such edges, and all resulting components will have at least x vertices.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Hence, for a given x, I can calculate the number of edges that can be removed without creating components smaller than x.

If this number is at least k, then x is achievable.

Otherwise, it's not.

Hence, I can perform a binary search on x, from 1 to n.

For each x, I calculate the number of removable edges, and check if it's at least k.

If it is, I try a larger x; otherwise, I choose a smaller x.

This seems feasible.

Now, how to calculate the number of removable edges for a given x.

I can perform a DFS and for each node, calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, for each edge, if both the subtree and the remaining tree have at least x vertices, then this edge can be removed.

Count the number of such edges.

If this count is at least k, then x is achievable.

Otherwise, it's not.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to n.

- For each x, perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- Count the number of edges where both subtrees have at least x vertices.

- If this number is at least k, set L = x.

- Otherwise, set R = x.

- Finally, output L.

But performing a DFS for each x would be too slow, since t=1e4 and n=1e5, total n is 1e5, but if I do DFS for each x, it would be t * n log n, which might be too slow.

Wait, but in the problem, it's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, so total operations would be log n per test case, which should be acceptable.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, no, since x varies per test case, I need to perform the binary search per test case.

Hence, total operations would be t * log n * n, which is about 1e4 * 20 * 1e5 = 2e10 operations, which is too much.

Wait, no, sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, so total operations would be t * log n * n_total = 1e4 * log(1e5) * 1e5, which is about 1e4 * 17 * 1e5 = 1.7e10 operations, which is too slow.

Hence, I need a faster way.

Perhaps I can optimize the calculation of the number of removable edges for a given x.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of edges where one side has at least x vertices and the other side has at least x vertices.

In other words, for each edge, if the subtree size is >= x and the remaining tree size is >= x, then this edge can be removed.

Hence, for each edge, I can check if the subtree size >= x and (n - subtree size) >= x.

Hence, I can perform a single DFS to calculate subtree sizes, and then count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

This can be done in O(n) time per test case.

Then, performing a binary search on x from 1 to n, say up to log n steps, the total time would be O(n log n) per test case.

But with t=1e4 and sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, total operations would be about 1e5 * 17 = 1.7e6 operations, which is acceptable.

Hence, this should work.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read n-1 edges to construct the tree.

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to n.

- For each x, perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- Count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

- If this count >= k, set L = x.

- Otherwise, set R = x.

- After binary search, output L.

But wait, in each binary search iteration, I need to perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes and count the number of removable edges.

However, since the tree is the same for each x, I can perform the DFS once and store the subtree sizes.

Then, for each x, I can count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

Hence, I can perform the DFS once per test case, store the subtree sizes, and then perform the binary search on x, counting the number of removable edges for each x without repeating the DFS.

This optimization is crucial, as it reduces the time complexity from O(n log n) per test case to O(n + t log n), which is much faster.

Given that sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, and t=1e4, log n is up to 17, total operations would be around 1e5 + 1e4 * 17 = 1e5 + 1.7e5 = 2.7e5 operations, which is acceptable.

Hence, the plan is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read n-1 edges and construct the tree.

- Perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to n.

- For each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

- If this count >= k, set L = x.

- Otherwise, set R = x.

- After binary search, output L.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Implement the DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- Store the subtree sizes in an array.

- For each edge, store which subtree size it separates.

- Then, for each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

Wait, but in a tree, each edge separates the tree into two subtrees: the subtree rooted at one end, and the rest of the tree.

Hence, for each edge (u,v), if I consider u as the parent of v, then the subtree size is the size of the subtree rooted at v.

Hence, for each edge, I can have the subtree size, and n - subtree size.

Hence, I can iterate through all edges and for each x, count how many edges satisfy subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

But since n and subtree_size are fixed, I can precompute for each edge whether it satisfies subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

Hence, I can store for each edge the subtree_size.

Then, for a given x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

This can be done in O(1) per edge.

But since I have up to 1e5 edges in total, and up to 1e4 test cases, it's still manageable.

Wait, but in the binary search, I need to perform this count for each x.

But x is different for each binary search iteration.

Hence, I need to perform this count efficiently for multiple x.

But since for each test case, the tree is fixed, I can precompute the subtree sizes for all edges, and then for each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

Given that n <= 1e5, and t=1e4, but sum of n over all test cases <=1e5, it should be fine.

Hence, in code, I can:

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read n-1 edges and construct the tree.

- Perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes for each node.

- For each edge, store the subtree_size it separates.

- Perform a binary search on x from 1 to n.

- For each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

- If this count >= k, set L = x.

- Otherwise, set R = x.

- After binary search, output L.

This should work.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

I need to make sure that the DFS is efficient and doesn't have extra logarithmic factors.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently, without exceeding time limits.

Given that sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, and t=1e4, I need to make sure that my code is optimized.

I should also consider that Python might be slower than other languages, so I need to write efficient code.

Hence, I should use fast input methods, like sys.stdin.readline.

Also, I should avoid using recursion too deeply, but since n <=1e5, and recursion depth is up to n, I need to set the recursion limit appropriately.

In Python, the default recursion limit is much smaller, so I need to increase it.

Hence, I can set sys.setrecursionlimit to a higher value, say 1<<20.

Also, to handle large inputs efficiently, I can use multithreading, but in Python, it might not be straightforward.

Hence, I can set the threading stack size appropriately.

Hence, I can set threading.stack_size to a higher value, like 1<<26.

Then, create a main thread to run the boom function.

Wait, in the given code, there's a boom function that seems to be the entry point.

But in the problem, it's not specified, so perhaps it's part of the template.

Anyway, in my code, I can define a func_1 that handles all test cases.

Hence, I can set up the threading and run the func_1 in the main thread.

Now, in the func_1, I can read t, and then process each test case one by one.

For each test case, I read n and k, read n-1 edges, construct the adjacency list, perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes, store the subtree sizes for each edge, then perform binary search on x, and for each x, count the number of removable edges.

Then, set L and R accordingly.

Finally, output L for each test case.

I need to make sure that variables are reset appropriately for each test case.

Hence, I need to define adj, n, k, etc., appropriately within the loop.

Also, I need to make sure that the DFS function is defined correctly and calculates the subtree sizes.

Hence, I can define a dfs function that takes a node and its parent, traverses the subtree, calculates the subtree size, and stores it.

Then, for each edge, I can have the subtree_size it separates.

Then, for each x, I can count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

Hence, I can store the subtree_sizes in a list or array.

Then, for each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >= x and n - subtree_size >= x.

This can be done in O(1) per edge.

Given that n <=1e5 and t=1e4, but sum of n over all test cases <=1e5, it should be fine.

Hence, I can proceed with this approach.

I need to make sure that I handle the binary search correctly, that L and R are set appropriately, and that I don't have infinite loops.

Also, I need to make sure that x is within valid ranges, i.e., 1 <= x <= n.

Hence, I can set L=1 and R=n+1 initially.

Then, perform the binary search until R - L ==1.

Then, L would be the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and all components have at least x vertices.

Hence, in code, I can set L=1 and R=n+1.

Then, while R - L >1, set x = (L + R) // 2.

Then, count the number of removable edges for this x.

If count >=k, set L=x.

Else, set R=x.

Finally, print L for each test case.

This should work.

Now, to test this approach, I can consider the example provided.

First test case:

n=5, k=1

Edges: 1-2,1-3,3-4,3-5

After DFS, subtree sizes:

Assuming root is 1.

Subtree sizes:

1:5

2:1

3:3

4:1

5:1

Then, edges:

1-2: subtree_size=1, n - subtree_size=4

1-3: subtree_size=3, n - subtree_size=2

3-4: subtree_size=1, n - subtree_size=4

3-5: subtree_size=1, n - subtree_size=4

For x=2:

Edges where subtree_size >=2 and n - subtree_size >=2:

Only edge 1-3: subtree_size=3 >=2 and n - subtree_size=2 >=2.

Hence, count=1 >=k=1, so L=2.

Hence, the answer is 2.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Edges:1-2

Subtree sizes:

Root 1.

Subtree sizes:

1:2

2:1

Edges:

1-2: subtree_size=1, n - subtree_size=1

For x=1:

count=1 >=k=1, so L=1

Hence, answer is 1.

Third test case:

n=6, k=1

Edges:1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5,5-6

Subtree sizes:

Root 1.

Subtree sizes:

1:6

2:5

3:4

4:3

5:2

6:1

Edges:

1-2: subtree_size=5, n - subtree_size=1

2-3: subtree_size=4, n - subtree_size=2

3-4: subtree_size=3, n - subtree_size=3

4-5: subtree_size=2, n - subtree_size=4

5-6: subtree_size=1, n - subtree_size=5

For x=3:

Edges where subtree_size >=3 and n - subtree_size >=3:

Only edge 3-4: subtree_size=3 and n - subtree_size=3.

Hence, count=1 >=k=1, so L=3.

Hence, answer is 3.

But in the example, the answer is 3, which matches.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Hence, I can proceed to implement this approach in code.

I need to make sure that the DFS is implemented correctly and that subtree sizes are calculated accurately.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently, without redundant computations.

Hence, I can define a func_1 that reads t and processes each test case one by one.

For each test case, read n and k, read n-1 edges, construct adj list, perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes, store subtree_sizes for each edge, then perform binary search on x, count the number of removable edges for each x, set L and R accordingly, and finally print L.

I need to make sure that variables are reset appropriately for each test case.

Hence, in code, I can define adj inside the loop for each test case.

Also, define subtree_sizes appropriately.

Also, make sure that the dfs function is defined correctly and calculates subtree sizes.

Hence, I can define dfs(a, p) to return the subtree size of node a, and store the subtree_size for each edge.

Then, for each x, count the number of edges where subtree_size >=x and n - subtree_size >=x.

If count >=k, set L=x.

Else, set R=x.

Finally, print L.

This should work.

Hence, I can proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum size \( x \) of connected components after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices. The goal is to ensure that each resulting connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**:
   - A tree with \( n \) vertices has \( n-1 \) edges.
   - Removing an edge splits the tree into two separate components.

2. **Binary Search on Component Size \( x \)**:
   - We use binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and have all resulting components with at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The search range for \( x \) is from 1 to \( n \).

3. **DFS to Calculate Subtree Sizes**:
   - Perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.
   - For each edge, determine if it can be removed such that both resulting components have at least \( x \) vertices.

4. **Counting Removable Edges**:
   - For a given \( x \), count the number of edges that can be removed without creating any component with fewer than \( x \) vertices.
   - If the count of such edges is at least \( k \), then \( x \) is achievable.

5. **Adjusting the Binary Search Range**:
   - If the number of removable edges is at least \( k \), set the lower bound to \( x \).
   - Otherwise, set the upper bound to \( x \).

6. **Output the Result**:
   - The result for each test case is the maximum achievable \( x \).

### Solution Code

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 30)
    threading.stack_size(1 << 26)
    main_thread = threading.Thread(target=func_1)
    main_thread.start()
    main_thread.join()

def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        L = 1
        R = n + 1
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
            dfs(1, 1, adj, subtree_sizes)
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                for b in adj[a]:
                    if b != parent[a]:
                        if subtree_sizes[b] >= x and (n - subtree_sizes[b]) >= x:
                            numCuts += 1
            if numCuts >= k:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        print(L)

def dfs(node, parent, adj, subtree_sizes):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in adj[node]:
        if child != parent:
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(child, node, adj, subtree_sizes)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \), then read the tree edges.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - Initialize the search range with \( L = 1 \) and \( R = n + 1 \).

3. **DFS for Subtree Sizes**:
   - Calculate the size of each subtree rooted at each node.

4. **Counting Removable Edges**:
   - For each edge, check if both resulting components after removal have at least \( x \) vertices.
   - Count such edges and compare with \( k \).

5. **Adjusting Search Range**:
   - If the count of removable edges is at least \( k \), set \( L = x \).
   - Otherwise, set \( R = x \).

6. **Output the Result**:
   - After the binary search, \( L \) will hold the maximum achievable \( x \) for the current test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum \( x \) for each test case while respecting the constraints of the problem.
