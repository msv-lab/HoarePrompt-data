Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array elements modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking. I have to process each command in sequence, output the product modulo m each time, and then modify the array by removing an element from the left or right accordingly. The array starts with n elements and ends up empty after n commands.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient because the constraints are fairly large: n can be up to 2*10^5, and there are up to 10^4 test cases, but the total n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. So, I need an algorithm that's linear in n.

Let me think about how to compute the product modulo m efficiently. If I were to compute the product naively for each step, it would be O(n^2), which is too slow. I need a smarter way.

Wait, if I can keep track of the product as I remove elements, I can update the product in constant time for each step. For example, if I remove an element, I can divide the current product by that element and take modulo m. But division under modulo is tricky, especially if m is not a prime number.

Actually, in modulo arithmetic, division by a number is equivalent to multiplying by its modular inverse. But for that, the number and m need to be coprime. Since m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, and the elements of the array can be up to 10^4, some elements might not have an inverse modulo m if they share a common factor with m.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider the order in which the elements are removed. The sequence of removals is determined by the string s. So, I can simulate the process by keeping track of which elements are removed in which order.

Wait, but simulating the removals one by one would still be too slow for large n. I need a way to compute the product without actually removing elements each time.

Another idea: perhaps I can compute the product of all elements initially, and then for each step, divide by the element being removed. But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal. But that still seems inefficient.

Let me think differently. Since the commands are given in advance, I know in what order the elements are being removed. So, perhaps I can determine the sequence in which elements are removed and then compute the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet at each step.

For example, if I have an array [a, b, c, d] and commands "LRRL", then:

- First command 'L': remove a, so remaining is [b, c, d], product = b*c*d mod m

- Second command 'R': remove d, remaining is [b, c], product = b*c mod m

- Third command 'R': remove c, remaining is [b], product = b mod m

- Fourth command 'L': remove b, remaining is empty, product = 1 mod m

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s="LRRL", the output is 0 2 4 1.

Let's verify:

- Initial product: 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 mod 6 = 0

- Remove 'L': remove 3, remaining [1,4,2], product=8, 8 mod 6 = 2

- Remove 'R': remove 2, remaining [1,4], product=4, 4 mod 6 = 4

- Remove 'R': remove 4, remaining [1], product=1, 1 mod 6 = 1

- Remove 'L': remove 1, remaining empty, product=1 (or 0?), 1 mod 6 = 1

Wait, in the sample output, the last number is 1, which matches.

But how can I compute this efficiently?

I need to compute the product of the array after each removal, and take modulo m.

Computing the product each time would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way to keep track of the product as elements are removed.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the prefix and suffix products.

Let me think about it.

If I precompute the prefix products and suffix products:

- prefix[i] = a[0]*a[1]*...*a[i]

- suffix[i] = a[i]*a[i+1]*...*a[n-1]

Then, at each step, the product of the remaining array is either a prefix or a suffix, depending on which side the elements have been removed from.

But actually, it's not that straightforward because elements are removed from either end based on the commands.

I need to find a way to compute the product of the remaining elements efficiently.

Another idea: since the commands are given in advance, I can determine the order in which elements are removed.

Then, the remaining elements at each step are those that haven't been removed yet.

But maintaining a product of elements that haven't been removed seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in reverse.

If I consider the process in reverse, starting from an empty array, and adding elements according to the reverse of the commands, I can maintain the product as I add elements.

Let me try this.

Suppose I have the commands "LRRL".

Reversed commands: "LRRL"

I start with an empty array, product = 1.

- Add 'L': add a new element to the left, say x, product *= x

- Add 'R': add a new element to the right, say y, product *= y

- Add 'R': add another element to the right, say z, product *= z

- Add 'L': add another element to the left, say w, product *= w

But this seems messy because I need to keep track of which elements are being added where.

Maybe this isn't the best approach.

Let me think about the positions of the elements.

If I know the order in which elements are removed, I can determine for each element the number of steps it remains in the array.

Then, each element contributes to the product for a certain number of steps.

But I still need to compute the product modulo m for each step.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that multiplication is associative and commutative, and precompute some values.

Alternatively, maybe I can use segment trees or some other data structure to handle the product queries efficiently.

But that might be too slow or too complicated for this problem.

Let me look at the sample input and output again to see if I can find a pattern.

Sample Input:

4

4 6

3 1 4 2

LRRL

5 1

1 1 1 1 1

LLLLL

6 8

1 2 3 4 5 6

RLLLRR

1 10000

10000

R

Sample Output:

0 2 4 1

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 4 4 4

0

Looking at the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s="LRRL"

- Step 1: product = 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 mod 6 = 0

- Step 2: remove 'L' (3), product = 1*4*2 = 8, 8 mod 6 = 2

- Step 3: remove 'R' (2), product = 1*4 = 4, 4 mod 6 = 4

- Step 4: remove 'R' (4), product = 1, 1 mod 6 = 1

So, output: 0 2 4 1

Second test case:

n=5, m=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1], s="LLLLL"

- product modulo 1 is always 0, since any number modulo 1 is 0

- So, output: 0 0 0 0 0

Third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s="RLLLRR"

- Step 1: product = 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720, 720 mod 8 = 0

- Step 2: remove 'R' (6), remaining [1,2,3,4,5], product=120, 120 mod 8=0

- Step 3: remove 'L' (1), remaining [2,3,4,5], product=120, 120 mod 8=0

- Step 4: remove 'L' (2), remaining [3,4,5], product=60, 60 mod 8=4

- Step 5: remove 'L' (3), remaining [4,5], product=20, 20 mod 8=4

- Step 6: remove 'R' (5), remaining [4], product=4, 4 mod 8=4

- So, output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

Fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000, a=[10000], s="R"

- Step 1: product = 10000, 10000 mod 10000 = 0

- Step 2: remove 'R' (10000), remaining empty, product=1, 1 mod 10000=1

- But output is 0, which suggests that for an empty array, product is 1, but in the output, it's 0. Wait, in the sample output, it's just "0", but according to the first test case, after removing all elements, the product should be 1. Maybe there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the first test case, after removing all elements, the product is 1, but in the fourth test case, it's 0. Maybe because in the fourth test case, there's only one command, and after removing the element, the product is 1, but the output is 0. Wait, perhaps the output is only the product before each removal.

Wait, in the first test case, the output has four numbers, corresponding to the product before each removal.

Wait, no. Let's see:

In the first test case, there are four commands, so four outputs: 0 2 4 1

- First output is before any removal

- Second output is after first removal ('L')

- Third output is after second removal ('R')

- Fourth output is after third removal ('R')

Wait, no. The problem says:

"First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m.

Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element, else remove the rightmost element."

So, for each command, before removing the element, output the product modulo m, then remove the element.

So, in the first test case:

- Initial array: [3,1,4,2]

- Output product: 3*1*4*2 = 24 mod 6 = 0

- Remove 'L' (3), array becomes [1,4,2]

- Output product: 1*4*2 = 8 mod 6 = 2

- Remove 'R' (2), array becomes [1,4]

- Output product: 1*4 = 4 mod 6 = 4

- Remove 'R' (4), array becomes [1]

- Output product: 1 mod 6 = 1

- Remove 'L' (1), array becomes empty

- Output product: 1 mod 6 = 1 (but in sample output, it's only four numbers: 0 2 4 1, so perhaps the last removal is not followed by another product output since the array is empty after that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s.

Processing a command is done as follows:

First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m.

Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a, if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a.

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1, and after processing all commands, it will be empty."

So, for n commands, there should be n outputs, each corresponding to the product modulo m before each removal.

In the first test case, there are four commands, so four outputs.

In the fourth test case, n=1, so only one output: 0.

Wait, but in the output, it's "0", which corresponds to the product before removing the only element.

After removing it, the array is empty, and there's no further output.

So, in the fourth test case, only one output: 0.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, back to the problem.

I need to find an efficient way to compute the product modulo m for each step, given the sequence of removals.

One approach is to simulate the process:

- Keep a deque or a list that allows efficient removal from both ends.

- Compute the product initially.

- For each command:

- Output the current product modulo m.

- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element and update the product accordingly.

But computing the product naively at each step would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a better way.

Another idea: precompute the product of all elements, and then for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But division under modulo is not straightforward, especially if the element and m are not coprime.

I need to handle cases where the element to remove shares a common factor with m.

This seems complicated.

Is there a way to avoid division altogether?

Let me consider the sequence of removals.

Since I know the sequence in advance, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements directly.

Wait, suppose I have the entire product initially.

Then, after removing an element, the product of the remaining elements is the initial product divided by the removed element.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements by multiplying the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But that would still be O(n^2) time.

I need something better.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the removals are either from the left or the right, and keep track of the remaining elements as a subarray.

Then, I can precompute prefix and suffix products.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have prefix[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i]

And suffix[i] = a[i] * a[i+1] * ... * a[n-1]

Then, at any step, the product of the remaining elements is prefix[j] * suffix[k], where j and k are appropriate indices.

But I need to map the remaining elements after a sequence of removals.

This seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can model the remaining array after each removal.

For example, if I have commands "LRRL", then:

- Initial array: [3,1,4,2]

- Remove 'L' (3), remaining: [1,4,2]

- Remove 'R' (2), remaining: [1,4]

- Remove 'R' (4), remaining: [1]

- Remove 'L' (1), remaining: empty

So, after each removal, the remaining array is a subarray of the original array, but the subarray changes based on the removals.

Is there a way to keep track of the current subarray and compute its product efficiently?

It seems that the subarray is determined by the left and right boundaries.

If I can keep track of the left and right boundaries after each removal, I can compute the product of the subarray a[l:r+1].

But computing the product of a subarray efficiently requires some precomputation.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix products modulo m.

Let prefix[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i-1] mod m

Then, the product of a[l:r] is (prefix[r] / prefix[l]) mod m

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the inverse modulo of each element and handle the division that way.

But this seems error-prone, especially since m can be up to 10^4 and elements up to 10^4, and m and elements may not be coprime.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, but n can be up to 2*10^5, so I need an O(n) solution.

Another idea: factorize m into its prime factors and compute the product modulo each prime power, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results.

But this seems overkill and time-consuming.

Wait, maybe I can factorize m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, but that still doesn't solve the division problem.

I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements by dividing the total product by the product of the removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the exponents of each prime in the factorization of the product.

But that seems too involved for this problem.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I collect all the removals and keep track of which elements are removed.

But that would require maintaining a dynamic set, which is inefficient for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can reverse the process.

If I consider the process in reverse: starting from an empty array and adding elements according to the reverse of the removal commands.

For example, if the removal commands are "LRRL", then the addition commands would be "LRRL".

Then, I can maintain the product as I add elements.

But I still need to handle the product correctly as I add elements.

Wait, maybe this can work.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize an empty array, with product = 1.

Then, for each command in reverse (from the last to the first):

- If the command is 'L', it means that in the original process, the leftmost element was removed. So, in the reverse process, we add an element to the left.

- If the command is 'R', in the original process, the rightmost element was removed. In the reverse process, we add an element to the right.

Wait, actually, it's a bit confusing.

Let me try to think of it in terms of a stack or a deque.

If I process the commands in reverse, I can build up the array and compute the product accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s="RLLLRR"

Reversed commands: "RRLLL R"

If I start with an empty array:

- Add 'R': add 6 to the right, product=6

- Add 'L': add 5 to the left, array=[5,6], product=5*6=30 mod 8=6

- Add 'L': add 4 to the left, array=[4,5,6], product=4*5*6=120 mod 8=0

- Add 'L': add 3 to the left, array=[3,4,5,6], product=3*4*5*6=360 mod 8=0

- Add 'R': add 2 to the right, array=[3,4,5,6,2], product=3*4*5*6*2=720 mod 8=0

- Add 'R': add 1 to the right, array=[3,4,5,6,2,1], product=3*4*5*6*2*1=720 mod 8=0

Then, the outputs should be the product at each addition, but in reverse order.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused.

In the reverse process, the product at each step corresponds to the product after adding an element, but I need to map it back to the original process.

This seems too convoluted.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each step, the product of the remaining array is the product of all elements except those that have been removed so far.

But keeping track of which elements have been removed so far is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements and then divide by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of removed elements and use that to compute the product of remaining elements.

But I still need to handle the division.

This seems challenging.

Let me think about the properties of modulo operation.

I know that (a * b) mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m

So, I can compute the product modulo m incrementally.

But in this problem, I need to compute the product of a subarray efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, determine which prefix or suffix to use based on the removals.

But I'm not sure how to map the removals to the prefix and suffix products.

Let me consider that each 'L' removes the leftmost element, and each 'R' removes the rightmost element.

So, the order of removals determines which elements are removed at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can collect the sequence of removed elements and see how the remaining array looks like after each removal.

But this seems too slow for large n.

Let me consider implementing a deque to simulate the removals.

- Initialize a deque with the array elements.

- For each command:

- Output the product of the current deque.

- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.

But computing the product of the deque at each step is too slow.

I need a way to compute the product of the deque efficiently, in constant time.

Is that possible?

Wait, if I maintain the current product of the deque, I can update it in O(1) time per removal.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the product in terms of its prime factors, but that seems too involved.

Wait, maybe I can consider the product as a multiple of some value, and keep track of the multiplicative inverse.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that m is not necessarily prime, so I can't always compute the inverse.

Wait, in Python, there's a function pow(a, b, m) that can compute a^b mod m efficiently, and pow(a, -1, m) can compute the modular inverse of a modulo m, if it exists.

But for the inverse to exist, a and m must be coprime.

If a and m are not coprime, then a does not have an inverse modulo m.

So, if an element a[i] and m share a common factor, then a[i] does not have an inverse modulo m.

In that case, I can't simply divide the product by a[i] modulo m.

So, I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each step, I can compute the product of the remaining elements by multiplying the current product by the inverse of the removed element, if the inverse exists.

But if the inverse doesn't exist, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too complicated for this problem, and it might be too slow.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m can be up to 10^4, which is 10000, and n can be up to 2*10^5.

I need an O(n) solution.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But again, division under modulo is problematic if the element and m are not coprime.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element, but handle the cases where the inverse doesn't exist by adjusting the product accordingly.

But this seems error-prone.

Let me think about the properties of modulo m.

If m is not prime, and elements may share factors with m, then division isn't straightforward.

Is there a way to handle this without division?

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements directly without dividing.

But how?

Let me consider that after k removals, the remaining array is a subarray of the original array.

If I can identify the remaining subarray after k removals, I can compute its product modulo m.

But identifying the remaining subarray after k removals seems tricky, as it depends on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the removal process to determine which elements are still in the array at each step.

But simulating the removals one by one would be O(n^2) time, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that each 'L' removes the current leftmost element, and each 'R' removes the current rightmost element.

So, the sequence of removals determines which elements are removed in which order.

Perhaps I can determine the order in which elements are removed and then compute the product of the remaining elements for each step.

But determining the order of removals seems necessary.

Wait, perhaps I can use two pointers to keep track of the current left and right boundaries of the remaining array.

For example:

- Initialize left=0 and right=n-1

- For each command:

- Output the product of a[left:right+1]

- If command is 'L', set left +=1

- If command is 'R', set right -=1

But computing the product of a[left:right+1] efficiently is still the issue.

Wait, if I precompute the prefix products modulo m, prefix[i] = a[0]*a[1]*...*a[i]

Then, the product of a[left:right+1] is prefix[right] / prefix[left-1], if left >0

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the inverse prefix, but that has the same issues.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, and n can be up to 2*10^5.

Maybe I can handle m=1 separately, since any number modulo 1 is 0.

Wait, in the second test case, m=1, and the output is all 0s, which makes sense.

But for other m, I need to handle the product modulo m efficiently.

I need to find a way to compute the product of a subarray efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m using logarithms, but that won't help with division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the product as a*b*c*d, and keep track of the exponents of each prime factor.

But factorizing m and handling exponents seems too involved.

Let me consider that m is small, so I can precompute some values related to m.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m, but handle the cases where the inverse doesn't exist by adjusting the product.

But I still don't know how to handle those cases.

Let me consider that if an element a[i] and m share a common factor, then a[i] does not have an inverse modulo m.

In that case, perhaps I can remove the common factor from the product.

But this seems too vague.

I need a clearer approach.

Let me consider that for each removal, I can compute the product of the remaining elements by multiplying the current product by the inverse of the removed element, if it exists.

If the inverse doesn't exist, perhaps I can divide the product and m by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the removed element and m, and adjust the product accordingly.

This might be a way to handle the division even when the inverse doesn't exist.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have the current product p, and I remove an element x.

If gcd(x, m) = 1, then x has an inverse modulo m, and I can compute p * inv(x) mod m.

If gcd(x, m) !=1, let d = gcd(x, m)

Then, x = d * x'

m = d * m'

Now, p / x mod m = p * inv(x) mod m

But since x and m are not coprime, inv(x) doesn't exist.

However, p is divisible by x' because x divides p (since x is a factor of the original product).

So, p / x = (p / d) / x' = (p / x') / d

But this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that for each step, I need to compute the product of the current array modulo m.

Given that m can be up to 10^4, which is small, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m incrementally, keeping track of the product as I remove elements.

But I still need to handle the division issue.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements by keeping track of the product of the removed elements and dividing the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me consider that since m is small, up to 10^4, and n can be up to 2*10^5, but t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

Perhaps I can precompute some values related to m, like its prime factors, but that seems too time-consuming.

Wait, maybe I can handle m=1 separately, since any product modulo 1 is 0.

In that case, the output is all 0s, as in the second test case.

For m=1, the output is always 0, regardless of the array.

So, I can handle m=1 as a special case.

For m >1, I need to handle the product computations.

But I still need a general approach.

Let me consider that for m >1, and when elements and m are coprime, I can use inverses, but when they are not, I need to handle it differently.

This seems too involved.

Let me think about the constraints again.

n can be up to 2*10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, but the total n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Given that, I need to find a way to compute the product of the remaining array in O(1) time per step, which seems difficult due to the division issue.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But that would require O(n) time per step, which is too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a segment tree to compute the product of the remaining subarray in O(log n) time per step, but that would still be O(n log n) time per test case, which might be acceptable, but I'm looking for an O(n) solution.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products, and then for each step, determine which prefix or suffix corresponds to the remaining array.

But I need to map the sequence of removals to the remaining subarray.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that each 'L' removes the current leftmost element, and each 'R' removes the current rightmost element.

So, the sequence of removals defines which elements are removed in which order.

Perhaps I can simulate the removals and keep track of which elements are still present.

But maintaining a dynamic set of present elements would be O(n^2) time.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the order in which elements are removed and then, for each step, compute the product of the elements that have not been removed yet.

But that still seems too slow.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the product of the remaining array at each step, taking modulo m.

Given that, perhaps I can accept that division under modulo is too complicated and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by keeping track of the product of the removed elements and then dividing the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that are still present.

But that would require O(n) time per step, which is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining array by updating it as I remove elements.

- Initialize product = product of all elements modulo m

- For each removal:

- Output product modulo m

- Remove an element and update the product by dividing by that element (if possible)

But again, division under modulo is problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that haven't been removed yet, but that's O(n) time per step.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for m=1, the output is always 0, as any number modulo 1 is 0.

For m >1, I need to compute the product modulo m.

But I still need an efficient way to handle the division.

Perhaps I should accept that handling division under modulo for general m is too difficult and look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by keeping track of the exponents of the prime factors of m.

So, factorize m into its prime factors, and then for each prime power, compute the exponent in the product of the remaining array.

Then, compute the product modulo m using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved for this problem, and it might be too slow for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that for m=1, output is always 0.

For m >1, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array directly, without worrying about division.

But I need to find a way to compute the product of the remaining array efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by keeping track of the product of the removed elements and then dividing the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

I need to find a way to handle this division efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the removed elements, and then compute the product of the remaining array as total_product * inv(removed_product) mod m.

But inv(removed_product) exists only if removed_product and m are coprime.

If they are not coprime, then inv(removed_product) does not exist, and I can't perform the division.

In that case, perhaps I can compute the gcd of removed_product and m, and adjust the product accordingly.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let p = product of remaining elements

Let r = product of removed elements

Then, p * r = product of all elements

So, p = (product of all elements) / r

But under modulo, this is p = (product of all elements) * inv(r) mod m

If r and m are coprime, inv(r) exists.

If not, inv(r) does not exist.

In that case, perhaps I can compute p = (product of all elements) * inv(r) mod m/d, where d = gcd(r, m)

But I'm not sure.

This seems too complicated for the time constraints.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for m=1, output is always 0.

For m >1, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that are still present, taking modulo m.

But this would require O(n) time per step, which is too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, determine which prefix or suffix corresponds to the remaining array.

But I need to map the sequence of removals to the remaining subarray.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each 'L' removes the current leftmost element, and each 'R' removes the current rightmost element.

So, the sequence of removals defines a sequence of subarrays.

Perhaps I can simulate the removals and keep track of the current subarray.

But simulating this for n up to 2*10^5 seems too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the product of the remaining array at each step, taking modulo m.

Given that, perhaps I can accept that handling division under modulo for general m is too difficult and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by keeping track of the product of the removed elements and then dividing the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that are still present.

But that would require O(n) time per step, which is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window approach, where the window corresponds to the remaining subarray.

But the window boundaries are determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, which makes it difficult to handle.

I need to find a smarter way.

Let me consider that the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands defines a specific order in which elements are removed.

So, perhaps I can determine, for each step, which elements are still present in the array.

But determining which elements are still present after a sequence of removals seems too slow for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the order in which elements are removed and then, for each step, compute the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But that still seems too slow.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the product of the remaining array at each step, taking modulo m.

Given that, perhaps I can accept that handling division under modulo for general m is too difficult and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by keeping track of the product of the removed elements and then dividing the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements that are still present.

But that would require O(n) time per step, which is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use a segment tree to compute the product of the remaining subarray in O(log n) time per step, but that would still be O(n log n) time per test case, which might be acceptable, but I'm looking for an O(n) solution.

Given the time constraints, perhaps O(n log n) is acceptable, but I need to confirm.

Wait, the constraints say that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4.

So, an O(n log n) solution per test case would be too slow, as 10^4 * 2*10^5 * log(2*10^5) is too large.

I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Given that, I need to find a way to compute the product of the remaining array in O(1) time per step.

But I don't see how to do that without division under modulo, which is problematic when the element and m are not coprime.

This seems like a dead end.

Perhaps I need to consider that m is small, up to 10^4, and precompute some values related to m.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factorize m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved for this problem.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that for m=1, the output is always 0.

For m >1, perhaps I can handle the case where all a[i] are coprime with m, and compute the product using inverses.

But in general, a[i] and m may not be coprime, so this approach won't work.

I need a general solution.

Let me consider that in programming competitions, sometimes problems have tricky observations that lead to simple solutions.

Perhaps there's a simple observation that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the product of the remaining array is equal to the product of all elements divided by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product of the remaining array is equal to the product of a certain prefix and suffix.

But I don't see how to apply this here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that after a sequence of 'L' and 'R' removals, the remaining array is a subarray of the original array, and I can keep track of the current left and right boundaries.

Then, I can precompute the prefix and suffix products and compute the product of the subarray a[left:right+1] as prefix[right] * inv(prefix[left-1]) mod m, assuming left >0 and a[left-1] and m are coprime.

But this is too restrictive, as a[left-1] and m may not be coprime.

This seems too complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that this problem is too difficult for me currently and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each step, the product of the remaining array is equal to the product of all elements divided by the product of removed elements.

Then, I can precompute the product of all elements and the product of removed elements, and compute the product of remaining elements as product_all * inv(product_removed) mod m.

But again, inv(product_removed) exists only if product_removed and m are coprime.

If they are not coprime, then inv(product_removed) does not exist, and I can't perform the division.

In that case, perhaps I can compute the gcd of product_removed and m, and adjust the product accordingly.

Wait, let's think about it.

Let product_removed = r

Let product_all = p

Then, product_remaining = p / r mod m

But if r and m are not coprime, then inv(r) does not exist.

In that case, p / r is not defined modulo m.

However, if p is divisible by r, then p / r is an integer, and p / r mod m can be computed as (p * inv(r)) mod m, but inv(r) doesn't exist.

So, perhaps I
