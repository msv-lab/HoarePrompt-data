Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. The usual price for each bun is a coins. But to attract customers, he's running a promotion where he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the minimum of n and b), and for the first k buns sold, the price is modified to (b - i + 1) coins, where i is the ith bun in the sequence. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at price a coins each, so the total profit is n * a.

If he chooses k = 1, he sells the first bun at b coins, and the remaining (n - 1) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (n - 1) * a.

If k = 2, the first bun is sold at b coins, the second at (b - 1) coins, and the remaining (n - 2) buns at a coins each. Total profit: b + (b - 1) + (n - 2) * a.

Generalizing, for any k, the total profit is the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

So, the total profit for a given k is:

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) + (n - k) * a

Simplifying the sum:

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = sum from i=1 to k of b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k = k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k = k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + 2k/2 = k * b - (k^2 + k - 2k)/2 = k * b - (k^2 - k)/2 = k * b - (k(k - 1))/2

So, total profit is:

k * b - (k(k - 1))/2 + (n - k) * a

I need to maximize this expression with respect to k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's min(n, b), but b is a price, not necessarily related to the number of buns. I need to double-check that.

Looking back: "k (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b))". Hmm, b is the price, but in the promotion, it's (b - i + 1), so for k from 1 to min(n, b), but perhaps it's min(n, b) to ensure that (b - k + 1) is non-negative.

But in the problem constraints, b can be up to 1e9, and n up to 1e9, so min(n, b) can be up to 1e9.

But in the sample input, in the first test case, n=4, a=4, b=5, and k can be up to min(4,5)=4.

In the second test case, n=5, a=5, b=9, k up to min(5,9)=5.

Third test case, n=10, a=10, b=5, k up to min(10,5)=5.

Fourth test case, n=5, a=5, b=11, k up to min(5,11)=5.

So, k can be up to min(n, b), but in the promotion, the price for the ith bun is (b - i + 1), which should be non-negative, so perhaps there's an implicit constraint that (b - k + 1) ≥ 0, meaning k ≤ b + 1.

But in the problem statement, it's given as k ≤ min(n, b).

Wait, but in the sample input, in the third test case, n=10, a=10, b=5, and k can be up to 5, but in this case, b < a.

I need to think about different scenarios.

First, when b < a, meaning the modified price for the first k buns is less than the usual price. In this case, it might not be beneficial to set k > 0.

Wait, in the third sample input, n=10, a=10, b=5, and the output is 100, which is n * a = 10 * 10 = 100.

So, in this case, choosing k=0 is optimal.

In the first sample input, n=4, a=4, b=5, output=17.

If k=1: 5 + 4*3 = 5 + 12 = 17

If k=2: 5 + 4 + 4*2 = 9 + 8 = 17

If k=3: 5 + 4 + 3 + 4*1 = 12 + 4 = 16

If k=4: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14

So, the maximum is indeed 17 for k=1 or k=2.

In the second sample input, n=5, a=5, b=9, output=35.

If k=5: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35

If k=4: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5*1 = 30 + 5 = 35

If k=3: 9 + 8 + 7 + 5*2 = 24 + 10 = 34

So, k=4 and k=5 give the same profit of 35.

In the fourth sample input, n=5, a=5, b=11, output=45.

If k=5: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45

If k=4: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 5*1 = 38 + 5 = 43

So, k=5 gives the highest profit.

From these observations, it seems that when b > a, it's beneficial to set k as high as possible, up to n, but limited by min(n, b).

Wait, but in the third sample input, b < a, and it's better to set k=0.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- If b <= a, choose k=0, and sell all buns at price a.

- Else, choose k up to min(n, b), but actually, in the first sample input, n=4, a=4, b=5, and k=1 or k=2 give the same profit.

Wait, but in the first sample input, k=1 gives 5 + 4*3 = 17, and k=2 gives 5 + 4 + 4*2 = 13, wait no, wait, earlier I thought k=2 gives 5 + 4 + 4*2 = 9 + 8 = 17, but actually, it's 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17.

Wait, no, for k=2, the first two buns are sold at b - i + 1, so:

First bun: b - 1 + 1 = b = 5

Second bun: b - 2 + 1 = b -1 = 4

Then, remaining n - k = 2 buns at a = 4 each.

So, total profit: 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17.

Similarly, for k=3:

First three buns: 5, 4, 3

Remaining one bun at 4.

Total: 5 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 16.

And for k=4:

First four buns: 5, 4, 3, 2

Total: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

So, indeed, k=1 or k=2 give the maximum profit of 17.

But why does k=1 give the same as k=2?

Because for k=1: 5 + 4*3 = 17

For k=2: 5 + 4 + 4*2 = 13 + 4 = 17

For k=3: 5 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 16

For k=4: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14

So, k=1 and k=2 both give 17, which is higher than k=0 (n*a = 4*4=16), k=3 (16), and k=4 (14).

So, in this case, the maximum is achieved for k=1 and k=2.

But in the second sample input, k=4 and k=5 both give 35, which is higher than k=0 (n*a=5*5=25).

In the third sample input, k=0 gives 10*10=100, which is higher than, say, k=5: 5 +4+3+2+1 +5*5=15 +25=40, which is less than 100.

So, in general, when b <= a, it's better to set k=0.

When b > a, it's better to set k to some value up to min(n, b), but which k?

In the first sample input, b=5, a=4, n=4, and k=1 or k=2 give the same maximum profit.

In the second sample input, b=9, a=5, n=5, and k=4 or k=5 give the same maximum profit.

In the fourth sample input, b=11, a=5, n=5, and k=5 gives the maximum profit.

So, perhaps there's a formula to determine the optimal k.

Looking back at the general profit formula:

Profit(k) = sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) + (n - k) * a

Which simplifies to:

Profit(k) = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k + (n - k) * a

Wait, earlier I had:

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = k * b - (k * (k - 1)) / 2

Wait, let me recalculate that sum.

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = sum from i=1 to k of b - sum from i=1 to k of i + sum from i=1 to k of 1 = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k * 1 = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k

So, profit(k) = k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k + (n - k) * a

Simplify:

k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k + n * a - k * a

= k * b - (k^2 + k)/2 + k + n * a - k * a

= k * b - (k^2)/2 - k/2 + k + n * a - k * a

= k * b - (k^2)/2 + k/2 + n * a - k * a

= - (k^2)/2 + k * (b + 0.5 - a) + n * a

This is a quadratic in terms of k: -0.5 * k^2 + (b + 0.5 - a) * k + n * a

To maximize this quadratic function, since the coefficient of k^2 is negative (-0.5), the maximum occurs at k = -B / (2 * A), where A = -0.5, B = (b + 0.5 - a)

So, k = (b + 0.5 - a) / (2 * 0.5) = (b + 0.5 - a) / 1 = b + 0.5 - a

But k has to be an integer, so we can round this to the nearest integer.

But k also has to be between 0 and min(n, b)

So, the optimal k is the integer closest to (b + 0.5 - a), clamped between 0 and min(n, b)

Wait, in the first sample input, n=4, a=4, b=5, so b + 0.5 - a = 5 + 0.5 - 4 = 1.5, so k=2, which matches one of the optimal k values (k=1 and k=2 both give 17).

In the second sample input, n=5, a=5, b=9, b + 0.5 - a = 9 + 0.5 - 5 = 4.5, so k=4 or k=5, which matches the optimal k values.

In the fourth sample input, n=5, a=5, b=11, b + 0.5 - a = 11 + 0.5 - 5 = 6.5, but k is limited to min(n, b)=5, so k=5 is optimal.

In the third sample input, n=10, a=10, b=5, b + 0.5 - a = 5 + 0.5 - 10 = -4.5, which is less than 0, so k=0 is optimal.

So, this seems to be a correct way to determine k.

Therefore, in code, I can calculate k = max(0, min(n, b, round(b + 0.5 - a)))

But in the provided code, it's k = min(n, b - a)

Wait, in the first sample input, n=4, a=4, b=5, so b - a =1, so k=1, which is one of the optimal k values.

In the second sample input, n=5, a=5, b=9, b - a=4, so k=4, which is optimal.

In the fourth sample input, n=5, a=5, b=11, b - a=6, but k is limited to min(n, b)=5, so k=5.

In the third sample input, n=10, a=10, b=5, b - a=-5, so k=0, which is optimal.

So, in this case, k = min(n, b - a)

But wait, in the first sample input, b - a =1, which corresponds to k=1, which is optimal.

But earlier, when I calculated the optimal k as round(b + 0.5 - a), which is 1.5 rounded to 2, which is also optimal.

Wait, but in the first sample input, both k=1 and k=2 are optimal.

So, perhaps there is a range of k values that give the same maximum profit.

In the first sample input, k=1 and k=2 both give 17, which is the maximum.

In the second sample input, k=4 and k=5 both give 35.

In the fourth sample input, k=5 gives 45, and k=4 gives 43, so only k=5 is optimal.

Wait, no, in the second sample input, k=4 and k=5 both give 35, which is higher than k=3 giving 34.

In the first sample input, k=1 and k=2 both give 17, which is higher than k=0 giving 16, k=3 giving 16, and k=4 giving 14.

So, in some cases, there are multiple k values that give the same maximum profit.

But in the provided code, it's choosing k = min(n, b - a)

In the first sample input, b - a =1, so k=1

In the second sample input, b - a=4, so k=4

In the fourth sample input, b - a=6, but k is limited to min(n, b)=5, so k=5

So, in these cases, it's choosing k=1, k=4, and k=5 respectively, which are optimal.

But in the first sample input, k=2 is also optimal, but the code chooses k=1.

But since both give the same profit, choosing k=1 is still correct.

So, perhaps choosing k = min(n, b - a) is a safe choice that guarantees the maximum profit.

Let me verify this.

First, understand that the profit function is a quadratic in k:

Profit(k) = -0.5 * k^2 + (b + 0.5 - a) * k + n * a

This is a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum occurs at the vertex.

The vertex is at k = (b + 0.5 - a) / 1 = b + 0.5 - a

So, the optimal k is the integer closest to b + 0.5 - a, within the bounds [0, min(n, b)]

In the provided code, k = min(n, b - a)

So, is min(n, b - a) equal to the integer closest to b + 0.5 - a?

Well, b - a is equal to b + 0.5 - a - 0.5

So, b - a is 0.5 less than b + 0.5 - a

Therefore, min(n, b - a) is equivalent to floor(b + 0.5 - a - 0.5) = floor(b - a)

But actually, b + 0.5 - a can be a float, and we need to round it to the nearest integer.

But in the code, it's taking k = min(n, b - a), which is equivalent to floor(b - a), assuming b and a are integers.

Wait, in the first sample input, b - a =1, which is already an integer, so k=1.

And b + 0.5 - a =1.5, which rounds to 2.

But both k=1 and k=2 are optimal, so choosing k=1 is still correct.

In the second sample input, b - a=4, b + 0.5 - a=4.5, rounds to 4 or 5, and both k=4 and k=5 are optimal.

The code chooses k=4, which is correct.

In the fourth sample input, b - a=6, but k is limited to 5, so k=5.

Which is optimal.

In the third sample input, b - a=-5, so k=0, which is optimal.

So, in all these cases, choosing k = min(n, b - a) leads to an optimal profit.

But is this always true?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, a=2, b=3

Then, b - a=1, so k=1

Profit for k=1: 3 + 2*2 = 3 + 4 =7

For k=2: 3 + 2 + 2*1 =5 +2=7

For k=3:3 +2 +1 +2*0=6 +0=6

So, k=1 and k=2 are optimal with profit 7.

The code chooses k=1 (min(3,1)=1), which is optimal.

Another example: n=6, a=3, b=7

b - a=4, so k=4

Profit for k=4:7 +6 +5 +4 +3*2=22 +6=28

For k=5:7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +3*1=25 +3=28

For k=6:7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2=27 +0=27

So, k=4, k=5 give 28, which is optimal.

The code chooses k=4, which is correct.

Another example: n=2, a=1, b=2

k=min(2,1)=1

Profit for k=1:2 +1*1=3

For k=2:2 +1 +1*0=3

Both give 3, which is optimal.

So, in these cases, choosing k = min(n, b - a) works.

But let's consider a case where b + 0.5 - a is not an integer.

For example, n=3, a=1, b=2.5

But in the problem, b is an integer, as per the input constraints.

Wait, in the problem statement, n, a, b are integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 1e9).

So, b and a are integers.

Therefore, b - a is integer, and b + 0.5 - a is integer + 0.5.

So, it's always a half-integer.

Therefore, rounding b + 0.5 - a to the nearest integer would be either floor(b + 0.5 - a) or ceil(b + 0.5 - a), depending on whether the fractional part is >=0.5.

But since b + 0.5 - a is always integer + 0.5, rounding it would be ceil(b + 0.5 - a).

But in the provided code, k = min(n, b - a)

Now, b - a is integer, and b + 0.5 - a is b - a + 0.5.

So, rounding b + 0.5 - a is ceil(b - a).

But in the code, it's taking floor(b - a), which is b - a.

But in the earlier examples, choosing k = b - a or k = ceil(b - a) both led to optimal profits, since in those cases, both k values gave the same profit.

So, perhaps it's safe to choose k = min(n, b - a)

But to confirm, let's see if there's a case where choosing k = min(n, b - a) doesn't give the maximum profit.

Suppose n=4, a=3, b=4

Then, b - a=1, so k=1

Profit for k=1:4 +3*3=4 +9=13

For k=2:4 +3 +3*2=7 +6=13

For k=3:4 +3 +2 +3*1=9 +3=12

For k=4:4 +3 +2 +1 +3*0=10 +0=10

So, k=1 and k=2 give 13, which is optimal.

The code chooses k=1, which is correct.

Another case: n=5, a=2, b=3

k=min(5,1)=1

Profit for k=1:3 +2*4=3 +8=11

For k=2:3 +2 +2*3=5 +6=11

For k=3:3 +2 +1 +2*2=6 +4=10

For k=4:3 +2 +1 +0 +2*1=6 +2=8

For k=5:3 +2 +1 +0 +(-1)=5 +0=5

So, k=1 and k=2 give 11, which is optimal.

Code chooses k=1, which is correct.

Another case: n=1, a=1, b=2

k=min(1,1)=1

Profit for k=1:2 +1*0=2

Without promotion:1*1=1

So, k=1 is better.

Another case: n=1, a=2, b=1

k=min(1, -1)=0

Profit for k=0:1*2=2

For k=1:1 +2*0=1

So, k=0 is better.

Hence, choosing k = min(n, b - a) seems to work in these cases.

But is there a general proof for this?

Let's consider the profit function:

Profit(k) = sum from i=1 to k of (b - i +1) + (n - k) * a

Which simplifies to:

k * b - (k * (k + 1)) / 2 + k + (n - k) * a

Which further simplifies to:

-0.5 * k^2 + (b + 0.5 - a) * k + n * a

This is a quadratic in k, with a negative leading coefficient, so it opens downwards.

The maximum occurs at k = (b + 0.5 - a) / 1 = b + 0.5 - a

Since k has to be an integer, we should choose the closest integer to b + 0.5 - a, within the bounds [0, min(n, b)]

In the provided code, k = min(n, b - a)

Now, b - a is equal to floor(b + 0.5 - a - 0.5) = floor(b - a)

But since b + 0.5 - a is b - a + 0.5, rounding it would give ceil(b - a)

But in practice, in the earlier examples, choosing k = b - a or k = ceil(b - a) both gave the same profit.

So, perhaps in cases where k is an integer, choosing k = floor(b + 0.5 - a) or k = ceil(b + 0.5 - a) both give the same profit.

Hence, choosing k = min(n, b - a) is acceptable, as it corresponds to floor(b + 0.5 - a).

Therefore, the provided code is correct in its choice of k.

Moreover, in the code, if b <= a, it directly outputs n * a, which is correct, as choosing k=0 is optimal in such cases.

Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:

b * k - k * (k - 1)/2 + (n - k) * a

Which matches the earlier simplification.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Edge cases to consider:

1. n=1, a=1, b=1

If b <= a, choose k=0: profit=1

Else, k=1:1 +0=1

Both give the same.

2. n=1, a=1, b=2

Choose k=1:2 +0=2

Better than k=0:1

3. n=2, a=1, b=2

k=1:2 +1=3

k=2:2 +1=3

Same.

4. n=3, a=2, b=3

k=1:3 +2*2=7

k=2:3 +2 +2=7

Same.

5. n=4, a=3, b=4

k=1:4 +3*3=13

k=2:4 +3 +3*2=13

Same.

6. n=5, a=4, b=5

k=1:5 +4*4=21

k=2:5 +4 +4*3=12 +12=21

k=3:5 +4 +3 +4*2=12 +8=20

k=4:5 +4 +3 +2 +4*1=14 +4=18

k=5:5 +4 +3 +2 +1 +4*0=15 +0=15

So, k=1 and k=2 are optimal.

The code chooses k=1 (min(5,1)=1), which gives 21, which is correct.

7. n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

k=min(1000000000,0)=0

Profit:1000000000 * 1000000000=1000000000000000000

Which is correct.

8. n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1

k=min(1000000000,-999999999)=0

Profit:1000000000 * 1000000000=1000000000000000000

Which is correct.

9. n=1000, a=1, b=1000

k=min(1000,999)=999

Profit:1000*999 - 999*998/2 + (1000-999)*1

=999000 - (999*998)/2 +1

=999000 - 498501 +1=500499 +1=500500

Which matches the last sample output.

Hence, the code handles large inputs correctly.

In conclusion, the provided code correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal k, and it handles all the test cases correctly.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
