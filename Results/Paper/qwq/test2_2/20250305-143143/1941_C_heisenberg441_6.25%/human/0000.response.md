Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Rudolf has a string, and he thinks it's ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Otherwise, it's beautiful. My task is to make the string beautiful by removing the least number of characters possible, specifically by removing some characters from anywhere in the string to eliminate those ugly substrings.

First, I need to understand what makes a string ugly. It's ugly if it contains "pie" or "map" as substrings. So, for example, "ppiee" is ugly because it contains "pie", and "mmap" is ugly because it has "map". Even if there are multiple occurrences, like in "dfpiefghmap", which has both "pie" and "map", it's still ugly.

On the other hand, "mathp" is beautiful because it doesn't contain either "pie" or "map". "Ppiiee" is also beautiful because although it has "pie" in it, it's actually "ppiiee", which might not have the exact substring "pie" consecutively.

Wait, actually, "ppiiee" does contain "pie" if the letters are consecutive. Let's check: p, p, i, i, e, e. So, is there a consecutive "pie"? Looking at it: ppiiee. There's "p i e", but are they consecutive? Yes, positions 1,3,5: p, i, e. So, it contains "pie" as a substring, even if there are extra letters in between. Wait, no. Substrings are consecutive sequences of characters. So in "ppiiee", the "p", "i", "e" are not consecutive; there's an extra "i" and "e" in between. So, it doesn't contain "pie" as a substring. Got it.

So, the problem is to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate any occurrences of "pie" or "map" as substrings.

Now, the program provided seems to attempt this. Let's look at it step by step.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases, t, and then for each test case, it reads the integer n (the length of the string) and the string s itself.

Then, it calls a function func_1(s) and prints the result.

Looking at func_1(s):

First, there's a special case: if s is 'mapie', return 1. I'm not sure why this is here, but maybe it's a specific example they knew would require one deletion.

Then, it initializes ans = 0, which will count the number of deletions made.

After that, there are two while loops:

1. While "map" is found in s, remove it by keeping the part before "map" and the part after "map", but skipping the first two characters of "map". So, s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:], and increment ans by 1.

2. Similarly, while "pie" is found in s, remove it by keeping the part before "pie" and the part after "pie", but skipping the first two characters of "pie". So, s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:], and increment ans by 1.

So, the approach is to repeatedly remove the substrings "map" and "pie" by deleting the first two characters of these substrings each time they are found, and count how many such removals are needed.

Wait a minute, is this the most efficient way? Let's think about it.

First, the special case for 'mapie' returning 1 seems arbitrary. Maybe it's a bug or a specific test case they handled manually.

Now, the removal process: by removing the first two characters of "map" or "pie", they are effectively deleting two characters each time to eliminate that particular instance of the substring.

But is this always the minimum number of deletions? Let's consider some examples.

Take "mapie". If we remove the first "ma" from "mapie", it becomes "pie". Then, we need to remove the first "pi" from "pie", leaving "e". So, total deletions are 2 (first "ma" and then "pi"). But actually, perhaps removing different characters could make it faster. For example, removing "p" and "m" could eliminate both "map" and "pie" in one go, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in "mapie", if we remove "p" and "m", we get "aie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, only 2 deletions are needed, which matches the function's output.

Another example: "mmap"

Removing "ma" from "mmap" gives "mp", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, only one deletion is needed.

Similarly, "ppiee": removing "pi" from "ppiee" gives "pee", which doesn't contain "pie". So, one deletion is enough.

But let's see a more complex example.

Take "dfpiefghmap"

First, remove "pie" by removing "pi", leaving "dfeefghmap". Then, remove "map" by removing "ma", leaving "dfeefghp". No more "pie" or "map". Total deletions: 2.

Is there a way to do it with fewer deletions? If I remove "p" and "m", maybe:

Remove "p" from "dfpiefghmap" to get "d fiefg hmap". Wait, that's not precise. If I remove the "p", it becomes "d fiefg hmap", which still contains "pie" and "map". So, not efficient.

Wait, perhaps removing overlapping parts is key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me think about the general strategy.

I need to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map" by deleting characters.

One way is to find all the positions where these substrings occur and determine the minimal set of deletions that cover all these positions.

This sounds like a interval covering problem, where each "pie" or "map" is an interval that needs to be covered by deletions.

In such cases, a greedy approach can be used: iterate through the string, and whenever an ugly substring is found, delete the minimal number of characters to eliminate it, and move on.

But the provided function seems to repeatedly remove the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" until there are no more, counting each removal as deleting two characters.

Is this optimal? In some cases, yes, but perhaps not always.

Let me consider a case where overlapping substrings require careful deletion.

For example, "mapie": as before, two deletions are needed.

Another example: "pipemap". This contains "pie" and "map".

If I remove "pi" from "pipemap", I get "pemap". Then, remove "ma" from "pemap", leaving "pep". No more "pie" or "map". Total deletions: 2.

Alternatively, if I remove "pie" first: remove "pi" from "pipemap", getting "pemap", then remove "ma" from "pemap", leaving "pep". Again, two deletions.

Seems consistent.

Another example: "mapmapmapmapmapmap". According to the example output, it should be 6 deletions.

Let's see: each "map" requires two deletions, and since they are overlapping, perhaps it's 2 deletions per "map".

Wait, but "mapmap" has two "map"s, but removing two characters can eliminate both "map"s in one go sometimes.

Wait, in "mapmap", removing "ma" from the first "map" eliminates the first "map" and part of the second "map", leaving "pmap". Then, removing "pm" from "pmap" eliminates the remaining "map". So, total deletions: 2.

But according to the example output, for "mapmapmapmapmapmap" (length 18), it's 6 deletions.

So, perhaps it's 1 deletion per "map" in some cases.

Wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that each "map" or "pie" requires at least one deletion, but overlapping needs to be considered.

This seems complicated.

Let me think of a different approach.

Perhaps, I can iterate through the string and keep track of the positions where "pie" or "map" occur, and then find the minimal set of deletions that cover all these positions.

This sounds like finding the minimal number of deletions to break all the intervals corresponding to "pie" and "map".

In such cases, a greedy algorithm can be used: always delete the character that covers the most number of intervals.

However, this might be too slow for large n (up to 10^6).

Alternatively, since we're dealing with overlapping substrings, maybe there's a way to model this with a state machine or dynamic programming.

Let me try to model it with dynamic programming.

Define dp[i]: the minimum number of deletions needed for the substring s[0:i].

Then, for each position i, I can consider whether to delete s[i] or keep it.

If I delete s[i], then dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1.

If I keep s[i], I need to check if keeping it introduces any "pie" or "map" substrings in s[0:i+1].

This seems tricky to implement efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the last few characters to detect "pie" or "map".

Let me consider that "pie" and "map" are specific sequences of three characters.

So, I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of times these sequences appear, and calculate the minimal deletions needed to break all such sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of forbidden subsequences.

But substrings are consecutive, so maybe I can use a sliding window approach.

Let me consider a sliding window of size 3 and check for "pie" or "map".

If I find "pie" or "map", I need to delete at least one character in the window to break the substring.

To minimize the deletions, I should choose to delete the character that allows the next characters to be preserved as much as possible.

This sounds vague. Let's think differently.

Perhaps, I can build the longest beautiful substring and subtract its length from n to get the minimal deletions.

But beautiful substrings can be complex to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the total number of deletions needed.

But that seems complicated.

Let me look back at the provided function.

It repeatedly removes "map" and "pie" by deleting the first two characters of each occurrence until no more such substrings exist, counting each removal as one deletion.

Wait, no, it's counting each removal as adding 1 to ans, but each removal involves deleting two characters.

Wait, no, in the code, ans +=1 each time, but actually, it's deleting two characters each time.

Wait, no, in the code, it's s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:], and ans +=1.

So, it's removing two characters for each "map" or "pie" found, but counting it as one deletion operation.

Wait, but the problem is to remove the minimum number of characters, not operations.

So, if each removal operation removes two characters, but we need to count the number of characters deleted, not the number of operations.

Wait, no, the problem says "the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted".

So, it's the total number of characters deleted, not the number of deletion operations.

In the code, each time it removes two characters and counts ans +=1.

Wait, but ans is supposed to be the number of characters deleted, not the number of operations.

But in the code, ans +=1 each time, which would mean counting the number of operations, not characters deleted.

Wait, but it deletes two characters each time, so ans should be incremented by 2.

But in the code, it's ans +=1, which is incorrect.

Wait, let's check:

s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]

This removes two characters from "map", keeping the 'p'.

Wait, no, s.find('map') finds the starting index of 'map'.

s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:] means keeping everything before 'map' and everything after the first two characters of 'map'.

So, for "map", it removes 'ma' and keeps 'p'.

So, it's deleting two characters each time.

But ans +=1, which seems incorrect because it should be ans +=2, since two characters are deleted.

Wait, no, in the code, it's ans +=1, but in the explanation, it says to consider it as deleting two characters per operation.

Wait, but in the example, for "mapie", it returns 1, which seems inconsistent because deleting two characters should correspond to ans +=2.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion.

Let me check the first test case:

Input:

6

9

mmapnapie

9

azabazapi

8

mappppie

18

mapmapmapmapmapmap

1

p

11

pppiepieeee

Output:

2

0

2

6

0

2

According to the code, for 'mapie', it returns 1, but according to the problem, the number of characters deleted should be 2, as in the first test case, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps the function is counting the number of operations, each deleting two characters.

So, in 'mapie', deleting 'ma' leaves 'pie', then deleting 'pi' leaves 'e', total two deletions (operations), but the function returns 1 for 'mapie'.

Wait, but in the code, for 'mapie', it returns 1, which seems incorrect because it should be 2 characters deleted.

Wait, perhaps the special case for 'mapie' is wrong.

Wait, maybe the function is intended to count the number of operations, each deleting two characters, and the total characters deleted is 2*ans.

But in the code, it's printing ans directly, which should be the number of characters deleted.

Wait, no, in the code, it's ans +=1 for each operation that deletes two characters, so ans should be ans *=2.

But in the code, it's ans +=1, which would mean total characters deleted is ans*2.

But in the special case for 'mapie', it returns 1, which would correspond to 1 operation deleting two characters, total characters deleted =2, which matches the first test case output of 2.

Wait, but in the code, it's just ans +=1, not ans +=2.

But if ans is the number of operations, and each operation deletes two characters, then the total characters deleted is 2*ans.

But in the code, it's printing ans directly, which should be 2*ans.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to return the number of operations, and the main code multiplies it by 2.

But looking at the code, it's print(func_1(s)), and func_1 returns ans, which is the number of operations.

So, it's assuming that each operation deletes two characters, and ans is the number of operations, so total characters deleted is 2*ans.

But in the code, it's just returning ans, which would be the number of operations.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the first test case, 'mmapnapie' should require 2 characters deleted, which would correspond to ans=1 if each operation deletes two characters.

But in reality, maybe it needs two operations, each deleting two characters, for a total of four characters deleted, but that doesn't match the expected output.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the function is intended to count the number of operations, each deleting two characters, and the total characters deleted is 2*ans.

But in the special case for 'mapie', it returns 1, which would correspond to 2 characters deleted, matching the first test case's output of 2.

Wait, but in the code, it's just printing ans, which should be the number of operations, not characters deleted.

So, it's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the function is counting the number of operations, each deleting two characters, and the total characters deleted is 2*ans, but the code is printing ans directly, which would be the number of operations, not characters deleted.

So, the code is incorrect.

But according to the instruction, "don't forget in the end of your reasoning to print Correctness: True or False", and the given program is to be evaluated for correctness.

Given this confusion, it seems the program is incorrect because it's counting the number of operations instead of the total characters deleted.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
