Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she bought less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the difference between what Bob pays her for the items he buys from her and what she spent to buy those items from the shop. Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what Alice's profit would be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. Alice chooses some subset of items to buy. If she buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is zero because Bob doesn't pay for anything. If she buys k or more items, Bob takes k items for free that Alice bought, and pays for the remaining items at their b_i prices.

Alice's profit is the total amount Bob pays her minus the total amount she spent on buying the items. So, she wants to choose a subset where the profit is maximized, and Bob, in turn, wants to minimize that profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

Let me think about how to approach this.

If Alice buys fewer than k items, her profit is zero. So, it's only interesting when she buys k or more items.

When Alice buys m items (m >= k), Bob will take k items for free, and Alice will sell the remaining (m - k) items to Bob at b_i each. Alice's profit will be the sum of b_i for the (m - k) items sold minus the sum of a_i for all m items she bought.

So, profit = sum(b_i for sold items) - sum(a_i for all bought items)

But Bob gets to choose which k items to take for free, so he will choose the items that minimize Alice's profit. That means he will choose the items with the highest b_i to take for free, because those are the ones that would give Alice the most profit if sold.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If Bob takes k items for free, he should take the ones that Alice would have sold to him for the highest b_i, because those are the ones that contribute the most to Alice's profit. By taking those for free, he reduces her profit the most.

So, to minimize Alice's profit, Bob should take the k items with the highest b_i.

Therefore, Alice's profit would be the sum of b_i for the items not taken by Bob minus the sum of a_i for all items she bought. Since Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i, Alice is left with the remaining (m - k) items with lower b_i.

So, to maximize her profit, Alice needs to choose a subset of m items such that the sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i minus the sum of a_i for all m items is maximized.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let's consider rephrasing the profit formula.

Profit = sum(b_i for sold items) - sum(a_i for bought items)

Since sold items are the ones not taken by Bob, and Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i, sold items are the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i.

So, profit = sum of the (m - k) smallest b_i - sum of all a_i for the m items.

Alice wants to maximize this profit, considering that Bob will choose the k items with the highest b_i to take for free.

To maximize the profit, Alice needs to choose a subset where the sum of the (m - k) smallest b_i minus the sum of a_i for all m items is as large as possible.

This seems complex because it involves selecting a subset and then considering the sum of the smallest (m - k) b_i values in that subset.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let's consider the difference between b_i and a_i for each item.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because Bob's action affects which items are sold.

Another approach: since Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i, perhaps Alice should try to minimize the impact of those k items.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting m items, then Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i among them, and Alice sells the remaining (m - k) items at b_i each, after having bought all m items at a_i each.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the (m - k) smallest b_i in the selected m items - sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over all possible m >= k.

This seems like a problem that can be solved using priority queues or sorting.

Let me consider sorting the items based on b_i.

If I sort the items in ascending order of b_i, then for a given m, the (m - k) smallest b_i are the first (m - k) items in the sorted list.

Wait, but Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i, which would be the last k items in the sorted list.

So, if I sort the items in ascending order of b_i, then the first (m - k) items are the ones sold by Alice to Bob, and the last k items are taken for free by Bob.

Wait, no. If I sort in ascending b_i, the first (m - k) are the ones with smallest b_i, which are the ones sold, and the next k are the ones taken for free.

Wait, but Bob takes the k items with highest b_i, which would be the last k in the sorted list.

So, if I sort the selected m items in ascending b_i, the first (m - k) are sold, and the last k are taken for free.

But Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the first (m - k) minus sum of a_i for all m.

So, profit = sum(b_i for i=1 to m - k) - sum(a_i for i=1 to m)

But Alice can choose which m items to select. So, she needs to choose m items, sort them by b_i, and then compute this profit.

She wants to maximize this profit over all possible m >= k.

This seems manageable.

Perhaps I can iterate over m from k to n and compute this profit for each m, keeping track of the maximum profit.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so it should be fine.

Let me think about how to compute this efficiently.

If I sort the items in ascending order of b_i for each test case, then for each m from k to n, the first (m - k) b_i are the smallest in the selected subset, and the last k are the ones taken for free by Bob.

Wait, but I need to choose m items first, then sort those m items to find the (m - k) smallest b_i.

This seems too slow because for each m, I'd have to consider all possible subsets of size m.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can consider all items and decide which ones to include in the subset.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider the items sorted by b_i - a_i.

Wait, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Another idea: since Bob takes the k items with highest b_i, Alice wants to minimize the impact of those k items.

So, perhaps Alice should choose items where the difference between b_i and a_i is maximized for the items sold.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the profit per item.

Let me consider the profit if Alice buys an item and sells it to Bob.

If Alice buys an item for a_i and sells it to Bob for b_i, her profit is b_i - a_i.

But, Bob might take some items for free, so it's not that straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the items in terms of their potential profit contribution.

Let me consider that for each item, if it's among the (m - k) sold items, it contributes b_i - a_i to the profit, and if it's among the k taken for free, it contributes -a_i to the profit.

Wait, let's see.

If an item is sold, profit is b_i - a_i.

If an item is taken for free, profit is -a_i.

So, for a subset of m items, the profit is sum over sold items of (b_i - a_i) plus sum over taken items of (-a_i).

But since sold items are the (m - k) items with smallest b_i, and taken items are the k items with largest b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the sum.

Let me try to express the profit in terms of sums.

Profit = sum_{sold items} (b_i - a_i) + sum_{taken items} (-a_i)

Which is equal to sum_{sold items} b_i - sum_{bought items} a_i

Since sold items are the (m - k) items with smallest b_i in the selected m items, and taken items are the k items with largest b_i in the selected m items.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let me consider that for each item, it can be either:

1. Not bought by Alice.

2. Bought by Alice and sold to Bob.

3. Bought by Alice and taken for free by Bob.

But Bob only takes the k items with highest b_i among the bought items.

So, for Alice, she wants to maximize the profit, which is the sum of b_i for the sold items minus the sum of a_i for all bought items.

Given that Bob will take the k items with highest b_i for free, the sold items are the remaining (m - k) items.

So, perhaps I can think about selecting m items, sort their b_i, take the sum of the first (m - k) b_i minus the sum of all m a_i.

Then, choose m to maximize this value.

This seems doable.

To make it efficient, I can sort all items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for each possible m from k to n, the first (m - k) b_i are the smallest in the selected subset, and the remaining k b_i are the largest, which Bob takes for free.

So, for a given m, the profit would be sum of the first (m - k) b_i minus sum of all m a_i.

But I need to choose m items such that this profit is maximized.

Wait, but I need to select m items and then sort their b_i to find the (m - k) smallest b_i.

This seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for any subset of m items, the sum of the (m - k) smallest b_i can be calculated if I sort the b_i within that subset.

But selecting subsets and sorting individually is not efficient.

Maybe I can consider all items sorted by b_i and then select m items in a sliding window fashion.

Wait, perhaps using a priority queue or heap can help.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a threshold for b_i, say t, and consider that Bob will take the k items with b_i >= t for free.

Then, Alice sells all items with b_i < t, and buys all m items.

So, profit would be sum of b_i for items with b_i < t minus sum of a_i for all m items.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can consider pairing a_i and b_i in some way.

Let me consider the difference b_i - a_i.

If b_i - a_i > 0, then selling the item to Bob gives a positive contribution to profit.

But Bob can take up to k items for free, so Alice might not want to sell those items.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the net profit for each item.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting m items such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i minus the sum of a_i for the k items with largest b_i is maximized.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to simplify.

Suppose I sort the items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for a given m, the first (m - k) items are the ones sold, and the last k items are taken for free by Bob.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the first (m - k) items - sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

So, for each m, I need to calculate sum of the first (m - k) b_i minus sum of all m a_i.

I can precompute prefix sums of b_i and prefix sums of a_i.

Wait, but the items are sorted by b_i, so the first (m - k) b_i are the smallest in the selected m items.

But I need to select m items out of n.

This is still confusing.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over all possible m and select the top m items with the highest (b_i - a_i), but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the optimal strategy for Alice.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is the sum of b_i for the items sold minus the sum of a_i for all bought items.

Bob, in turn, wants to minimize this profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

So, it's a minimax problem.

Alice chooses the subset to maximize the profit, considering that Bob will choose the k items with highest b_i to take for free.

One way to approach this is to iterate over all possible subsets, but that's not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort all items in ascending order of b_i.

- Then, for each possible m from k to n, calculate the sum of the first (m - k) b_i minus the sum of the first m a_i.

- Choose the m that maximizes this value.

Wait, but the a_i should be summed over the m items selected, not necessarily the first m.

No, since the items are sorted by b_i, the a_i are not necessarily in any particular order.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the items by b_i and then consider selecting m items in a way that the sum of a_i is minimized.

But it's not that simple.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix m and try to select m items such that the sum of b_i for the (m - k) smallest b_i minus the sum of a_i for all m items is maximized.

This seems similar to selecting m items where the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i minus sum of a_i for the k items with largest b_i is maximized.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider pairing a_i and b_i differently.

Let me consider the difference b_i - a_i for each item.

If b_i - a_i > 0, then selling the item to Bob gives a positive contribution to profit.

But Bob can take up to k items for free, so Alice might want to sell items with higher b_i - a_i, but Bob will take the items with highest b_i.

This is tricky.

Perhaps I can think in terms of selecting m items where the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i minus the sum of a_i for the k items with largest b_i is maximized.

Wait, that seems similar to what I thought before.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let S be the set of m items selected by Alice.

Let T be the set of k items with highest b_i in S, taken for free by Bob.

Let U = S - T be the set of (m - k) items sold by Alice to Bob.

Then, profit = sum_{i in U} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

This can be rewritten as sum_{i in U} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

Alice wants to maximize this, and Bob minimizes it by choosing T.

This is a minimax problem.

To solve this, perhaps I can consider that for any set S, Bob will choose the k items with highest b_i to minimize Alice's profit.

So, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i minus the sum of a_i for the k items with largest b_i in S is maximized.

This is still complicated.

Maybe I can transform the problem.

Let me consider redefining the profit.

Profit = sum_{i in U} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which can be written as sum_{i in U} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

To maximize this, Alice wants to maximize the positive contributions from U and minimize the negative contributions from T.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose Alice selects m items, and Bob takes the k items with highest b_i for free.

Then, Alice sells the remaining (m - k) items to Bob at b_i each.

So, profit = sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which can be rewritten as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's recast it.

sum_{i in U} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in U} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the items in ascending order of b_i.

Then, for a given m, the first (m - k) items are the ones sold, and the last k items are taken for free by Bob.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the first (m - k) items - sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

So, for each m, I need to calculate sum of b_i for the first (m - k) items minus sum of a_i for all m items.

To make this efficient, I can precompute prefix sums of b_i and prefix sums of a_i.

Wait, but the items are sorted by b_i, so the prefix sums of b_i would be straightforward, but the a_i are not sorted by b_i.

So, I need to sort the items by b_i and then compute prefix sums of b_i and prefix sums of a_i based on this sorting.

Then, for each m from k to n, profit = prefix_sum_b[m - k] - (prefix_sum_a[m])

But I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

Wait, but m - k could be negative if m < k, but in our case m >= k.

So, m - k ranges from 0 to n - k.

So, profit = prefix_sum_b[m - k] - prefix_sum_a[m]

I need to find m from k to n that maximizes this expression.

So, for m from k to n, compute prefix_sum_b[m - k] - prefix_sum_a[m] and find the maximum value.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n log n) due to sorting.

Let me check with the first test case.

First test case:

n = 2, k = 0

a = [2, 1]

b = [1, 2]

Sort items by b_i: item 1 (b=1, a=2), item 2 (b=2, a=1)

m starts from k=0 to n=2.

For m=0: sum_b[m - 0] - sum_a[m] = sum_b[-0] - sum_a[0] = 0 - 0 = 0

For m=1: sum_b[1 - 0] - sum_a[1] = sum_b[1] - sum_a[1] = 1 - 2 = -1

For m=2: sum_b[2 - 0] - sum_a[2] = sum_b[2] - sum_a[2] = 1 + 2 - (2 + 1) = 3 - 3 = 0

But according to the example, Alice should choose m=2 and sell item 2 to Bob, getting profit 2 - 1 = 1.

Wait, in this approach, m=2 gives profit 0, but according to the example, it should be 1.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case, when m=2, Bob takes k=0 items for free, so Alice sells both items to Bob.

Profit = sum of b_i for sold items - sum of a_i for bought items = (1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 3 - 3 = 0

But according to the note, Alice should buy the second item and sell it to Bob, getting profit 2 - 1 = 1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In the first test case, k=0, which means Bob takes no items for free, so Alice sells all the items she buys to Bob.

In the note, it says Alice should buy the second item and sell it to Bob, getting profit 1.

But according to my calculation, profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

Wait, but according to my previous approach, for m=2, profit is 0.

So, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when m > k, Bob takes k items for free, but in the case k=0, he takes nothing for free.

So, in that case, profit = sum of b_i for all m items - sum of a_i for all m items = sum of (b_i - a_i) for m items.

So, for m=1: item 1: b=1 - a=2 = -1

Item 2: b=2 - a=1 = 1

So, choosing m=1 with item 2 gives profit 1.

Choosing m=2: sum of (b_i - a_i) = (1 - 2) + (2 - 1) = -1 + 1 = 0

So, indeed, choosing m=1 gives higher profit of 1.

But in my previous approach, for m=1, profit = sum_b[m - k] - sum_a[m] = sum_b[1 - 0] - sum_a[1] = 1 - 2 = -1

Which is not matching the correct profit of 1.

So, my previous approach is incorrect.

I need to rethink this.

Let me consider that when m <= k, Bob takes all m items for free, so profit is zero.

Wait, no. When m < k, Bob takes m items for free, but according to the problem, "if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free", so profit is zero.

When m >= k, Bob takes k items for free, and Alice sells the remaining (m - k) items to Bob.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the (m - k) items sold - sum of a_i for all m items.

In the first test case, m=1, k=0: Bob takes 0 items for free, so Alice sells 1 item to Bob: profit = b_i - a_i = 2 - 1 = 1

For m=2: Bob takes 0 items for free, so Alice sells both items to Bob: profit = (1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 0

So, maximum profit is 1.

In my previous approach, for m=1: sum_b[m - k] - sum_a[m] = sum_b[1 - 0] - sum_a[1] = 2 - 2 = 0, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in my previous approach, I sorted b_i in ascending order, so sum_b[1 - 0] would be sum of the first 1 b_i, which is 1, minus sum_a[1] = 2, giving -1, which is incorrect.

So, the issue is that I sorted the items by b_i, but in reality, Alice can choose any subset of m items, not necessarily sorted in any particular way.

So, perhaps sorting is not the right approach here.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for m >= k, profit = sum of b_i for (m - k) items with smallest b_i in the selected m items - sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

This seems similar to selecting m items and then choosing the (m - k) items with smallest b_i to sell.

To maximize the profit, Alice wants the sum of b_i for those (m - k) items to be as large as possible, while minimizing the sum of a_i for all m items.

But this is still confusing.

Maybe I can think in terms of selecting m items where the difference between the sum of b_i for the (m - k) smallest b_i and the sum of a_i for all m items is maximized.

This seems too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the set of m items, and then Bob chooses the k items with highest b_i to take for free.

To maximize her profit, Alice wants to minimize the impact of those k items.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting m items and then subtracting the sum of a_i for the m items and adding the sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i.

But I need a better way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for any set of m items, the sum of b_i for the (m - k) smallest b_i is equal to sum of all b_i in the set minus the sum of the k largest b_i in the set.

So, profit = (sum of b_i in S - sum of top k b_i in S) - sum of a_i in S

Which simplifies to sum of (b_i - a_i) in S - sum of top k b_i in S.

This seems similar to what I had before.

This is still not giving me a clear path to an efficient solution.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that Alice's profit can be expressed as sum of (b_i - a_i) for the items she sells minus sum of a_i for the items Bob takes for free.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think about it differently.

Let me consider that for each item, if it's sold, it contributes (b_i - a_i) to the profit, and if it's taken for free by Bob, it contributes (-a_i) to the profit.

So, for a subset S of m items, profit is sum over S of (b_i - a_i) minus sum over the top k b_i in S.

Alice wants to maximize this, and Bob minimizes it by choosing the top k b_i.

So, it's like selecting m items and then subtracting the sum of the top k b_i.

This seems similar to selecting m numbers and trying to maximize the sum of the (m - k) smallest numbers.

This is a classic problem in minimax optimization.

I recall that to maximize the sum of the (m - k) smallest numbers, it's equivalent to selecting the m items with the largest (b_i - a_i), but considering that Bob will take the k items with highest b_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the differences.

Let me consider defining c_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, profit = sum of c_i for the (m - k) items with smallest b_i - sum of a_i for the k items with largest b_i.

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I need to adjust c_i in some way.

Let me consider that for each item, if it's sold, it contributes c_i = b_i - a_i, and if it's taken for free, it contributes -a_i.

But Bob chooses the k items with highest b_i to take for free.

So, for any subset S, profit = sum over S of c_i - sum over the top k b_i in S of (c_i - (-a_i)).

Wait, this might not be helpful.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that to maximize the profit, Alice should select items where the difference (b_i - a_i) is maximized, but also consider that Bob will take the k items with highest b_i.

So, perhaps Alice should select items where the (m - k) smallest b_i are as large as possible, and the a_i are as small as possible.

This is too vague.

Maybe I need to consider adjusting the costs.

Let me consider defining a new value d_i = b_i - a_i - b_i = -a_i.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each item, the net profit is (b_i - a_i), but since Bob takes the k items with highest b_i for free, their contribution is different.

Wait, maybe I can adjust c_i = b_i - a_i - min(0, b_i - a_i).

No, that doesn't seem right.

Let me try to think in terms of inclusion in the subset.

For each item, if it's included in the subset S:

- If it's among the (m - k) items sold, it contributes (b_i - a_i).

- If it's among the k items taken for free, it contributes (-a_i).

Bob chooses which k items to take for free, which are the ones with highest b_i.

So, for any subset S, the profit is sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over the top k b_i in S of b_i - a_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, profit = sum over sold items of (b_i - a_i) + sum over taken items of (-a_i).

Sold items are the (m - k) items with smallest b_i in S.

Taken items are the k items with largest b_i in S.

So, profit = sum over the (m - k) smallest b_i in S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over the top k b_i in S of a_i.

This seems too convoluted for direct computation.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for any subset S of m items, the profit can be expressed as sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over the top k b_i in S of b_i.

Because:

- sum over sold items of (b_i - a_i) = sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over taken items of (b_i - a_i)

- sum over taken items of (-a_i) = - sum over taken items of a_i

- But sum over taken items of (b_i - a_i) = sum over taken items of b_i - sum over taken items of a_i

- So, profit = sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over taken items of (b_i - a_i)

- Which is sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - (sum over taken items of b_i - sum over taken items of a_i)

- Simplifying, profit = sum over S of (b_i - a_i) - sum over taken items of b_i + sum over taken items of a_i

- But sum over taken items of a_i is already included in sum over S of (b_i - a_i), so it's not clear.

This seems messy.

Let me try to find a different way.

Suppose I sort the items in descending order of b_i.

Then, for any m >= k, the first k items are taken for free by Bob, and the remaining (m - k) items are sold.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items - sum of a_i for all m items.

Wait, no. If sorted in descending b_i, the first k items are taken for free, so sold items are the last (m - k) items.

So, profit = sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items - sum of a_i for all m items.

I can precompute prefix sums for b_i and a_i.

Let me define prefix_sum_b[m] = sum of first m b_i (sorted descending)

prefix_sum_a[m] = sum of first m a_i (sorted descending)

Then, profit for m >= k is prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k] - (prefix_sum_a[m])

Wait, no.

Wait, if sorted descending by b_i, then:

- taken items (for free) are the first k items.

- sold items are the next (m - k) items.

So, profit = sum of b_i for sold items - sum of a_i for all m items.

Sum of b_i for sold items = prefix_sum_b[k] + sum from k to m-1 of b_i = prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]

Sum of a_i for all m items = prefix_sum_a[m]

So, profit = (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m]

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no.

Wait, if sorted descending by b_i, then:

- taken items (for free) are the first k items.

- sold items are the next (m - k) items.

So, sum of b_i for sold items = sum from k to m-1 of b_i = prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]

Sum of a_i for all m items = prefix_sum_a[m]

Therefore, profit = (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m]

So, profit = prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k] - prefix_sum_a[m]

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

So, for each m from k to n, compute prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k] - prefix_sum_a[m], and take the maximum.

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=2, k=0

a=[2,1], b=[1,2]

sorted descending by b_i: item2 (b=2), item1 (b=1)

prefix_sum_b[0] = 0

prefix_sum_b[1] = 2

prefix_sum_b[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

prefix_sum_a[0] = 0

prefix_sum_a[1] = 1

prefix_sum_a[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

For m=0: profit = prefix_sum_b[0] - prefix_sum_b[0] - prefix_sum_a[0] = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0

For m=1: profit = prefix_sum_b[1] - prefix_sum_b[0] - prefix_sum_a[1] = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1

For m=2: profit = prefix_sum_b[2] - prefix_sum_b[0] - prefix_sum_a[2] = 3 - 0 - 3 = 0

So, maximum profit is 1, which matches the first test case.

Good, seems correct.

Let's check the second test case.

Second test case:

n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3]

sorted descending by b_i: item1 (b=3), item2 (b=3), item4 (b=3), item3 (b=2)

prefix_sum_b[0] = 0

prefix_sum_b[1] = 3

prefix_sum_b[2] = 3 + 3 = 6

prefix_sum_b[3] = 6 + 3 = 9

prefix_sum_b[4] = 9 + 2 = 11

prefix_sum_a[0] = 0

prefix_sum_a[1] = 1

prefix_sum_a[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

prefix_sum_a[3] = 3 + 1 = 4

prefix_sum_a[4] = 4 + 4 = 8

For m=1: profit = prefix_sum_b[1] - prefix_sum_b[1] - prefix_sum_a[1] = 3 - 3 - 1 = -1

For m=2: 6 - 3 - 3 = 0

For m=3: 9 - 3 - 4 = 2

For m=4: 11 - 3 - 8 = 0

So, maximum profit is 2, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, there's inconsistency.

Sample output for the second test case is 1, but according to this approach, it's 2.

So, perhaps this approach is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the profit.

Wait, in the second test case, k=1.

So, Bob takes the top 1 item with highest b_i for free.

In the sorted list:

Item1: b=3, a=1

Item2: b=3, a=2

Item4: b=3, a=4

Item3: b=2, a=1

For m=3:

Bob takes the top 1 item with highest b_i, which is item1 or item2 or item4 (all have b=3).

So
