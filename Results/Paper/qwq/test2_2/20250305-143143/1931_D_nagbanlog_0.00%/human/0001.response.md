Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> (where i < j) beautiful if two conditions are met:

1. The sum of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by x.

2. The difference of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by y.

My task is to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for given values of n, x, and y.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by a number. For two numbers a and b:

- Their sum (a + b) is divisible by x if (a + b) % x == 0.

- Their difference (a - b) is divisible by y if (a - b) % y == 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions hold true.

Let's think about this mathematically. Suppose I have two numbers a and b.

From the first condition:

(a + b) % x == 0

Which means:

(a + b) ≡ 0 mod x

Similarly, from the second condition:

(a - b) % y == 0

Which means:

(a - b) ≡ 0 mod y

I need to find pairs (a, b) such that both these congruences are satisfied.

Let me try to manipulate these equations to see if I can find a relationship between a and b.

Let's denote:

a + b ≡ 0 mod x  =>  b ≡ -a mod x

And

a - b ≡ 0 mod y  =>  b ≡ a mod y

So, I have:

b ≡ -a mod x

And

b ≡ a mod y

This seems like a system of congruences. I can try to solve for b in terms of a.

So, b must satisfy:

b ≡ -a mod x

And

b ≡ a mod y

This is similar to finding b such that:

b ≡ -a mod x

And

b ≡ a mod y

This is a system of linear congruences, and under certain conditions, it can have a solution.

But solving this system for each pair seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4, with the total sum of n across all test cases being up to 2*10^5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about the properties of these congruences.

Given that b ≡ -a mod x and b ≡ a mod y, I can set these equal to each other since both are equal to b.

So, -a ≡ a mod x

Which implies:

2a ≡ 0 mod x

So, 2a is divisible by x, meaning that a is divisible by x/2, assuming x is even.

Wait, but x can be any integer >=1, so I need to be careful here.

Actually, 2a ≡ 0 mod x implies that x divides 2a.

So, x divides 2a, which means that a is a multiple of x/ gcd(x,2).

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me consider the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). CRT tells us that if we have two congruences with coprime moduli, there is a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli.

But in this case, x and y may not be coprime.

Moreover, I'm not sure if applying CRT directly here is the most efficient way, especially considering the constraints.

I need a way to count the number of pairs efficiently without checking every possible pair, which would be O(n^2) and too slow for large n.

Let me consider the frequency of certain properties of the elements in the array.

Suppose I group the elements based on their remainders when divided by x and y.

Wait, but x and y may be different.

Maybe I can look at the remainders of the elements modulo some combination of x and y.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one element, say a_i, and try to find how many a_j (j > i) satisfy both conditions:

1. (a_i + a_j) % x == 0

2. (a_i - a_j) % y == 0

I can rearrange these conditions.

From the first condition:

(a_j) ≡ -a_i mod x

From the second condition:

(a_j) ≡ a_i mod y

So, for a given a_i, I need to find a_j such that:

a_j ≡ -a_i mod x

And

a_j ≡ a_i mod y

So, for each a_i, I can compute the required a_j that would make the pair <i,j> beautiful.

Specifically, a_j should satisfy:

a_j ≡ -a_i mod x

And

a_j ≡ a_i mod y

Now, if I can find how many a_j in the array satisfy these two conditions, then I can sum this over all a_i to get the total number of beautiful pairs.

But wait, I need to make sure that I don't double-count pairs, so I should consider only j > i.

To handle this efficiently, I can iterate through the array and keep track of how many times each possible (remainder modulo x, remainder modulo y) has been seen so far.

Wait, perhaps I can use a frequency map where the key is (a % x, a % y), and the value is the count of how many times I've seen that combination.

Then, for each a_i, I can compute the required (a_j % x, a_j % y) which is (-a_i % x, a_i % y), and look up how many such a_j have been seen so far.

I need to make sure to handle the negative modulo correctly.

In Python, -a_i % x will give the correct positive remainder.

For example, if a_i = 3 and x = 5, then -3 % 5 = 2, which is correct.

So, for each a_i, I can compute required_x = (-a_i) % x and required_y = a_i % y.

Then, look up freq[required_x, required_y], where freq is a dictionary tracking the frequency of (a % x, a % y) for a_j seen so far.

I need to make sure to update the frequency map only after processing a_i, to avoid counting pairs where j <= i.

This seems promising.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize a frequency map freq with (a % x, a % y) counts, starting empty.

2. Initialize a counter for beautiful pairs.

3. Iterate through the array:

a. For each a_i, compute required_x = (-a_i) % x and required_y = a_i % y.

b. Look up freq[required_x, required_y] and add it to the beautiful pairs counter.

c. Update freq[a_i % x, a_i % y] by incrementing its count.

4. After processing all elements, the beautiful pairs counter should have the total count.

This approach should be O(n) per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Let me test this logic with the first example provided:

n=6, x=5, y=2, a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Let's list the pairs that are beautiful:

<1,5>: 1+9=10 divisible by 5, 1-9=-8 divisible by 2

<4,6>: 4+6=10 divisible by 5, 4-6=-2 divisible by 2

So, there are 2 beautiful pairs.

Now, let's simulate the algorithm:

Initialize freq as empty.

Initialize beautiful_count = 0.

Process a_1 = 1:

required_x = (-1) % 5 = 4

required_y = 1 % 2 = 1

Look up freq[4,1], which is 0.

Update freq[1%5,1%2] = freq[1,1] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1}

Process a_2 = 2:

required_x = (-2) % 5 = 3

required_y = 2 % 2 = 0

Look up freq[3,0], which is 0.

Update freq[2%5,0] = freq[2,0] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1}

Process a_3 = 7:

required_x = (-7) % 5 = (-2) % 5 = 3

required_y = 7 % 2 = 1

Look up freq[3,1], which is 0.

Update freq[2,1] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1}

Process a_4 = 4:

required_x = (-4) % 5 = 1

required_y = 4 % 2 = 0

Look up freq[1,0], which is 0.

Update freq[4%5,0] = freq[4,0] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1}

Process a_5 = 9:

required_x = (-9) % 5 = (-4) % 5 = 1

required_y = 9 % 2 = 1

Look up freq[1,1], which is 1 (from a_1).

So, beautiful_count +=1, now beautiful_count=1.

Update freq[4,1] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1, (4,1):1}

Process a_6 = 6:

required_x = (-6) % 5 = (-1) % 5 = 4

required_y = 6 % 2 = 0

Look up freq[4,0], which is 1 (from a_4).

So, beautiful_count +=1, now beautiful_count=2.

Update freq[1,0] +=1

Current freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1, (4,1):1, (1,0):1}

Total beautiful pairs: 2, which matches the example.

Great, seems correct.

Let me check another example to be sure.

Take the second example:

n=7, x=9, y=5, a=[1,10,15,3,8,12,15]

According to the output, there are 0 beautiful pairs.

Let's see:

Possible pairs where (a_i + a_j) % 9 == 0 and (a_i - a_j) % 5 == 0.

Let's check a few pairs:

<1,4>: 1+3=4 not divisible by 9, 1-3=-2 not divisible by 5.

<1,5>: 1+8=9 divisible by 9, 1-8=-7 divisible by 5? -7 % 5 = 3, not 0.

<1,6>: 1+12=13 not divisible by 9, 1-12=-11 not divisible by 5.

<1,7>: 1+15=16 not divisible by 9, 1-15=-14 not divisible by 5.

<2,3>: 10+15=25 not divisible by 9, 10-15=-5 divisible by 5.

Doesn't satisfy both.

<2,4>: 10+3=13 not divisible by 9, 10-3=7 not divisible by 5.

<2,5>: 10+8=18 divisible by 9, 10-8=2 not divisible by 5.

<2,6>: 10+12=22 not divisible by 9, 10-12=-2 not divisible by 5.

<2,7>: 10+15=25 not divisible by 9, 10-15=-5 divisible by 5.

<3,4>: 15+3=18 divisible by 9, 15-3=12 divisible by 5? 12 % 5 = 2, no.

<3,5>: 15+8=23 not divisible by 9, 15-8=7 not divisible by 5.

<3,6>: 15+12=27 divisible by 9, 15-12=3 not divisible by 5.

<3,7>: 15+15=30 divisible by 9? 30 % 9 = 3, no.

<4,5>: 3+8=11 not divisible by 9, 3-8=-5 divisible by 5.

<4,6>: 3+12=15 not divisible by 9, 3-12=-9 divisible by 5.

<4,7>: 3+15=18 divisible by 9, 3-15=-12 divisible by 5? -12 % 5 = 3, no.

<5,6>: 8+12=20 not divisible by 9, 8-12=-4 not divisible by 5.

<5,7>: 8+15=23 not divisible by 9, 8-15=-7 not divisible by 5.

<6,7>: 12+15=27 divisible by 9, 12-15=-3 not divisible by 5.

No pairs satisfy both conditions, so output is 0, which matches the example.

Good.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function is named func_1, and it takes t (number of test cases) and test_cases (a list of dictionaries, each containing params and array).

It initializes results as an empty list.

For each test case, it extracts n, x, y from params, and the array a.

It initializes a frequency dictionary freq, and a counter beautiful_count.

Then, for each number num in a:

- It computes mod_x = num % x

- mod_y = num % y

- required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x

- required_mod_y = mod_y

- It checks if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and if so, adds freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] to beautiful_count.

- If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, it initializes it to 0.

- It increments freq[mod_x, mod_y] by 1.

Finally, it appends beautiful_count to results and returns results.

Comparing this to my earlier outline, it seems correct.

It's keeping track of frequency of (a % x, a % y) tuples.

For each num, it calculates what the required (a_j % x, a_j % y) should be to form a beautiful pair with num, and looks up how many such a_j have been seen so far.

Then, it updates the frequency map with the current num's (mod_x, mod_y).

This should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs.

The only thing is that in Python, dictionaries use keys as tuples naturally, so using (mod_x, mod_y) as keys should work fine.

Also, it's important to handle the negative modulo correctly, but in Python, (-a) % x gives the correct positive remainder.

So, the implementation seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
