Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1, meaning they take up one cell, and others are 2x2, meaning they take up four cells in a square.

The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and the icons can't overlap.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. We have t test cases, and for each test case, we're given the numbers x and y, which are the counts of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

I need to figure out how to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons without overlapping.

Let me think about the screen grid. Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making 15 cells per screen.

Now, the 2x2 icons take up 4 cells each, arranged in a square. So, on a 5x3 grid, how many 2x2 icons can fit?

Let's visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, the cells are A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, and so on up to C5.

A 2x2 icon would cover, for example, A1, B1, A2, B2.

Similarly, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are the other cells.

Wait, but in a 5x3 grid, placing a 2x2 icon would occupy a 2x2 block.

Let me try to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a 5x3 grid.

In terms of rows and columns:

- Rows: 5

- Columns: 3

For 2x2 icons:

- They can be placed in positions where there are at least 2 rows and 2 columns available starting from that position.

So, the number of possible positions for the top-left cell of a 2x2 icon would be:

- Rows: 1 to 4 (since needing 2 rows)

- Columns: A to B (since needing 2 columns)

So, total possible 2x2 icon positions: 4 rows x 2 columns = 8 positions per screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and there are 8 possible such icons per screen, but of course, placing one 2x2 icon may prevent placing others due to overlap.

Wait, but in reality, because the icons can't overlap, we need to make sure that the positions are not overlapping.

Let me try to see the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a 5x3 grid without overlapping.

Looking at the grid:

A1 B1 C1

A2 B2 C2

A3 B3 C3

A4 B4 C4

A5 B5 C5

If I place a 2x2 icon at A1, B1, A2, B2, then that occupies A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, I could place another 2x2 icon at A3, B3, A4, B4.

But then, A5, B5, C3, C4, C5 are left.

So, total of 2 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 8 positions, but clearly, they can't all be placed without overlapping.

So, in practice, only 2 2x2 icons can fit per screen.

Wait, but maybe there's a better arrangement.

Let me try another arrangement.

If I place one 2x2 icon at A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then another at C1, C2, C3, C4.

Wait, but C3 and C4 are in the third column, and rows 3 and 4.

But C5 is alone.

Wait, no, a 2x2 icon needs four contiguous cells in a square.

So, C3, C4, C5 doesn't form a square.

Wait, no, a 2x2 icon needs a square of 2x2 cells.

So, possible positions are:

- A1, B1, A2, B2

- A2, B2, A3, B3

- A3, B3, A4, B4

- A4, B4, A5, B5

So, four possible positions for 2x2 icons, but placing one may block others.

Let me try placing one at A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, can I place another at A3, B3, A4, B4?

Yes, that seems possible.

Then, C column is left with C1 to C5, which are 5 cells.

These can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, in this arrangement, two 2x2 icons and five 1x1 icons can fit into one screen.

Alternatively, if I place only one 2x2 icon, say at A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, the remaining cells are C1 to C5 and A3 to A5, B3 to B5.

That's 3 rows x 2 columns for A and B from row 3 to 5, plus C column from 1 to 5.

So, 6 cells from A3 to B5, plus 5 cells in C column, total 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, in this case, one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons.

Or, if no 2x2 icons, then all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but earlier, with two 2x2 icons and five 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, two 2x2 icons take up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons, not five.

Wait, let's recalculate.

Total cells per screen: 15.

Two 2x2 icons take up 8 cells.

So, remaining cells: 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- Option 1: Two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

- Option 2: One 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons.

- Option 3: No 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons.

Given that, I need to minimize the number of screens used to fit all x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons.

So, I need to maximize the usage of each screen, i.e., prioritize placing as many icons as possible per screen.

I think the best strategy is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, since they take up more space, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

But, given that each screen can hold only two 2x2 icons (as per the earlier calculation), and then the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, two 2x2 icons leave seven cells for 1x1 icons.

In the second arrangement, one 2x2 icon leaves eleven cells for 1x1 icons.

And if no 2x2 icons, fifteen cells for 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, up to two per screen.

But, we also need to consider that sometimes it's better to leave some 2x2 icons for the next screen to make better use of the remaining cells.

Wait, but I think the straightforward approach is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, given that each screen can hold up to two, and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining spaces.

Let me think in terms of the total number of screens needed.

Let me denote the number of screens as s.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, we need at least ceil(y / 2) screens, since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, for x 1x1 icons, we need ceil(x / 7) screens, since each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons after placing two 2x2 icons.

But, this is not entirely accurate, because the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed depends on how many 2x2 icons are placed on each screen.

I think a better approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, since they take up more space.

- Then, for the remaining 1x1 icons, see how many additional screens are needed, considering the remaining space on the screens already used for 2x2 icons.

So, first, calculate the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons: s2 = ceil(y / 2).

Then, calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons on these s2 screens: remaining_space = s2 * 7.

If x <= remaining_space, then the total number of screens is s2.

Else, the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons are ceil((x - remaining_space) / 15).

Wait, but wait, each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons if two 2x2 icons are placed, or eleven if only one 2x2 icon is placed, or fifteen if no 2x2 icons are placed.

This complicates things, because the remaining space varies depending on how many 2x2 icons are placed on each screen.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the total cell capacity.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes up four cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes up one cell.

So, total cell usage is 4*y + 1*x.

Total cells available per screen is 15.

So, total screens needed is ceil( (4*y + x) / 15 ).

But, this might not always be correct, because of the way 2x2 icons must be placed without overlapping.

In other words, you can't just treat the 2x2 icons as using four cells arbitrarily; their positions are constrained.

However, in the earlier analysis, we saw that per screen, two 2x2 icons can be placed, using eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

So, in that case, it's equivalent to each screen providing space for two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

Given that, the total screens needed would be the minimum number s such that:

s * 2 >= y (for 2x2 icons)

and

s * 7 >= x (for 1x1 icons)

But, this might not always be optimal, because sometimes it's better to place fewer 2x2 icons on a screen to leave more space for 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of screens needed based on the total cell usage, but adjusted for the fact that 2x2 icons have constraints on their placement.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula ceil(y / 2) for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, considering the remaining space.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let s2 = ceil(y / 2)

Then, the total cells used by these 2x2 icons is 4 * y

The total cells available on s2 screens is 15 * s2

The remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons is 15 * s2 - 4 * y

We need to place x 1x1 icons, each taking one cell.

So, if x <= 15 * s2 - 4 * y, then we can fit all 1x1 icons on the s2 screens, and the total screens needed is s2.

Else, we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil( (x - (15 * s2 - 4 * y)) / 15 )

Therefore, total screens s = s2 + ceil( (x - (15 * s2 - 4 * y)) / 15 )

But, we need to make sure that the remaining space calculation is accurate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total cells needed and the cells provided per screen.

Total cells needed: 4*y + x

Cells per screen: 15

But, due to the constraints of placing 2x2 icons, we can't always place them optimally.

From earlier, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling 8*4 + 7*1 = 32 + 7 = 39 cells, which is more than 15, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, each screen has only 15 cells.

Wait, with two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and seven 1x1 icons (7 cells), totaling 15 cells.

So, it's consistent.

Hence, the formula s = ceil( (4*y + x) / 15 ) should work.

But, I need to verify this with the sample input and output.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Let's take the first test case: x=1, y=1

Total cells needed: 4*1 + 1*1 = 5

Total screens needed: ceil(5 / 15) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2

Total cells needed: 4*2 + 7 = 15

ceil(15 / 15) = 1

Matches the sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

Total cells needed: 4*4 + 12 = 28

ceil(28 / 15) = 2

Matches the sample output.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

Total cells needed: 4*3 + 0 = 12

ceil(12 / 15) = 1, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, there's an issue here.

Wait, perhaps my formula is not entirely correct.

In the fourth test case, y=3.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

So, for y=3, we need ceil(3 / 2) = 2 screens.

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells per screen.

So, for two screens: 16 cells used for 2x2 icons.

But we only have y=3, which is 12 cells needed.

So, two screens are sufficient.

Moreover, since x=0, no need for additional screens for 1x1 icons.

Hence, total screens needed is 2, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, my initial formula ceil( (4*y + x) / 15 ) gives ceil(12 / 15)=1, but the correct answer is 2.

Hence, the formula is incorrect.

Therefore, I need a better approach.

Let me think again.

We need to consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, we need at least ceil(y / 2) screens.

Then, for x 1x1 icons, we can use the remaining space on these screens.

Each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons if two 2x2 icons are placed.

If only one 2x2 icon is placed, it leaves eleven cells for 1x1 icons.

If no 2x2 icons are placed, fifteen cells are available for 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., two per screen.

So, let's calculate:

s2 = ceil(y / 2)

Then, the total remaining space for 1x1 icons is s2 * 7

If x <= s2 * 7, then total screens needed is s2.

Else, need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil( (x - s2 * 7) / 15 )

Hence, total screens s = s2 + ceil( (x - s2 * 7) / 15 )

Let's test this with the fourth test case: x=0, y=3

s2 = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

remaining space for 1x1 icons: 2 * 7 = 14

x=0 <= 14, so total screens s=2

Matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=1, y=1

s2 = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

remaining space: 1 * 7 = 7

x=1 <=7, so s=1

Matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=12, y=4

s2 = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

remaining space: 2 *7 =14

x=12 <=14, so s=2

Matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=8, y=2

s2 = ceil(2 / 2) =1

remaining space:1*7=7

x=8 >7, so additional screens needed: ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens:1+1=2

Matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=9

s2=ceil(9/2)=5

remaining space:5*7=35

x=0<=35, so s=5

Matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Hence, the correct approach is:

- Calculate s2 = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate remaining space for 1x1 icons: s2 *7

- If x <= s2*7, then total screens s = s2

- Else, s = s2 + ceil( (x - s2*7) / 15 )

Alternatively, in code, to avoid dealing with ceil function, we can use integer division and adjust for remainder.

For s2 = ceil(y / 2), which is equivalent to (y +1)//2 in integer division.

Then, remaining space: s2 *7

If x > s2*7, then additional screens needed: ceil( (x - s2*7) / 15 )

Which can be calculated as (x - s2*7 +14)//15

Because ceil(a/b) = (a +b -1)//b

Hence, s = s2 + (x - s2*7 +14)//15

But need to ensure that (x - s2*7) is not negative, which it shouldn't be because x <= s2*7 in that case, s= s2

So, in code, we can write:

s2 = (y +1)//2

if x <= s2*7:

s = s2

else:

s = s2 + (x - s2*7 +14)//15

Or, more concisely:

s = s2 + max(0, (x - s2*7 +14)//15)

But, in the code provided, it seems to follow a different approach.

Let's look at the given code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b

if t % 2 == 0:

t = t // 2

else:

t = t // 2 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

So, let's analyze this.

First, it reads the number of test cases n.

Then, for each test case, it reads a and b (x and y).

Then, it sets t = b

Then, if b is even, t = b // 2, else t = b // 2 +1

Which is equivalent to t = ceil(b / 2), which is correct for the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b *4

What's this? t screens can hold t*15 cells in total.

b 2x2 icons take up b*4 cells.

So, remaining cells after placing b 2x2 icons is t*15 - b*4

Then, it checks if t1 >= a

If yes, then t remains t

Else, calculate t2 = a - t1

Which is the number of additional cells needed for 1x1 icons

Then, if t2 % 15 ==0, add t2//15 to t

Else, add t2//15 +1 to t

Which is equivalent to adding ceil(t2 /15) to t

So, overall, it's calculating:

s2 = ceil(y / 2)

Then, remaining cells after placing y 2x2 icons on s2 screens: s2*15 - y*4

If x <= remaining cells, then total screens s = s2

Else, s = s2 + ceil( (x - (s2*15 - y*4)) /15 )

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I had s2*7 as the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

But here, it's using s2*15 - y*4, which is the actual remaining cells after placing y 2x2 icons on s2 screens.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I assumed that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But in reality, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But, in this code, it's calculating remaining cells as s2*15 - y*4

Which is more general, as it accounts for the exact number of cells used by y 2x2 icons, regardless of how they are distributed across s2 screens.

Whereas my earlier approach assumed that each screen holds up to two 2x2 icons and the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.

But this approach is more flexible, as it considers the total cell capacity.

Let me verify this with the earlier test case where y=3, x=0

s2 = ceil(3 /2) =2

remaining cells: 2*15 -3*4 =30 -12=18

x=0 <=18, so s=2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: y=1, x=1

s2=1

remaining cells:1*15 -1*4=11

x=1<=11, s=1

Matches sample output.

Another test case: y=4, x=12

s2=2

remaining cells:2*15 -4*4=30-16=14

x=12<=14, s=2

Matches sample output.

Seems correct.

Hence, this approach is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{see explanation}} \]

**Correctness:** **True**
