Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel, and Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

First, I need to understand how Alice buys the jewels. She goes to each stall one by one and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins. So, if a stall has a price p, and she has c coins, she'll buy floor(c/p) jewels and then move on to the next stall.

Bob's goal is to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels, using at most 60 stalls, each with a price between 1 and 10^18 coins.

I need to determine, for given n and k, whether it's possible for Bob to achieve this, and if so, provide one possible setup.

Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 7, k = 3

The solution is YES, with 10 stalls priced from 2 to 11.

At the first stall priced at 2, Alice can buy 3 jewels (since 7 // 2 = 3), and she's left with 1 coin. Since 1 coin is less than the price of any other stall, she stops, having bought exactly 3 jewels.

In the third test case:

n = 255, k = 8

The solution is YES, with 8 stalls priced at 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

At each stall, Alice buys one jewel, spending 128, then 64, then 32, and so on, until she has 0 coins left, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in both cases where the answer is YES, there's a setup that allows Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

Now, looking at the second test case:

n = 6, k = 4

The answer is NO. So, it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

I need to find a general approach to determine when it's possible and how to set up the stalls accordingly.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

The minimal number of jewels Alice can buy is 1, by setting up a single stall with price floor(n/k). But wait, no. If she buys only one jewel, it's when she has less coins than the price of the second stall.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

If Bob sets up only one stall, Alice will buy floor(n/p) jewels, where p is the price.

To make floor(n/p) = k, p needs to satisfy floor(n/p) = k, which means:

k <= n/p < k+1

Which implies:

n/(k+1) < p <= n/k

If n/k - n/(k+1) >=1, then there exists such a p.

Wait, let's check.

For example, n=7, k=3:

n/k = 7/3 ≈2.333, n/(k+1)=7/4=1.75

So, 1.75 < p <=2.333

So p=2 is acceptable.

For n=6, k=4:

n/k=1.5, n/(k+1)=6/5=1.2

So, 1.2 < p <=1.5

But p must be an integer, so p=2, but 2 >1.5, which is not in the range.

Wait, p=1 is less than 1.2, which is not in the range.

Wait, p must be greater than 1.2 and less than or equal to 1.5, but p has to be an integer, so p=2 is greater than 1.5, which is not in the range.

So, no such p exists, hence NO.

For n=255, k=8:

n/k=31.875, n/(k+1)=255/9≈28.333

So, 28.333 < p <=31.875

p can be 29,30,31

So, setting p=31, Alice buys floor(255/31)=8 jewels, which is exactly k.

Alternatively, with multiple stalls, maybe it's possible to achieve more flexibility.

But in the first example, they used multiple stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels.

So, with multiple stalls, it seems possible to achieve more combinations.

But in the second example, even with multiple stalls, it's impossible.

So, I need to find a general way to determine when it's possible and provide a setup if it is.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle cases where k <= n, which makes sense because if k > n, Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins for.

Wait, no, because stalls can have p=1, so she can buy up to n jewels.

But in the problem statement, it says "Alice buys greedily: she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall."

So, with p=1, she can buy up to n jewels, but she might buy more than k, which is not desired.

So, the condition is to make her buy exactly k jewels.

Looking back at the program:

It takes t test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and k.

Then, if n < k, it's impossible, so print 'NO'.

Because Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins, assuming p=1 for all stalls, she can buy up to n jewels.

Wait, but with p=1, she can buy n jewels.

So, if n < k, it's impossible.

If n == k, then set up one stall with price 1, so she buys n jewels.

Wait, but in this case, she would buy n jewels, which is equal to k.

So, print 'YES', number of stalls s=1, and p=1.

But in the example, for n=7, k=3, they used s=10, which is more than necessary.

But according to the problem, s can be up to 60, so using more stalls is allowed, as long as s <=60.

In the program, for n >=k, it checks if k-1 < n -k +1.

Wait, that seems unclear.

Wait, in the program:

if n <k:

print('NO')

elif n ==k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(n)

elif k-1 < n -k +1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n -k +1, 1)

else:

print('NO')

So, for n >k, it checks if k-1 < n -k +1.

Wait, let's see what this condition means.

Let's rearrange:

k -1 < n -k +1

=> k -1 < n -k +1

=> k -1 < n -k +1

=> k -1 < n -k +1

=> 2k -1 < n +1

=> 2k < n +2

=> n >= 2k -1

So, if n >= 2k -1, then it's YES with s=2, p1 = n -k +1, p2=1

Else, NO.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3:

7 >= 2*3 -1 =5, so 7 >=5, which is true, so YES with s=2, p1=7-3+1=5, p2=1

So, stalls with prices 5 and 1.

At stall 1 with p=5, Alice buys 1 jewel (since 7//5=1), left with 2 coins.

At stall 2 with p=1, buys 2 jewels (2//1=2), total jewels=3.

So, total jewels=3, as required.

In the second example, n=6, k=4:

6 >= 2*4 -1=7, which is false, so NO.

In the third example, n=255, k=8:

255 >= 2*8 -1=15, which is true, so YES with s=2, p1=255-8+1=248, p2=1

At stall 1 with p=248, buys 1 jewel (255//248=1), left with 7 coins.

At stall 2 with p=1, buys 7 jewels (7//1=7), total jewels=8.

But in the example, they used s=8 with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

But according to this program, it would use s=2 with p=248 and 1, which also works.

So, the program seems to be correct in these cases.

But is this condition general?

Let me think about another case.

Suppose n=5, k=2.

5 >= 2*2 -1=3, which is true, so YES with s=2, p1=5-2+1=4, p2=1

At stall 1 with p=4, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At stall 2 with p=1, buys 1 jewel, total jewels=2.

Works.

Another case: n=4, k=2.

4 >= 3? No, so NO.

But let's see, is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 2 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try s=2, p1=2, p2=2.

At stall 1, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels=2.

So, it's possible.

But according to the program, since 4 >=3 is false, it would print NO.

But it should be YES.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, in this case, n=4, k=2.

According to the program, since 4 >=2*2 -1=3, which is true, so YES with s=2, p1=4-2+1=3, p2=1.

At stall 1 with p=3, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At stall 2 with p=1, buys 1 jewel, total jewels=2.

So, it works.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 >=3 is false, but actually 4 >=3 is true.

Wait, no, 4 >=3 is true.

Wait, 4 >=3 is true, so it's YES.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, it's YES.

Another case: n=3, k=2.

3 >=2*2 -1=3, which is true, so YES with s=2, p1=3-2+1=2, p2=1.

At stall 1 with p=2, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At stall 2 with p=1, buys 1 jewel, total jewels=2.

Works.

Another case: n=2, k=2.

2 >=2*2 -1=3, which is false, so NO.

But can it be done?

If s=1, p=1, Alice buys 2 jewels.

But according to the program, it's NO.

Wait, but in the earlier logic, if n >=k, and n >=2k -1, then YES with s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

Else, NO.

But in this case, n=2, k=2, 2 >=3 is false, so NO.

But actually, with s=1, p=1, Alice buys 2 jewels.

But according to the program, it's NO.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but the problem says that Alice buys from stall 1, then stall 2, and so on.

So, if s=1, p=1, she buys 2 jewels, which is exactly k=2.

But according to the program, it only considers s=1 when n==k, which in this case n=2, k=2, it would print YES, s=1, p=2.

Wait, no, in the program, when n==k, it prints YES, s=1, p=n.

So, for n=2, k=2, it would print YES, s=1, p=2.

Alice buys floor(2/2)=1 jewel, which is less than k=2.

Wait, that's not enough.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, if s=1, p=1, Alice would buy floor(2/1)=2 jewels, which is exactly k=2.

But in the program, when n==k, it sets p=n, so floor(n/p)=1, which is less than k unless p=1.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, in the program, when n==k, it sets s=1, p=n.

Then, floor(n/p)=1, which is equal to k only if k=1.

Wait, that's a mistake.

For example, n=2, k=2, setting p=2, Alice buys floor(2/2)=1 jewel, which is less than k=2.

So, it's incorrect.

Similarly, in n=4, k=2, setting s=2, p1=3, p2=1:

At p1=3, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, total=2.

Works.

But in n=3, k=2, s=2, p1=2, p2=1:

At p1=2, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, total=2.

Works.

In n=2, k=2, s=2, p1=1, p2=1:

At p1=1, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total=2.

Works.

But according to the program, for n=2, k=2, since n >=2k -1 -> 2 >=3 is false, it prints NO, which is incorrect because it's possible with s=2, p1=1, p2=1.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program, for n >=2k -1, it sets s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

In n=2, k=2, p1=2-2+1=1, p2=1.

So, s=2, p1=1, p2=1.

Which, as I calculated, works.

But the program, according to its condition, would print NO because n >=2k -1 -> 2 >=3 is false.

So, the condition is incorrect.

It should be n >=k, and s can be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is n >=k, and then set s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

But in the case where n -k +1 >=1, which is always true since n >=k.

Wait, no, n -k +1 can be less than or equal to 1.

Wait, in n=2, k=2, p1=1, which is >=1.

So, perhaps the condition should just be n >=k.

But in the program, it's n >=2k -1.

Which is too restrictive, as shown in the n=2, k=2 case.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that for n >=k, it's possible to set up s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

But in n=2, k=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

So, perhaps the condition should be n >=k, and s=2.

But in n=1, k=1, it should be YES with s=1, p=1.

But according to the program, when n==k, it sets s=1, p=n.

But as we saw, in n=2, k=2, p=2 leads to floor(2/2)=1 <k=2.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the general approach is:

- If n <k, impossible, NO.

- Else if n ==k, set s=1, p=1.

- Else, set s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

But in n=2, k=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

In n=1, k=1, s=1, p=1 works.

In n=4, k=2, s=2, p1=3, p2=1 works.

In n=3, k=1, s=2, p1=3, p2=1: at p1=3, buys 1 jewel, left with 0 coins, total=1.

Works.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in n=1, k=1, s=1, p=1 works.

But according to the program, for n==k, it sets p=n, which in this case p=1, and floor(1/1)=1, which is correct.

Similarly, in n=2, k=2, s=1, p=2: floor(2/2)=1 <k=2, which is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect in this case because it sets p=n when n==k, which may not work if p>n/k.

Wait, to make floor(n/p)=k, p needs to satisfy n/(k+1) <p <=n/k.

In n=2, k=2, n/k=1, n/(k+1)=2/3≈0.666, so p needs to be >0.666 and <=1, so p=1 works.

But in the program, it sets p=n when n==k, which is p=2, and floor(2/2)=1 <2, which is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, to fix this, for n==k, set s=1, p=1.

Then, in the other cases, set s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

Wait, but in n=2, k=2, s=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

But according to the program, for n >=2k -1, which is n >=2k -1, it sets s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

In n=2, k=2, n >=2*2 -1=3 is false, so it prints NO, which is incorrect because s=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

So, the condition should be n >=k, not n >=2k -1.

Wait, but in n=6, k=4, which should be NO, because there's no way to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

Wait, let's see: n=6, k=4.

If s=2, p1=6-4+1=3, p2=1.

At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels=2, which is less than k=4.

So, it doesn't work.

Wait, but according to the program, for n >=2k -1, which is 6 >=7, which is false, so NO.

But in this case, it's indeed impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

Wait, but with s=3, maybe it's possible.

For example, s=3, p1=2, p2=2, p3=1.

At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels=3, which is less than k=4.

Alternatively, s=3, p1=3, p2=1, p3=1.

At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels=2.

Still less than 4.

Alternatively, s=2, p1=1, p2=1.

At p1=1, buys 6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

So, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, NO is correct.

But earlier, for n=2, k=2, s=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

Wait, but in that case, Alice buys 2 jewels at p1=1, and then 0 at p2=1, since she has 0 coins left.

Wait, no, at p1=1, she buys floor(2/1)=2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels=2, which is exactly k=2.

So, it works.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it sets the condition as n >=2k -1, which is too strict.

It should be n >=k.

So, the correct approach is:

- If n <k, impossible, NO.

- Else if n ==k, set s=1, p=1.

- Else (n >k), set s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

This seems to work for the cases I've checked.

But in the program, it has:

if n <k:

print('NO')

elif n ==k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(n)

elif k -1 <n -k +1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n -k +1, 1)

else:

print('NO')

Wait, k -1 <n -k +1 is equivalent to k -1 <n -k +1 => k -1 <n -k +1 => 2k -1 <n +1 => n >=2k -1.

Which is what I saw earlier.

But as we've seen, it should be n >=k, not n >=2k -1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the case where n >=k, but n <2k -1, it prints NO, but in reality, it might be possible.

Wait, but in n=2, k=2, which is n >=k, but n <2k -1 (2 <3), and s=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

But according to the program, it prints NO.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the correct condition should be:

if n <k:

print('NO')

elif n ==k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

elif n >k:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n -k +1,1)

And in the case where n ==k and s=1, p=1 works, as in n=2, k=2.

Wait, but in n=1, k=1, s=1, p=1 works.

In n=2, k=2, s=2, p1=1, p2=1 works.

In n=3, k=2, s=2, p1=2, p2=1 works.

In n=4, k=2, s=2, p1=3, p2=1 works.

In n=6, k=4, s=2, p1=3, p2=1: at p1=3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins, total=2 <4, so NO.

Hence, the program's condition n >=2k -1 is too strict.

It should be n >=k.

But in the case where n >=k, s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

Then, check if p1 >=1.

Because p1 =n -k +1 >=1 since n >=k.

And p2=1.

Then, at p1, Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels.

Then, remaining coins =n - floor(n/p1)*p1.

Then, at p2=1, she buys remaining coins worth of jewels.

Total jewels =floor(n/p1) + remaining_coins.

But remaining_coins =n - floor(n/p1)*p1.

So, total jewels =floor(n/p1) + n - floor(n/p1)*p1.

Wait, but p1=n -k +1.

Let me compute floor(n/(n -k +1)) + n - floor(n/(n -k +1))*p1.

Wait, this seems complicated.

But in the examples, it works.

In n=7, k=3, p1=5, p2=1.

At p1=5, buys 1 jewel, left with 2 coins.

At p2=1, buys 2 jewels, total=3.

In n=255, k=8, p1=248, p2=1.

At p1=248, buys 1 jewel, left with 7 coins.

At p2=1, buys 7 jewels, total=8.

In n=2, k=2, p1=1, p2=1.

At p1=1, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total=2.

Works.

In n=3, k=2, p1=2, p2=1.

At p1=2, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, total=2.

Works.

In n=4, k=2, p1=3, p2=1.

At p1=3, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, total=2.

Works.

In n=5, k=2, p1=4, p2=1.

At p1=4, buys 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, total=2.

Works.

In n=6, k=4, p1=6-4+1=3, p2=1.

At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total=2 <4.

So, NO.

Hence, the condition should be n >=k, and s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1.

And check if this setup makes Alice buy exactly k jewels.

In the cases where n -k +1 >=1, which it is when n >=k, and p1 <=n, which it is since n -k +1 <=n.

So, the program should be:

if n <k:

print('NO')

elif n ==k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n -k +1,1)

But in the given program, it has:

if n <k:

print('NO')

elif n ==k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(n)

elif k -1 <n -k +1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n -k +1,1)

else:

print('NO')

Wait, k -1 <n -k +1 is equivalent to k -1 <n -k +1 => 2k -1 <n +1 => n >=2k.

Wait, 2k -1 <n +1 => n >=2k.

Wait, no, 2k -1 <n +1 => n >=2k -1 +1 -epsilon, but since n and k are integers, n >=2k -1 +1 => n >=2k.

Wait, actually, 2k -1 <n +1 => n >=2k -1 +1, since n and k are integers.

Wait, no, n >=2k -1 is equivalent to n +1 >2k -1, which is n >=2k -1.

Wait, let's solve k -1 <n -k +1.

k -1 <n -k +1

=> k -1 <n -k +1

=> 2k -1 <n +1

=> 2k -1 -1 <n

=> 2k -2 <n

=> n >=2k -1

So, the condition in the program is n >=2k -1.

But as we've seen, it's possible to have n >=k and setup s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1 to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Hence, the program is incorrect in setting the condition as n >=2k -1.

It should be n >=k.

But in the case where n >=k, s=2, p1=n -k +1, p2=1 works, as shown in the examples.

Wait, but in n=6, k=4, n -k +1=6-4+1=3, p2=1.

At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total=2 <4, which is not enough.

Hence, in this case, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the setup only works when n -k +1 <= floor(n/(something)).

Wait, it's getting complicated.

An alternative approach is to use multiple stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the third example.

For example, in n=255, k=8, using stall prices that are powers of 2, decreasing.

In general, to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, we can set up s stalls with prices that correspond to the binary representation of n, or something similar.

But that might require more than 60 stalls in some cases, which is not allowed.

But in the problem, s can be up to 60, which is enough for n up to 10^18, since 60 stalls can cover up to 2^60 -1, which is much larger than 10^18.

Wait, 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18.

So, with s=60, we can cover any n up to 2^60 -1.

But in the program, it only uses s=1 or s=2.

So, perhaps it's sufficient for the cases where n >=k.

But as we've seen, in some cases, like n=6, k=4, it's impossible, even though n >=k.

Hence, the condition should be:

- If n <k: NO

- Else if n ==k: YES, s=1, p=1

- Else if n >k:

- If n -k +1 <= floor(n / m), where m is the number of stalls, it's possible.

But this seems too vague.

Looking back at the program, it seems that it's trying to cover cases where n >=2k -1 with s=2.

But in reality, for n >=k, it's possible with s=2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is **False**
