Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, alternately, and we get points based on whether the card we play has already been played by either of us.

The goal is to maximize my score, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine in case of ties.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

- There are 2n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing twice.

- Me and Nene each get n cards.

- We take turns playing one card at a time, starting with me.

- For each card I play, if the integer on it is already on the table, I get one point.

- The same rule applies to Nene.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine in case of ties.

I need to find out the maximum score I can achieve under these conditions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider her moves as well when trying to maximize my score.

Let's consider the properties of the cards.

Each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck. So, for any integer x, there are two cards with x.

Given that, when I play a card with x, if the other x has already been played, I get a point. Otherwise, I don't.

Similarly for Nene.

Wait, no. The rule is that I get a point if any card with x is already on the table, regardless of who played it.

So, if I play x and there's already an x on the table, from either me or Nene, I get a point.

Okay, so the table just keeps all the cards that have been played so far.

And each player can see the table, so they know what's been played.

Now, the key is to maximize the number of times I play a card that matches something already on the table.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine, so she'll play in a way that benefits her score first and then tries to minimize mine.

I need to model their strategies.

Let me try to think of some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Take n=1.

So, 2 cards, both with 1.

Me and Nene each get one card.

I play my 1, no point.

Then Nene plays her 1, gets a point because 1 is already on the table.

Total: me 0, Nene 1.

So, me 0.

Another n=1, but maybe both cards to one person? Wait, n=1, each gets one card.

Wait, n=1, 2 cards both with 1, each get one.

Only two turns: me playing 1 (0 points), then Nene playing 1 (1 point).

So, me 0.

Another example: n=2.

Me: 1,1

Nene: 2,2

Turns:

- I play 1, no point.

- Nene plays 2, no point.

- I play 1, get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table).

- Nene plays 2, get 1 point.

Final scores: me 1, Nene 1.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Is there another way for Nene to play?

Wait, in this case, Nene only has 2's, so she has to play them.

Suppose me: 1,2

Nene: 1,2

Turns:

- I play 1, no point.

- Nene plays 1, gets 1 point.

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 2, gets 1 point.

Total: me 0, Nene 2.

Alternatively:

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 1, gets 0.

- I play 1, get 1 point.

- Nene plays 2, get 1 point.

Total: me 1, Nene 1.

So, in this case, by choosing different play orders, I can get different scores.

Nene wants to maximize her score first, so in the first scenario, she chooses to play 1 first to get a point, and then play 2 to get another point.

In the second scenario, she plays 1 after I play 2, getting 0 points from playing 1, but still getting a point from playing 2.

But according to her strategy, she would choose the first scenario where she gets 2 points.

So, in this case, if I play 1 first, she plays 1 and gets a point, then plays 2 and gets another point.

If I play 2 first, she plays 1 and gets 0, then plays 2 and gets 1 point.

So, she prefers the first scenario where she gets 2 points.

Therefore, in this case, I get 1 point if I play 1 first, and 1 point if I play 2 first.

Wait, in the first scenario, I get 1 point, in the second scenario, I get 1 point as well.

Wait, no:

In the first scenario:

- I play 1, no point.

- Nene plays 1, gets 1 point.

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 2, gets 1 point.

Me: 0 points.

In the second scenario:

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 1, gets 0 points.

- I play 1, get 1 point.

- Nene plays 2, gets 1 point.

Me: 1 point.

So, by choosing different play orders, I can get different scores.

Nene, knowing this, will choose the first scenario where she gets 2 points and I get 0.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score first, and minimize mine second.

So, in the first scenario, she gets 2 points and I get 0.

In the second scenario, she gets 1 point and I get 1 point.

Between these, she prefers the first scenario because she gets more points.

Therefore, she will choose to play 1 after I play 1, to get a point.

So, in this case, I can get 1 point if I play 2 first, but she would prefer to play in a way that minimizes my points, so she would choose the first scenario where I get 0 points.

Wait, but in the first scenario, I get 0 points, and in the second, I get 1 point.

So, she prefers the first scenario where I get 0 points, because in case of a tie in her score, she minimizes my score.

Wait, but in the first scenario, her score is higher (2 vs 1 in the second scenario).

So, actually, she doesn't need to consider minimizing my score because her score is higher in the first scenario.

Only if her score is the same in multiple scenarios, she would choose the one that minimizes my score.

But in this case, she gets 2 points in the first scenario and 1 point in the second scenario, so she strictly prefers the first scenario.

Therefore, in this example, I get 0 points.

Wait, but in the second scenario, I get 1 point, but she chooses the first scenario where I get 0 points.

So, in this case, I can only get 0 points because she will play optimally to maximize her score.

Hence, the answer should be 0.

But according to the problem, in the first test case with n=4 and a=1,1,2,3, the answer is 1.

Wait, but in my n=2 example, I get 0.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look back at the problem.

In the first test case:

n=4

a=1,1,2,3

So, Nene has the remaining cards: 2,3,4,4

According to the explanation in the sample input, the game proceeds as follows:

1. I play 1, no point.

2. Nene plays 4, no point.

3. I play 1, get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 4, get 1 point.

5. I play 2, no point.

6. Nene plays 2, get 1 point.

7. I play 3, no point.

8. Nene plays 3, get 1 point.

Total: me 1, Nene 3.

It says that this is one possible way, and that I cannot get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, in this case, I can get at least 1 point.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's see.

Another possible sequence:

1. I play 2, no point.

2. Nene plays 4, no point.

3. I play 1, no point.

4. Nene plays 4, get 1 point.

5. I play 1, get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 3, no point.

7. I play 3, get 1 point.

8. Nene plays 2, get 1 point.

Total: me 2, Nene 2.

In this case, I get 2 points, and Nene gets 2 points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

In this scenario, her score is 2, whereas in the previous one, her score is 3.

So, she would prefer the first scenario where she gets 3 points over this one where she gets 2 points.

Therefore, she would not choose this sequence.

Hence, I can't get 2 points because she would prevent it by choosing the first sequence where I get only 1 point.

So, in this case, the answer is 1.

Another test case: n=3, a=1,2,3; Nene has 1,2,3.

If I play 1, no point; Nene plays 1, gets 1 point; I play 2, no point; Nene plays 2, gets 1 point; I play 3, no point; Nene plays 3, gets 1 point. Total: me 0, Nene 3.

Alternatively, I play 2, no point; Nene plays 1, no point; I play 3, no point; Nene plays 2, gets 1 point; I play 1, get 1 point; Nene plays 3, get 1 point. Total: me 1, Nene 2.

But Nene would prefer the first sequence where she gets 3 points over the second where she gets 2 points.

Hence, in the first sequence, I get 0 points.

So, the answer is 0.

Wait, but in the second sequence, she gets only 2 points.

But according to her strategy, she prefers the first sequence where she gets 3 points.

Therefore, in this case, I get 0 points.

Hence, the answer is 0.

Another test case: n=1, a=1; Nene has 1.

I play 1, no point; Nene plays 1, gets 1 point.

Total: me 0, Nene 1.

So, me 0.

Now, I need to find a general way to compute the maximum score I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

Each integer appears exactly twice.

Me and Nene each have n cards, and together, they cover all integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.

So, for each integer x, there are two cards: one with x for me and one for Nene.

Wait, not necessarily.

Wait, actually, for each x, there are two cards with x, and they can be distributed between me and Nene in any combination: both to me, both to Nene, or one to each.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "the number on it appears exactly on 2 cards."

So, for each x from 1 to n, there are two cards with x.

Then, these 2n cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

So, for each x, the two cards with x can be both mine, both Nene's, or one each.

Given that, I need to consider the distribution of these pairs.

Let me define:

- Pairs where both cards are mine.

- Pairs where both cards are Nene's.

- Pairs where one card is mine and one is Nene's.

Let's denote:

- Let c_x be the number of cards I have with x.

- So, c_x can be 0,1, or 2.

- Similarly, Nene has 2 - c_x cards with x.

Now, I need to think about how to maximize my score, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me think about the possible scenarios for each x.

Case 1: c_x = 2.

- I have both cards with x.

- So, Nene has no cards with x.

- In this case, I can play one x, no point, and then play the second x and get one point.

- So, I can get one point from this x.

Case 2: c_x = 1.

- I have one card with x, and Nene has one card with x.

- So, when I play my x, if Nene has already played her x, I get a point.

- Otherwise, if Nene hasn't played her x yet, I don't get a point.

- Similarly, when Nene plays her x, she gets a point if I have already played my x.

Case 3: c_x = 0.

- I have no cards with x, Nene has both.

- So, Nene can play one x, no point, and then play the second x and get one point.

- So, Nene gets one point from this x.

Now, I need to consider the sequence of plays.

Since we alternate turns, starting with me, and we each have n cards to play.

I need to decide the order in which I play my cards to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems quite complex.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the number of "pairs" where both cards are mine, and the number of "pairs" where one card is mine and one is Nene's.

Wait, but "pairs" is not the right word here because pairs are defined as two cards with the same x.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of times I can play a card that matches a card already on the table.

Let me consider that.

Each time I play a card with x, I get a point if there is already an x on the table.

Similarly for Nene.

So, the key is to have x already on the table when I play my second x.

But, Nene can interfere with that by playing her x before I play my second x.

So, I need to think about the timing of the plays.

Let me consider that the table has some cards, and I want to play a card that matches something on the table to get a point.

Similarly, Nene wants to do the same.

So, it's like we're both trying to play the second card of a pair.

But the pairs are distributed between us.

I need to maximize the number of times I can play the second card of a pair, considering that Nene is trying to maximize her own such plays and minimize mine.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial optimization.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n=4

a=1,1,2,3

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Nene has two 3's and one 2.

Answer is 1.

Second test case:

n=8

a=7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, I have one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, two 8's, and two 5's.

Nene has the remaining cards: two 3's, one 6, one 4, one 7, one 1, one 2.

Wait, no.

Wait, each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly twice.

So, for numbers 1 to 8, there are two cards each.

Given that, if I have one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2, two 8's, and two 5's, then Nene has the other cards.

So, for 7: one card is mine, one is Nene's.

Similarly for 4,1,2.

For 8 and 5, I have both cards.

Answer is 2.

Third test case:

n=8

a=7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have one 7, one 1, two 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6.

Nene has the other cards.

Answer is 1.

Fourth test case:

n=3

a=1,2,3

So, I have one each of 1,2,3.

Nene has the other 1,2,3.

Answer is 0.

Fifth test case:

n=1

a=1

So, I have one 1, Nene has the other 1.

Answer is 0.

Looking at these, perhaps there is a pattern based on how many pairs I have.

In the first test case, I have one pair of 1's, and I get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs: two 8's and two 5's, and I get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair of 4's, and I get one point.

In the fourth test case, I have no pairs, and I get zero points.

In the fifth test case, I have no pair, and I get zero points.

So, it seems that the number of pairs I have corresponds to the number of points I can get.

But wait, in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and I get one point.

In the second test case, two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), and I get two points.

In the third test case, one pair (two 4's), and I get one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, no pairs, zero points.

So, perhaps, for each pair that I have both cards, I can get one point.

But, is that always the case?

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and I get one point.

But, if I have two 1's, and Nene has two 3's and one 2, I can play one 1, no point, then play the second 1 and get one point.

Similarly, in the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, so I can play one 8, no point, then the second 8, get one point; similarly for 5's.

Hence, two points.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, so one point.

In the fourth test case, no pairs, zero points.

In the fifth test case, no pairs, zero points.

So, it seems that for each pair that I have both cards, I can get one point.

But, is this always true?

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and I get one point.

But, Nene has two 3's and one 2.

She can play her 3's to get one point from the second 3.

But, she can also play her 2, which doesn't give her any points.

So, in that case, I can get one point from my second 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, so I can get two points.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, so one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, no pairs, zero points.

So, perhaps, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

But, is this always the case?

Wait, let's think of another example.

Suppose n=3.

Me: 1,1,2

Nene: 2,3,3

Then, I have one pair of 1's, and Nene has one pair of 3's.

If I play one 1, no point; Nene plays 2, no point; I play 1, get one point; Nene plays 3, no point; I play 2, no point; Nene plays 3, get one point.

Total: me 1, Nene 1.

Alternatively, I could play 1, no point; Nene plays 3, no point; I play 1, get one point; Nene plays 2, no point; I play 2, get one point; Nene plays 3, get one point.

Total: me 2, Nene 1.

But, Nene, being optimal, would choose the first sequence where she gets 1 point and minimizes my score to 1.

Hence, in this case, I can get at least 1 point.

But according to the earlier pattern, I have one pair (two 1's), so I should get one point.

But in the alternative sequence, I can get two points.

But Nene would prevent that by choosing the first sequence.

Hence, perhaps, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, assuming Nene plays optimally.

Wait, but in this example, I have one pair, but I could potentially get two points if Nene doesn't play optimally.

But since Nene plays optimally, she would prevent me from getting more than one point.

Hence, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have both cards of.

So, in this case, I have one pair (two 1's), so I can get one point.

Similarly, in the earlier test cases, it matches.

Hence, perhaps the answer is simply the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

But, let's check another example.

Suppose n=4.

Me: 1,1,2,2

Nene: 3,3,4,4

Then, I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

If I play one 1, no point; Nene plays 3, no point; I play one 2, no point; Nene plays 3, get one point; I play the second 1, get one point; Nene plays 4, no point; I play the second 2, get one point; Nene plays 4, get one point.

Total: me 2, Nene 2.

Alternatively, I could play one 1, no point; Nene plays 3, no point; I play the second 1, get one point; Nene plays 3, get one point; I play one 2, no point; Nene plays 4, no point; I play the second 2, get one point; Nene plays 4, get one point.

Total: me 2, Nene 2.

Or, Nene could play differently to minimize my points, but I still get two points.

Hence, in this case, I have two pairs, and I get two points.

Another example: n=5.

Me: 1,1,2,3,4

Nene: 2,3,4,5,5

Here, I have one pair of 1's, and Nene has one pair of 5's.

I can get one point from my second 1.

Nene can get one point from her second 5.

Hence, me 1, Nene 1.

So, again, the number of pairs I have corresponds to the number of points I can get.

Wait, but in the earlier example where n=3, me:1,1,2; Nene:2,3,3; I can get one point, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Hence, perhaps, the answer is simply the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

So, in the code, I can count how many integers x appear exactly twice in my hand.

That is, count the number of x where c_x == 2.

That would be the number of pairs I have both cards of.

Hence, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of such x where c_x == 2.

But, is this always true?

Wait, in the earlier example where n=3, me:1,1,2; Nene:2,3,3; I have one pair (two 1's), and I can get one point.

In another sequence, I could get two points, but Nene would prevent that.

Hence, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have both cards of.

Hence, the answer is the number of x where c_x == 2.

But, in the second test case, n=8, a=7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5; so, I have two 8's and two 5's, so number of pairs is two, and the answer is two.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, a=7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6; I have two 4's, so one pair, answer is one.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a=1,2,3; no pairs, answer is zero.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=1; no pair, answer is zero.

Hence, it seems that the answer is the number of x where c_x == 2.

But, wait, in the first test case, n=4, a=1,1,2,3; I have two 1's, so one pair, answer is one.

So, in all these cases, it matches.

Hence, perhaps, the answer is simply the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

But, is this always the case?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=4.

Me:1,1,2,3

Nene:2,3,4,4

As in the first test case.

I have one pair (two 1's), answer is one.

Another example: n=5.

Me:1,1,2,2,3

Nene:3,4,4,5,5

I have two pairs (two 1's and two 2's).

Hence, I can get two points.

Nene has two pairs (two 4's and two 5's), so she can get two points.

But, in this case, I have two pairs, so I can get two points.

Hence, it seems consistent.

Wait, but in the earlier example where n=3, me:1,1,2; Nene:2,3,3; I have one pair, and I can get one point.

Hence, perhaps, the answer is indeed the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

Hence, in the code, I can count the number of x where c_x == 2.

But, in the problem statement, it says that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a at most twice.

Hence, c_x can be 0,1, or 2.

So, I can count the number of x where c_x == 2.

That would be the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

Hence, that should be the answer.

But, in the earlier example where n=3, me:1,1,2; Nene:2,3,3; I have one pair, and I can get one point.

Hence, it seems correct.

Another way to think about it is that for each pair that I have both cards of, I can arrange to play the first card at a time when the table doesn't have that x yet, and play the second card when the first one is already on the table, thus getting a point.

Meanwhile, for pairs that I don't have both cards of, I can't guarantee getting a point because Nene can play her card in a way that minimizes my points.

Hence, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

Hence, the answer is the number of x where c_x == 2.

Hence, in the code, for each test case, count the number of x that appear exactly twice in my hand.

That can be done by counting the frequency of each x in a, and counting how many x have frequency == 2.

Hence, the code can be written accordingly.

But, looking at the given code:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

elements = line.split()

print(sum((elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})))

Wait, this code reads every second line starting from the second line (index 2), splits it into elements, and then for each unique element, counts how many times it appears in the list, integer divides by 3, and sums these up.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I concluded that the answer should be the number of x where c_x == 2.

But, in this code, it's summing elements.count(item) // 3 for unique items.

Wait, that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the interactions between my cards and Nene's cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for pairs where I have both cards, I can get one point, and for pairs where I have one card and Nene has one, there is some interaction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of such pairs where I have one card and Nene has one.

But, in my earlier examples, it seems that the answer is simply the number of pairs that I have both cards of.

Hence, perhaps the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but the given code is summing floor division of the count of each unique element by 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the number of x where c_x >=2, but only counting floor division by 3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times an x appears in my hand divided by 3.

But, in my earlier examples, that doesn't align with the answers.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, a=1,1,2,3.

Unique elements: 1,2,3.

counts: 1 appears twice, 2 once, 3 once.

sum of counts//3: 2//3 +1//3 +1//3 =0+0+0=0, but the answer should be 1.

Hence, this code is incorrect for that test case.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1.

Hence, this code would output 0, but the correct answer is 1.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, the code is sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in set(elements)).

In the first test case, sum(2//3 +1//3 +1//3)=0.

But the correct answer is 1.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

But, according to my earlier reasoning, the correct answer should be the number of x where c_x ==2.

Hence, in the first test case, c_x for x=1 is 2, and for x=2 and x=3 is 1.

Hence, number of x with c_x==2 is 1, which matches the sample output.

Hence, the correct approach is to count the number of x where c_x ==2.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
