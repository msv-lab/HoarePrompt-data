Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

Okay, so I need to determine, for given values of a and b, who will win the game if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics clearly.

1. **Exchange or Keep Wallets:** In each turn, the player has the option to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.

2. **Remove One Coin:** After choosing to swap or keep, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet. The wallet cannot have zero coins before removing.

The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move, meaning their wallet has zero coins and they can't remove any more.

I need to figure out a strategy that allows one player to force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if I can find a pattern.

**Test Case 1:**

a = 1, b = 1

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. Now, a=1, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=0, b=1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. Remove 1 coin, a=0, b=1.

- In both cases, it's Bob's turn with a=0 and b=1.

- Bob can only keep his wallet since swapping would still leave him with 1 coin. He removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0.

- Now, it's Alice's turn again, but both wallets are empty, so she can't make a move. Therefore, Bob wins.

**Test Case 2:**

a = 1, b = 4

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. Now, a=4, b=1. Alice removes 1 coin, a=3, b=1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. Remove 1 coin, a=0, b=4.

- Let's say Alice chooses to swap.

- Now, it's Bob's turn with a=3 and b=1.

- Bob can choose to swap or keep.

- If Bob swaps: a=1, b=3. Bob removes 1 coin, a=1, b=2.

- If Bob keeps: removes 1 from his wallet, a=3, b=0.

- Let's say Bob chooses to swap.

- Now, Alice has a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap. a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

- Option 2: Keep. Remove 1, a=0, b=2.

- Let's say Alice chooses to keep.

- Now, a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn:

- Can't swap because a=0, so must keep. Remove 1 from b, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn:

- Can't remove from a since a=0, so must swap with b=1. Now, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Interesting. In this case, Alice wins.

Looking at these two test cases:

- When a and b are equal, Bob wins.

- When a and b are different, Alice can make a move that leads to her victory.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, for a=1, b=4, Alice wins.

Let me look at the example output:

10 test cases with outputs:

Bob

Alice

Bob

Alice

Bob

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Bob

Looking at the first test case: 1 1 → Bob

Second: 1 4 → Alice

Third: 5 3 → Bob

Fourth: 4 5 → Alice

Fifth: 11 9 → Bob

Sixth: 83 91 → Bob

Seventh: 1032 9307 → Alice

Eighth: 839204 7281 → Alice

Ninth: 1000000000 1000000000 → Bob

Tenth: 53110 2024 → Bob

Looking for a pattern:

When a and b are equal, Bob wins.

When a and b differ by an even number, Bob wins.

When a and b differ by an odd number, Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

Test case 1: a=1, b=1 → diff=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Test case 2: a=1, b=4 → diff=3 (odd) → Alice wins.

Test case 3: a=5, b=3 → diff=2 (even) → Bob wins.

Test case 4: a=4, b=5 → diff=1 (odd) → Alice wins.

Test case 5: a=11, b=9 → diff=2 (even) → Bob wins.

Test case 6: a=83, b=91 → diff=8 (even) → Bob wins.

Test case 7: a=1032, b=9307 → diff=8275 (odd) → Alice wins.

Test case 8: a=839204, b=7281 → diff=831923 (odd) → Alice wins.

Test case 9: a=1000000000, b=1000000000 → diff=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Test case 10: a=53110, b=2024 → diff=51086 (even) → Bob wins.

Yes, it seems that when the difference between a and b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

So, the strategy seems to be based on the difference between a and b.

Let me try to generalize this.

Define the difference d = |a - b|.

If d is even, Bob wins.

If d is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for all the test cases.

But why is this the case?

Let's think about the game in terms of parity.

Each move, a player removes one coin from their current wallet.

If they choose to swap wallets, the wallets' coins are exchanged.

The game continues until a player can't make a move, i.e., their current wallet has zero coins.

Given that, the game is symmetric in a certain way.

The key is to notice that swapping wallets allows the player to switch between the two wallet states.

But the condition that the player must remove one coin from their current wallet after choosing to swap or keep adds complexity.

However, the parity of the difference seems to determine the winner.

Let me consider the game as a impartial game, where the game state is determined by the pair (a, b).

Each move consists of choosing to swap or not, and then removing one coin from the current wallet.

I need to find a way to model this game to determine the winning strategy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of Nimbers or some other game theory concept, but that might be too advanced for this problem.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the simplest way is to accept that the difference's parity determines the winner, as observed in the test cases.

Therefore, the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

Seems to be correct based on the observation from the test cases.

But to be thorough, let's consider another test case.

Suppose a=2, b=2.

Difference is 0, which is even, so Bob wins.

Play through:

- Alice's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=2, b=2. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: can't swap since a=0, so keep. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: both wallets empty, can't make a move. Bob wins.

Another test case: a=2, b=3.

Difference is 1, which is odd, so Alice wins.

Play through:

- Alice's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=3, b=2. Remove 1, a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=2, b=2. Remove 1, a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=2, b=1. Remove 1, a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: swap or keep.

- If swap: a=1, b=1. Remove 1, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: can't swap since a=0, so keep. Remove 1, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Bob}}\]
