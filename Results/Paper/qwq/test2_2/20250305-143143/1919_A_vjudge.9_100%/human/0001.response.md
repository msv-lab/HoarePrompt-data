Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets, and they take turns making moves according to specific rules. The goal is to determine who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the key points are:

1. Players take turns, Alice starts.

2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.

3. After choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet, and the wallet can't have zero coins before removing.

4. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

I need to determine, for given 'a' and 'b', who wins if both play optimally.

First, I should think about the base cases.

Case 1: Both a and b are 1.

- Alice's turn: She can choose not to swap. Then a becomes 0, b remains 1.

- Bob's turn: He can choose not to swap. Then a remains 0, b becomes 0.

- Alice's turn: Both wallets are empty, so she can't make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

So, when a = b = 1, Bob wins.

Case 2: a = 1, b = 2.

- Alice's turn: She can choose to swap or not.

- If she chooses not to swap: a = 0, b = 2.

- Bob's turn: He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap: a = 0, b = 1.

- Alice's turn: She must swap because her wallet is empty. So, a = 0, b = 0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

- Alternatively, if Alice chooses to swap in the first place: a = 2, b = 1.

- Bob's turn: He can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap: a = 1, b = 1.

- Alice's turn: a = 0, b = 1.

- Bob's turn: a = 0, b = 0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Wait, so depending on the choices, different outcomes are possible. But since they play optimally, we need to see what choice leads to a win.

In this case, if Alice chooses not to swap, she can force a win. So, Alice wins.

Wait, but in the first scenario with a = b = 1, Bob wins. In a =1, b=2, Alice wins.

I need to look for a pattern.

Let me try a = 2, b = 2.

- Alice's turn: Choose not to swap. a =1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses to swap in the first move: a=2, b=2.

It's the same situation.

So, Bob wins when a = b.

Another case: a = 3, b = 2.

- Alice's turn: Choose not to swap. a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: Choose to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses to swap in the first move: a=2, b=3.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=3.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: Choose to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: Choose not to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, depending on the choice, different outcomes. But optimally, Alice would choose the path where she wins.

Wait, but in this case, if she chooses not to swap, she wins, but if she chooses to swap, Bob wins. So, she chooses not to swap, and wins.

Wait, but in the previous case with a=2, b=2, Bob wins.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the winning condition is based on the number of moves or some parity.

Here, the game ends when a player can't make a move, which is when both wallets are empty.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one, since one coin is removed each turn.

The game starts with a + b coins in total.

Each move, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet, provided it's not empty.

Also, they can choose to swap wallets before removing the coin.

So, the swap introduces a bit of complexity.

I need to see how the swap affects the game.

Let me consider that swap allows the player to choose which wallet to deplete the coin from.

Wait, but it's not exactly choosing which wallet to remove the coin from, because after swapping, they remove from the current wallet.

So, effectively, swapping allows the player to choose which wallet to remove the coin from.

Because if they swap, they remove from the opponent's wallet, else from their own.

Wait, no. After swapping, the wallets are exchanged, and then they remove from their current wallet.

So, swapping allows them to target the opponent's wallet.

But in terms of strategy, it's about controlling the coin counts.

This seems similar to a Nim game or some impartial game where the number of coins matters.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the parity of the difference between a and b.

Looking back at the initial program, it seems to check if the absolute difference between a and b is even or odd.

If |a - b| is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Is that correct?

Let me test with some examples.

From earlier:

- a=1, b=1: difference is 0, which is even -> Bob wins. Matches the first test case.

- a=1, b=4: difference is 3, which is odd -> Alice wins. Matches the second test case.

- a=5, b=3: difference is 2, even -> Bob wins.

- a=4, b=5: difference is 1, odd -> Alice wins.

- a=11, b=9: difference is 2, even -> Bob wins.

- a=83, b=91: difference is 8, even -> Bob wins.

- a=1032, b=9307: difference is 8275, odd -> Alice wins.

- a=839204, b=7281: difference is 831923, odd -> Alice wins.

- a=1000000000, b=1000000000: difference is 0, even -> Bob wins.

- a=53110, b=2024: difference is 51086, even -> Bob wins.

This matches the output in the example.

So, based on this, it seems the program is correct.

But to be thorough, let's think about why this works.

Suppose a = b.

Then, the difference is 0, which is even, so Bob wins.

From earlier, when a = b, Bob wins, which matches.

If a != b, then depending on whether the difference is even or odd, Alice or Bob wins.

Perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of the difference.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the parity of the sum or something else.

Wait, but in the program, it's checking the absolute difference.

Let me consider that.

If |a - b| is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me consider that the game continues until both wallets are empty.

The total number of moves is a + b.

The player who makes the (a + b)th move wins, because the opponent can't make a move after that.

Since Alice starts, she makes the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., moves.

Bob makes the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., moves.

So, if a + b is even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

If a + b is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins.

Wait, but that's not matching the program's logic.

The program checks |a - b| % 2 == 0 for Bob to win.

But according to this, a + b's parity determines the winner.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile these.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a = b.

Then, as in the first test case, Bob wins.

If a != b, need to see.

Wait, perhaps the difference's parity determines something about the symmetry of the game.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of times they can force the opponent into a certain position.

I'm not sure.

Given that the program seems to work based on the test cases, and I can't find a counterexample off the top of my head, I'll conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The program is correct.}} \]
