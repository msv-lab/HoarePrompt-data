Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding array values multiplied by the length of the substring. The goal is to split the string in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

First, I need to understand how the array 'a' is defined based on the string 's'. If s_i is "+", then a_i is 1, and if s_i is "-", then a_i is -1. So, the array 'a' is just a numerical representation of the string 's' with "+" as 1 and "-" as -1.

Now, the problem is about splitting this array 'a' into multiple non-empty subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. Finally, sum up all these penalties and find the minimum possible value.

I need to think about how to split the array to minimize this total penalty.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty is 5.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

If I split it into two parts, say ([-1, -1, -1], [-1, -1]), the penalties would be | -3 | * 3 = 9 and | -2 | * 2 = 4, total penalty 13, which is worse.

Or, split into three parts: ([-1, -1], [-1, -1], [-1]), penalties are | -2| * 2 = 4, | -2| * 2 = 4, and | -1| * 1 = 1, total 9, still worse.

So, splitting into individual elements seems to give the minimal penalty in this case.

Third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+ -"

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into ([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1]), the penalties are |0| * 4 = 0 and |0| * 2 = 0, total penalty 0.

That's perfect, no penalty.

Fourth example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++ -"

So, a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

If I split it into ([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1]), the penalties are |7| * 9 = 63 and | -1| * 1 = 1, total 64.

That seems high.

Alternatively, split into ([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1]), penalties are | -1| * 1 = 1, |6| * 7 = 42, | -1| * 1 = 1, total 44.

Still high.

Better split: ([-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1])

So, sums are |0| * 2 = 0 for each pair, total penalty 0. Wait, but the last pair is [1, -1], which is |0| * 2 = 0.

Wait, but the entire array sum is -1 + -1 + 7*1 + -1 = 4, but in this splitting, the total penalty is 0, which seems better.

Wait, but according to the problem, the answer is 4.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty isn't always 0.

Wait, in the third example, it was 0, but in this one, it's 4.

I need to think differently.

Let me look at the function provided in the program.

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

So, it counts the number of '+' and '-', calculates the difference, and returns the absolute value of that difference.

Wait, in the first example:

n=1, s="+", count=1, sub=0, abs(1-0)=1, which matches the first test case.

Second example:

n=5, s="-----", count=0, sub=5, abs(5-0)=5, matches the second test case.

Third example:

n=6, s="+-+-+ -", count=4 (assuming the space is a '-'), so sub=2, abs(4-2)=2, but the expected output is 0, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, s="+-+-+ -", that's 6 characters, assuming the space is a '-', so 4 '+' and 2 '-', so count=4, sub=2, abs(4-2)=2, but the expected output is 0.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Fourth example:

n=10, s="--+++++++ -", assuming 7 '+' and 3 '-', count=7, sub=3, abs(7-3)=4, which matches the fourth test case.

Fifth example:

n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", count=10, sub=10, abs(10-10)=0, but the expected output is 4, so discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, in the third example, s="+-+-+ -", that's 6 characters, assuming the space is a '-', so s="+-+-+-", which is 3 '+' and 3 '-', so count=3, sub=3, abs(3-3)=0, which matches the expected output of 0.

Wait, earlier I thought count=4, but actually, it's 3 '+' and 3 '-', so count=3, sub=3, abs(3-3)=0.

So, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

In the fifth example, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", let's count the '+' and '-':

+ - - - + + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -

Count of '+': 10

Count of '-': 10

So, count=10, sub=10, abs(10-10)=0, but the expected output is 4, which doesn't match.

So, the function seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the function is correct for some cases but not all.

Wait, perhaps the function is calculating something different from what the problem is asking.

Wait, let's think about what the function is doing.

It's counting the number of '+' and '-', then taking the absolute difference, and returning that.

But according to the problem, we need to split the array into subarrays and sum the penalties based on the formula given.

I think there's a misunderstanding here.

Maybe the function is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-', but that doesn't explain why in some cases it's zero.

Wait, in the third example, with equal number of '+' and '-', the minimal penalty is zero, which matches the abs difference being zero.

In the fifth example, with equal number of '+' and '-', the minimal penalty is 4, which doesn't match the abs difference of zero.

So, the function seems incorrect.

I think I need to find a better approach.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I split the array into subarrays where each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-', then the sum of each subarray would be zero, and hence the penalty would be zero.

But, in the fifth example, that's not possible because the total number of '+' and '-' are equal, but the minimal penalty is 4, not zero.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the distribution of '+' and '-' in the string.

Perhaps it's not always possible to split into subarrays with equal number of '+' and '-'.

Wait, in the third example, s="+-+-+-", I can split into ([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1]), each with sum 0 and length 2, total penalty 0.

In the fifth example, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", which is "+ - - - + + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -"

Let's see, maybe it's not possible to split it into subarrays with sum zero each.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the minimal number of splits needed to balance the sums in some way.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the whole array as one subarray.

Then, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the fifth example, sum(a) = 10 - 10 = 0, so penalty is 0 * 20 = 0, but the expected output is 4.

So, in some cases, splitting can lead to a lower penalty than not splitting.

Wait, in this case, not splitting would give penalty 0, but the minimal penalty is 4, which is higher.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, no, the total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

If I split into more subarrays, I might get a lower total penalty.

In the fifth example, splitting into more subarrays gives a total penalty of 4, which is lower than not splitting.

Wait, but in the third example, splitting into multiple subarrays gives a lower penalty of 0, which is better than not splitting.

Wait, but in the second example, splitting into individual elements gives a lower penalty of 5, which is better than splitting into fewer subarrays.

So, the optimal way depends on the string.

I need a general approach.

Maybe dynamic programming can be used here.

Define dp[i] as the minimal total penalty for the substring s[0 to i-1].

Then, for each i from 0 to n, iterate over all possible splits before i, and choose the one that minimizes the penalty.

But n can be up to 5000, and t up to 1000, so time complexity needs to be considered.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the penalty formula: |sum(b_j)| * len(b_j) for each subarray b_j.

I need to minimize the sum of these over all subarrays.

I need to find a way to group the elements such that the sum of (|sum(b_j)| * len(b_j)) is minimized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider the prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of a[0 to i-1].

Then, for a split (b1, b2, ..., bk), the sum of each b_j is prefix_sum[end] - prefix_sum[start].

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as minimizing the sum over all splits of |prefix_sum[end] - prefix_sum[start]| * (end - start).

But that still seems complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix the number of splits, and try to find the optimal places to split.

But the number of splits is variable, so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when each subarray has a sum as close to zero as possible, considering their lengths.

But I need a way to formalize this.

Let me consider small cases.

For n=1:

If s="+", penalty=1*1=1

If s="-", penalty=1*1=1

For n=2:

If s="++", sum=2, penalty=2*2=4

If s="+-", sum=0, penalty=0

If s="-+", sum=0, penalty=0

If s="--", sum=-2, penalty=2*2=4

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements would give penalties of 1+1=2 for "+-" and "-+", which is worse than splitting into one subarray with penalty 0.

Wait, but according to the earlier examples, splitting into subarrays with sum zero is better.

Wait, in n=2, for "+-" or "-+", splitting into one subarray gives penalty 0, which is better than splitting into two subarrays with penalty 2.

So, the optimal is to have subarrays with sum zero.

But in n=5, "-----", splitting into individual elements gives penalty 5, which is better than splitting into fewer subarrays.

Wait, in that case, sum of each subarray is -1, penalty is 1*1=1 for each, total 5.

If I split into two subarrays, say ([-1,-1,-1], [-1,-1]), penalties are | -3| *3 =9 and | -2| *2=4, total 13, which is worse.

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements is better.

Wait, but in n=6, "+-+-+-", splitting into three subarrays of two each gives penalty 0, which is better than splitting into one subarray with sum zero and penalty 6*0=0.

Wait, no, sum is zero, penalty is zero, same as splitting into subarrays with sum zero.

So, in that case, both ways give the same result.

But in n=10, "--+++++++ -", with sum zero, splitting into subarrays with sum zero gives minimal penalty.

But according to the problem, the minimal penalty is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some subarrays must have non-zero sums.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that splitting into subarrays where the sum is zero is ideal, but when that's not possible, minimize the sum of |sum(b_j)| * len(b_j).

Wait, perhaps there's a way to calculate this without dynamic programming.

Wait, maybe there's a formula based on the counts of '+' and '-'.

Looking back at the function provided:

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

So, it's returning the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-'.

In the first example, n=1, s="+", count=1, sub=0, abs(1-0)=1, matches output 1.

Second example, n=5, s="-----", count=0, sub=5, abs(0-5)=5, matches output 5.

Third example, n=6, s="+-+-+ -", assuming s="+-+-+-", count=3, sub=3, abs(3-3)=0, matches output 0.

Fourth example, n=10, s="--+++++++ -", count=7, sub=3, abs(7-3)=4, matches output 4.

Fifth example, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", count=10, sub=10, abs(10-10)=0, but output is 4.

Wait, in the fifth example, according to the function, it should be 0, but the expected output is 4.

So, there's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the '+' and '-' in the fifth example.

Let's count them:

s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"

Breaking it down:

+ - - - + + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -

Count of '+': 10

Count of '-': 10

According to the function, abs(10 - 10) = 0, but the expected output is 4.

So, the function is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
