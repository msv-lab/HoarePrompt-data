Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N is the length of the strings I need to form, and K is the number of lowercase English alphabets to use, starting from 'a'. I need to create a string S such that all possible strings of length N using the first K letters are subsequences of S. And I have to make S as short as possible.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so for each test case, I get N and K. I need to generate a string S where every possible combination of N letters from the first K letters appears as a subsequence.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

1 2

2 1

2 2

2 3

Output:

ab

aa

baab

abcbac

For the first test case, N=1, K=2. The possible strings are "a" and "b". The output is "ab". Both "a" and "b" are subsequences of "ab", which makes sense.

Second test case, N=2, K=1. Only possible string is "aa". The output is "aa", which obviously contains "aa" as a subsequence.

Third test case, N=2, K=2. Possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". The output is "baab". Let's check:

- "aa" is in "baab" as the 2nd and 4th characters.

- "ab" is in "baab" as the 1st and 3rd characters.

- "ba" is in "baab" as the 1st and 2nd characters.

- "bb" is in "baab" as the 3rd and 4th characters.

Looks good.

Fourth test case, N=2, K=3. Possible strings are all combinations of 'a', 'b', 'c' of length 2. That's 9 strings: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". The output is "abcbac". Let's verify a few:

- "aa": appears as 1st and 3rd 'a's.

- "ab": 1st and 2nd characters.

- "ac": 1st and 4th characters.

- "ba": 2nd and 3rd characters.

- And so on. Seems like all are covered.

So, the problem is to find the shortest string S such that all possible N-length strings from the first K letters are subsequences of S.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = ''

for j in range(97, k + 97):

s += chr(j)

if k == 1:

print(n * s)

else:

print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)

Let's try to understand what this code is doing.

It reads the number of test cases, T. For each test case, it reads N and K.

Then, it constructs a string S by concatenating the first K lowercase letters, starting from 'a'.

For example, if K=3, S='abc'.

Then, it checks if K is 1. If K is 1, it prints S repeated N times. So, for K=1, N=2, it would print 'aa'.

Otherwise, it prints S multiplied by (2 - (n == 1)). So, if N is 1, it's 2 - 1 = 1, else 2.

So, for K=2, N=1, it's 2 * S = 'abab'.

Wait, but in the sample input, for N=1, K=2, the output is 'ab', not 'abab'.

Hmm, that's different from the sample output.

Wait, in the sample input, for N=1, K=2, output is 'ab', but according to this code, it would print 'ab' only once because 2 - (n == 1) is 1.

Wait, no, 2 - (n == 1) is 2 - 1 = 1, so it should print S once, which is 'ab'.

Wait, but in the sample, it's 'ab', which matches.

Wait, but in the third test case, N=2, K=2, it should print S twice, since 2 - (n == 1) is 2.

So, it would print 'baab', which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the code, S is constructed by starting from 'a' to 'k + 97', but in the third test case, it's 'baab', which starts with 'b'.

Wait, in the code, S is built by appending characters from 'a' to 'k + 97', but in the third test case, it's 'baab'.

Wait, there's something off here.

Let me check how S is constructed.

for j in range(97, k + 97):

s += chr(j)

So, for K=2, it's range(97, 99), which is 'a', 'b'.

So S='ab'.

But in the sample, for N=2, K=2, it's 'baab'.

But according to the code, it's (2 - (n == 1)) * S, which is 1 * S = 'ab', but sample output is 'baab'.

Wait, that's a discrepancy.

So, for N=2, K=2, the code would output 'ab', but the sample output is 'baab'.

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, the code would output 'abc', but the sample output is 'abcbac'.

So, the code seems incorrect because it doesn't match the sample outputs for N=2, K=2 and N=2, K=3.

Wait, but in the code, for K=2, N=2, it's (2 - (n == 1)) * S, which is 1 * S = 'ab', but sample is 'baab', which is longer.

So, the code is incorrect in these cases.

Wait, but for K=1, N=2, it's 'aa', which matches the sample.

For K=2, N=1, it's 'ab', which matches the first sample.

But for N=2, K=2, it's 'ab', which doesn't match the sample 'baab'.

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, it's 'abc', which doesn't match 'abcbac'.

So, the code is incorrect for N >=2 and K >=2.

I need to think about how to construct S correctly.

I need to find the shortest string S such that all possible N-length strings from the first K letters are subsequences of S.

This sounds like a problem related to de Bruijn sequences, but for subsequences instead of substrings.

In de Bruijn sequences, we deal with subsequences of a certain length that appear as contiguous substrings, but here, we need all possible N-length strings to appear as subsequences, not necessarily contiguous.

So, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me think about N=1.

For N=1, regardless of K, I just need to include all K letters at least once, in any order, because any single letter is a subsequence anywhere it appears.

So, for N=1, S can be just the concatenation of the K letters, like 'abc' for K=3.

But in the code, for K=1, it's N * S, which is N copies of the single letter.

But actually, for N=1, K=1, S just needs to contain that one letter at least once, so S should be of length at least 1.

But in the code, for K=1, it's N * S, so if N=1, K=1, S='a', which is correct.

For N=2, K=1, it's 'aa', which is correct, as per the sample.

Wait, but for N=2, K=2, the code outputs 'ab', but the sample output is 'baab', which is longer.

So, the code is incorrect for N >=2 and K >=2.

I need to find a better way to construct S.

Let's think about how to minimize the length of S while ensuring all possible N-length strings from K letters are subsequences.

One way to approach this is to maximize the overlap between the required subsequences.

For N=2 and K=2, possible strings are 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb'.

I need to arrange these in a way that their subsequences overlap as much as possible.

Looking at the sample 'baab':

- 'aa' is positions 2 and 4.

- 'ab' is positions 1 and 3.

- 'ba' is positions 1 and 2.

- 'bb' is positions 3 and 4.

So, it covers all with S='baab', which has length 4.

Is there a shorter string that can cover all these?

Let's see.

If I try 'aabb':

- 'aa' is positions 1 and 2.

- 'ab' is positions 1 and 3.

- 'ba' is positions 2 and 3.

- 'bb' is positions 3 and 4.

Seems to work, also length 4.

Another option: 'abba'.

- 'aa' is positions 1 and 4.

- 'ab' is positions 1 and 2.

- 'ba' is positions 3 and 4.

- 'bb' is positions 2 and 3.

Also works.

So, length 4 is the minimum here.

Is there a way to do it in length 3?

Let's try 'aab':

- 'aa' is positions 1 and 2.

- 'ab' is positions 1 and 3.

- 'ba' is positions 2 and 3.

- 'bb' is not present.

So, 'bb' is missing.

Or 'abb':

- 'aa' is not present.

- 'ab' is positions 1 and 2.

- 'ba' is positions 2 and 3.

- 'bb' is positions 2 and 3.

Wait, 'aa' is missing.

So, it seems impossible to cover all with length 3.

Hence, the minimal length is 4 for N=2 and K=2.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, there are 9 possible strings.

The sample output is 'abcbac', which has length 6.

Is there a shorter string that can cover all 9 possible strings?

Let's see.

Possible strings:

'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc'.

Looking at 'abcbac':

- 'aa': positions 1 and 5.

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2.

- 'ac': positions 1 and 6.

- 'ba': positions 4 and 5.

- 'bb': positions 4 and 6.

- 'bc': positions 4 and 5.

- 'ca': positions 5 and 6.

- 'cb': positions 3 and 4.

- 'cc': positions 5 and 6.

Wait, 'cc' is positions 5 and 6, which are 'a' and 'c', so that's not 'cc'. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, 'abcbac' has positions: a, b, c, b, a, c.

- 'cc' would require two 'c's in sequence, but here, 'c' is at positions 3 and 6.

So, 'cc' would need positions 3 and 6, but it's 'c' and 'c', so yes, 'cc' is present.

Wait, but in the note, it says 'cc' is positions 5 and 6, which are 'a' and 'c', but that doesn't make 'cc'. So, perhaps the note is incorrect.

Wait, in the note, for 'cc', it's positions 5 and 6 in 'abcbac', which are 'a' and 'c', which doesn't form 'cc'. So, maybe there's a mistake in the note.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the note.

In the note, for 'cc', it says:

- \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

So, positions 3 and 6 are 'c' and 'c', so 'cc' is present.

So, 'abcbac' does contain 'cc' as a subsequence.

Now, is there a shorter string than 'abcbac' for N=2 and K=3?

Let's see.

Suppose I try 'abcabc':

- It's longer, 6 characters, same as 'abcbac'.

Is there a way to do it in 5 characters?

Let's attempt to construct one.

Take 'abcbc':

- 'aa': not present.

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2.

- 'ac': positions 1 and 4.

- 'ba': positions 2 and 3.

- 'bb': positions 3 and 4.

- 'bc': positions 3 and 4.

- 'ca': not present.

- 'cb': positions 4 and 5.

- 'cc': positions 4 and 5.

So, 'aa' and 'ca' are missing.

Hence, not all subsequences are covered.

Another attempt: 'abcbac', which is length 6 and covers all.

Is there a way to cover all with length 5?

Probably not, since 'aa' and 'ca' would require additional 'a's.

So, likely, the minimal length is 6 for N=2 and K=3.

Now, generalizing this, I need a way to construct S such that it contains all possible N-length strings from K letters as subsequences, with minimal length.

One approach is to use the concept of a supersequence.

A supersequence is a string that contains a given set of strings as subsequences.

In this case, I need a supersequence for all possible N-length strings from K letters.

Finding the minimal supersequence is a classic problem in computer science.

One way to approach this is to find the minimal string that contains all required subsequences by overlapping them optimally.

In the case of N=2 and K=2, the minimal length is 4, as seen in 'baab' or 'abba'.

For N=2 and K=3, it's 6, as in 'abcbac'.

Is there a pattern here?

For K=2, N=2, length=4=2^2.

For K=3, N=2, length=6=3*2.

Is this a general pattern?

Wait, for K=1, N=2, length=2=1^2*2.

Wait, no, K=1, N=2, length=2=1*2.

Wait, maybe it's K*N.

But for K=2, N=2, K*N=4, which matches.

For K=3, N=2, K*N=6, which matches.

For K=1, N=1, K*N=1, which would be 'a', matches.

For K=2, N=1, K*N=2, which is 'ab', matches.

So, it seems that the minimal length is K*N.

Is this always true?

Wait, but for N=1, K=1, it's 1, which is K*N=1*1=1.

For N=2, K=1, it's 2, which is K*N=1*2=2.

For N=2, K=2, it's 4=2*2.

For N=2, K=3, it's 6=3*2.

Seems consistent.

Is this always the case?

Wait, but for N=3, K=2, what would be the minimal length?

If the pattern holds, it should be 6=3*2.

But let's think about it.

For N=3, K=2, possible strings are 'aaa', 'aab', 'aba', 'abb', 'baa', 'bab', 'bba', 'bbb'.

I need to arrange these in a string where all of these appear as subsequences.

What's the minimal length?

If I take 'aaabbb', does it cover all?

- 'aaa': positions 1,2,3.

- 'aab': positions 1,2,4.

- 'aba': positions 1,4,5.

- 'abb': positions 1,4,6.

- 'baa': positions 3,4,5.

- 'bab': positions 3,4,6.

- 'bba': positions 4,5,6.

- 'bbb': positions 4,5,6.

Wait, 'baa' is positions 3,4,5: 'a','a','b', which is 'aab', not 'baa'.

Wait, maybe I misidentified.

Wait, in 'aaabbb':

- 'baa': where 'b' is position 3, and 'a's are positions 4 and 5.

Wait, but position 3 is 'a', position 4 is 'b'.

Wait, no, 'aaabbb' is positions 1:'a', 2:'a', 3:'a', 4:'b', 5:'b', 6:'b'.

So, 'baa' would require a 'b' followed by two 'a's, but in 'aaabbb', after position 3, there are only 'b's, so 'baa' is not present.

So, 'aaabbb' doesn't cover 'baa'.

Another attempt: 'ababab'.

- 'aaa': positions 1,3,5.

- 'aab': positions 1,3,4.

- 'aba': positions 1,2,3.

- 'abb': positions 1,2,4.

- 'baa': positions 2,4,5.

- 'bab': positions 2,4,6.

- 'bba': positions 3,4,5.

- 'bbb': positions 4,5,6.

Wait, 'baa': positions 2,4,5: 'b','a','a'. Yes, that works.

Similarly, all others seem to be covered.

So, 'ababab' covers all 8 possible strings with N=3 and K=2.

Is there a shorter string than length 6?

Let's try 'ababb'.

- 'aaa': positions 1,3,5: 'a','b','a'.

That's 'aba', not 'aaa'.

Wait, need three 'a's.

But in 'ababb', there are only two 'a's, so 'aaa' is not present.

Hence, need at least three 'a's and three 'b's.

So, minimal length is 6 for N=3 and K=2.

So, in this case, K*N=6, which matches.

Seems like a general pattern that minimal length is K*N.

So, perhaps the code should always output a string of length K*N, consisting of N repetitions of the K letters in some order.

But in the provided code, for K=2, N=2, it's outputting 'abab', which is K*N=4, matching the sample 'baab'.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2, it's 'abcabc', which is length 6, matching the sample 'abcbac'.

Wait, but in the code, for K=2, N=2, it's (2 - (n == 1)) * s, which is 1 * 'ab' = 'ab', but according to K*N=2*2=4, it should be 'abab'.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, (2 - (n == 1)) is 1 when n=2, so it's 1 * s = 'ab'.

But according to K*N=4, it should be 'abab'.

So, the code is incorrect here.

Wait, maybe I need to interpret (2 - (n == 1)) differently.

When n=1, it's 2 - 1 =1, else 2.

So, for n=1, it's 1 * s.

For n=2, it's 2 * s.

So, for K=2, N=2, it's 'abab', which matches K*N=4.

Wait, but in the sample, it's 'baab', which is also length 4.

So, perhaps it's acceptable.

But in the code, for K=2, N=2, it's 'abab', but in the sample, it's 'baab'.

Both are correct as long as they cover all subsequences.

So, perhaps the code is acceptable for N=2 and K=2.

But for N=1 and K=2, it's 'ab', which matches the sample.

For N=2 and K=3, according to the code, it's (2 - (2 == 1)) * s = 1 * 'abc' = 'abc', but in the sample, it's 'abcbac', which is longer.

Wait, but for N=2 and K=3, K*N=6, so 'abc' is length 3, which is insufficient.

Hence, the code is incorrect for N>=2 and K>=3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the expression.

(2 - (n == 1)) * s

For n=1, it's (2 - 1) * s = 1 * s = s.

For n=2, it's (2 - 0) * s = 2 * s = 'abab' for K=2.

Similarly, for K=3, n=2, it's 2 * 'abc' = 'abcabc', which matches the sample 'abcbac' in length.

But in the sample, for N=2 and K=3, it's 'abcbac', which is also length 6.

So, perhaps it's acceptable.

Wait, but in the code, for K=2, N=2, it's 'abab', which is length 4, matching K*N=4.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2, it's 'abcabc', which is length 6, matching K*N=6.

So, perhaps the minimal length is K*N.

And the code is constructing S as N repetitions of the K letters.

But in the sample for N=2 and K=2, 'baab' is used instead of 'abab'.

Both are correct as long as they cover all subsequences.

So, perhaps the code is correct in terms of length, but not in terms of the specific string generated.

But the problem states: "if there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them."

So, as long as the string has the minimal length and contains all required subsequences, it's acceptable.

Hence, the code seems to be following this approach: constructing S as N repetitions of the K letters in order.

But in the sample, for N=2 and K=2, 'baab' is used instead of 'abab'.

Both have length 4 and cover all required subsequences.

So, both are acceptable.

Hence, the code is correct in terms of length and correctness of the string.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, 'abcabc' is used, which is acceptable, although the sample uses 'abcbac'.

Both have length 6 and cover all required subsequences.

Hence, the code seems to be correct.

Wait, but for K=1 and N=2, it's 'aa', which is correct.

For K=2 and N=1, it's 'ab', which is correct.

For K=2 and N=2, 'abab' is correct.

For K=3 and N=2, 'abcabc' is correct.

So, seems like the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`. The goal is to create `s` with the smallest possible length.

## Approach
1. **Understand Subsequence Requirement**: A subsequence can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
2. **Generate the String `s`**:
   - For `k` alphabets, we need to repeat the sequence of these alphabets in a way that ensures all combinations of length `n` are covered.
   - For `k = 1`, the string `s` should be composed of `n` repetitions of that single alphabet.
   - For `k > 1`, repeating the sequence of `k` alphabets `(2 - (n == 1))` times ensures minimal coverage for `n >= 2`. For `n = 1`, it's sufficient to have the alphabets appear once.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)

func()
```

## Explanation
- **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
- **String Construction**:
  - Construct the string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase alphabets.
  - If `k == 1`, print `s` repeated `n` times.
  - Otherwise, print `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.
- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that the generated string `s` is of minimal length while covering all required subsequences. The time complexity is linear with respect to the output size, making it efficient for the given constraints.

This solution is designed to be simple, efficient, and adheres to the problem's requirements, ensuring that all possible combinations of the specified length appear as subsequences in the generated string.
