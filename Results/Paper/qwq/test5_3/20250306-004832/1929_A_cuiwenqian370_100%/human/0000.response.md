Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2,1,3]. If I arrange it as [1,2,3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example given.

Wait a minute, if I have an array like [1,2,3], the differences are 1 and 1, summing to 2. But if I arrange it differently, say [3,2,1], then the differences would be (2-3) = -1 and (1-2) = -1, summing to -2. But the problem says that the beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), so it could be negative. However, in the example, they have a positive beauty. Maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "the beauty of the array a as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n". So, it's just the sum of differences. But in the first example, they have a beauty of 2, which is achieved by arranging the array in ascending order.

Wait, but if I arrange it in descending order, I get a negative beauty. Is there a way to get a higher positive beauty by arranging it differently? Let's see.

Take the first example: [2,1,3]. If I arrange it as [1,2,3], beauty is 2. If I arrange it as [1,3,2], beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 -1 =1. If I arrange it as [2,1,3], beauty is (1-2) + (3-1) = -1 + 2 =1. If I arrange it as [2,3,1], beauty is (3-2) + (1-3) =1 -2 =-1. If I arrange it as [3,1,2], beauty is (1-3) + (2-1) =-2 +1 =-1. If I arrange it as [3,2,1], beauty is (2-3) + (1-2) =-1 -1=-2.

So, the maximum beauty among all possible arrangements is 2, which is achieved by arranging the array in ascending order. Interesting.

Let me try another example. Take the second test case: n=3, array=[69,69,69]. No matter how I arrange them, the differences will always be 0, so beauty is 0.

Third test case: n=5, array=[100,54,80,43,90]. Let's arrange them in ascending order: [43,54,80,90,100]. Then beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. That matches the example.

Fourth test case: n=4, array=[3,4,3,3]. Arrange in ascending order: [3,3,3,4]. Beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 =1.

Fifth test case: n=2, array=[2,1]. Arrange in ascending order: [1,2]. Beauty is (2-1)=1.

So, in all these cases, arranging the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. Is this always the case?

Let me think about why arranging in ascending order maximizes the beauty. The beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. If I expand this sum:

sum_{i=2 to n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_2 - a_1 + a_3 - a_2 + a_4 - a_3 + ... + a_n - a_{n-1}.

Notice that this is a telescoping sum, where most terms cancel out, leaving only a_n - a_1.

So, sum = a_n - a_1.

Wait a minute, that's interesting. No matter how I arrange the array, the sum of differences is just the last element minus the first element.

But in the first test case, arranging as [1,2,3] gives beauty 2, which is 3 - 1 =2. Arranging as [3,2,1] gives -1 -1 =-2, which is also 1 - 3 =-2. Wait, but 3 -1 is 2, and 1 -3 is -2, which matches.

In the third test case, arranging as [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 -43=57, which matches the example.

So, actually, the beauty is always equal to a_n - a_1, regardless of how you arrange the array, as long as you arrange it in ascending order.

Wait, but that can't be right because if I arrange it in descending order, the beauty should be a_n - a_1, but in descending order, a_n would be the smallest and a_1 the largest, so a_n - a_1 would be negative.

But in the first test case, arranging as [1,2,3] gives 3-1=2, and arranging as [3,2,1] gives 1-3=-2.

So, actually, the beauty is a_n - a_1, where a_n and a_1 are the last and first elements in the arranged array.

But to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize a_n - a_1.

Wait, but in ascending order, a_n is the maximum value and a_1 is the minimum value, so a_n - a_1 is max - min, which is the maximum possible difference.

In descending order, a_n is the minimum value and a_1 is the maximum value, so a_n - a_1 is min - max, which is negative.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty, which is max - min, and arranging in descending order gives min - max, which is the minimum beauty.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in ascending order.

Wait, but in the first test case, arranging in ascending order gives beauty 2, which is max - min =3-1=2, and arranging in descending order gives -2, which is min - max =1-3=-2.

So, yes, the beauty is always a_n - a_1, where a_n and a_1 are the last and first elements in the arranged array.

Hence, to maximize beauty, we should arrange the array in ascending order, so a_n is the maximum value and a_1 is the minimum value.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the third test case, max is 100 and min is 43, so 100-43=57, which matches the example.

In the second test case, all elements are 69, so 69-69=0, which matches the example.

In the fourth test case, max is 4 and min is 3, so 4-3=1, which matches the example.

In the fifth test case, max is 2 and min is 1, so 2-1=1, which matches the example.

So, in all cases, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Therefore, to solve the problem, I just need to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and subtract them.

Wait, but in the program given, it sorts the array and then sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Is that necessary? From my reasoning, it seems that I can simply find max - min.

Let me check if that's equivalent.

Take the first test case: [2,1,3]. max=3, min=1, so beauty=2.

In the program, it sorts the array to [1,2,3] and then sums the differences: (2-1) + (3-2) =1 +1=2, which equals max - min.

In the third test case: [43,54,80,90,100], sorted, sum of differences: (54-43)+(80-54)+(90-80)+(100-90)=11+26+10+10=57, which equals 100-43=57.

So, yes, sum of differences in ascending order equals max - min.

Hence, the program is correct in that it sorts the array and sums the differences, which effectively calculates max - min.

But is there a simpler way? Can I just find max - min directly?

Yes, but perhaps the problem wants to see the sum of differences as per the definition.

Anyway, in terms of correctness, the program seems to be correct.

Let me look at the code.

There are two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 reads the input, processes each test case by calling func_1, and collects the results, then prints them.

func_1 takes an array, sorts it, and sums the differences between consecutive elements.

As per my earlier reasoning, this should give the maximum beauty.

But is there a mistake here?

Wait, in func_1, it sums the absolute differences: beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i-1])

But in my reasoning, without absolute values, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) in ascending order gives max - min.

With absolute values, it would be sum of positive differences.

Wait, in ascending order, a_i - a_{i-1} is always non-negative, so abs is not necessary.

In the code, it uses abs, but it's sorted in ascending order, so a_i - a_{i-1} is already non-negative.

Hence, abs is redundant here.

But it doesn't affect the correctness.

In descending order, a_i - a_{i-1} would be negative, but in this code, it's sorted in ascending order, so it's fine.

Hence, the code is correct.

Alternatively, as I reasoned, simply computing max(a) - min(a) would suffice, but summing the differences in sorted order achieves the same result.

So, the given program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{1} \]
