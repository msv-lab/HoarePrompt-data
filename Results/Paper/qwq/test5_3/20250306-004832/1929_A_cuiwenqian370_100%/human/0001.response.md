Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example given.

Wait a minute, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. But if I arrange it as [3, 2, 1], the beauty is (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + (-1) = -2. So, rearranging can give different values.

But the problem is to find the maximum beauty. So, in this case, 2 is greater than -2, so the maximum is 2.

Another example is [69, 69, 69]. No matter how I arrange them, the differences will always be 0, so the beauty is 0.

In the third example, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], the output is 57. Let's see how that works. If I sort it in ascending order: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty would be (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but the problem says I can rearrange the array in any way. So, perhaps sorting it in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

Wait, but in the first example, [1, 2, 3], which is sorted ascending, gives beauty 2, which is higher than any other arrangement.

In the second example, all elements are equal, so any arrangement gives beauty 0.

In the third example, sorting ascending gives beauty 57.

In the fourth example, [3, 4, 3, 3], sorting gives [3, 3, 3, 4]. Beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

And in the last example, [2,1], sorting gives [1,2], beauty is (2-1) = 1.

So, it seems that sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n gives the maximum beauty.

But why is that? Let's think about it.

If I have two elements, a and b, with a < b. Then, arranging them as [a, b] gives beauty (b - a), and arranging them as [b, a] gives beauty (a - b), which is negative. So, clearly, arranging in ascending order gives a higher beauty.

For more than two elements, if I arrange them in ascending order, each difference (a_i - a_{i-1}) is positive, and their sum is the total beauty.

If I arrange them in any other order, some differences might be negative, lowering the total beauty.

Wait, but maybe there's a better arrangement than just ascending order.

Let me consider an array [1,2,3,4]. In ascending order, beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

If I arrange it as [1,3,2,4], beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 + (-1) + 2 = 3.

Same as ascending order.

Another arrangement: [4,3,2,1]. Beauty is (3-4) + (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + (-1) + (-1) = -3, which is worse.

So, it seems that arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

Wait, in the first arrangement [1,3,2,4], it also gives beauty 3, which is the same as ascending order.

Is there any arrangement that gives higher than ascending order?

Let me try [1,4,2,3]. Beauty is (4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2, which is less than 3.

Another try: [2,3,4,1]. Beauty is (3-2) + (4-3) + (1-4) = 1 + 1 + (-3) = -1.

So, seems like ascending order gives the best beauty.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,2,3] gives beauty 2, and [1,3,2] gives beauty (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1, which is less than 2.

So, ascending order seems to be the way to go.

But why does ascending order give the maximum beauty?

Let's think about the sum: sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

This simplifies to a_n - a_1.

Because it's a telescoping sum: a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + a4 - a3 + ... + an - a_{n-1} = an - a1.

Wait, really? So, if it's just an - a1, then the beauty is simply the last element minus the first element in the arranged array.

If that's the case, then to maximize beauty, I need to maximize (an - a1), which means making an as large as possible and a1 as small as possible.

So, to maximize an - a1, I should put the largest value in an and the smallest value in a1.

So, arranging the array in ascending order achieves this: a1 is the smallest, an is the largest, so an - a1 is maximized.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,2,3], an - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the beauty.

In the second example, all elements are equal, so an - a1 = 0.

In the third example, [43,54,80,90,100], an - a1 = 100 - 43 = 57.

In the fourth example, [3,3,3,4], an - a1 = 4 - 3 = 1.

In the fifth example, [1,2], an - a1 = 2 - 1 = 1.

So, it seems that the beauty is always an - a1, regardless of how you arrange the array.

Wait, but in the first test case, with [1,2,3], beauty is 2, which is 3 - 1.

In the arrangement [1,3,2], beauty is 1, which is 2 - 1.

Wait, but according to the telescoping sum, it should be an - a1, which in [1,3,2] is 2 - 1 = 1, which matches.

Similarly, in [4,3,2,1], beauty should be 1 - 4 = -3, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, indeed, the beauty is simply an - a1, regardless of how you arrange the middle elements.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, I need to maximize an - a1.

To maximize an - a1, I should choose the largest possible an and the smallest possible a1.

Which means sorting the array in ascending order: a1 is the smallest, an is the largest.

Hence, beauty = an - a1 is maximized.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and compute an - a1.

This is much simpler than summing up all the differences.

In fact, in the earlier step-by-step calculation, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is indeed an - a1.

Because it's a telescoping sum.

So, in the program provided, func_1 sorts the array and then sums up the differences, which is equivalent to an - a1.

But actually, instead of sorting and summing up all differences, I can just sort the array and compute array[-1] - array[0].

That would be more efficient.

But in terms of correctness, both approaches are equivalent.

Now, looking at the program:

- It reads all input at once using sys.stdin.read().

- Splits the input into tokens.

- Reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n, the length of the array.

- Reads the next n tokens as the array.

- Calls func_1 on the array.

- Stores the results and prints them all at once.

Now, func_1 sorts the array and sums up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, in func_1, it's using abs(array[i] - array[i-1]), which is unnecessary if the array is sorted in ascending order, because the difference will be non-negative.

In the earlier analysis, we saw that beauty is an - a1, which is equivalent to sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) without absolute values, assuming the array is sorted in ascending order.

But in the program, it's using abs(array[i] - array[i-1]), which is not needed.

In fact, using abs() would make it sum of absolute differences, which is not what the problem asks for.

The problem asks for sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which, for a sorted array, is an - a1.

But with abs(), it would be sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is still an - a1, but without abs(), it's just an - a1.

Wait, but in the program, it's using abs(), which is unnecessary, but doesn't affect correctness because the differences are non-negative when sorted.

Wait, no. If sorted in ascending order, a_i >= a_{i-1}, so a_i - a_{i-1} >= 0, so abs() is redundant.

But it's still correct.

In the example, [1,2,3], sum of abs(2-1) + abs(3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct.

In [4,3,2,1], sum of abs(3-4) + abs(2-3) + abs(1-2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, but the beauty should be -3, but since we're using abs(), it's giving 3, which is not correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, beauty is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which can be negative.

But in the program, it's using abs(), which makes all differences positive.

So, in the [4,3,2,1] case, the correct beauty is -3, but the program would output 3.

But in the examples provided, all beauties are non-negative.

Wait, in the first test case, beauty is 2, which is correct with or without abs().

In the second test case, beauty is 0, which is correct.

In the third test case, beauty is 57, correct.

Fourth test case, beauty is 1, correct.

Fifth test case, beauty is 1, correct.

But according to the problem statement, beauty can be negative, as in the arrangement [4,3,2,1], beauty is -3.

But in the program, it's using abs(), which would make it 3.

So, is the program correct?

Well, according to the problem, we need to maximize the beauty, which can be positive or negative.

But since we can choose the arrangement that maximizes beauty, and the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging in ascending order, and in that case, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is an - a1, which is equivalent to sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}) when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Wait, but in the descending order arrangement, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is an - a1, which is negative, but with abs(), it's positive.

But since we are to maximize beauty, and the problem asks for the maximum beauty, which is obtained by ascending order arrangement, the abs() is not necessary, but in this specific case, it doesn't affect the correctness because when sorted ascending, a_i - a_{i-1} >= 0.

So, in terms of correctness, since we are sorting ascending and then summing a_i - a_{i-1}, which is non-negative, abs() doesn't change the value.

Hence, the program is correct.

Alternatively, a more efficient way would be to sort the array and compute array[-1] - array[0], which is equivalent to the sum of differences.

But in terms of correctness, the program is fine.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
