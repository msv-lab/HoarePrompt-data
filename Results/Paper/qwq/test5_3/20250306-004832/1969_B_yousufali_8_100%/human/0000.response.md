Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. I'm given a binary string, which means it consists only of 0s and 1s. I need to make this string sorted in non-descending order, which means all 0s should come before all 1s. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I choose to shift.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the string "10". If I perform a cyclic shift on the entire string, it becomes "01", which is sorted. The cost is 2 because the substring length is 2.

Another example: "11000". If I choose substring [1,3], which is "110", and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "011". So the string turns into "01100". Then, if I choose [2,4], which is "110", and shift it, it becomes "011". So now the string is "00110". Finally, choosing [3,5], which is "110", and shifting it becomes "011". So the string is now "00011". The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

But is there a better way? Maybe with fewer operations or smaller substring lengths.

Let's think about the general approach. I need to move all the 0s to the front and all the 1s to the back. Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of the substring to the front of the substring.

One way to think about this is to count how many times I need to move a 1 before a 0. Every time a 1 appears after a 0 in the string, it's out of order, and I need to fix it.

Wait, but since I can perform operations on any substring, I need a strategy to fix the order with the least cost.

Let's consider the positions of 0s and 1s. Suppose I have a 0 at position i and a 1 at position j, where i < j. To move the 0 before the 1, I might need to perform shifts that involve these positions.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

10 -> 01 with cost 2.

Second test case:

0000 is already sorted, so cost 0.

Third test case:

11000 -> After some operations, cost 9.

Fourth test case:

101011 -> Cost 5.

Fifth test case:

01101001 -> Cost 11.

I need to find a general method to calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me think about the properties of the string.

In the final sorted string, all 0s are before all 1s. So, I need to move all the 0s that are after some 1s to before those 1s.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front, which can be used to rearrange the substring.

But calculating the minimal cost seems tricky.

Maybe I can model this as inversion counts or something similar.

Inversion count is the number of pairs that are out of order. But here, I need to consider the cost of operations to fix those inversions.

But since each operation can fix multiple inversions at once, I need to find a way to group inversions and minimize the cost.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of 1s that need to be moved past certain 0s.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as moving 1s to the end, and each move has a cost associated with it.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a string like 1010.

To sort it to 0011, I can perform operations as follows:

- Choose substring [1,2]: 10 -> 01, string becomes 0110. Cost: 2.

- Choose substring [3,4]: 10 -> 01, string becomes 0101. Cost: 2.

- Choose substring [2,4]: 101 -> 110, string becomes 0110. Cost: 3.

But this doesn't seem to be making progress towards sorted order.

Alternatively:

- Choose substring [1,4]: 1010 -> 0101. Cost: 4.

- Choose substring [1,4] again: 0101 -> 1010. Wait, that's not helpful.

Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can be used to move a 0 past a 1, effectively swapping their positions with a cost equal to the length of the substring that includes both positions.

Wait, but it's not a direct swap; it's a cyclic shift.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or a formula that can directly calculate the minimum cost based on the positions of 0s and 1s.

Let me consider the positions of 1s in the string. Suppose I have k 1s in the string. In the sorted string, all 0s are first, followed by all 1s.

So, I need to move the 1s to the end of the string.

Each cyclic shift operation can be used to move a 1 closer to the end.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of positions each 1 needs to be moved to reach its final position.

But since operations can overlap and affect multiple positions at once, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the number of inversions, where an inversion is a pair of positions (i,j) with i < j and s[i] > s[j]. In this case, s[i] is '1' and s[j] is '0'.

Each inversion needs to be fixed by moving the 1 before the 0.

If I can find a way to group these inversions and fix them with operations that cover multiple inversions at once, I can minimize the cost.

But how to group them efficiently?

Another idea: Since the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, perhaps I can think about moving blocks of characters at once.

Wait, maybe I can model this as reversing substrings, since reversing is similar to a series of cyclic shifts.

But the operation is specifically a cyclic shift, not a reverse.

Hmm.

Let me look at the first sample input again.

"10" can be transformed to "01" with a single operation on the entire string, cost 2.

In this case, there's only one inversion, and it's fixed with cost 2.

In the third sample input, "11000" is transformed into "00011" with total cost 9.

But is there a better way?

Wait, let's try:

- Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100". Cost: 3.

- Choose substring [1,2]: "01" -> "10", string becomes "10100". Cost: 2.

- Choose substring [1,3]: "101" -> "110", string becomes "11000". Cost: 3.

- Choose substring [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100". Cost: 5.

- Choose substring [1,2]: "01" -> "10", string becomes "10100". Cost: 2.

This seems to be going in circles.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence of operations.

Alternative approach:

Instead of trying to transform the string step by step, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can directly give the minimum cost.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

- "10" -> cost 2

- "0000" -> cost 0

- "11000" -> cost 9

- "101011" -> cost 5

- "01101001" -> cost 11

I need to find a pattern or formula that matches these inputs and outputs.

Let me try to count the number of 1s before each 0 and sum them up.

For "10":

There is one '1' before the '0', so cost = 1. But the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

For "11000":

- First '0': two '1's before

- Second '0': two '1's before

- Third '0': two '1's before

Total cost = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, but sample output is 9.

Not matching.

Alternative idea: For each '0', count the number of '1's before it and multiply by some factor.

But not sure.

Wait, maybe for each '0', count the number of '1's before it and add the position or something.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the code provided and see if it matches the sample outputs.

The code is:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1():

s = input()

n = 0

ans = 0

for i in range(len(s)):

if s[i] == '1':

n += 1

if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:

ans += n + 1

print(ans)

def func_2():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the string s, initializes n and ans to 0, iterates through each character in s, increments n if it's '1', and if it's '0' and n != 0, adds n + 1 to ans, then prints ans.

Let's test this code with the sample inputs.

First test case: "10"

n = 0, ans = 0

i=0, s[0]='1', n=1

i=1, s[1]='0', n=1 !=0, ans = 1 + 1 = 2

Output: 2, which matches the sample.

Second test case: "0000"

n=0, ans=0

i=0, '0', n=0, no addition

i=1, '0', n=0

i=2, '0', n=0

i=3, '0', n=0

Output: 0, matches the sample.

Third test case: "11000"

n=0, ans=0

i=0, '1', n=1

i=1, '1', n=2

i=2, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=2+1=3

i=3, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=3+3=6

i=4, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=6+3=9

Output: 9, matches the sample.

Fourth test case: "101011"

n=0, ans=0

i=0, '1', n=1

i=1, '0', n=1 !=0, ans=1+1=2

i=2, '1', n=2

i=3, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=2+3=5

i=4, '1', n=3

i=5, '1', n=4

Output: 5, matches the sample.

Fifth test case: "01101001"

n=0, ans=0

i=0, '0', n=0

i=1, '1', n=1

i=2, '1', n=2

i=3, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=2+1=3

i=4, '1', n=3

i=5, '0', n=3 !=0, ans=3+4=7

i=6, '0', n=3 !=0, ans=7+4=11

i=7, '1', n=4

Output: 11, matches the sample.

So, the code produces the correct output for the given samples.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's try to understand the logic.

The code iterates through the string, counts the number of '1's encountered so far, and whenever a '0' is encountered and n !=0, it adds n + 1 to the answer.

So, for each '0' that comes after at least one '1', it adds the number of '1's before it plus one to the total cost.

Why does this make sense?

Well, in terms of the problem, we need to move these '0's before the '1's, and each such move has some cost associated with it.

But I'm not entirely sure why adding n + 1 for each such '0' gives the minimal total cost.

Maybe there's a smarter way to group the operations to reduce the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the cost is being calculated based on the number of operations needed to move each '0' past the '1's.

But I need to confirm if this logic always gives the minimal cost.

Let me try another example.

Suppose the string is "11010".

According to the code:

n=0, ans=0

i=0, '1', n=1

i=1, '1', n=2

i=2, '0', n=2 !=0, ans=2+1=3

i=3, '1', n=3

i=4, '0', n=3 !=0, ans=3+4=7

So, total cost is 7.

Is this the minimal cost?

Let's see:

Original: 11010

Operation 1: Choose substring [1,3], "110" -> "011", string becomes "01110", cost=3.

Operation 2: Choose substring [4,5], "10" -> "01", string becomes "01101", cost=2.

Operation 3: Choose substring [3,4], "10" -> "01", string becomes "01011", cost=2.

Operation 4: Choose substring [2,3], "10" -> "01", string becomes "00111", cost=2.

Total cost: 3+2+2+2=9, which is higher than the code's output of 7.

Wait, but the code outputs 7, but I found a sequence with higher cost. That doesn't help.

Maybe there's a better sequence.

Alternative sequence:

Original: 11010

Operation 1: Choose substring [1,4], "1101" -> "1110", string becomes "11100", cost=4.

Total cost: 4.

Which is less than the code's output of 7. So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, another sequence:

Original: 11010

Operation 1: Choose substring [1,5], "11010" -> "01101", cost=5.

Operation 2: Choose substring [1,3], "011" -> "110", string becomes "11001", cost=3.

Operation 3: Choose substring [4,5], "01" -> "10", string becomes "11010", cost=2.

This is not making progress.

Alternatively:

Original: 11010

Operation 1: Choose substring [3,4], "01" -> "10", string becomes "11100", cost=2.

Total cost: 2.

Which is better than the code's output of 7 and better than the previous sequence's total cost of 4.

So, in this case, the minimal cost is 2, but the code outputs 7, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
