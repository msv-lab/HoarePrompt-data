Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array. An array \( a \) of length \( m \) is considered good if there exists another integer array \( b \) of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in \( a \) is equal to the sum of elements in \( b \).

2. For every index \( i \), \( a_i \) is not equal to \( b_i \).

3. Every element in \( b \) is greater than 0.

And I'm given an array \( c \) of length \( n \), where each element is greater than 0. Then, there are \( q \) queries, each asking whether a subarray from index \( l_i \) to \( r_i \) is good.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good". So, for a given subarray \( c_l \) to \( c_r \), I need to check if there exists an array \( b \) that satisfies the three conditions above.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions to understand better:

- The sum of \( a \) should equal the sum of \( b \).

- All elements in \( b \) are positive integers.

- No element in \( b \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( a \).

Given that \( a \) is the subarray of \( c \) from \( l \) to \( r \), and \( b \) is another array with the same length, I need to find if such a \( b \) exists that meets these criteria.

Let me think about the implications of these conditions.

First, since \( b_i \) must be a positive integer and \( b_i \neq a_i \), \( b_i \) can either be less than \( a_i \) or greater than \( a_i \).

But, since \( b_i \) must be positive, if \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \) can only be greater than 1 (since it can't be 0 or 1).

If \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i \) can be either \( a_i + 1 \), \( a_i - 1 \), or any other positive integer except \( a_i \).

Wait, but the problem specifies that \( b_i \) must be different from \( a_i \), and greater than 0.

So, for each \( a_i \), \( b_i \) can be any positive integer except \( a_i \).

And the sum of \( b \) should be equal to the sum of \( a \).

So, essentially, I need to adjust each \( a_i \) to some other positive integer \( b_i \neq a_i \), such that the total sum remains the same.

This sounds like a problem where I need to make sure that the adjustments I make to each \( a_i \) to get \( b_i \) cancel each other out in terms of their impact on the sum.

Let me consider the differences \( d_i = b_i - a_i \). Since \( b_i \neq a_i \), \( d_i \neq 0 \). Also, \( b_i > 0 \), so \( d_i = b_i - a_i \geq -a_i + 1 \) (since \( b_i \) can be as low as 1, but not lower).

Wait, no. Since \( b_i \) can be any positive integer except \( a_i \), \( d_i \) can be any integer except 0, but with the constraint that \( b_i > 0 \), which translates to \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \).

But perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the total sum.

Let me denote \( s = \sum a_i \). I need to find \( b_i \) such that \( \sum b_i = s \), \( b_i > 0 \), and \( b_i \neq a_i \) for all \( i \).

One way to approach this is to consider the minimal possible sum of \( b \) under the constraints.

If I set \( b_i \) to be the smallest possible positive integer not equal to \( a_i \), what would that be?

If \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \) must be at least 2.

If \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i \) can be either \( a_i - 1 \) (if \( a_i - 1 \neq 0 \)) or \( a_i + 1 \).

Wait, but \( a_i > 0 \), so if \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \geq 2 \), contributing at least 1 more than \( a_i \).

If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), which is at least 1, or \( a_i + 1 \), etc.

So, in the minimal case, for each \( a_i \), if \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) is at least 2, contributing an extra 1 to the sum.

If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), which is less than \( a_i \), or \( a_i + 1 \), which is more.

But to minimize the sum, I would choose \( b_i = a_i - 1 \) if possible.

Wait, but \( b_i \) must be positive, so \( b_i = a_i - 1 \) is allowed only if \( a_i - 1 \geq 1 \), i.e., \( a_i \geq 2 \).

If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) must be at least 2.

So, for each \( a_i \):

- If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \geq 2 \), contributing at least 1 more to the sum.

- If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), contributing \( -1 \) to the sum, or \( a_i + 1 \), contributing \( +1 \), etc.

So, in the minimal case, for \( a_i = 1 \), I have to add at least 1 to the sum, and for \( a_i > 1 \), I can subtract 1 from the sum.

Wait, but I need the total sum to remain the same.

So, I need to make sure that the total adjustments sum to zero.

That is, the sum of \( d_i = b_i - a_i \) over all \( i \) should be zero.

Given that for each \( i \), \( d_i \neq 0 \), and \( b_i > 0 \), which implies:

- If \( a_i = 1 \), \( d_i \geq 1 \) (since \( b_i \geq 2 \)).

- If \( a_i > 1 \), \( d_i \) can be any integer except 0, but \( b_i > 0 \), so \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \).

But to minimize the sum, I need to consider the minimal possible \( d_i \):

- For \( a_i = 1 \), \( d_i \geq 1 \).

- For \( a_i > 1 \), \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \).

But I need the sum of \( d_i \) to be zero, and each \( d_i \neq 0 \).

So, I need to find if there's a way to assign \( d_i \) such that:

- For each \( i \), \( d_i \neq 0 \), \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \), and for \( a_i = 1 \), \( d_i \geq 1 \).

- The sum of all \( d_i \) is zero.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider the minimal possible sum of \( b_i \) under the constraints.

For each \( a_i \):

- If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \geq 2 \), so minimal \( b_i = 2 \), which is \( a_i + 1 \).

- If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \geq a_i - 1 \) (as long as \( a_i - 1 \geq 1 \)), so \( b_i = a_i - 1 \).

Wait, but \( b_i \) must be positive and not equal to \( a_i \).

So, for \( a_i > 1 \):

- If \( a_i = 2 \), \( b_i \) can be 1 or 3 or more.

- If \( a_i = 3 \), \( b_i \) can be 2 or 4 or more.

So, the minimal \( b_i \) is \( a_i - 1 \) if \( a_i - 1 \geq 1 \), i.e., \( a_i \geq 2 \).

Hence, for \( a_i \geq 2 \), minimal \( b_i = a_i - 1 \).

For \( a_i = 1 \), minimal \( b_i = 2 \).

So, the minimal sum of \( b \) is:

\( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \min(a_i - 1, 2) \) if \( a_i \geq 2 \), else 2.

Wait, more precisely:

\( b_i = a_i - 1 \) if \( a_i \geq 2 \), else 2.

So, the minimal sum of \( b \) is:

\( \sum_{i=1}^{m} (a_i - 1) \) for \( a_i \geq 2 \), plus \( \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 2 \).

But I need this minimal sum to be less than or equal to the original sum \( s = \sum a_i \), and then see if I can adjust the \( b_i \) such that the total sum is exactly \( s \).

Wait, but actually, I need the sum of \( b_i \) to be exactly \( s \), and each \( b_i \) is different from \( a_i \) and positive.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between \( b_i \) and \( a_i \).

Let me define \( d_i = b_i - a_i \), with \( d_i \neq 0 \), and \( b_i = a_i + d_i > 0 \), so \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \).

And \( \sum d_i = 0 \).

So, I need to find if there's a way to assign \( d_i \) such that:

- \( d_i \neq 0 \)

- \( d_i \geq -a_i + 1 \)

- \( \sum d_i = 0 \)

This seems like a problem of solving a system of inequalities with the sum equal to zero.

This might be a bit too involved for a programming problem, so there must be a smarter way.

Let me consider the minimal possible sum of \( b_i \):

As established, for each \( a_i \):

- If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \geq 2 \), so \( b_i = 2 \), contributing \( 2 - 1 = 1 \) more than \( a_i \).

- If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \geq a_i - 1 \), contributing \( -1 \) less than \( a_i \).

So, the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is:

\( \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i = \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} (a_i - 1) \)

But the original sum is \( s = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i \).

So, the difference between the minimal sum of \( b_i \) and \( s \) is:

\( \sum_{i: a_i = 1} (2 - a_i) + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} (a_i - 1 - a_i) = \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 1 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} (-1) \)

Which simplifies to:

\( (\text{number of } a_i = 1) - (\text{number of } a_i > 1) \)

For the subarray to be "good", this difference must be less than or equal to zero.

Because, if the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is less than or equal to \( s \), and the sum needs to be exactly \( s \), it's possible to adjust the \( b_i \) accordingly.

Wait, but actually, the difference should be less than or equal to zero for the minimal sum to be less than or equal to \( s \).

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

The minimal sum of \( b_i \) is:

\( \sum b_i = \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} (a_i - 1) \)

The original sum is:

\( s = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 1 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} a_i \)

So, the difference between the minimal sum of \( b_i \) and \( s \) is:

\( \left( \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} (a_i - 1) \right) - \left( \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 1 + \sum_{i: a_i > 1} a_i \right) = \sum_{i: a_i = 1} 1 - \sum_{i: a_i > 1} 1 = (\text{number of } a_i = 1) - (\text{number of } a_i > 1) \)

For the subarray to be "good", this difference should be less than or equal to zero, because if it's positive, even the minimal sum of \( b_i \) exceeds \( s \), making it impossible to have \( \sum b_i = s \).

Wait, but actually, if the difference is positive, that means the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is greater than \( s \), which would require making some \( b_i \) larger than the minimal possible to increase the sum even more, which isn't possible because we already have the minimal sum exceeding \( s \).

Wait, but we need \( \sum b_i = s \), so if the minimal sum is greater than \( s \), it's impossible.

Conversely, if the minimal sum is less than or equal to \( s \), then it might be possible to adjust the \( b_i \) to make the sum equal to \( s \).

But, we also need to ensure that it's possible to adjust the \( b_i \) such that their sum equals \( s \), given the constraints.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, the difference is \( (\text{number of } a_i = 1) - (\text{number of } a_i > 1) \), and for the subarray to be "good", this difference should be less than or equal to zero.

Wait, but in the example provided:

Input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's check for the subarrays:

- 1 2 1 4 5: number of 1's = 2, number of >1's = 3, difference = 2 - 3 = -1 <= 0, so YES

- 4: number of 1's = 0, number of >1's = 1, difference = 0 - 1 = -1 <=0, so YES, but output is NO. Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second query: 4, which is a single element, 4. Number of 1's = 0, number of >1's =1, difference = 0 -1 = -1 <=0, so according to my earlier logic, it should be YES, but the sample output is NO. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when the subarray has only one element, it's impossible to have \( b_i \neq a_i \) and still have \( \sum b_i = \sum a_i \), because \( b_i \neq a_i \), so \( b_i \) must be different, but then \( \sum b_i \neq \sum a_i \).

Wait, in the second query, subarray is just [4], so any \( b_i \) different from 4, but positive, say 1,2,3,5,... but in any case, \( b_i \neq 4 \), so \( \sum b_i \neq 4 \), hence it's NO.

Ah, so my earlier logic is incomplete. I need to consider that for subarrays of length 1, it's impossible to have \( b_i \neq a_i \) and still have \( \sum b_i = \sum a_i \), because \( b_i \neq a_i \) implies \( \sum b_i \neq \sum a_i \).

Hence, for subarrays of length 1, it's always NO.

But in my earlier calculation, I didn't account for the length of the subarray.

Wait, but in the sample input, the second query is 4 4, which is subarray [4], and the output is NO, which aligns with this observation.

Similarly, the third query is 3 4, which is subarray [1,4], number of 1's =1, number of >1's=1, difference=0 <=0, so YES, which matches the sample output.

And the fourth query is 1 3, which is subarray [1,2,1], number of 1's=2, number of >1's=1, difference=1 >0, which should be NO, but according to the sample output, it's NO.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, difference=1 >0 should be NO, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If the subarray length is 1, always NO.

- Else, if \( (\text{number of } a_i = 1) - (\text{number of } a_i > 1) \leq 0 \), then YES, else NO.

But in the second query, it's length 1, so NO.

First query: length 5, num_1=2, num_>1=3, difference=-1 <=0, YES.

Third query: length 2, num_1=1, num_>1=1, difference=0 <=0, YES.

Fourth query: length 3, num_1=2, num_>1=1, difference=1 >0, NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the condition seems to be:

- If the subarray length is 1, NO.

- Else, if \( (\text{number of } a_i = 1) - (\text{number of } a_i > 1) \leq 0 \), then YES, else NO.

Wait, but why is this the case?

Because, for the subarray to be "good", the minimal sum of \( b_i \) should be less than or equal to \( s \), the sum of \( a_i \).

And as calculated earlier, the difference between minimal sum of \( b_i \) and \( s \) is \( (\text{number of } a_i =1) - (\text{number of } a_i >1) \).

If this difference is less than or equal to zero, it means that the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is less than or equal to \( s \), so it's possible to adjust the \( b_i \) to make the sum exactly \( s \).

Otherwise, if the difference is positive, even the minimal sum of \( b_i \) exceeds \( s \), making it impossible to have \( \sum b_i = s \).

Additionally, for subarrays of length 1, it's impossible to have \( b_i \neq a_i \) and \( \sum b_i = \sum a_i \), so those are always NO.

This seems consistent with the sample input and output.

Hence, the condition can be summarized as:

- If the subarray length is 1, output NO.

- Else, if \( (\text{number of } a_i =1) - (\text{number of } a_i >1) \leq 0 \), output YES, else NO.

Now, considering the constraints, \( n \) and \( q \) can be up to \( 3 \times 10^5 \), and the sum of \( n \) and the sum of \( q \) over all test cases do not exceed \( 3 \times 10^5 \), so we need an efficient way to handle the queries.

To handle this efficiently, we can precompute prefix sums for the number of 1's and the sum of \( a_i -1 \) for \( a_i >1 \).

Wait, but according to our condition, we only need the number of 1's and the number of elements greater than 1.

So, we can precompute prefix counts of the number of 1's and the number of elements greater than 1.

Then, for each query, we can compute the number of 1's and the number of elements greater than 1 in the subarray, and check the condition.

But, in the given program, it seems to be doing something similar.

Let's look at the provided program:

```python

import math

testCases = int(input())

for i in range(testCases):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))

    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]

    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)

        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1

    for _ in range(q):

        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))

        if l == r:

            print('NO')

            continue

        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]

        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]

        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:

            print('YES')

        else:

            print('NO')

```

So, it's precomputing two arrays:

- `ones`: prefix count of the number of 1's in the array.

- `sum`: prefix sum of \( nums[i] -1 \).

Then, for each query, it computes:

- `onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l-1]`: number of 1's in the subarray from l to r.

- `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l-1]`: sum of \( nums[i] -1 \) for i from l to r.

Then, it checks if \( 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange \).

Simplifying the left side:

\( 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange = onesInRange + (r - l + 1) \)

So, it's checking if \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \).

But according to my earlier reasoning, the condition should be:

If the subarray length is 1, output NO.

Else, if \( onesInRange - (r - l + 1 - onesInRange) <= 0 \), output YES, else NO.

Simplifying the condition:

\( onesInRange - (r - l + 1 - onesInRange) = 2 * onesInRange - (r - l + 1) \leq 0 \)

Which is equivalent to \( 2 * onesInRange <= r - l + 1 \), or \( onesInRange <= \frac{r - l + 1}{2} \).

But in the code, it's checking \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \).

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to express the condition.

Wait, perhaps the `sumInRange` is being used differently.

Wait, `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l-1] = \sum_{i=l}^{r} (nums[i] -1) = \sum_{i=l}^{r} nums[i] - (r - l + 1) `

So, `sumInRange = s - (r - l + 1)`, where \( s = \sum_{i=l}^{r} nums[i] \).

But in my earlier reasoning, the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is:

\( \sum_{i: a_i =1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) \)

Which is equal to:

\( \sum_{i: a_i =1} (1 +1) + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i + \sum_{i: a_i =1} 1 - \sum_{i: a_i >1} 1 \)

Wait, no.

Wait, \( \sum b_i = \sum_{i: a_i =1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) \)

Which is equal to:

\( \sum_{i: a_i =1} (a_i +1) + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i + \sum_{i: a_i =1} 1 - \sum_{i: a_i >1} 1 \)

So, \( \sum b_i = s + (\text{number of } a_i =1) - (\text{number of } a_i >1) \)

For the subarray to be "good", we need \( \sum b_i = s \), which implies:

\( s + (\text{number of } a_i =1) - (\text{number of } a_i >1) \leq s \), which simplifies to \( (\text{number of } a_i =1) - (\text{number of } a_i >1) \leq 0 \)

Hence, the condition is \( (\text{number of } a_i =1) \leq (\text{number of } a_i >1) \)

In other words, the number of 1's should not exceed the number of elements greater than 1 in the subarray.

Now, looking back at the code, it's checking:

If \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \), which is:

\( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= \sum_{i=l}^{r} (nums[i] -1) \)

But \( \sum_{i=l}^{r} (nums[i] -1) = s - (r - l + 1) \), where \( s = \sum_{i=l}^{r} nums[i] \)

Wait, no.

Wait, \( sumInRange = \sum_{i=l}^{r} (nums[i] -1) = s - (r - l + 1) \), where \( s = \sum_{i=l}^{r} nums[i] \)

But in the earlier reasoning, the condition is \( onesInRange - (r - l + 1 - onesInRange) \leq 0 \), which simplifies to \( 2 * onesInRange \leq r - l + 1 \), or \( onesInRange \leq \frac{r - l + 1}{2} \)

But in the code, it's checking \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \), which is \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= s - (r - l + 1) \)

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Let me see what `sumInRange` represents.

`sum[i] = sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] -1`, so `sum[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} (nums[j] -1)`

Therefore, `sum[r] - sum[l-1] = \sum_{j=l}^{r} (nums[j] -1) = \sum_{j=l}^{r} nums[j] - (r - l + 1) `

So, `sumInRange = s - (r - l + 1)`, where \( s = \sum_{j=l}^{r} nums[j] \)

Now, the condition in the code is:

If \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \), then YES, else NO.

Substituting `sumInRange`:

\( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= s - (r - l + 1) \)

Which simplifies to:

\( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= s - (r - l + 1) \)

Rearranging:

\( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) + (r - l + 1) <= s \)

\( onesInRange + 2*(r - l + 1) <= s \)

But according to my earlier reasoning, the condition should be \( onesInRange - (r - l + 1 - onesInRange) \leq 0 \), which simplifies to \( 2 * onesInRange - (r - l + 1) \leq 0 \), or \( onesInRange \leq \frac{r - l + 1}{2} \)

So, the condition in the code seems different from what I derived.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Let me double-check.

The minimal sum of \( b_i \) is:

\( \sum_{i: a_i =1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) \)

Which is equal to:

\( \sum_{i: a_i =1} (a_i +1) + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i + \sum_{i: a_i =1} 1 - \sum_{i: a_i >1} 1 \)

Hence, \( \sum b_i = s + ones - (m - ones) = s + 2*ones - m \)

Wait, hold on.

Wait, \( \sum b_i = \sum_{i: a_i =1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) \)

But \( s = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i: a_i =1} 1 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} a_i \)

So, \( \sum b_i = \sum_{i: a_i =1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) = \sum_{i: a_i =1} (1 +1) + \sum_{i: a_i >1} (a_i -1) = s + ones - (m - ones) = s + 2*ones - m \)

Wait, yes.

So, \( \sum b_i = s + 2*ones - m \)

For the subarray to be "good", we need \( \sum b_i = s \), which implies:

\( s + 2*ones - m \leq s \), which simplifies to \( 2*ones - m \leq 0 \), or \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

Hence, the condition is \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

But in the code, it's checking \( ones + m <= s - m \), which is \( ones + m <= s - m \), or \( ones + 2m <= s \)

Wait, that doesn't seem to match.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the condition.

Wait, in the code, it's checking:

If \( onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange \), which is:

\( ones + m <= s - m \), where \( m = r - l + 1 \), \( s = \sum_{i=l}^{r} a_i \), \( ones = \) number of 1's in the subarray.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the condition should be \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

These two conditions are different.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample input, it seems to produce the correct output.

Wait, in the sample input, for the first query:

Subarray from 1 to 5: ones=2, m=5, sum=1+2+1+4+5=13

Check: ones + m =2+5=7 <= sum -m =13-5=8, which is 7<=8, so YES

Second query: subarray from 4 to 4: ones=0, m=1, sum=4

Check: 0+1=1 <=4-1=3, which is 1<=3, so YES, but according to the sample output, it's NO.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the sample output.

Sample Input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, for the second query, it's 4 4, which is subarray [4], ones=0, m=1, sum=4

Check: 0 +1 =1 <=4 -1=3, which is true, but according to the sample output, it's NO.

Hence, the code seems to have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the code has a condition to handle subarrays of length 1 separately.

Looking back at the code:

if l == r:

print('NO')

continue

So, for subarrays of length 1, it directly outputs NO, which matches the sample output.

But in the sample input, the second query is 4 4, which is length 1, so it should output NO, as per the code.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, for subarrays of length 1, it's always NO, which matches the sample output.

But in the code, it has a condition:

if l == r:

print('NO')

continue

Else:

onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]

sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]

if onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, for subarrays of length greater than 1, it checks the condition \( ones + m <= s - m \), which seems incorrect based on my earlier reasoning.

But according to the sample input, it produces the correct output.

Wait, in the first query: ones=2, m=5, s=13, check 2+5=7 <=13-5=8, which is 7<=8, YES

Third query: ones=1, m=2, s=1+4=5, check 1+2=3 <=5-2=3, which is 3<=3, YES

Fourth query: ones=2, m=3, s=1+2+1=4, check 2+3=5 <=4-3=1, which is 5<=1, NO

These match the sample output.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the condition should be \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \), which for m=5, ones=2, 2 <=2.5, YES

For m=2, ones=1, 1<=1, YES

For m=3, ones=2, 2<=1.5, NO

Which also matches the sample output.

So, both conditions seem to produce the correct output for the sample.

But are they equivalent?

Let me see.

We have:

- My condition: \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

- Code's condition: \( ones + m <= s - m \), which is \( ones + m <= s - m \), or \( ones + 2m <= s \)

Wait, but in the first query: ones=2, m=5, s=13, check 2 + 5 =7 <=13 -5=8, which is 7<=8, YES

According to my condition: 2 <=2.5, YES

Second query: m=1, ones=0, s=4, check 0 +1=1 <=4 -1=3, which is 1<=3, YES, but should be NO, but the code has a special case for m=1, so it prints NO directly.

Third query: m=2, ones=1, s=5, check 1+2=3<=5-2=3, which is 3<=3, YES

My condition: 1<=1, YES

Fourth query: m=3, ones=2, s=4, check 2+3=5<=4-3=1, which is 5<=1, NO

My condition: 2<=1.5, NO

So, both conditions seem to work correctly for the sample input.

But are they equivalent in general?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose m=4, ones=2, s=6

My condition: 2 <=2, YES

Code's condition: 2 +4=6 <=6 -4=2, which is 6<=2, NO

Wait, so according to my condition, it should be YES, but according to the code's condition, it's NO.

Hence, there's a discrepancy here.

So, perhaps my condition is incorrect.

Wait, let's see.

According to the earlier reasoning, the minimal sum of \( b_i \) is \( s + 2*ones - m \)

We need \( s + 2*ones - m \leq s \), which simplifies to \( 2*ones - m \leq 0 \), or \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

But in the code, it's checking \( ones + m <= s - m \), which is \( ones + m <= s - m \), or \( ones + 2m <= s \)

But in the earlier example, m=4, ones=2, s=6

According to my condition: 2 <=2, which is true, so YES

According to the code's condition: 2 +4=6 <=6 -4=2, which is 6<=2, which is false, so NO

Hence, the code's condition is too strict, and it incorrectly classifies some subarrays as NO when they should be YES.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it produces the correct output.

Is there a flaw in my reasoning?

Wait, perhaps the condition should be \( ones + m <= s - m \), which is \( ones + m <= s - m \), or \( ones + 2m <= s \)

But in the earlier example, m=4, ones=2, s=6, which satisfies \( 2 +8=10 <=6 \), which is not true, so NO

But according to my condition, it should be YES.

Is there a mistake in my earlier reasoning about the minimal sum of \( b_i \)?

Let me double-check.

The minimal sum of \( b_i \) is:

\( \sum b_i = \sum_{i: a_i=1} 2 + \sum_{i: a_i>1} (a_i -1) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i + \sum_{i: a_i=1} 1 - \sum_{i: a_i>1} 1 = s + ones - (m - ones) = s + 2*ones - m \)

We need \( s + 2*ones - m \leq s \), which simplifies to \( 2*ones - m \leq 0 \), or \( ones \leq \frac{m}{2} \)

Hence, my condition is correct.

So, in the earlier example with m=4, ones=2, s=6, my condition is satisfied (2 <=2), but the code's condition is not (2 +4=6 <=6 -4=2, which is false).

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input
