Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

I need to find out in which year the nth sign will occur, causing the apocalypse.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on.

But they must occur sequentially, meaning that for each sign, we start waiting for it only after the previous sign has occurred.

So, for example, if the first sign occurs in year x, then we start looking for the second sign in year x+1, and so on.

I need to find the year when the nth sign occurs, given this sequential dependency.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can iterate through each sign and calculate the year when it occurs, based on the previous sign's year.

Let's consider the first sign. It occurs in years that are multiples of a_1. So the possible years are a_1, 2*a_1, 3*a_1, etc.

We need the first occurrence of the first sign, so that would be in year a_1.

Then, for the second sign, we start waiting from year a_1 + 1, and we look for the second sign's occurrences, which are multiples of a_2.

So, we need to find the smallest year greater than a_1 where the second sign occurs, which is the smallest multiple of a_2 greater than a_1.

Similarly, for the third sign, we start looking from the year when the second sign occurred plus one, and find the smallest multiple of a_3 greater than that, and so on.

So, in general, for each sign i from 1 to n, we need to find the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the year when the previous sign occurred.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on."

So, it seems like the signs must occur one after the other, with no overlaps in their occurrences.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that each sign occurs exactly after the previous one has occurred.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have the sequence of signs, and for each sign, its occurrence is periodic with period a_i.

But they must occur in sequence, meaning that each sign occurs right after the previous one.

So, perhaps the year when the nth sign occurs is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the a_i's.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the signs have different periods, and they need to align in sequence.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the time when all signs have occurred in sequence, considering their periods.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

And the output is 36.

Let's see how this works.

First sign occurs every 3 years: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,...

Second sign occurs every 2 years: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,...

Third sign occurs every 4 years: 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,...

Fourth sign occurs every 5 years: 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,...

Fifth sign occurs every 9 years: 9,18,27,36,...

Sixth sign occurs every 18 years: 18,36,54,...

Now, according to the problem, the signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year.

So, first sign occurs in year 3.

Then, we start looking for the second sign from year 4 onwards.

The second sign occurs in years 4,6,8,10,...

So, the earliest occurrence after year 3 is year 4.

Then, we start looking for the third sign from year 5 onwards.

The third sign occurs in years 4,8,12,16,...

But 4 is before 5, so the next is 8, which is greater than 5.

So, third sign occurs in year 8.

Then, start looking for the fourth sign from year 9 onwards.

Fourth sign occurs in years 5,10,15,20,...

But 5 is before 9, so next is 10, which is greater than 9.

So, fourth sign occurs in year 10.

Then, start looking for the fifth sign from year 11 onwards.

Fifth sign occurs in years 9,18,27,36,...

9 is before 11, so next is 18, which is greater than 11.

So, fifth sign occurs in year 18.

Then, start looking for the sixth sign from year 19 onwards.

Sixth sign occurs in years 18,36,54,...

18 is before 19, so next is 36, which is greater than 19.

So, sixth sign occurs in year 36.

Hence, the apocalypse happens in year 36.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Start from year 0.

- For each sign, find the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the year when the previous sign occurred.

- Keep track of the year when each sign occurs.

- The year when the nth sign occurs is the answer.

Now, let's look at the code provided and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function is defined as "func()".

It reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n, the number of signs.

- Read the list of a_i's.

- Initialize start_year to 0.

- Iterate through the list of a_i's:

- For each a_i, calculate the next year when this sign occurs after start_year.

- Update start_year to this new year.

- After processing all signs, print start_year.

Now, the key part is how it calculates the next year for each sign.

The line is:

start_year = (start_year // a[x] + 1) * a[x]

Wait, actually, in the code, it's:

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

So, for each a_i, it computes (start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i.

What does this do?

(start_year // a_i) is the number of times a_i fits into start_year.

Adding 1 gives the next multiple.

Multiplying by a_i gives the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than or equal to start_year.

But, we need the smallest multiple greater than start_year.

Wait, if start_year is exactly divisible by a_i, then (start_year // a_i) * a_i = start_year.

Adding 1 to (start_year // a_i) gives the next multiple.

So, (start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than start_year, even if start_year is a multiple of a_i.

Perfect, that's what we need.

So, this seems correct.

Let's verify with the first example.

Start with start_year = 0.

First a_i = 3.

(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3.

So, first sign occurs in year 3.

Then, start_year = 3.

Next a_i = 2.

(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4.

Second sign occurs in year 4.

Then, start_year = 4.

Next a_i = 4.

(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 8.

Third sign occurs in year 8.

Then, start_year = 8.

Next a_i = 5.

(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10.

Fourth sign occurs in year 10.

Then, start_year = 10.

Next a_i = 9.

(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18.

Fifth sign occurs in year 18.

Then, start_year = 18.

Next a_i = 18.

(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 36.

Sixth sign occurs in year 36.

Which matches the example.

Let's check another example.

Input:

5

1 2 3 4 5

Output:

5

Let's see:

Start with start_year = 0.

a_i = 1.

(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (0 + 1) * 1 = 1.

start_year = 1.

a_i = 2.

(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (0 + 1) * 2 = 2.

start_year = 2.

a_i = 3.

(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3.

start_year = 3.

a_i = 4.

(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4.

start_year = 4.

a_i = 5.

(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (0 + 1) * 5 = 5.

start_year = 5.

Which matches the output.

Another example:

5

1 1 1 1 1

Output:

5

Start with start_year = 0.

a_i = 1.

(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1.

start_year = 1.

a_i = 1.

(1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (1 + 1) * 1 = 2.

start_year = 2.

a_i = 1.

(2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3.

start_year = 3.

a_i = 1.

(3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4.

start_year = 4.

a_i = 1.

(4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (4 + 1) * 1 = 5.

start_year = 5.

Which matches the output.

Last example:

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

2012

Let's compute:

Start with start_year = 0.

a_i = 50.

(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50.

start_year = 50.

a_i = 30.

(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = (1 + 1) * 30 = 60.

start_year = 60.

a_i = 711.

(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = (0 + 1) * 711 = 711.

start_year = 711.

a_i = 200.

(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = (3 + 1) * 200 = 800.

start_year = 800.

a_i = 503.

(800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = (1 + 1) * 503 = 1006.

start_year = 1006.

a_i = 1006.

(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = (1 + 1) * 1006 = 2012.

start_year = 2012.

Which matches the output.

So, in all these cases, the code seems to be working correctly.

Let me think if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Consider n=1, a_1=1.

Start_year=0.

(0 // 1 + 1)*1 = 1.

Which is correct, as the first sign occurs in year 1.

Another case: n=2, a=[1,1].

Start_year=0.

First sign: (0//1 +1)*1 =1.

Second sign: (1//1 +1)*1 =2.

Which seems correct.

Another case: n=2, a=[2,2].

Start_year=0.

First sign: (0//2 +1)*2=2.

Second sign: (2//2 +1)*2=4.

Which is correct, as both signs occur in years 2 and 4 respectively.

Another case: n=2, a=[2,3].

Start_year=0.

First sign: (0//2 +1)*2=2.

Second sign: (2//3 +1)*3=3.

So, signs occur in years 2 and 3.

Is this correct?

According to the problem, after the first sign occurs in year 2, we start looking for the second sign from year 3 onwards.

The second sign occurs in years 3,6,9,...

So, the earliest occurrence after year 2 is year 3.

Yes, that's correct.

Another case: n=2, a=[3,2].

Start_year=0.

First sign: (0//3 +1)*3=3.

Second sign: (3//2 +1)*2= (1 +1)*2=4.

So, signs occur in years 3 and 4.

Is this correct?

First sign in year 3.

Start looking for second sign from year 4 onwards.

Second sign occurs in years 2,4,6,...

So, yes, it occurs in year 4.

Correct.

Another edge case: n=1, a_1=1000000.

Start_year=0.

(0//1000000 +1)*1000000=1000000.

Which is correct.

Another edge case: n=100, all a_i=1.

Start_year=0.

Each step increases start_year by 1.

So, final start_year=100.

Which seems correct.

Another edge case: n=100, a_i=1 for first 99, a_100=1000000.

Start_year=0.

After 99 steps, start_year=99.

Then, for a_100=1000000, (99//1000000 +1)*1000000=1000000.

So, final year is 1000000.

Which seems correct.

I can't think of any case where this logic fails.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}} \]
