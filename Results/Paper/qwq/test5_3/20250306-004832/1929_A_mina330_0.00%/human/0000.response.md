Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input:

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the sample output.

Another example: n=3, all elements are 69. So, no matter how I arrange them, the differences will be 0, so beauty is 0.

Third example: n=5, array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. Let's see, if I sort it: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty would be (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems like sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements gives the maximum beauty. But is this always the case?

Let me think about it. If I have an array like [3, 4, 3, 3], sorting it gives [3, 3, 3, 4]. Then beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which again matches the sample output.

And for [2,1], sorting gives [1,2], beauty is 2-1=1, which matches the sample.

So, sorting seems to work. But why? Let's think about what the sum (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) simplifies to.

If I expand this sum:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

Most terms cancel out, and it simplifies to an - a1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, no matter how I arrange the array, the sum of differences between consecutive elements is just the last element minus the first element.

Is that always true? Let's test it with the first example: [1,2,3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sample.

Second example: [69,69,69], beauty is 69 - 69 = 0.

Third example: [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 - 43 = 57.

Fourth example: [3,3,3,4], beauty is 4 - 3 = 1.

Fifth example: [1,2], beauty is 2 - 1 = 1.

So, in all these cases, the beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Wait, but in the first approach in the given program, it's doing something different. It's sorting the array and then for each i from 0 to n//2 -1, it's adding a[n-1-i] - a[i]. So, it's pairing the smallest with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, and summing those differences.

But according to my earlier observation, the beauty is just an - a1, regardless of how you arrange the array.

So, why is the program doing this?

Let me check with the first example: n=3, a=[1,2,3]. According to the program:

kq = (3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2 + 0 = 2, which matches the sample.

Wait, no, for n=3, n//2=1, so i goes from 0 to 0, so only one term: a[2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2.

But according to my earlier observation, beauty should be an - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2. So, it matches.

But in general, if n is even, say n=4, with a=[3,3,3,4], sorted.

n//2=2, so i from 0 to 1.

kq = (4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the sample.

Another example: n=5, a=[43,54,80,90,100]

n//2=2, i from 0 to 1.

kq = (100 -43) + (80 -54) = 57 + 26 = 83, but according to earlier observation, beauty should be 100 -43=57.

But in the sample output, it's 57, not 83.

Wait, that's a problem. So, according to the program, for n=5, it's calculating kq = (a[4] - a[0]) + (a[3] - a[1]) = (100 -43) + (90 -54) = 57 + 36 = 93, but the sample output is 57.

Wait, no, in the code, it's for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):

kq = kq + a[len(a) - i -1 ] - a[i]

For n=5, len(a)//2=2, so i=0: a[4]-a[0]=100-43=57

i=1: a[3]-a[1]=90-54=36

Total kq=57+36=93, but sample output is 57.

Hmm, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, beauty is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

As I saw earlier, this simplifies to a_n - a_1.

But in the program, it's calculating something else.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me verify with n=3.

For n=3, array [1,2,3], beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 +1=2, which matches a3 - a1=3-1=2.

For n=4, [3,3,3,4], beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3)=0+0+1=1, which is a4 - a1=4-3=1.

For n=5, [43,54,80,90,100], beauty should be a5 - a1=100-43=57, which matches the sample output.

But according to the program, it's calculating sum of differences between paired elements: (a5 - a1) + (a4 - a2) + ..., which for n=5 would be (100-43) + (90-54) =57+36=93, which does not match the sample output of 57.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

The problem says: beauty is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

So, for n=5, it's (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + (a4 - a3) + (a5 - a4).

Which simplifies to a5 - a1, as all intermediate terms cancel out.

So, in the sample input, for n=5, a=[100,54,80,43,90], after sorting [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 -43=57, which matches the sample output.

But according to the program, it's calculating (a[n-1] - a[0]) + (a[n-2] - a[1]) + ... for i from 0 to n//2 -1.

For n=5, that's (a[4]-a[0]) + (a[3]-a[1]) =57 +36=93, which does not match the sample.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the sample output is 57, which matches a5 - a1.

So, the correct approach is to sort the array and subtract the first element from the last element.

That's much simpler.

So, the program is incorrect because it's calculating extra terms that aren't needed.

Let me check the code again:

kq = 0

for i in range(0, len(a)//2, 1):

kq = kq + a[len(a)-i-1] - a[i]

print(kq)

This is pairing the largest with the smallest, second largest with second smallest, and summing their differences.

But as per the problem, beauty is just a[n]-a[1] after sorting.

So, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
