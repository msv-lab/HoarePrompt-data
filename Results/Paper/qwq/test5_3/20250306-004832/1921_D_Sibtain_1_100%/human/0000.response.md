Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya wants to choose and arrange m integers to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of his array c and Petya's array a.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize D = sum of |a_i - c_i| for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. Since D is the sum of absolute differences, to maximize D, I need to choose c_i such that |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible for each i.

One way to approach this is to pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away from a_i as possible. So, for each a_i, I want to choose c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|.

But since I have to choose n integers from m, and m >= n, I need to select n integers from b and arrange them in a specific order to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a.

Let me think about how to efficiently do this.

First, I should sort both arrays to have a better understanding of their distributions.

If I sort array a and array b, I can try to pair the smallest a with the largest b, the second smallest a with the second largest b, and so on. This way, the differences should be maximized.

Wait, but that might not always be the case. Let's consider an example.

Suppose a = [1, 2, 3], and b = [4, 5, 6].

If I pair 1 with 6, 2 with 5, and 3 with 4, then D = |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5, and 3 with 6, D = |1-4| + |2-5| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

So, in this case, both pairings give the same D.

Another example: a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3].

Pairing 1 with 3, 2 with 2, 3 with 1 gives D = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

Pairing 1 with 1, 2 with 2, 3 with 3 gives D = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So, in this case, pairing the smallest with the largest gives a higher D.

Another example: a = [1, 2, 3], b = [3, 2, 1].

Pairing 1 with 3, 2 with 2, 3 with 1 gives D = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

Pairing 1 with 1, 2 with 2, 3 with 3 gives D = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Again, pairing smallest with largest is better.

So, it seems that sorting a in ascending order and b in descending order and pairing them correspondingly maximizes D.

Let me try to generalize this.

Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then compute sum of |a_i - b_i| for i from 1 to n.

This seems to work in the examples I tried.

But let's see if there's a case where this doesn't hold.

Suppose a = [1, 1, 1], b = [1, 1, 1].

No matter how I pair them, D will always be 0, which is expected.

Another case: a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3].

Pairing a_i with b_j where b_j is in descending order gives a higher D.

Wait, in the earlier example, it gave D=4, which is higher than pairing in ascending order.

So, seems like sorting a in ascending and b in descending order is a good strategy.

But let's think about it more carefully.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, in fact, this is related to the rearrangement inequality, which states that for two sequences, the sum of their products is maximized when both sequences are sorted in the same order (both ascending or both descending), and minimized when one is sorted in ascending and the other in descending order.

But in our case, we have absolute differences, not products.

However, if we consider that |a_i - b_i| is what we want to maximize for each pair, and that a and b are sorted appropriately to maximize each term, then this approach makes sense.

So, to maximize D, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then compute the sum of |a_i - b_i| for i from 1 to n.

This should give the maximum possible D.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and m, reads array a and array c (I assume c is the same as b in the problem statement).

Then, it checks if all elements in a and c are equal, in which case D is 0, which makes sense.

Then, it sorts a in ascending order and c in descending order, which aligns with my earlier reasoning.

Then, it handles the case when n=1 separately, which also makes sense because for n=1, the maximum difference would be the maximum of |a_0 - max(c)| and |a_0 - min(c)|.

Then, for n > 1, it initializes i and j to 0 and 1 respectively, and ans to 0.

Then, it loops k from 0 to n-1, calculates t1 as |a[i] - c[i]| and t2 as |a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]|, compares t2 and t1, increments j if t2 > t1 else increments i, and adds the maximum of t1 and t2 to ans.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me see.

Wait, why is it using i and j in this way?

Wait, a is sorted in ascending order, c in descending order.

Then, for each k, it calculates t1 as |a[i] - c[i]| and t2 as |a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j]|, compares them, increments j if t2 > t1 else increments i, and adds the max of t1 and t2 to ans.

This seems unnecessary complicated.

In my earlier reasoning, after sorting a in ascending and c in descending order, I would just pair a[i] with c[i] for i from 0 to n-1 and sum up |a[i] - c[i]|.

Why is this code using i and j and comparing t1 and t2?

This seems like an attempt to select n elements from c, but c is already sorted in descending order, and a is sorted in ascending order.

I think this might be an incorrect approach.

Let me try an example.

Take the first example from the input:

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

So, n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted ascending: [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Now, pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13

But in the note, it says the output is 16.

Wait, in the note, it says Vasya can create array (1,5,7,2), which is selected from c: [3,5,1,7,2,3], so [1,2,3,5,7,3], choose [1,5,7,2], arranged in this order.

Then D=|6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

But according to my earlier approach, D=13, which is less than 16.

So, my initial approach is not giving the correct maximum D.

Hence, my earlier assumption might be wrong.

I need to think differently.

Maybe sorting a in ascending and c in descending order and pairing them directly isn't always giving the maximum D.

Perhaps I need to select a subset of m integers and arrange them in a specific order to maximize D.

This seems more complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Maybe for each a_i, I should choose the c_j that is as far away from a_i as possible.

But since I have to choose n integers from m, and arrange them in a certain order, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I should sort a and select the c's that maximize the sum of absolute differences.

But how?

Maybe I need to consider all possible subsets of c of size n and arrange them to maximize D, but that's not efficient.

Given the constraints (n and m up to 2e5), I need an O(n log n) or O(m log m) solution.

Let me think again.

Suppose I sort both a and c in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, the possible c_j's are in sorted order.

But I need to arrange c in a certain order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_{sigma(i)}| for some permutation sigma.

This sounds like assigning each a_i to a c_j such that the sum of differences is maximized.

This is similar to the assignment problem in operations research, where we want to maximize the sum of assignments.

Given that, perhaps using the greedy approach of sorting one array and assigning the largest available c to each a, depending on whether a is smaller or larger.

Wait, maybe for each a_i, if c has elements both smaller and larger than a_i, I should choose the c that is farthest from a_i.

But since I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them, it's tricky.

An alternative approach is to select the n elements from c that can maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i| when paired optimally with a.

This seems complex.

Let me consider that |a_i - c_i| is equal to max(a_i - c_i, c_i - a_i).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following:

For each a_i, find the maximum possible |a_i - c_j|, but since I have to choose n c_j's without replacement, I need to maximize the sum over i of |a_i - c_j|.

This is equivalent to maximizing the sum of pairwise differences without repeating any c_j.

This sounds like a maximum weighted matching problem, which can be solved using bipartite matching with weights.

But that's too slow for the given constraints.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I should pair smaller a_i with larger c_j and larger a_i with smaller c_j, or vice versa.

Wait, in the first example, sorting a in ascending and c in descending seems to give a higher D.

Wait, in the first example, sorting a as [1,2,4,6] and c as [7,5,3,3,2,1].

Pairing a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, but in the note, it's 16.

So, perhaps sorting a ascending and c descending isn't always optimal.

Wait, in the note, they chose [1,5,7,2], which isn't in any particular order.

Wait, perhaps I need to select n elements from c and arrange them in a specific order to pair with a.

So, selection and arrangement matter.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the arrangement of a in sorted order, and then select and arrange c to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Maybe for each a_i, I can choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, without choosing the same c_j twice.

But how to implement this efficiently?

An efficient way might be to sort c in descending order and pair the smallest a with the largest c, and the largest a with the smallest c.

Wait, like in the first example: a=[1,2,4,6], c=[7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, but in the note, it's 16.

So, perhaps I need to select different c's.

Wait, in the note, they chose [1,5,7,2], which is c=[7,5,1,2].

Pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=1: |1-1|=0

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=7: |4-7|=3

a[3]=6 with c[3]=2: |6-2|=4

Total D=0+3+3+4=10, which is less than 16.

Wait, in the note, they arranged c as (1,5,7,2), but selected from c=[3,5,1,7,2,3].

So, they chose [1,5,7,2], which are positions [2,1,3,4] in the original c.

Then, arrange them in the order (1,5,7,2).

Pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=1: |1-1|=0

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=7: |4-7|=3

a[3]=6 with c[3]=2: |6-2|=4

Total D=0+3+3+4=10, which is less than 16.

Wait, maybe I misread the note.

Wait, in the note, it says Vasya can create the array (1,5,7,2), then D=|6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2|=5+4+5+2=16.

Wait, a=[6,1,2,4], c=[1,5,7,2]

So, pairing:

a[0]=6 with c[0]=1: |6-1|=5

a[1]=1 with c[1]=5: |1-5|=4

a[2]=2 with c[2]=7: |2-7|=5

a[3]=4 with c[3]=2: |4-2|=2

Total D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, in this arrangement, a is not sorted.

Wait, in my earlier approach, I sorted a and c, but in this case, a is not sorted.

So, perhaps I need to sort a and select c in a way that doesn't necessarily correspond to sorting.

This complicates things.

Wait, maybe I need to select n elements from c and arrange them in such a way that when paired with a in their given order, the sum of absolute differences is maximized.

So, the arrangement of a is fixed as per input, and I need to select and arrange n elements from c to maximize D.

This makes more sense now.

So, I need to select n elements from c and arrange them in an order that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i| for i from 1 to n.

This seems like assigning each a_i to a c_j, where c_j is chosen and arranged to maximize the sum of differences.

This is similar to assigning each a_i to a c_j such that the total difference is maximized.

This sounds like finding a permutation of c that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_sigma(i)| for some permutation sigma.

Given that, I need an efficient way to compute this.

One way to approach this is to sort a and c, and then pair the smallest a with the largest c and the largest a with the smallest c.

Wait, in the first example, a=[6,1,2,4], sorted a=[1,2,4,6], sorted c descending=[7,5,3,3,2,1].

Then, pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, but in the note, it's 16.

So, this approach doesn't give the optimal result.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps for each a_i, I should choose the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, without choosing the same c_j twice.

So, select for each a_i, the c_j that is farthest from a_i, and assign it to c_i.

But this would require some kind of assignment algorithm, which is too slow for the constraints.

An alternative approach is to consider that to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I need to maximize each |a_i - c_i| individually, given the constraints that c_i are distinct and selected from b.

But since the c_i are selected from b and arranged in a certain order, I need to find a way to assign c_i to maximize the sum.

This sounds like a matching problem where I need to maximize the sum of distances between a_i and c_i.

Given that, perhaps I can sort a and c and then pair them in a way that maximizes the differences.

Wait, but as seen earlier, sorting a ascending and c descending doesn't always give the optimal solution.

So, maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that for each a_i, the maximum |a_i - c_j| is max(c_max - a_i, a_i - c_min), but since I have to choose n distinct c_j's, I need to select c_j's that maximize the sum.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided code again.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)

So, it sorts a in ascending and c in descending order.

Then, for n=1, it correctly computes the maximum difference between a[0] and either min(c) or max(c).

For n > 1, it initializes i and j to 0 and 1 respectively, and iterates k from 0 to n-1, calculating t1 and t2 as differences and choosing the maximum between them, updating i or j accordingly.

This seems like an attempt to select c_j's that maximize the difference for each a_i.

But in the first example, as we saw, this approach gives D=13, whereas the optimal is 16.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to solve this problem.

Let me think about the correct approach.

I need to select n distinct elements from c and arrange them in a certain order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i| for i from 1 to n.

This sounds like finding a permutation sigma of c that maximizes sum of |a_i - c_sigma(i)|.

This is similar to the assignment problem where we want to maximize the sum of weights, with weights being |a_i - c_j|.

The assignment problem can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm, but that's not feasible for n up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

An alternative approach is to consider that for each a_i, the maximum |a_i - c_j| is achieved when c_j is either the smallest or the largest possible.

But since I have to choose n distinct c_j's, I need to select a combination that maximizes the sum.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach.

Let's sort a in ascending order and c in descending order.

Then, initialize two pointers, one at the start of c (largest) and one at the end of c (smallest).

For each a_i, choose the c_j that gives the maximum |a_i - c_j|, and remove it from c.

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

Not feasible.

Another idea: precompute for each a_i, the maximum |a_i - c_j| possible, then select n such maximum differences without repeating c_j's.

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Sort a in ascending order.

Sort c in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, without choosing the same c_j twice.

But I need to prioritize which a_i to assign which c_j.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the arrangement of a, and I need to select and arrange c to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

I can consider for each a_i, the potential contributions
