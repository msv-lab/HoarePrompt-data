Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The process is:

1. First, lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest.

3. Next, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

And I need to find out what the k-th card is in this sequence.

Okay, let's try to understand this with the example given. For n=7 and k from 1 to 7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4. Let's see why:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice an odd number: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

- Three times an odd number: Well, 3*1=3, but 3 is already in the odd numbers. 3*3=9, but n=7, so 9 is beyond n. So, no new cards here.

- Four times an odd number: 4*1=4, which is within n=7.

So the sequence is: 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Got it. So, the general idea is to group the numbers based on how many times an odd number they are. Like, first group is 1 times odd numbers (which are just the odd numbers), second group is 2 times odd numbers, third group is 3 times odd numbers, and so on.

And within each group, they are ordered from smallest to largest.

Now, the problem is to find the k-th card in this ordering for given n and k, and I have t test cases to handle.

Constraints are:

- t up to 5*10^4, which is 50,000.

- n up to 10^9, which is a billion.

- k up to n, so k can be up to a billion.

So, efficiency is key here because with t=50,000 and n up to a billion, anything that's not O(log n) per test case is probably not going to work.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand how the numbers are being grouped.

Let's consider that every number can be expressed as m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of the number, and m is a power of 2.

Wait, actually, more generally, m is a power of 2 times some odd number, but in this problem, it seems m is a power of 2.

But looking back at the problem, it's m times an odd number, where m is a positive integer.

Wait, no, m is a positive integer, not necessarily a power of 2.

Wait, the problem says:

- First, all odd-numbered cards: that's m=1 times odd numbers.

- Then, all cards that are twice an odd number: m=2 times odd numbers.

- Then, all cards that are three times an odd number.

- Then, four times an odd number.

- And so on.

Wait, but in the example, for n=7:

- m=1: 1,3,5,7

- m=2: 2,6

- m=4:4

Wait, why m=3 is not present? Because 3*1=3 already in m=1, 3*3=9 >7.

So, m=3 has no new cards in n=7.

Similarly, m=4:4 is included.

So, the groups are for m=1,2,4,...

And within each m, the numbers are m*o, where o is odd and m*o <=n.

And the ordering is first m=1, then m=2, then m=3, and so on, but skipping m=3 in n=7 because there are no new cards for m=3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

- First, all odd-numbered cards.

- Next, all cards that are twice an odd number.

- Next, all cards that are three times an odd number.

- Next, all cards that are four times an odd number.

- And so on, until all cards are laid down.

So, it's grouped by m=1,2,3,4,... and within each m, the numbers are m*o, where o is odd and m*o <=n.

But in the example, m=3 has no new cards because 3*1=3 is already in m=1, and 3*3=9 >7.

Similarly, m=4:4 is included.

So, the sequence is m=1:1,3,5,7; m=2:2,6; m=4:4.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says m=1, m=2, m=3 (empty), m=4.

But in the code, we need to generate this sequence efficiently.

Given that n can be up to a billion and t up to 50,000, we need an efficient way to find the k-th element in this sequence.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, observe that for each m, the numbers in that group are m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., up to the largest odd o such that m*o <=n.

And the groups are ordered by m, starting from m=1, then m=2, m=3, etc., but skipping m=3 in n=7 because there are no new cards for m=3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's m=1, m=2, m=3, m=4, etc., but in n=7, m=3 has no new cards because 3*1=3 is already in m=1, and 3*3=9>7.

So, do we need to skip m=3 in this case?

Wait, but according to the problem, it's "all cards that are m times an odd number", but m=3 has no new cards in n=7, so effectively, m=3 is skipped.

So, in general, for each m, we consider m*o where o is odd and m*o <=n, and o is not divisible by any smaller m' < m.

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the highest odd divisor of each number.

For each number x from 1 to n, let o be the largest odd divisor of x, and m = x / o.

Then, x is in group m.

And within group m, the numbers are ordered by x ascending.

So, the sequence is all x from 1 to n, sorted first by m = x / o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x, and within the same m, by x ascending.

Our task is to find the k-th x in this ordering.

Now, the question is, how to efficiently find the k-th x given n and k, with n up to a billion and t up to 50,000.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about the largest odd divisor.

Given a number x, its largest odd divisor can be found by repeatedly dividing x by 2 until it's odd.

For example, x=12:

12 / 2 = 6

6 / 2 = 3 (3 is odd), so o=3, m=12/3=4.

So, x=12 is in group m=4.

Similarly, x=6:

6 / 2 = 3 (3 is odd), so o=3, m=6/3=2.

So, x=6 is in group m=2.

x=3:

3 is odd, o=3, m=1.

x=4:

4 / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 (1 is odd), so o=1, m=4.

Wait, but in the problem, m seems to be multiplied by o to get x.

Wait, perhaps m is the multiplier, and o is the odd number.

So, x = m * o, where o is odd, and m is the multiplier.

And m is chosen to be the minimal possible m such that o is odd.

Wait, perhaps m is the largest power of 2 dividing x.

Wait, no.

Wait, in x=12, o=3, m=4.

But 4 is not a power of 2.

Wait, 4 is a power of 2: 4=2^2.

Wait, yes, 4 is 2^2.

Wait, m is x divided by the largest odd divisor o.

So, m = x / o, and m is a power of 2.

Wait, is that always true?

Let's see:

Take x=12, o=3, m=4=2^2.

x=6, o=3, m=2=2^1.

x=4, o=1, m=4=2^2.

x=2, o=1, m=2=2^1.

x=1, o=1, m=1=2^0.

x=3, o=3, m=1=2^0.

x=5, o=5, m=1=2^0.

x=7, o=7, m=1=2^0.

So, in this case, m is indeed a power of 2.

Wait, but m=3*1=3, m=3 is not a power of 2, but in n=7, m=3 is not used because there are no new cards for m=3.

Wait, perhaps m is restricted to be a power of 2.

Wait, but in the problem, m can be any positive integer.

But in the example, m=1,2,4, which are powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps m is a power of 2.

But m=3 is included, even if it has no cards in n=7.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, m starts from 1 and increases by 1 each time, not just powers of 2.

But in n=7, m=3 has no new cards because 3*1=3 is already in m=1, and 3*3=9>7.

Similarly, m=4:4 is included.

Wait, but m=3 is included in the process, but has no new cards in n=7.

So, perhaps m can be any positive integer, but only those m where m*o <=n and o is odd are considered.

But in the sequence, m increases sequentially: m=1,2,3,4,...

And for each m, the cards are m*o for odd o <=n/m.

But in n=7, for m=3, o=1 (m*o=3 already in m=1), o=3 (m*o=9>7), so no new cards.

Similarly, for m=4, o=1 (m*o=4), o=3 (m*o=12>7), so only 4 is included.

So, in the sequence, it's m=1:1,3,5,7; m=2:2,6; m=4:4.

So, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, to find the k-th element in this sequence.

Given that n can be up to a billion and t up to 50,000, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to model this sequence.

First, observe that for m=1, the numbers are all odd numbers up to n: 1,3,5,7,...

For m=2, the numbers are all even numbers that are not divisible by 4, because if a number is divisible by 4, it would be in a higher m group.

Wait, no.

Wait, for m=2, the numbers are 2*1=2, 2*3=6, 2*5=10, etc., but in n=7, only 2 and 6 are included.

Similarly, for m=4, it's 4*1=4, 4*3=12>7, so only 4.

So, in general, for each m, the numbers are m*o, where o is odd and m*o <=n.

And the groups are ordered by m increasing.

So, to find the k-th number, I need to iterate through m from 1 to some maximum m, and for each m, count how many numbers are in that group, and skip those counts until I reach k.

But with n up to a billion and t up to 50,000, I need this to be efficient.

So, perhaps I can find m and o such that the k-th number is m*o, and o is the (k - some offset)-th odd number.

Wait, maybe I can find m such that the cumulative count up to m-1 is less than k, and the count at m is greater than or equal to k.

Then, within that m, find the corresponding o.

Wait, more formally:

Let's define for each m, the number of elements in that group as the number of odd o such that m*o <=n.

Which is the number of o <= floor(n/m), where o is odd.

The number of odd numbers up to floor(n/m) is floor((floor(n/m)+1)/2).

Wait, yes.

So, for a given m, the count c_m = floor((floor(n/m) +1)/2).

Then, I can iterate m from 1 to n, accumulating c_m, and when the cumulative sum equals or exceeds k, I know that the k-th number is in group m.

Then, I can find which o within m corresponds to the (k - previous cumulative sum)-th odd number.

Then, the number is m * (2*p -1), where p is the position within the group.

But iterating m from 1 to n is too slow for n up to a billion and t up to 50,000.

So, I need a faster way to sum c_m up to some m.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a binary search on m.

Find the smallest m such that the cumulative sum up to m is >=k.

Then, within that m, find the exact o.

But even computing the cumulative sum up to m is O(m), which is too slow for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the cumulative sum up to m in O(1) time.

But that seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate m in a way that skips multiple m at once.

Wait, let's look at the code provided and see if it implements something like this.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 0

m = 1

while n:

x = (n + 1) // 2

n //= 2

if s < k and k <= s + x:

break

s += x

m *= 2

print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

So, it seems to be iterating in a loop where m is doubled each time, and n is halved each time.

Let me see what's happening here.

It initializes s=0, m=1.

Then, in a loop, while n:

x = (n +1) //2

n //=2

if s <k and k <= s +x:

break

s +=x

m *=2

Then, it prints (2*(k -s) -1)*m

So, it seems to be processing m=1,2,4,8,... and for each m, calculating x=(n+1)//2, which is the number of odd o such that m*o <=n.

Wait, n here is being halved each time, which corresponds to considering o <= floor(n/m), and then x=(floor(n/m) +1)//2 is the number of odd o in that range.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each m, it calculates c_m = (floor(n/m) +1)//2

Then, it accumulates s +=c_m

And when s >=k, it breaks.

Wait, more precisely, it checks if s <k and k <=s +x, then breaks.

So, it finds the m where the cumulative sum s is still less than k, and s +x >=k.

Then, within that m, the position within the group is p =k -s

Then, the o is the p-th odd number, which is 2*p -1

Then, the number is m*(2*p -1)

That's what the code is doing: print((2*(k -s) -1)*m)

Now, is this correct?

Let me verify with the example.

Take n=7, k=1

m=1, n=7, x=(7+1)//2=4, s=0, s <1 and 1 <=0+4, so p=1, o=2*1 -1=1, number=1*1=1. Correct.

k=2: s=0, x=4, 0<2<=4, p=2, o=3, number=1*3=3. Correct.

k=5: s=4 (from m=1:4 elements), m=2, n=3 (n//=2), x=(3+1)//2=2, s=4 <5 <=6, so p=5-4=1, o=1, number=2*1=2. Correct.

k=7: s=6 (m=1:4, m=2:2, m=4:0?), wait, n=7, m=1: x=4, s=0+4=4, m=2: x=2, s=4+2=6, m=4: n//=2=1, x=(1+1)//2=1, s=6+1=7 >=7, so p=7-6=1, o=1, number=4*1=4. But in the sequence, k=7 should be 4, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier step for k=7, n=7, m=1: x=4, s=0+4=4, m=2: x=2, s=4+2=6, m=4: x=1, s=6+1=7 >=7, p=7-6=1, o=1, number=4*1=4. Correct.

Another way to see it: the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, for k=1 to 7, the numbers are as above.

Now, let's see how the code computes for k=4.

n=7, m=1: x=4, s=0 <4 <=4, p=4, o=7, number=1*7=7. But in the sequence, k=4 is 7. Correct.

For k=6: s=4 (m=1), m=2: x=2, s=4 <6 <=6, p=6-4=2, o=3, number=2*3=6. Correct.

For k=5: s=4 <5 <=6, p=5-4=1, o=1, number=2*1=2. Correct.

Seems correct for n=7.

Let's check for n=1, k=1: should be 1.

m=1: x=(1+1)//2=1, s=0 <1 <=1, p=1, o=1, number=1*1=1. Correct.

For n=34, k=14.

Sequence:

m=1: odds 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,34//2=17, (17+1)//2=9, but wait, n=34, m=1: odds up to 33, which are 1,3,5,...,33: total 17 numbers.

Then m=2: even numbers that are not divisible by 4: 2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34: total 9 numbers.

Then m=4: multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 8: 4,12,20,28,36>34: so 4,12,20,28:4 numbers.

Then m=8: multiples of 8 that are not multiples of 16:8,24,40>34: so 8,24:2 numbers.

Then m=16: multiples of 16 that are not multiples of 32:16,48>34: so 16:1 number.

Then m=32:32:1 number.

Total:17+9+4+2+1+1=34.

So, for k=14, it's within m=1:1-17.

So, p=14, o=1+2*(14-1)=27, number=1*27=27. But according to the example, it's 27. Correct.

Another test: n=84, k=19.

m=1: odds 1,3,5,...,83: total 42 numbers.

m=2: even numbers not divisible by 4:2,6,10,...,82: total 21 numbers.

m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,...,68: total 10 numbers.

m=8: multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16: multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32: multiples of 32 not divisible by 64:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64:64:1 number.

Total:42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83. But n=84, so one more number.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, n=84, m=1: odds 1,3,5,...,83:42 numbers.

m=2: even numbers not divisible by 4:2,6,10,...,82:21 numbers.

m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,...,68:10 numbers.

m=8: multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16: multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32: multiples of 32 not divisible by 64:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64:64:1 number.

Total:42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83 numbers. So, what about the 84-th number?

Wait, perhaps m=1 includes all odds up to 83, and m=2 includes even numbers not divisible by 4 up to 82, m=4 includes multiples of 4 not divisible by 8 up to 68, m=8 includes multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72, m=16:16,48,80, m=32:32, m=64:64.

Total 42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83 numbers. So, what's the 84-th number? Is there a m=128:128>84, so no. Maybe m=1 includes all odds up to 83, but perhaps 81 is included in m=1, and 81 is odd, so yes, 83 is the last odd number.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted m=1: odds from 1 to 83: (83-1)/2 +1=42 numbers.

m=2: even numbers not divisible by 4:2,6,10,...,82: first term 2, last term 82, common difference 4.

Number of terms: ((82-2)/4)+1=21 numbers.

m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,...,68: first term 4, last term 68, common difference 8.

Number of terms: ((68-4)/8)+1=9 numbers.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 10, but actually 4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68:9 numbers.

m=8: multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16: multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32: multiples of 32 not divisible by 64:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64:64:1 number.

Total:42+21+9+5+3+1+1=82 numbers. Still missing 83 and 84.

Wait, perhaps m=1 includes odds up to 83:1,3,5,...,83:42 numbers.

m=2: even numbers not divisible by 4:2,6,10,...,82:21 numbers.

m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,...,68:9 numbers.

m=8: multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16: multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32: multiples of 32 not divisible by 64:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64:64:1 number.

Total:42+21+9+5+3+1+1=82 numbers.

Wait, n=84, so there should be 84 numbers.

What's missing? Maybe m=1 includes odds up to 83, and m=2 includes even numbers not divisible by 4 up to 82, m=4 includes multiples of 4 not divisible by 8 up to 68, m=8 includes multiples of 8 not divisible by 16 up to 72, m=16 includes multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80, m=32:32, m=64:64.

Still total 82 numbers.

Wait, perhaps m=1 includes all odds up to 83, and m=2 includes even numbers not divisible by 4 up to 82, but what about numbers like 84?

84 is divisible by 4 and by 8 and by 12, etc.

Wait, 84 is divisible by 4, and 4 is m=4, but in m=4, we have multiples of 4 not divisible by 8, but 84 is divisible by 4 and by 8 (since 84/4=21, which is odd, wait no, 84/4=21, which is odd, so 84 is 4*21, where 21 is odd, so it should be in m=4.

But in m=4, we have 4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,84.

Wait, earlier I thought up to 68, but 84 should be included.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,84:10 numbers.

Wait, but 84 is 4*21, and 21 is odd, so it should be in m=4.

So, m=4:4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,84:10 numbers.

m=8:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64:64:1 number.

Total:42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83 numbers.

Still missing one number.

Wait, perhaps m=1 includes odds up to 83, and m=2 includes even numbers not divisible by 4 up to 82, m=4 includes multiples of 4 not divisible by 8 up to 84:4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,84:10 numbers.

Then total:42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83 numbers.

So, what's the 84-th number? Maybe m=1 includes all odds up to 83, and m=2 includes even numbers not divisible by 4 up to 82, m=4 includes multiples of 4 not divisible by 8 up to 84.

But according to the code, for n=84, m=1: x=(84+1)//2=42, s=0+42=42.

m=2: n//=2=42, x=(42+1)//2=21, s=42+21=63.

m=4: n//=2=21, x=(21+1)//2=11, s=63+11=74.

m=8: n//=2=10, x=(10+1)//2=5, s=74+5=79.

m=16: n//=2=5, x=(5+1)//2=3, s=79+3=82.

m=32: n//=2=2, x=(2+1)//2=1, s=82+1=83.

m=64: n//=2=1, x=(1+1)//2=1, s=83+1=84.

So, for k=84, it would be in m=64, p=84-83=1, o=1, number=64*1=64.

But according to the earlier count, m=64:64, and m=128:128>84, so s=83+1=84.

So, the sequence ends with 64 as the 84-th number.

But earlier, I thought m=1 includes odds up to 83, m=2 up to 82, m=4 up to 84, m=8 up to 72, m=16 up to 80, m=32:32, m=64:64.

So, sequence: 1,3,5,...,83 (42 numbers), 2,6,10,...,82 (21 numbers), 4,12,20,...,84 (10 numbers), 8,24,40,56,72 (5 numbers), 16,48,80 (3 numbers), 32 (1 number), 64 (1 number).

Total:42+21+10+5+3+1+1=83 numbers. So, the 84-th number is 64.

Wait, but according to the earlier count, m=64:64, and m=128:128>84, so s=83+1=84.

Hence, the 84-th number is 64.

But in the earlier manual count, m=4 includes 84, which is 4*21, where 21 is odd.

So, in m=4, o=21, number=4*21=84.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the counts.

Wait, m=4: multiples of 4 not divisible by 8:4,12,20,28,36,44,52,60,68,84:10 numbers.

m=8: multiples of 8 not divisible by 16:8,24,40,56,72:5 numbers.

m=16: multiples of 16 not divisible by 32:16,48,80:3 numbers.

m=32: multiples of 32 not divisible by 64:32,96>84:1 number.

m=64: multiples of 64 not divisible by 128:64,128>84:1 number.

Total:42+21+10
