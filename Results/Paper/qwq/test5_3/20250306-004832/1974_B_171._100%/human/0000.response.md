Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Polycarp has a string made of lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it using a specific algorithm. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string 'r' which consists of all the distinct letters from the original string 's', sorted in alphabetical order. Then, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character from 'r'. For example, the first character of 'r' is replaced by the last of 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

Given the encoded string, I need to write a program that decodes it back to the original string 's'. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an encoded string 'b', and I have to output the original string 's' for each case.

First, I need to understand the encoding process thoroughly to reverse it correctly. Let's break it down.

1. **Construct the auxiliary string 'r':**

- 'r' is made of all distinct characters from 's', sorted alphabetically.

- For example, if 's' is "codeforces", then 'r' is "cdefors".

2. **Encoding process:**

- Each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character in 'r'.

- Symmetric means the first character of 'r' is replaced by the last of 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

- For "codeforces":

- 'c' (first in 'r') is replaced by 's' (last in 'r').

- 'o' (second in 'r') is replaced by 'e' (second last in 'r').

- 'd' (third in 'r') is replaced by 'r' (third last in 'r').

- And so on.

So, to decode, I need to reverse this process. Given the encoded string 'b', I need to find the original string 's'.

Let me think about how to approach this.

**Step-by-step plan:**

1. **Identify the auxiliary string 'r' from the encoded string 'b':**

- Since 'r' is made of all distinct characters in 's', sorted alphabetically, and the encoding replaces each character in 's' with its symmetric character in 'r', I need to find 'r' from 'b'.

- But 'b' is encoded using 'r', and 'r' is derived from 's'. So, I need a way to reconstruct 'r' from 'b'.

- Since 'r' consists of unique sorted characters from 's', and 'b' is 's' encoded using 'r', I should be able to find 'r' by looking at the unique characters in 'b' and their mapping.

Wait, but 'r' is derived from 's', not 'b'. However, since 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', and 'r' is determined by 's', I need to find a way to map from 'b' back to 's'.

Let me consider that 'r' is the same for both encoding and decoding, as it's derived from 's'. So, if I can reconstruct 'r' from 'b', I can use it to decode 'b' back to 's'.

But how?

Let's think differently. Since 'r' is sorted and consists of unique characters from 's', and 'b' is 's' with each character replaced by its symmetric in 'r', I can infer 'r' from 'b'.

Wait, but 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', and 'r' is unique to 's'. So, to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to know 'r'.

But 'r' is not directly given. So, I need a way to determine 'r' from 'b'.

Wait a minute, perhaps 'r' can be derived from 'b' in the same way as it's derived from 's', because 'b' is a permutation of 's' in a certain way.

Let me see.

Since 'r' is made of unique sorted characters from 's', and 'b' is 's' with each character replaced by its symmetric in 'r', the unique characters in 'b' should be the same as in 's', just mapped differently.

Therefore, the unique sorted characters in 'b' should be the same as 'r'.

Wait, is that true?

Let's take the example:

's' = "codeforces"

'r' = "cdefors"

'b' = "serofedsoc"

Unique sorted characters in 'b' are 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's' which is the same as 'r'.

So, perhaps 'r' can be obtained by sorting the unique characters in 'b'.

If that's the case, then I can:

- Get the unique sorted characters from 'b' to get 'r'.

- Then, create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'.

- Finally, decode 'b' by replacing each character with its original character based on the mapping.

Let me test this idea with the example.

Given 'b' = "serofedsoc"

Unique sorted characters in 'b': 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's' -> 'cdefors' which is 'r'.

Now, the symmetric mapping would be:

'r'[0] -> 'r'[-1]: 'c' -> 's'

'r'[1] -> 'r'[-2]: 'd' -> 'r'

'r'[2] -> 'r'[-3]: 'e' -> 'o'

'r'[3] -> 'r'[-4]: 'f' -> 'f'

'r'[4] -> 'r'[-5]: 'o' -> 'e'

'r'[5] -> 'r'[-6]: 'r' -> 'd'

'r'[6] -> 'r'[-7]: 's' -> 'c'

So, the mapping is:

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'o' -> 'e'

'r' -> 'd'

's' -> 'c'

Now, to decode 'b' = "serofedsoc":

- 's' -> 'c'

- 'e' -> 'o'

- 'r' -> 'd'

- 'o' -> 'e'

- 'f' -> 'f'

- 'e' -> 'o'

- 'd' -> 'r'

- 's' -> 'c'

- 'o' -> 'e'

- 'c' -> 's'

Which gives "codeforces", which matches the original 's'.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the plan is:

- For each test case:

- Read 'n' and 'b'.

- Get the unique sorted characters from 'b' to form 'r'.

- Create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'.

- Decode 'b' by replacing each character with its original character based on the mapping.

- Output the decoded string.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

So, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case.

Let's think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case:

1. Read 'n' and 'b'.

2. Get 'r' by sorting the unique characters in 'b'.

3. Create a mapping where each character in 'r' is mapped to its symmetric character in 'r'.

4. Decode 'b' by replacing each character with its mapped character.

5. Output the decoded string.

Implementing this in code should be straightforward.

Let me consider edge cases to ensure the correctness.

**Edge Cases:**

1. **Single character:**

- If 'b' is a single character, say 'a', then 'r' is 'a'.

- The symmetric character of 'a' is itself.

- So, decoding 'a' should give 'a'.

2. **All characters are the same:**

- If 'b' is "aaa", then 'r' is 'a'.

- Mapping: 'a' -> 'a'

- Decoding gives "aaa".

3. **Two characters:**

- If 'b' is "ab", and 'r' is "ab".

- Mapping: 'a' -> 'b', 'b' -> 'a'

- So, decoding "ab" would be "ba".

4. **Palindrome in 'r':**

- If 'r' is a palindrome, the mapping might have some characters mapping to themselves.

- But since 'r' is sorted, it's unlikely to be a palindrome unless all characters are the same.

5. **Maximum length:**

- n = 2*10^5

- Need to ensure that the solution is efficient and doesn't exceed time limits.

6. **Minimum length:**

- n = 1

- As above, should handle single character cases.

I need to make sure that the solution handles all these cases correctly.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently. Since t can be up to 10^4, and sum of n is up to 2*10^5, I should read all input at once and process it accordingly to minimize I/O time.

In Python, reading all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and splitting it into tokens is efficient for such constraints.

Now, let's think about implementing the mapping.

I can create a dictionary that maps each character in 'r' to its symmetric character.

For example, for 'r' = "cdefors":

mapping = {

'c': 's',

'd': 'r',

'e': 'o',

'f': 'f',

'o': 'e',

'r': 'd',

's': 'c'

}

Then, for each character in 'b', I replace it with the corresponding value from the mapping.

In code, this can be done using a dictionary in Python.

Alternatively, I can use a list for mapping since keys are characters and values are their mappings.

Now, let's consider the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

**Provided Program:**

```python

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

index = 0

t = int(data[index])

index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index])

index += 1

b = data[index]

index += 1

results.append(func_1(b))

for result in results:

print(result)

def func_1(encoded):

unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))

char_map = {}

len_unique = len(unique_chars)

for i in range(len_unique):

char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]

decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))

return decoded

```

**Analysis of the Provided Program:**

1. **Reading Input:**

- Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.

- Splits the input into tokens and stores them in the list `data`.

- Uses an index to traverse the tokens.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**

- Reads the number of test cases `t`.

- For each test case:

- Reads `n` (length of the encoded string).

- Reads the encoded string `b`.

- Calls `func_1(b)` to decode it and appends the result to `results`.

- After processing all test cases, prints each result.

3. **Decoding Function `func_1`:**

- Takes the encoded string `encoded`.

- Finds the unique characters in `encoded`, sorts them to get 'r'.

- Creates a mapping where each character in 'r' is mapped to its symmetric character in 'r'.

- Decodes `encoded` by replacing each character with its mapped character.

This seems to match the plan I outlined earlier.

Let's verify it with the example.

**Example Verification:**

Take the first test case:

- n = 10

- b = "serofedsoc"

- unique_chars = sorted(set("serofedsoc")) = ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']

- mapping:

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'o' -> 'e'

'r' -> 'd'

's' -> 'c'

- Decoding "serofedsoc":

s -> c

e -> o

r -> d

o -> e

f -> f

e -> o

d -> r

s -> c

o -> e

c -> s

- Result: "codeforces"

Which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

- n = 3

- b = "ttf"

- unique_chars = sorted(set("ttf")) = ['f', 't']

- mapping:

'f' -> 't'

't' -> 'f'

- Decoding "ttf":

t -> f

t -> f

f -> t

- Result: "fft"

Which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

**Efficiency Consideration:**

- Reading input: O(total_characters)

- Processing each test case:

- Finding unique characters: O(n)

- Sorting unique characters: O(m log m), where m is the number of unique characters (m <= 26)

- Creating mapping: O(m)

- Decoding the string: O(n)

- Since t can be up to 10^4 and sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Since m is small (alphabet size is 26), sorting is efficient.

- Using a dictionary for mapping is fine.

- No further optimizations are necessary.

**Conclusion:**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as per the problem's requirements. It handles the input efficiently and processes each test case correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correct}}\]
