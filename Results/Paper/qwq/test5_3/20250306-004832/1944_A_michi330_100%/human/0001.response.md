Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? The number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense for a complete graph.

Everule lives on island 1 and wants to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. My task is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand what it means for Dominater to act optimally. Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so he should try to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.

Everule can visit an island if there's a path connecting island 1 to that island via the remaining bridges.

So, the problem is essentially about disconnecting as many islands as possible from island 1 by removing at most k bridges.

I recall that in graph theory, the connectivity of a graph is related to the number of bridges (edges) that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.

In a complete graph with n nodes, the connectivity is very high because there are multiple paths between any two nodes.

But in this problem, since it's a complete graph, removing bridges corresponding to a spanning tree would not disconnect the graph, as there would still be multiple paths.

Wait, no. In a complete graph, even after removing many bridges, there are still multiple paths between nodes.

Actually, to disconnect island 1 from some other island, say island x, Dominater needs to remove all bridges connecting island 1 to island x, and also ensure that there's no path via other islands.

But in a complete graph, there are multiple paths via other islands, so simply removing one bridge might not be enough to disconnect island 1 from island x.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, the graph is highly connected. To disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater would need to remove all bridges connected to island 1, which is n-1 bridges.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands by removing all its bridges, and Everule can only visit island 1.

But if k < n-1, then Dominater cannot completely isolate island 1. So, Everule can still reach some other islands.

But the problem is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. So, Dominater would try to remove bridges in such a way that as few islands as possible remain connected to island 1.

Wait, but in a complete graph, it's tricky because there are multiple paths.

Let me think about small values of n and k.

Take n=2, k=0.

If k=0, no bridges can be destroyed, so Everule can reach both islands: 1 and 2.

Output should be 2.

n=2, k=1.

Dominater can destroy the bridge between 1 and 2.

Then, Everule can only visit island 1.

Output is 1.

n=3, k=1.

If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3.

Because there's a bridge between 1 and 3, and 3 and 2.

So, Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, if Dominater destroys any other bridge, say 1 and 3, Everule can still reach island 3 via island 2.

Or if Dominater destroys the bridge between 2 and 3, Everule can still reach island 2 and 3 via each other.

So, with k=1, Everule can still reach all islands in n=3.

n=4, k=1.

Similarly, removing one bridge won't disconnect any island completely.

Everule can still reach all islands.

n=4, k=2.

If Dominater removes two bridges, say both bridges connected to island 2: 1-2 and 3-2.

Then, Everule can't reach island 2 directly or via other islands, because island 2 is only connected to 1 and 3, and both bridges are removed.

So, Everule can only reach islands 1, 3, and 4.

But wait, island 2 is disconnected from the rest.

But in a complete graph, island 2 is connected to all others.

Wait, no. In n=4, island 2 is connected to 1,3,4.

If Dominater removes bridges 1-2 and 3-2, then island 2 is still connected to island 4.

So, Everule can reach island 2 via island 4.

Hence, it's still connected.

Actually, in a complete graph, removing fewer than n-1 bridges cannot disconnect the graph.

Wait, no. In a complete graph, the edge connectivity is n-1.

Meaning, you need to remove at least n-1 edges to disconnect the graph.

So, if k < n-1, the graph remains connected, and Everule can reach all islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from some other islands.

But in the problem, Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can remove all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

Then, Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, the graph remains connected, and Everule can reach all islands.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

Output:

2

1

4

1

5

1

For n=2, k=0: output 2

n=2, k=1: output 1

n=4, k=1: output 4

n=5, k=10: output 1

n=5, k=3: output 5

n=4, k=4: output 1

Wait, n=5, k=10.

Total bridges: 5*4/2=10.

So, k=10 means all bridges are destroyed.

Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.

n=5, k=3.

Total bridges: 10.

Dominater can remove 3 bridges.

Since 3 < 5-1=4, the graph remains connected, so Everule can reach all islands.

n=4, k=4.

Total bridges: 6.

Dominater removes 4 bridges.

Is 4 >= 4-1=3? Yes.

So, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=1, output is 4, meaning the graph is still connected.

In n=4, k=4, output is 1, meaning island 1 is isolated.

So, when k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

When k < n-1, Everule can visit all islands.

Hence, the logic seems to be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

This matches all the examples.

For n=5, k=3:

n-1=4, k=3 < 4, so print 5.

n=5, k=10:

k=10 >=5-1=4, so print 1.

n=4, k=1:

1 < 4-1=3, so print 4.

n=4, k=4:

4 >= 4-1=3, so print 1.

n=2, k=0:

0 < 2-1=1, so print 2.

n=2, k=1:

1 >= 2-1=1, so print 1.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

This seems correct based on the above reasoning.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to k bridges in a complete graph of n islands.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Graph Structure**: 
   - Initially, all islands are connected in a complete graph, meaning there is a path between any two islands.
   
2. **Dominater's Strategy**:
   - Dominater aims to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying up to k bridges.
   - To isolate island 1 (Everule's starting point) from as many other islands as possible.

3. **Critical Number of Bridges to Disconnect**:
   - In a complete graph with n islands, to disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1, which amounts to n-1 bridges.
   
4. **Decision Based on k**:
   - If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If k < n-1, it is impossible to isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still visit all islands.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

```

## Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases, t.
   - For each test case, read the values of n (number of islands) and k (maximum bridges Dominater can destroy).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If k is greater than or equal to n-1, print 1 (only island 1 is accessible).
   - If k is less than n-1, print n (all islands are accessible).

3. **Optimal Bridge Destruction**:
   - The logic relies on the fact that in a complete graph, destroying up to n-2 bridges cannot isolate island 1 from all other islands.
   - Destroying n-1 bridges disconnects island 1 from the rest of the graph.

This approach ensures an efficient and correct solution to the problem by leveraging the properties of complete graphs and the critical number of bridges needed to disconnect the graph.
