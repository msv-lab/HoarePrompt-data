Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given four points that are the corners of a square on a coordinate plane. The square has sides parallel to the axes, and I need to find its area. There are multiple test cases, and I have to do this for each one.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligning with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that arrangement.

Given four points, I need to figure out which ones are opposite each other to calculate the side length and then the area. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, opposite sides will have either the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate.

Looking at the example provided:

Test case 1:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

If I plot these points, I can see that:

- (1,2) and (1,5) have the same x-coordinate, meaning they form a vertical side.

- (4,2) and (4,5) also have the same x-coordinate, forming another vertical side.

- (1,2) and (4,2) have the same y-coordinate, forming a horizontal side.

- Similarly, (1,5) and (4,5) have the same y-coordinate, forming another horizontal side.

So, the side length would be the difference in x-coordinates between (1,2) and (4,2), which is 3, or the difference in y-coordinates between (1,2) and (1,5), which is also 3. The area would be 3 squared, which is 9, matching the first output.

Another test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Plotting these:

- (-1,1) and (1,1) form a horizontal side.

- (-1,-1) and (1,-1) form another horizontal side.

- (-1,1) and (-1,-1) form a vertical side.

- (1,1) and (1,-1) form another vertical side.

The side length is the difference in x-coordinates between (-1,1) and (1,1), which is 2, or the difference in y-coordinates between (-1,1) and (-1,-1), which is 2. Area is 2 squared, which is 4, matching the second output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Plotting these:

- (45,11) and (45,39) form a vertical side.

- (17,11) and (17,39) form another vertical side.

- (45,11) and (17,11) form a horizontal side.

- (45,39) and (17,39) form another horizontal side.

Side length is the difference in x-coordinates between (45,11) and (17,11), which is 28, or the difference in y-coordinates between (45,11) and (45,39), which is 28. Area is 28 squared, which is 784, matching the third output.

So, the general approach seems to be:

1. Identify two points that share the same x-coordinate to find the vertical side length.

2. Identify two points that share the same y-coordinate to find the horizontal side length.

3. Since it's a square, both should be equal.

4. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())

(x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())

(x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())

(x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())

if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:

if y1 < y3:

res = abs(y3 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y3)

elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

print(res ** 2)

Let's analyze this.

It reads the number of test cases, a, and then for each test case, it reads four lines of coordinates.

Then, it has conditional statements based on the x-coordinates:

- If x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 3.

- Else if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 2.

- Else if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 2.

- Then, it prints the square of this difference.

Wait a minute, in all cases, it's calculating the difference in y-coordinates. But in the problem, the side length could be determined by either the difference in x or y coordinates, depending on which sides are horizontal or vertical.

In the program, it seems to always calculate the vertical side length (difference in y-coordinates) and assumes that the horizontal side length is the same, which is true for a square.

But is this approach comprehensive? Let's consider the possibilities.

Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, there are only two possible orientations for the sides: either the sides are vertical and horizontal, or... wait, no, since it's specified that sides are parallel to the axes, all sides must be either vertical or horizontal.

So, in all cases, opposite sides will have either the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate.

But in the program, it's only calculating the difference in y-coordinates, assuming that the side length can be obtained from vertical sides.

However, in some cases, it might be more straightforward to calculate the horizontal side length (difference in x-coordinates).

Let's see if the program covers all scenarios.

Looking back at the conditionals:

- If x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: this suggests that points 1 and 3 share the same x, and points 2 and 4 share the same x, meaning vertical sides.

- Then, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between points 1 and 3.

- Similarly, in the other conditions, it's calculating differences in y-coordinates.

But what if the repeated x-coordinates are different?

Wait, in a square, opposite sides should have the same x or y coordinates.

Given that, the program seems to be trying to pair points with the same x-coordinates to calculate the vertical side lengths.

But it might not cover all possible configurations of the points.

Let me think of a case where this logic might fail.

Suppose the input is:

1

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

This should be a square with side length 1, area 1.

According to the program:

x1=0, y1=0

x2=0, y2=1

x3=1, y3=0

x4=1, y4=1

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 0 == 1 and 0 == 1, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4: 0 == 0 and 1 == 1, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y2: 0 < 1, which is True, so res = abs(1 - 0) = 1

Then, print 1**2 = 1, which is correct.

Another case:

1

2 3

2 7

5 3

5 7

This should be a square with side length 4, area 16.

According to the program:

x1=2, y1=3

x2=2, y2=7

x3=5, y3=3

x4=5, y4=7

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 2 == 5 and 2 == 5, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4: 2 == 2 and 5 == 5, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y2: 3 < 7, which is True, so res = abs(7 - 3) = 4

Then, print 4**2 = 16, which is correct.

Seems fine.

But what if the repeated x-coordinates are different?

Consider:

1

3 4

3 8

7 4

7 8

According to the program:

x1=3, y1=4

x2=3, y2=8

x3=7, y3=4

x4=7, y4=8

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 3 == 7 and 3 == 7, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4: 3 == 3 and 7 == 7, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y2: 4 < 8, which is True, so res = abs(8 - 4) = 4

Then, print 4**2 = 16, which is correct.

Another configuration:

1

0 0

1 0

0 1

1 1

According to the program:

x1=0, y1=0

x2=1, y2=0

x3=0, y3=1

x4=1, y4=1

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 0 == 0 and 1 == 1, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y3: 0 < 1, which is True, so res = abs(1 - 0) = 1

Then, print 1**2 = 1, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, which matches the first condition.

So, it seems to handle this case correctly.

What about a different order:

1

0 0

0 1

1 1

1 0

According to the program:

x1=0, y1=0

x2=0, y2=1

x3=1, y3=1

x4=1, y4=0

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 0 == 1 and 0 == 1, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4: 0 == 0 and 1 == 1, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y2: 0 < 1, which is True, so res = abs(1 - 0) = 1

Then, print 1**2 = 1, which is correct.

Another order:

1

1 0

0 0

0 1

1 1

According to the program:

x1=1, y1=0

x2=0, y2=0

x3=0, y3=1

x4=1, y4=1

Check if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4: 1 == 0 and 0 == 1, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4: 1 == 0 and 0 == 1, which is False.

Then, check if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2: 1 == 1 and 0 == 0, which is True.

Then, if y1 < y2: 0 < 0, which is False, so res = abs(0 - 0) = 0

Wait, but the side length should be 1, not 0.

Oh, there's a mistake here.

Wait, in this case:

x1=1, y1=0

x2=0, y2=0

x3=0, y3=1

x4=1, y4=1

It falls into the last elif: x1 == x4 and x3 == x2: 1 == 1 and 0 == 0, which is True.

Then, it checks if y1 < y2: 0 < 0, which is False, so res = abs(0 - 0) = 0

Then, it prints 0**2 = 0, which is incorrect because the area should be 1.

Hmm, so there's a problem here.

Wait, why does it check y1 < y2 in this case?

Let's see: in this configuration, points are:

- (1,0)

- (0,0)

- (0,1)

- (1,1)

So, points 1 and 4 share the same x-coordinate (1), and points 2 and 3 share the same x-coordinate (0).

The program, in the last elif, checks if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, which is True.

Then, it checks if y1 < y2: 0 < 0, which is False, so res = abs(y1 - y2) = abs(0 - 0) = 0

But actually, the side length should be the difference in x-coordinates between x1 and x2, which is 1 - 0 = 1, or the difference in y-coordinates between y1 and y4, which is 0 - 1 = -1, but taking abs, it's 1.

So, in this case, the program incorrectly calculates the side length as 0.

This suggests that the program's logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly identify the side lengths in all configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to calculate the side length.

Since it's a square with sides parallel to the axes, the side length should be equal to the difference in x-coordinates of two points with the same y-coordinate or the difference in y-coordinates of two points with the same x-coordinate.

Given that, perhaps a better approach is to find any two points that share the same x-coordinate and calculate the difference in their y-coordinates, or find two points that share the same y-coordinate and calculate the difference in their x-coordinates.

But in the program, it seems to make specific pairings based on the order of input, which can lead to errors in certain configurations, as seen in the above example.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible configurations of the input points.

A more robust approach would be to find pairs of points with the same x-coordinate and calculate the difference in their y-coordinates, and similarly, find pairs with the same y-coordinate and calculate the difference in their x-coordinates, then ensure that both differences are equal since it's a square.

But in this program, it seems to arbitrarily choose which differences to calculate based on the input order, which leads to incorrect calculations in some cases.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
