Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Polycarp has a string made up of lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it using a specific algorithm. I need to write a program that can decode this encoded string back to the original.

First, I need to understand the encoding process clearly. The problem says that he constructs an auxiliary string 'r' which consists of all distinct letters from the original string 's', arranged in alphabetical order. Then, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character from 'r'. That means the first character in 'r' is replaced by the last in 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

For example, with s = "codeforces", r is "cdefors". So, 'c' is replaced by 's', 'o' by 'e', 'd' by 'r', and so on, resulting in "serofedsoc".

Okay, so my task is to reverse this process. Given the encoded string 'b', I need to find the original string 's'.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the auxiliary string 'r' was, based on the encoded string 'b'. Since 'r' is made up of unique characters from 's' in alphabetical order, and 'b' is 's' with each character replaced by its symmetric character in 'r', I need a way to map back from 'b' to 's'.

Wait, but I don't know 'r', I only have 'b'. Hmm.

But 'b' is derived from 's' using 'r', and 'r' is determined by 's'. Since 's' is encoded to 'b', and I have 'b', I need to find 's'.

Let me see if I can find a way to determine 'r' from 'b'.

Since 'r' is made up of unique characters from 's' in alphabetical order, and 's' is transformed into 'b' by replacing each character with its symmetric character in 'r', I need to find a way to map back.

Wait, but in the encoding process, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character in 'r'. So, if I can find 'r', then I can create a mapping from 'b' back to 's'.

But to find 'r', I need to know the unique characters in 's', which is the same as the unique characters in 'b', since the encoding is a permutation of these characters.

Wait, no. The encoding replaces characters based on 'r', which is the sorted unique characters of 's'. But 's' and 'b' have the same set of unique characters, because the encoding only rearranges them.

So, the unique characters in 'b' are the same as those in 's', which are used to form 'r'.

Therefore, I can determine 'r' by taking the unique characters in 'b' and sorting them alphabetically.

Once I have 'r', I can create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'. Then, to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to apply the inverse of this mapping.

Wait, actually, since 's' was transformed to 'b' by replacing each character with its symmetric character in 'r', to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to replace each character in 'b' with its symmetric character in 'r'.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

In the encoding process:

- Construct 'r' from 's' by taking unique characters in alphabetical order.

- Replace each character in 's' with its symmetric character in 'r' to get 'b'.

So, to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to apply the same replacement again, because replacing twice should bring me back to the original.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me take an example.

Given s = "codeforces", r = "cdefors", encoding is:

c -> s

o -> e

d -> r

e -> d

f -> f

o -> e

r -> o

c -> s

e -> d

s -> c

So, b = "serofedsoc"

Now, to decode "serofedsoc" back to "codeforces", I need to apply the same replacement:

s -> c

e -> o

r -> d

o -> f

f -> o

e -> d

d -> e

s -> c

So, indeed, applying the same replacement again brings me back to the original 's'.

Wait, but in this case, it seems that applying the replacement twice returns to the original.

But in general, is this always true?

Let's consider a smaller example.

Suppose s = "ab", then r = "ab"

Encoding: a -> b, b -> a, so b = "ba"

Decoding: apply the same replacement, b -> a, a -> b, so "ba" -> "ab", which is the original 's'.

Similarly, for s = "aaa", r = "a", encoding: a -> a, so b = "aaa", decoding is the same, a -> a, so back to "aaa".

So, yes, applying the same replacement again should return to the original string.

Therefore, to decode 'b' back to 's', I can use the same replacement mapping that was used to encode 's' to 'b'.

So, in the program, for each test case, I can:

1. Determine 'r' from 'b' by taking the unique characters in 'b' and sorting them alphabetically.

2. Create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'.

3. Apply this mapping to 'b' to get 's'.

Let me look at the given program and see if it's implementing this correctly.

The program defines a function func_1(b) that takes the encoded string 'b' and is supposed to return the original string 's'.

Inside func_1:

- It creates a dictionary char_map.

- It iterates over the sorted unique characters in 'b', and for each character, it maps it to a new character which is 'a' shifted by (len(b) - i - 1).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, len(b) is the length of the string 'b', not the length of 'r'.

But 'r' is the sorted unique characters in 'b'.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, let's look at the code again.

It says:

for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):

char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))

So, it's mapping each unique character in 'b' (sorted alphabetically) to a new character, which is 'a' shifted by (len(b) - i - 1).

This doesn't seem right.

Wait, in the problem, the encoding process replaces each character in 's' with its symmetric character in 'r'.

So, to decode, I need to replace each character in 'b' with its symmetric character in 'r'.

But in this code, it's mapping each character in 'r' to a new character based on its position in 'r', but not necessarily its symmetric character.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread it.

Wait, no, this doesn't look right.

Let me think differently.

Given 'r' is the sorted unique characters of 'b' (since 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', which is unique sorted characters of 's', and 's' and 'b' have the same unique characters).

So, 'r' is sorted(unique(b)).

Then, in the encoding, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character in 'r'.

So, to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to replace each character in 'b' by its symmetric character in 'r'.

Therefore, I need to create a mapping where each character in 'r' is mapped to its symmetric character in 'r'.

Then, apply this mapping to 'b' to get 's'.

So, in code, I should:

- Get 'r' = sorted(unique(b))

- Create a mapping where r[i] maps to r[len(r)-1-i]

- Then, for each character in 'b', replace it with the corresponding character from this mapping.

Looking back at the code:

char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))

This is mapping each unique character in 'b' to a character that is 'a' shifted by (len(b) - i - 1), which is not the same as mapping to the symmetric character in 'r'.

This seems incorrect.

It should be:

char_map[c] = r[len(r) - 1 - i]

Where r is sorted(set(b))

So, the code is wrong in this part.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to decode a given string `b` back to its original form `s` based on a specific encoding algorithm. The encoding algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

### Approach

1. **Determine the Auxiliary String `r`**:
   - Since `r` is composed of unique characters from `s` in alphabetical order, and `s` and `b` share the same unique characters, we can derive `r` by taking the unique characters from `b` and sorting them alphabetically.

2. **Create the Mapping for Decoding**:
   - Each character in `b` needs to be replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. This means that for each character in `r`, we map it to the character symmetric to it in the string `r`.

3. **Decode the String `b`**:
   - Using the mapping created, replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character in the original string `s`.

### Solution Code

```python
def decode_string(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    mapping = {}
    n = len(r)
    for i in range(n):
        mapping[r[i]] = r[n - 1 - i]
    s = ''.join(mapping[c] for c in b)
    return s

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    num_test_cases = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(num_test_cases):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        b = data[index]
        index += 1
        print(decode_string(b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Determine the Auxiliary String `r`**:
   - We extract the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sort them to form `r`.

2. **Create the Mapping for Decoding**:
   - We create a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric character in `r`. This mapping is used to decode `b` back to `s`.

3. **Decode the String `b`**:
   - Using the mapping, we replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `s`, thus reconstructing the original string.

This approach ensures that we correctly decode the string `b` back to its original form `s` by reversing the encoding process accurately.
