Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in each move. He can do this for n moves, and I need to figure out if it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower after these n moves.

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. In each move, he can either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. That means the tower's height can increase or decrease by one in each step.

I need to think about how the sequence of these operations affects the final number of cubes in the tower. Let's consider that he starts with zero cubes.

Suppose he adds a cube in the first move; the tower has 1 cube. If he adds another cube, it has 2 cubes. If he then removes one cube, it goes back to 1 cube, and so on.

I need to find out, after n such moves, whether it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case: n=3, m=3.

So, in 3 moves, can he have 3 cubes in the tower?

Yes, by adding a cube in each of the 3 moves: start with 0, add 1 (total 1), add 1 (total 2), add 1 (total 3). So, "Yes".

Second test case: n=2, m=4.

In 2 moves, can he have 4 cubes?

Let's see:

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Add another cube: 1 -> 2

That's only 2 cubes.

Alternatively:

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

- Remove a cube: 1 -> 0

- Add a cube: 0 -> 1

Wait, but he only has 2 moves, so only two operations. So, he can't have 4 cubes in 2 moves. So, "No".

Third test case: n=5, m=3.

In 5 moves, can he have 3 cubes?

One possible sequence:

Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add: 0->1->2->3->2->3. So, yes.

Another sequence:

Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove: 0->1->2->3->4->3. Still ends with 3.

So, "Yes".

From these examples, it seems that as long as n is greater than or equal to m, it's possible to have m cubes after n moves. But is that always the case?

Wait a minute. Suppose n=1 and m=0.

Sequence:

- Start with 0, add a cube: 0->1

- Or start with 0, remove a cube: can't remove from 0, so only option is to add a cube to get 1.

But m=0, which is not possible in this case. So, "No".

But according to my earlier assumption, n >= m (1 >= 0), which would suggest "Yes", but in reality, it's "No".

So, my initial thought is incomplete.

Let's think differently.

Let's consider that each "add" operation increases the cube count by 1, and each "remove" operation decreases it by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

Given that, after n moves, some number of adds and removes, the final number of cubes will be the initial number (0) plus the number of adds minus the number of removes.

So, if a is the number of adds and r is the number of removes, then:

m = a - r

And since total moves are n, a + r = n

So, we have two equations:

1. a - r = m

2. a + r = n

We can solve these equations for a and r.

Adding both equations: 2a = m + n => a = (m + n)/2

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 2r = n - m => r = (n - m)/2

For a and r to be non-negative integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, and both a and r must be non-negative.

So, for it to be possible:

1. (m + n) is even

2. (n - m) is even

3. a = (m + n)/2 >= 0

4. r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Wait, actually, since a and r are non-negative integers, (m + n) must be even and (n - m) must be even, and both a and r must be non-negative.

But in the earlier example, n=1, m=0:

a = (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5, which is not an integer, so not possible, hence "No".

In the first test case, n=3, m=3:

a = (3 + 3)/2 = 3, r = (3 - 3)/2 = 0, which is valid.

Second test case, n=2, m=4:

a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3, r = (2 - 4)/2 = -1, which is invalid, so "No".

Third test case, n=5, m=3:

a = (3 + 5)/2 = 4, r = (5 - 3)/2 = 1, which is valid.

So, the condition should be:

- (m + n) is even

- (n - m) is even

- a >= 0 and r >= 0

But since a = (m + n)/2 and r = (n - m)/2, and m and n are integers, (m + n) being even ensures a is integer, and (n - m) being even ensures r is integer.

Also, a >= 0 implies m + n >= 0, which is always true since m and n are positive.

r >= 0 implies n - m >= 0, or n >= m.

So, combining all these, the condition simplifies to:

- n >= m

- (m + n) is even

- (n - m) is even

But wait, if (m + n) is even, then (n - m) = (n + m) - 2m is also even, since 2m is even. So, if (m + n) is even, then (n - m) is automatically even.

Therefore, the condition further simplifies to:

- n >= m

- (m + n) is even

So, in the program, we need to check if n >= m and (m + n) % 2 == 0.

If both these conditions are satisfied, then it's "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, looking at the given program:

kreker = int(input())

for i in range(kreker):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if n >= m:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

Hmm, it only checks if n >= m, but it doesn't check if (m + n) is even.

In the earlier example, n=1, m=0, which should be "No", but according to this program, since 1 >= 0, it would print "Yes", which is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't account for the parity condition.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after performing exactly `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding one cube to the top of the tower or removing one cube from the top.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Moves**:
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube.
   - We start with zero cubes.
   
2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - Let `a` be the number of add operations.
   - Let `r` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have two equations:
     - `a + r = n` (total moves)
     - `a - r = m` (net addition results in `m` cubes)
   
3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - Adding the equations: `2a = n + m` => `a = (n + m)/2`
   - Subtracting the equations: `2r = n - m` => `r = (n - m)/2`
   
4. **Conditions for Feasibility**:
   - `a` and `r` must be non-negative integers.
   - Therefore, `(n + m)` must be even.
   - `(n - m)` must be even.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `m`.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n + m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
  
- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Check if `n >= m` to ensure there are enough moves to reach `m` cubes.
  - Check if `(n + m)` is even to ensure the number of add and remove operations are integers.
  
- **Output**:
  - Print "Yes" if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise print "No".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves by considering both the total moves and the parity conditions.
