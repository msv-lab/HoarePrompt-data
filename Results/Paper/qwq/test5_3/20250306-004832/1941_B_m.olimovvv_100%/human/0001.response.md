Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Rudolf has an array of n integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero after applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. So, for any chosen i (between 2 and n-1), the operation subtracts 1 from a[i-1], subtracts 2 from a[i], and subtracts 1 from a[i+1]. This seems like a way to reduce the values in the array, but in a specific pattern.

I need to figure out if it's possible to reduce the entire array to zeros using these operations. It feels like this might be related to linear algebra or some kind of system of equations, where each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific combination of values from three consecutive elements.

Let me think about the constraints. The array has at least 3 elements (since n ≥ 3), and the elements can be up to 10^9, which is a large number. Also, there are up to 10^4 test cases, with a total of up to 2*10^5 elements across all test cases. So, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

7

5

1 3 5 5 2

5

2 4 4 5 1

5

0 1 3 3 1

6

5 6 0 2 3 0

4

1 2 7 2

3

7 1 0

4

1 1 1 1

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

NO

NO

NO

So, for the first test case with array [1,3,5,5,2], it's possible to make all elements zero, but for the second one [2,4,4,5,1], it's not.

I need to find a general way to determine this for any given array.

Let me consider the operation in more detail. Each operation affects three consecutive elements: subtracting 1 from the left and right neighbors and 2 from the center element. If I think of this operation as a vector or a kernel [-1, -2, -1], then applying this operation at position i is equivalent to convolving this kernel with the array at position i.

My goal is to apply a series of these operations to make the entire array zero. This sounds like solving a system of equations where each operation is a equation, and I need to find non-negative integer solutions (since the number of operations must be non-negative).

However, with n up to 2*10^5, solving a system of equations directly is not feasible due to time constraints. I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the cumulative sum or prefix sums of the array. Sometimes, in array problems where operations affect ranges, cumulative sums can help.

Let's define prefix sums:

s[0] = 0

s[k] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1] for k from 1 to n+1

But I'm not sure if this directly helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the operations in terms of differences. Since each operation affects three consecutive elements, maybe I can look at the differences between elements.

Let me try to see what happens to the differences between consecutive elements when I apply an operation.

Let’s define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n, assuming a[0] = 0.

Wait, but a[0] is actually given in the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the second differences, like in spline interpolations.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me look at the problem differently. Suppose I have the final array as all zeros. If I reverse the operations, I can add the kernel [1,2,1] at certain positions to build up to the original array.

So, if I can express the original array as a sum of such kernels applied at different positions, then it's possible to reach all zeros.

This sounds similar to signal processing or convolution.

But again, this seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider small examples to see a pattern.

Take n=3:

Array: [a,b,c]

I can only perform the operation at i=2:

a' = a -1

b' = b -2

c' = c -1

If I perform this operation k times, then:

a' = a - k

b' = b - 2k

c' = c - k

To make a' = b' = c' = 0, we need:

a - k = 0 => k = a

b - 2k = 0 => b - 2a = 0 => b = 2a

c - k = 0 => c = a

So, for n=3, it's possible only if b = 2a and c = a.

Similarly, for n=4:

[a,b,c,d]

Operations can be at i=2 or i=3.

If I operate at i=2:

a' = a -1

b' = b -2

c' = c -1

d' = d

If I operate at i=3:

a' = a

b' = b -1

c' = c -2

d' = d -1

This seems more complicated. Maybe I can find some invariants or constraints that need to be satisfied.

Another idea: perhaps there are certain conditions on the array elements that must hold for it to be possible to reduce to all zeros.

Looking back at the first test case: [1,3,5,5,2]

After series of operations, it becomes [0,0,0,0,0]

In the second test case: [2,4,4,5,1], it's not possible.

I need to find what distinguishes these two cases.

Let me look at the differences between consecutive elements.

For [1,3,5,5,2]:

Differences: 3-1=2, 5-3=2, 5-5=0, 2-5=-3

For [2,4,4,5,1]:

Differences: 4-2=2, 4-4=0, 5-4=1, 1-5=-4

Is there a pattern in the differences?

Not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the sum of the array elements.

For the first test case: 1+3+5+5+2=16

For the second: 2+4+4+5+1=16

Same sum, but one is possible and the other is not.

So sum is not enough.

Wait, maybe the sum must be even or something like that.

But in this case, both sums are 16, which is even, and one is possible, the other is not.

So sum being even is not sufficient.

Another idea: maybe there is a pattern in the prefix sums.

Let me try computing prefix sums for the first test case:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 1

prefix[2] = 1 + 3 = 4

prefix[3] = 4 + 5 = 9

prefix[4] = 9 + 5 = 14

prefix[5] = 14 + 2 = 16

For the second test case:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 2

prefix[2] = 2 + 4 = 6

prefix[3] = 6 + 4 = 10

prefix[4] = 10 + 5 = 15

prefix[5] = 15 + 1 = 16

Not sure what to make of these prefix sums.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the differences between prefix sums.

Wait, the prefix sums themselves are just the cumulative sums.

Maybe I need to look at something else.

Let me consider the operation again.

Each operation subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, the total sum subtracted per operation is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Therefore, the total sum of the array must be a multiple of 4 for it to be possible to reduce to all zeros.

In the first test case, sum is 16, which is divisible by 4.

In the second test case, sum is 16, which is also divisible by 4, but it's still not possible.

Wait, but in the sample input, there's another test case with sum 16, and it's "NO".

So, sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

I need more constraints.

Let me think about the operations in terms of linear algebra.

Each operation can be represented as subtracting a vector [-1, -2, -1] from the array, but shifted to the position where the operation is applied.

So, for an array of size n, the operations correspond to vectors of size n, and I can set up a system of equations where the coefficients are the number of times each operation is applied.

But solving this system directly is not practical for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the operations in reverse.

Suppose I have all zeros, and I apply the operations in reverse to build up to the original array.

Each reverse operation adds 1 to a[i-1], 2 to a[i], and 1 to a[i+1].

So, it's like smoothing the array by adding these kernels.

But I need to see if I can build the original array by summing such kernels.

This seems related to convolution.

But I need a way to check if the array can be expressed as a sum of these kernels.

Another idea: maybe I can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the required operations.

Let me try to simulate this.

Start from the leftmost element.

In the first test case: [1,3,5,5,2]

I need to make the first element zero.

To affect the first element, I can only operate at i=2, because operation at i=2 subtracts 1 from a[1].

So, if I operate k times at i=2, I subtract k from a[1].

I need a[1] - k = 0, so k = a[1] = 1.

So, perform operation once at i=2.

After this operation:

a[1] = 1 -1 =0

a[2] = 3 -2 =1

a[3] =5 -1=4

a[4] =5

a[5] =2

Now the array is [0,1,4,5,2]

Next, I need to make a[2]=0.

To affect a[2], I can operate at i=2 or i=3.

Wait, operation at i=2 affects a[1], a[2], a[3].

Operation at i=3 affects a[2], a[3], a[4].

I need to choose how many times to operate at i=2 and i=3 to make a[2]=0.

Let’s denote:

Let x be the number of operations at i=2.

Let y be the number of operations at i=3.

Then:

a[2] -2x -y =0 => 1 -2x -y=0 => 2x + y =1

a[3] -x -2y =0 =>4 -x -2y=0

a[4] -y =0 =>5 -y=0 =>y=5

But if y=5, then from 2x + y =1 =>2x +5=1 =>2x=-4 =>x=-2

But x can't be negative, so this is impossible.

Wait, but in the problem, the number of operations must be non-negative integers.

So, in this case, it's impossible to make a[2]=0 with non-negative operations.

Wait, but in the example, it's possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulating the operations.

Let me try again.

Original array: [1,3,5,5,2]

First operation at i=2: k=1

a[1]=1-1=0

a[2]=3-2=1

a[3]=5-1=4

a[4]=5

a[5]=2

Now, a[2]=1, need to make it zero.

Can I operate at i=3?

Operation at i=3: k times

a[2] -= k

a[3] -= 2k

a[4] -= k

I need a[2] -k =0 =>k=1

Then:

a[2]=1-1=0

a[3]=4-2=2

a[4]=5-1=4

a[5]=2

Now, array is [0,0,2,4,2]

Next, need to make a[3]=0.

To affect a[3], I can operate at i=3 or i=4.

Operation at i=3: k times

a[2] -=k (but a[2] is already 0)

a[3] -=2k

a[4] -=k

I need a[3]-2k=0 =>2-2k=0 =>k=1

Then:

a[2]=0-1=-1 (but a[2] is already 0, wait no, a[2] is 0, but operation subtracts 1, so a[2]=0-1=-1, which is negative, but in the problem, elements are non-negative, so maybe negative values are allowed?

Wait, no, the problem says elements are non-negative, and operations can only be applied in a way that doesn't make any element negative.

So, if a[2]=0, and operation at i=3 would subtract 1 from a[2], making it -1, which is invalid.

Therefore, I cannot perform any operations at i=3 if a[2]=0.

So, in this case, I cannot make a[3]=0, because operating at i=3 would make a[2] negative.

Wait, but in the example, it's possible to make all elements zero.

Maybe I simulated the operations incorrectly.

Let me try a different sequence of operations.

Original array: [1,3,5,5,2]

First, operate at i=4:

a[3]=5-1=4

a[4]=5-2=3

a[5]=2-1=1

Array becomes: [1,3,4,3,1]

Now, operate at i=3:

a[2]=3-1=2

a[3]=4-2=2

a[4]=3-1=2

Array: [1,2,2,2,1]

Operate at i=2:

a[1]=1-1=0

a[2]=2-2=0

a[3]=2-1=1

Array: [0,0,1,2,1]

Operate at i=3:

a[2]=0-1=-1 (invalid)

Wait, again, negative values are not allowed.

So, perhaps I need to choose operations in a different order.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem without trying to simulate all possible sequences of operations.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the array a[1..n], and I need to make all a[i]=0 by applying operations that subtract [-1,-2,-1] at positions i from 2 to n-1.

I need to find coefficients k_i (for i from 2 to n-1) such that:

a[1] - k[2] =0

a[2] -2k[2] -k[3] =0

a[3] -k[2] -2k[3] -k[4] =0

...

a[n-1] -k[n-2] -2k[n-1] =0

a[n] -k[n-1] =0

This is a system of linear equations.

I need to solve for k[2..n-1] in integers, with k[i] >=0.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can find a way to express k[i] in terms of a[i].

Let me try to solve this system step by step.

From the last equation: a[n] -k[n-1]=0 =>k[n-1]=a[n]

From the second last equation: a[n-1] -k[n-2] -2k[n-1]=0 =>k[n-2]=a[n-1]-2k[n-1]=a[n-1]-2a[n]

But k[n-2] must be >=0, so a[n-1]-2a[n] >=0.

Similarly, proceed backwards.

This seems promising.

Let me try to generalize this.

Start from the end:

k[n-1] = a[n]

k[n-2] = a[n-1] - 2k[n-1] = a[n-1] - 2a[n]

k[n-3] = a[n-2] - 2k[n-2] - k[n-1] = a[n-2] - 2(a[n-1]-2a[n]) - a[n] = a[n-2] - 2a[n-1] + 4a[n] - a[n] = a[n-2] - 2a[n-1] + 3a[n]

And so on.

This seems like a pattern, but it's getting complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe I can use dynamic programming to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Define dp[i] as the value of k[i], the number of operations at position i.

Starting from the end:

dp[n-1] = a[n]

Then dp[n-2] = a[n-1] - 2*dp[n-1] = a[n-1] - 2*a[n]

If dp[n-2] <0, invalid.

Then dp[n-3] = a[n-2] - dp[n-1] - 2*dp[n-2]

Wait, I need to double-check the dependencies.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the beginning.

Let me try that.

From the first equation: a[1] - k[2] =0 =>k[2]=a[1]

Then, from the second equation: a[2] -2k[2] -k[3]=0 =>k[3]=a[2]-2k[2]=a[2]-2a[1]

If k[3]<0, invalid.

Then, k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2k[3]=a[3]-a[1]-2(a[2]-2a[1])=a[3]-a[1]-2a[2]+4a[1]=a[3]-2a[2]+3a[1]

If k[4]<0, invalid.

Continuing this way:

k[5]=a[4]-k[3]-2k[4]

And so on.

This seems manageable.

I can compute k[i] sequentially from i=2 to i=n-1, and check if each k[i] is non-negative.

If all k[i] are non-negative integers, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

Let me test this with the first test case.

Test case 1: [1,3,5,5,2]

n=5

a=[1,3,5,5,2]

Compute k[2]=a[1]=1

k[3]=a[2]-2k[2]=3-2*1=1

k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2k[3]=5-1-2*1=5-1-2=2

Then, check a[4]-k[3]-2k[4]=5-1-4=0

And a[5]-k[4]=2-2=0

All good.

Test case 2: [2,4,4,5,1]

n=5

a=[2,4,4,5,1]

k[2]=a[1]=2

k[3]=a[2]-2k[2]=4-4=0

k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2k[3]=4-2-0=2

Check a[4]-k[3]-2k[4]=5-0-4=1 !=0

So, invalid, which matches the sample output "NO"

Another test case: [0,1,3,3,1]

n=5

a=[0,1,3,3,1]

k[2]=a[1]=0

k[3]=a[2]-2k[2]=1-0=1

k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2k[3]=3-0-2=1

Check a[4]-k[3]-2k[4]=3-1-2=0

And a[5]-k[4]=1-1=0

So, "YES"

Another test case: [5,6,0,2,3,0]

n=6

a=[5,6,0,2,3,0]

k[2]=5

k[3]=6-2*5=6-10=-4 <0, invalid, "NO"

Seems correct.

So, the approach is:

- Set k[2] = a[1]

- For i from 3 to n-1:

k[i] = a[i-1] - 2*k[i-1] - (-k[i-2]) Wait, no.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, for k[3]=a[2]-2*k[2]

k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2*k[3]

Wait, I need to generalize this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the array and update the values as if applying the operations in reverse.

Here's an idea:

Start from the left, and for each position i from 1 to n-2:

Apply k[i] operations at position i+1, where k[i] = a[i]

Then update a[i+1] and a[i+2] accordingly.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think again.

From the earlier calculations, it seems that k[i] can be expressed in terms of a[i], and previous k[j].

I need to find a way to compute k[i] sequentially.

Looking back, in the first test case:

a=[1,3,5,5,2]

k[2]=1

k[3]=1

k[4]=2

Then check a[4]-k[3]-2*k[4]=0

And a[5]-k[4]=0

Similarly, in the second test case:

a=[2,4,4,5,1]

k[2]=2

k[3]=0

k[4]=2

Then a[4]-k[3]-2*k[4]=5-0-4=1 !=0

So, invalid.

This seems consistent.

Therefore, the algorithm can be:

For each test case:

Read n and a[1..n]

Initialize an array k[2..n-1]

Set k[2] = a[1]

For i from 3 to n-1:

k[i] = a[i-1] - 2*k[i-1]

if k[i] <0:

print "NO"

break

Else:

Compute the last two checks:

If a[n-1] - k[n-2] -2*k[n-1] !=0 or a[n] - k[n-1] !=0:

print "NO"

else:

print "YES"

This seems to match the earlier examples.

Let me test this with the first test case:

a=[1,3,5,5,2]

k[2]=1

k[3]=3-2*1=1

k[4]=5-2*1=3, but earlier I had k[4]=2, which is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the earlier manual calculation for the first test case:

k[2]=1

k[3]=1

k[4]=2

But according to this formula, k[3]=3-2*1=1, which is correct.

Then k[4]=a[3]-k[2]-2*k[3]=5-1-2=2, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier manual calculation, I had a[4]-k[3]-2*k[4]=5-1-4=0, which is correct.

So, the formula is:

For i from 2 to n-1:

k[i] = a[i-1] - k[i-1] -2*k[i]

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in
