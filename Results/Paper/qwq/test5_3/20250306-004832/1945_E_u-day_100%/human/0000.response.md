Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x in it using binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, which is a requirement for binary search to work correctly. However, I'm allowed to perform at most two swap operations on the permutation before running the binary search. After these swaps, the binary search should end up with p_l equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array that contains each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeat until the value is found or the interval is empty.

But in this problem, the array isn't sorted, and I can perform up to two swaps to make the binary search find the correct value x.

The problem also mentions that it can be shown that two swaps are always sufficient. That's an important hint. It means no matter how the permutation is arranged, I can always make the binary search work correctly with at most two swaps.

Let me try to understand how binary search works in this context. The algorithm is described as follows:

- Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

- While r - l != 1:

- Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

- After the loop, p_l should be equal to x.

Wait a second, this binary search looks a bit unusual. Typically, binary search stops when l >= r, and then checks if the element at l (or r-1) is the target.

In this version, it seems to stop when r - l = 1, which should be similar.

I need to ensure that after my swaps, when this binary search is run, p_l equals x.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to adjust the permutation so that the binary search path leads to the position of x.

Let me think about how binary search navigates through the array. Since the array is not sorted, the behavior of binary search is unpredictable, but I can try to make it predictable by swapping elements to create a path that leads to x.

One approach could be to simulate the binary search process and see where it ends up, then determine which swaps would adjust the array so that it lands on x.

Let's consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 6, x = 3

permutation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

In this case, the array is already sorted, so binary search should work directly without any swaps.

Let's simulate the binary search:

Initialize l = 0, r = 6

While r - l > 1:

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p_m = 4

Since 4 > 3, set r = 3

Now, l = 0, r = 3

m = floor((0 + 3)/2) = 1

p_m = 2

2 <= 3, so set l = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2

p_m = 3

3 <= 3, so set l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2

p_m = 3

3 <= 3, so set l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, so exit loop.

p_l = p_2 = 3, which is equal to x. So, no swaps are needed.

The output is 0.

That makes sense.

Another example:

n = 6, x = 5

permutation: [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Let's simulate binary search:

l = 0, r = 6

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3

p_m = 5

5 <= 5, set l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4

p_m = 2

2 <= 5, set l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5

p_m = 4

4 <= 5, set l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5

p_m = 4

4 <= 5, set l = 5

Now, r - l = 1, exit loop.

p_l = p_5 = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, we need to perform some swaps to make p_l = 5.

Looking at the positions:

- Position 5 has 2

- Position 4 has 2

Wait, no. Indices start at 0, so:

- p[0] = 3

- p[1] = 1

- p[2] = 6

- p[3] = 5

- p[4] = 2

- p[5] = 4

Wait, but in the code, it seems like indices start at 1, but in Python, lists are 0-indexed.

Wait, let's check the code.

In the code:

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, arr is 0-indexed, but when printing indices, it adds 1.

In the second test case:

n=6, x=5

arr = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

Looking for x=5.

Find position of 5: arr[3] = 5, so pos = 3

Perform binary search:

low = 0, high = 6

while 0 + 1 < 6:

mid = (0 + 6)//2 = 3

arr[3] = 5 <= 5, so low = 3

now low = 3, high = 6

3 + 1 < 6:

mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

arr[4] = 2 <=5, so low =4

now low=4, high=6

4 + 1 < 6:

mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

arr[5]=4 <=5, so low=5

now low=5, high=6

5 + 1 < 6:

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, so low=5

now low=5, high=6

exit loop

check arr[5] =4 !=5, so need to swap.

The code then prints 1 (one swap), and swaps positions low+1=6 and pos+1=4.

So, swap arr[5] and arr[3]:

Before: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

After: [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, let's see if binary search finds 5.

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=4 <=5, low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

exit loop

arr[5]=5 == x=5

Good, it works with one swap.

Another example:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

pos=4

binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

now low=0, high=1

exit loop

arr[0]=3 !=1

So, need to swap.

The code would swap low+1=1 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[0] and arr[4]:

Before: [3,5,4,2,1]

After: [1,5,4,2,3]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=1 <=1, low=0

exit loop

arr[0]=1 == x=1

Good, works with one swap.

Another example:

n=6, x=3

arr=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

pos=1 (since arr[1]=3)

binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >3, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=3, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=1 !=3

So, need to swap.

The code would swap low+1=3 and pos+1=2

Wait, pos=1 (since arr[1]=3)

So, swap 2 and 1+1=2

Wait, indices are off.

Wait, in the code:

if arr[low] !=k:

print(1)

print(low+1, pos+1)

So, low=2, pos=1

So, swap 3 and 2

Swap arr[2] and arr[1]:

Before: [4,3,1,5,2,6]

After: [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >3, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=3 == x=3

Good, works with one swap.

Last example:

n=3, x=2

arr=[3,2,1]

pos=1 (since arr[1]=2)

binary search:

low=0, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=1 !=2

So, need to swap.

The code would swap low+1=3 and pos+1=2

Swap arr[2] and arr[1]:

Before: [3,2,1]

After: [3,1,2]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=2, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=2 == x=2

Good, works with one swap.

From these examples, it seems like the code is working correctly.

But I need to make sure that this approach is correct in general.

The approach in the code is:

- Find the position of x in the permutation.

- Perform the binary search as described, and see where it ends up.

- If the value at the final low index is x, then no swaps are needed.

- If not, perform one swap between the final low index and the position of x.

- It seems that in all the examples, one swap is sufficient.

But the problem allows up to two swaps. Maybe in some cases, one swap isn't enough, and we need to perform two swaps.

But according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient.

However, in the code, it only performs at most one swap.

Is this code correct, or are there cases where one swap isn't enough?

Let me think about a case where one swap isn't sufficient.

Suppose we have:

n=4, x=2

arr=[4,3,1,2]

Position of 2 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+4)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=2, low=3

mid=(3+4)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=2, low=3

exit loop

arr[3]=2 == x=2

So, no swap needed.

Another case:

n=4, x=1

arr=[4,3,2,1]

Position of 1 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=2 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=4 >1, high=0

now low=0, high=1

exit loop

arr[0]=4 !=1

So, need to swap low+1=1 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[0] and arr[3]:

Before: [4,3,2,1]

After: [1,3,2,4]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=2 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=1 <=1, low=0

exit loop

arr[0]=1 == x=1

Works with one swap.

Seems fine.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try:

n=4, x=3

arr=[1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=3, low=1

exit loop

arr[1]=2 !=3

So, need to swap low+1=2 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[1] and arr[3]:

Before: [1,2,4,3]

After: [1,3,4,2]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

exit loop

arr[1]=3 == x=3

Works with one swap.

Still works.

Another case:

n=5, x=3

arr=[5,1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=4 >3, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=2 !=3

So, need to swap low+1=3 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[2] and arr[4]:

Before: [5,1,2,4,3]

After: [5,1,3,4,2]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=4 >3, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=3 == x=3

Works with one swap.

Still works.

Hmm.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try:

n=4, x=2

arr=[3,4,1,2]

Position of 2 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+4)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=2, low=3

exit loop

arr[3]=2 == x=2

No swap needed.

Another case:

n=4, x=1

arr=[2,3,4,1]

Position of 1 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=2 >1, high=0

low=0

arr[0]=2 !=1

So, swap low+1=1 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[0] and arr[3]:

Before: [2,3,4,1]

After: [1,3,4,2]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=1 <=1, low=0

exit loop

arr[0]=1 == x=1

Works with one swap.

Still works.

Hmm.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try:

n=5, x=3

arr=[5,4,2,1,3]

Position of 3 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=1 <=3, low=3

mid=(3+5)//2=4

arr[4]=3 <=3, low=4

exit loop

arr[4]=3 == x=3

No swap needed.

Another case:

n=5, x=4

arr=[1,2,3,5,4]

Position of 4 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=4, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >4, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=4, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=3 !=4

So, swap low+1=3 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[2] and arr[4]:

Before: [1,2,3,5,4]

After: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 <=4, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >4, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=4 <=4, low=2

exit loop

arr[2]=4 == x=4

Works with one swap.

Still works.

I'm starting to think that one swap is always sufficient, but the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient. Maybe in some cases, one swap isn't enough, and we need two swaps.

But in all the examples I've tried, one swap is enough.

Wait, maybe in some cases, one swap isn't enough.

Let me try:

n=4, x=2

arr=[3,1,4,2]

Position of 2 is 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 !=2

So, swap low+1=2 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[1] and arr[3]:

Before: [3,1,4,2]

After: [3,2,4,1]

Now, binary search:

low=0, high=4

arr[1]=2 == x=2

Works with one swap.

Still works.

Another case:

Position of 3 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=5 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1
