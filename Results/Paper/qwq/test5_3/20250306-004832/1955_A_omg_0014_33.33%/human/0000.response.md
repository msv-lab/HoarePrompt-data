Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of 'a' burles each, or buy two of them together under a promotion for 'b' burles. The goal is to find out the minimum amount of money Maxim needs to spend to get exactly n yogursts.

First, I need to understand the promotion. Buying two yogurts for 'b' burles might be cheaper than buying them individually for 'a' burles each. So, I need to compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs under the promotion versus buying them individually.

Let me think about how to approach this. If Maxim buys as many pairs as possible under the promotion, and then buys any remaining yogurt individually, that might be the cheapest way. But I need to make sure that the promotion price for two yogurts is actually cheaper than buying them individually.

Let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, 'a' is the price per yogurt, and 'b' is the price for two yogurts under the promotion.

I need to maximize the number of pairs I buy under the promotion, but only if it's cheaper than buying them individually.

Wait, actually, I need to minimize the total cost. So, I should buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion if the promotion price for two is cheaper than buying them individually.

Let me calculate the cost per yogurt under the promotion. If I buy two yogurts for 'b' burles, then the cost per yogurt would be b/2. So, if b/2 is less than 'a', then it's cheaper to buy them in pairs under the promotion.

So, for each pair of yogurts, if b/2 < a, then I should buy them as a pair under the promotion. If b/2 >= a, then it's better to buy them individually.

But, n might be odd, so there might be one yogurt left that has to be bought individually.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, calculate how many pairs can be bought: pairs = n // 2

Then, calculate the remaining yogurts: remaining = n % 2

Now, if b/2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion, and buy the remaining yogurts individually.

So, total cost = pairs * b + remaining * a

But, I need to check if buying in pairs is actually cheaper.

Wait, no. I need to compare the cost of buying all yogurts individually versus buying as many pairs as possible under the promotion and buying the remaining individually.

Also, perhaps there are other combinations. For example, maybe sometimes it's better to buy fewer pairs under the promotion and buy more individually, but I think that if b/2 < a, then it's always better to buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion.

Let me check with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

So, buying two yogurts under the promotion costs 9 burles, whereas buying them individually would cost 10 burles (5 each). So, 9 < 10, so it's better to buy them under the promotion.

Indeed, the output is 9.

Second test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

Buying one pair under the promotion: 9 burles

Buying the remaining yogurt individually: 5 burles

Total: 14 burles

Alternatively, buying all three individually: 15 burles

So, 14 < 15, so 14 is the minimum.

Third test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

Buying one pair under the promotion: 11 burles

Buying the remaining yogurt individually: 5 burles

Total: 16 burles

But the output is 15 burles, which is buying all three individually: 15 burles

Wait, but according to my logic, it should be 16 burles, but the output is 15 burles. So, my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, in this case, buying under the promotion is not cheaper because b/2 = 11/2 = 5.5, which is greater than a = 5. So, it's better to buy all individually: 3 * 5 = 15 burles.

But according to my previous logic, if b/2 >= a, then buy all individually.

But in the third test case, b/2 = 5.5 >= a = 5, so buy all individually: 15 burles.

But in the second test case, b/2 = 4.5 < a = 5, so buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion and the remaining individually: one pair for 9 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles, total 14 burles.

So, my initial approach seems correct, but I need to make sure that I'm handling the cases where b/2 >= a correctly.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 11

Buying two pairs under the promotion: 2 * 11 = 22 burles

Buying all individually: 4 * 5 = 20 burles

But the output is 20 burles, which matches buying individually.

Wait, according to my logic, if b/2 >= a, which is 11/2 = 5.5 >= 5, then buy all individually: 4 * 5 = 20 burles.

So, my approach seems consistent with the examples.

But in the third test case, b/2 = 5.5 >= a = 5, so buy all individually: 3 * 5 = 15 burles.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

Wait, but according to my calculation, buying two for 11 and one for 5 would be 16 burles, which is more than buying all three individually for 15 burles.

But the explanation seems to suggest that buying two for 11 and one for 5 is not better than buying all three individually for 15 burles.

Wait, but 16 > 15, so buying all individually is better, which matches my approach.

But in the second test case, buying two for 9 and one for 5 is 14, which is less than buying all three individually for 15.

So, my approach seems correct.

Wait, but in the third test case, b = 11, a = 5, n = 3

If I buy one pair for 11 and one individually for 5, total 16

Buying all three individually: 3 * 5 = 15

So, 15 < 16, so buy all individually.

But in the explanation, it says "buy three yogurts for 15 burles", which matches buying individually.

But the explanation also says "buy two for 11 and one for 5", which would be 16, which is more than 15.

So, my approach seems correct.

Another way to think about it is to calculate the minimum cost by considering the number of pairs bought under the promotion and the remaining bought individually.

So, for n yogurts, the number of pairs can range from 0 to n//2, and the remaining yogurts are n - 2*pairs.

Then, total cost = pairs * b + remaining * a

I need to find the minimum over all possible values of pairs.

But since buying pairs under the promotion is cheaper per yogurt if b/2 < a, then buying as many pairs as possible under the promotion and the remaining individually would be the cheapest.

But, in cases where b/2 >= a, it's better to buy all individually.

So, the general approach is:

if b/2 < a:

total_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

else:

total_cost = n * a

This should give the minimum cost.

Let me verify this with the test cases.

First test case:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

b/2 = 4.5 < 5, so buy one pair: 9 burles

Second test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

b/2 = 4.5 < 5, so buy one pair and one individual: 9 + 5 = 14 burles

Third test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

b/2 = 5.5 >= 5, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Fourth test case:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 11

b/2 = 5.5 >= 5, so buy all individually: 20 burles

Which matches the example outputs.

So, this seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

d = c / 2

if a * b < a * d:

print(a * b)

else:

print(round(a * d))

Wait, there are a few issues here.

First, in the function, the variables are named differently than in the problem description.

In the problem, n is the number of yogurts, a is the price per yogurt, b is the promotion price for two yogurts.

In the function, n is the number of test cases, and in the loop, (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

So, a is n (number of yogurts), b is a (price per yogurt), c is b (promotion price for two yogurts).

So, a is n, b is a, c is b.

Then, d = c / 2

So, d = promotion price per yogurt.

Then, if a * b < a * d:

print(a * b)

else:

print(round(a * d))

Wait, a is n, b is a, c is b.

So, a * b = n * a, which is the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

a * d = n * (c / 2) = n * (promotion price per yogurt)

But, this doesn't make much sense because the promotion is for pairs of yogurts, not per yogurt.

Moreover, round(a * d) would be rounding the total cost if all yogurts were bought at the promotion price per yogurt, but that's not how the promotion works.

The promotion is for pairs of yogurts, not per yogurt.

So, this approach is incorrect.

The correct approach should be:

if b / 2 < a:

total_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

else:

total_cost = n * a

But in the given function, it's comparing n * a with n * (b / 2), which is not the same.

Because n * (b / 2) would be the cost if all yogurts were bought in pairs under the promotion, which is not possible if n is odd.

Moreover, even if n is even, comparing n * a with n * (b / 2) is not the same as comparing a with b / 2.

Because n * (b / 2) = (n / 2) * b, which is the cost of buying n/2 pairs under the promotion.

But in the function, it's comparing n * a with n * (b / 2), and choosing the minimum, but then rounding the second one.

This is not correct.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

So, a * b = 2 * 5 = 10

a * d = 2 * (9 / 2) = 9

So, 10 > 9, so print round(9) = 9, which is correct.

Second test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (9 / 2) = 13.5, round to 14

So, 15 > 14, so print 14

But according to the correct approach, it should be 14 burles, which matches.

Third test case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (11 / 2) = 16.5, round to 17

So, 15 < 17, so print 15

But according to the correct approach, it should be 15 burles, which matches.

Fourth test case:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 11

a * b = 20

a * d = 4 * (11 / 2) = 22, round to 22

So, 20 < 22, so print 20, which matches.

So, in these examples, it seems to give the correct output.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let's consider another case.

Suppose n = 4, a = 5, b = 8

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 4 < a = 5, so buy two pairs under the promotion: 2 * 8 = 16 burles

Alternatively, buying individually: 4 * 5 = 20 burles

So, minimum is 16 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 4 * 5 = 20

a * d = 4 * (8 / 2) = 16

20 > 16, so print round(16) = 16, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 10

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 5 = a, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Alternatively, buy one pair under the promotion and one individually: 10 + 5 = 15 burles

So, total is 15 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (10 / 2) = 15, round to 15

15 == 15, so print 15, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 4.5 < a = 5, so buy two pairs under the promotion and one individually: 2 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 18 + 5 = 23 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 25 burles

So, minimum is 23 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 25

a * d = 5 * (9 / 2) = 22.5, round to 23

So, 25 > 23, print 23, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 4, b = 7

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 3.5 < a = 4, so buy two pairs under the promotion and one individually: 2 * 7 + 1 * 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 20 burles

So, minimum is 18 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 5 * (7 / 2) = 17.5, round to 18

So, 20 > 18, print 18, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 3, b = 6

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 3 = a, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under the promotion and one individually: 2 * 6 + 1 * 3 = 12 + 3 = 15 burles

So, total is 15 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 5 * (6 / 2) = 15, round to 15

15 == 15, print 15, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 3, b = 5

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 2.5 < a = 3, so buy two pairs under the promotion and one individually: 2 * 5 + 1 * 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 15 burles

So, minimum is 13 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 5 * (5 / 2) = 12.5, round to 13

So, 15 > 13, print 13, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 6, a = 4, b = 7

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 3.5 < a = 4, so buy three pairs under the promotion: 3 * 7 = 21 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 24 burles

So, minimum is 21 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 24

a * d = 6 * (7 / 2) = 21, round to 21

So, 24 > 21, print 21, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 6, a = 4, b = 8

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 4 = a, so buy all individually: 24 burles

Alternatively, buy three pairs under the promotion: 24 burles

So, total is 24 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 24

a * d = 6 * (8 / 2) = 24, round to 24

So, 24 == 24, print 24, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 7, a = 5, b = 9

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 4.5 < a = 5, so buy three pairs under the promotion and one individually: 3 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 35 burles

So, minimum is 32 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 35

a * d = 7 * (9 / 2) = 31.5, round to 32

So, 35 > 32, print 32, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 7, a = 5, b = 10

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 5 = a, so buy all individually: 35 burles

Alternatively, buy three pairs under the promotion and one individually: 3 * 10 + 1 * 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 burles

So, total is 35 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 35

a * d = 7 * (10 / 2) = 35, round to 35

So, 35 == 35, print 35, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 7, a = 5, b = 11

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 5.5 >= a = 5, so buy all individually: 35 burles

Alternatively, buy three pairs under the promotion and one individually: 3 * 11 + 1 * 5 = 33 + 5 = 38 burles

So, minimum is 35 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 35

a * d = 7 * (11 / 2) = 38.5, round to 39

So, 35 < 39, print 35, which is correct.

Wait, but according to the correct approach, it's 35, and the function also prints 35, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 1, a = 5, b = 9

According to the correct approach:

Can't buy a pair, so buy individually: 5 burles

According to the given function:

a * b = 5

a * d = 1 * (9 / 2) = 4.5, round to 5

So, 5 < 5, print 5, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 0, a = 5, b = 9

Wait, n starts from 1 according to the problem, so n >=1.

But according to the problem, 1 <= n <= 100, so n=1 is possible.

Another case:

n = 4, a = 3, b = 6

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 3 = a, so buy all individually: 12 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under the promotion: 2 * 6 = 12 burles

So, total is 12 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 12

a * d = 4 * (6 / 2) = 12, round to 12

So, 12 == 12, print 12, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 4, a = 3, b = 5

According to the correct approach:

b / 2 = 2.5 < a = 3, so buy two pairs under the promotion: 2 * 5 = 10 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 12 burles

So, minimum is 10 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 12

a * d = 4 * (5 / 2) = 10, round to 10

So, 12 > 10, print 10, which is correct.

Seems like in all these cases, the given function produces the correct output.

But is there any case where it would fail?

Let me think about when n is odd and b / 2 < a.

For example:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

According to the correct approach: buy one pair under promotion and one individually: 9 + 5 = 14 burles

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 13.5, round to 14

So, matches.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

Correct approach: buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 18 + 5 = 23 burles

Given function: a * b = 25, a * d = 22.5, round to 23

Matches.

Wait, but in the third test case of the example, n=3, a=5, b=11

Correct approach: buy all individually: 15 burles

Given function: a * b = 15, a * d = 16.5, round to 17, but it prints 15 because 15 < 17

Wait, in the earlier analysis, I thought a * d was 16.5, round to 17, but in the example, it prints 15.

Wait, no, in the third test case, according to the given function:

a * b = 3 * 5 = 15

a * d = 3 * (11 / 2) = 16.5, round to 17

So, 15 < 17, so print 15, which matches the correct approach.

So, it seems correct.

But let's consider a case where b is even.

For example:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 10

Correct approach: b / 2 = 5 = a, so buy all individually: 20 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under promotion: 2 * 10 = 20 burles

So, total is 20 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 4 * (10 / 2) = 20, round to 20

So, 20 == 20, print 20, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 10

Correct approach: b / 2 = 5 = a, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Alternatively, buy one pair under promotion and one individually: 10 + 5 = 15 burles

So, total is 15 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (10 / 2) = 15, round to 15

So, 15 == 15, print 15, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 10

Correct approach: b / 2 = 5 = a, so buy individually: 10 burles

Alternatively, buy one pair under promotion: 10 burles

So, total is 10 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 10

a * d = 2 * (10 / 2) = 10, round to 10

So, 10 == 10, print 10, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 8

Correct approach: b / 2 = 4 < a = 5, so buy one pair under promotion: 8 burles

Alternatively, buy individually: 10 burles

So, total is 8 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 10

a * d = 2 * (8 / 2) = 8, round to 8

So, 10 > 8, print 8, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 1, a = 5, b = 9

Correct approach: can't buy a pair, so buy individually: 5 burles

According to the given function:

a * b = 5

a * d = 1 * (9 / 2) = 4.5, round to 5

So, 5 < 5, print 5, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 0, but n >=1, so not necessary to consider.

Wait, according to the problem, 1 <= n <= 100, so n=0 is not possible.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 4, b = 8

Correct approach: b / 2 = 4 = a, so buy all individually: 20 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 16 + 4 = 20 burles

So, total is 20 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 5 * (8 / 2) = 20, round to 20

So, 20 == 20, print 20, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 4, b = 7

Correct approach: b / 2 = 3.5 < a = 4, so buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 14 + 4 = 18 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 20 burles

So, total is 18 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 5 * (7 / 2) = 17.5, round to 18

So, 20 > 18, print 18, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but is there any case where rounding could cause an issue?

Let's consider:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 12

Correct approach: b / 2 = 6 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Alternatively, buy one pair under promotion and one individually: 12 + 5 = 17 burles

So, total is 15 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (12 / 2) = 18, round to 18

So, 15 < 18, print 15, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 3, a = 5, b = 13

Correct approach: b / 2 = 6.5 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 15 burles

Alternatively, buy one pair under promotion and one individually: 13 + 5 = 18 burles

So, total is 15 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 15

a * d = 3 * (13 / 2) = 19.5, round to 20

So, 15 < 20, print 15, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 14

Correct approach: b / 2 = 7 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 20 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under promotion: 2 * 14 = 28 burles

So, total is 20 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 4 * (14 / 2) = 28, round to 28

So, 20 < 28, print 20, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 15

Correct approach: b / 2 = 7.5 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 25 burles

Alternatively, buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 30 + 5 = 35 burles

So, total is 25 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 25

a * d = 5 * (15 / 2) = 37.5, round to 38

So, 25 < 38, print 25, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 6, a = 5, b = 16

Correct approach: b / 2 = 8 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 30 burles

Alternatively, buy three pairs under promotion: 48 burles

So, total is 30 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 30

a * d = 6 * (16 / 2) = 48, round to 48

So, 30 < 48, print 30, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 7, a = 5, b = 17

Correct approach: b / 2 = 8.5 > a = 5, so buy all individually: 35 burles

Alternatively, buy three pairs under promotion and one individually: 51 + 5 = 56 burles

So, total is 35 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 35

a * d = 7 * (17 / 2) = 59.5, round to 60

So, 35 < 60, print 35, which is correct.

Seems like in all these cases, the given function produces the correct output.

But is there any case where it would fail?

Let me consider a case where b is less than 2 * a, but not significantly.

For example:

n = 4, a = 5, b = 9

Correct approach: b / 2 = 4.5 < a = 5, so buy two pairs under promotion: 18 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 20 burles

So, total is 18 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 20

a * d = 4 * (9 / 2) = 18, round to 18

So, 20 > 18, print 18, which is correct.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

Correct approach: buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 18 + 5 = 23 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 25 burles

So, total is 23 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 25

a * d = 5 * (9 / 2) = 22.5, round to 23

So, 25 > 23, print 23, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, a * d = 22.5, which rounds to 23, but the actual cost using the correct approach is 23 burles.

But what if a * d is 22.5 and a * b is 25, so print 23, which matches the correct approach.

Seems fine.

Another case:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 8

Correct approach: b / 2 = 4 < a = 5, so buy two pairs under promotion and one individually: 16 + 5 = 21 burles

Alternatively, buy all individually: 25 burles

So, total is 21 burles.

According to the given function:

a * b = 25

a * d = 5 * (8 / 2) = 20, round to 20

So, 25 > 20, print 20

But according to the correct approach, it's 21 burles.

Wait, but the function prints 20, which is less than the correct approach.

But according to the correct approach, it should be 21 burles.

So, in this case, the function is printing 20, which is less than the actual minimum cost of 21 burles.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the function is incorrect in this case.

Wait, let's recast the correct approach.

Buy two pairs under promotion: 2 * 8 = 16 burles

Buy one individually: 5 burles

Total: 21 burles

But the function is calculating a * d = 5 * (8 / 2) = 20 burles, which is less than 21 burles.

But according to the function, it would print 20 burles, but actually, it's not possible to buy 5 yogurts for 20 burles under the promotion.

Because the promotion is for pairs only.

So, the function is incorrect in this case.

It's suggesting a cost of 20 burles, but the actual minimum is 21 burles.

So, the function is flawed.

It incorrectly calculates the cost by assuming that all yogurts can be bought at the promotion price per yogurt, which is not possible since the promotion is only for pairs.

So, in this case, the function would output 20 burles, but the actual minimum cost is 21 burles.

Hence, the function is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
