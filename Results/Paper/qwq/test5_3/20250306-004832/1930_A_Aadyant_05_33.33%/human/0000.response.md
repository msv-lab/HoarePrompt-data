Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about this. If I have, say, n=1, so 2 numbers, I just pair them up and add the smaller one to my score. That seems straightforward.

But for larger n, I need to pair up 2n numbers into n pairs, and for each pair, I add the smaller number to the score. I need to do this in a way that the total score is as large as possible.

I should consider how to pair the numbers to maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair.

One idea is to sort the numbers in ascending order. Let's say I have the numbers sorted: a1, a2, a3, ..., a2n.

Now, I need to group them into pairs. If I pair them consecutively after sorting, like (a1, a2), (a3, a4), ..., (a(2n-1), a2n), then for each pair, the smaller number is the first one in the pair since the list is sorted.

So, the sum of the minimums would be a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a(2n-1).

But is this the maximum possible sum?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think about an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

So, n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1.

If I sort them: 1,1,1,2.

Pair them as (1,1) and (1,2). Sum of minimums is 1 + 1 = 2.

Which matches the output in the example.

Another test case:

n=3, numbers are all 1s: 1,1,1,1,1,1.

Sum of minimums would be 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, again matching the example.

And for n=1, numbers 2 and 3: pair them as (2,3), sum of minimums is 2.

Seems consistent.

But is this always optimal?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,4.

Sort them: 1,2,3,4.

Pair them as (1,2) and (3,4). Sum of minimums is 1 + 3 = 4.

Is there a better pairing?

If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), sum of minimums is 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 4.

If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), sum of minimums is 1 + 2 = 3, again less than 4.

So, pairing consecutive numbers after sorting seems to give a higher sum.

Another example: n=3, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sort them: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pair them as (1,2), (3,4), (5,6). Sum of minimums is 1+3+5=9.

Is there a better pairing?

If I pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), sum is 1+2+5=8, which is less than 9.

If I pair (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), sum is 1+2+3=6, worse.

So, pairing consecutive numbers after sorting seems optimal.

But why?

Let me try to reason this.

When I sort the numbers, I have a1 <= a2 <= ... <= a2n.

If I pair a1 with a2, a3 with a4, and so on, the sum of minimums is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a(2n-1).

Is there any other pairing where this sum would be larger?

Suppose I pair a1 with a3, then a2 with a4, and so on.

Sum would be a1 + a2 + a4 + ... .

Wait, in this case, for n=2, it would be a1 + a2, which is less than a1 + a3.

Similarly, for n=3, it would be a1 + a2 + a4, which is less than a1 + a3 + a5.

So, pairing consecutive numbers after sorting seems to maximize the sum of minimums.

I think this is because by pairing consecutive numbers, I'm ensuring that the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest possible numbers, thus maximizing the minimum in each pair.

Alternatively, if I pair a small number with a large number, the minimum in that pair is the small number, which might be included in another pair with a larger number.

But in the consecutive pairing, I'm making sure that the minimums are as large as possible.

So, I believe that sorting the list and pairing consecutive numbers will give the maximum sum of minimums.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

num = input()

out = []

for numbers in range(int(num)):

list2 = []

list1 = []

a = input()

a = int(a)

b = input('')

list1 = b.split()

list1.sort()

for i in range(a):

list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))

out.append(sum(list2))

del list1[:]

del list2[:]

for outputs in out:

print(outputs)

Let's see what this program is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- It reads n.

- Reads a line containing 2n integers.

- Splits them into a list, sorts the list.

- Then, it iterates from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it takes list1[2*i], which is the i-th smallest number in the sorted list (since list1 is 0-indexed).

- Adds these n smallest numbers to list2.

- Sums list2 and appends the sum to out.

- Finally, prints each sum in out for each test case.

Wait a minute.

In the sorted list, list1[0], list1[2], list1[4], ..., list1[2*(n-1)] are being added to list2.

But in the sorted list, list1[0] is the smallest, list1[1] is the next smallest, and so on.

So, list2 is containing the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., (2n-1)th smallest numbers.

Which is exactly what I thought earlier: a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a(2n-1).

And according to my earlier reasoning, this seems to be the optimal sum.

In the examples provided, this approach gives the correct output.

So, I believe this program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
