Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she bought less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the amount Bob pays her minus the amount she spends buying the items. Alice wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to calculate Alice's profit when both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics.

1. Alice chooses a subset S of items to buy.

2. If |S| < k, Bob takes all items in S for free. So, Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S), since she spends money but gets nothing back.

3. If |S| >= k, Bob takes k items for free and pays for the remaining |S| - k items. So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items Bob takes for free.

Bob, wanting to minimize Alice's profit, will choose the k items to take for free in a way that minimizes the profit Alice gets. That means he'll choose the k items with the smallest b_i, because those are the ones that would contribute the least to Alice's profit if he takes them for free.

Wait, actually, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he wants to minimize sum(b_i for i in S - T). To minimize this, he should choose the k items with the largest b_i to take for free, because that leaves Alice with the smallest possible sum of b_i for the remaining items.

Wait, no. If Bob takes the k items with the largest b_i for free, then the remaining items have smaller b_i, which would decrease the sum Bob pays Alice, thus decreasing Alice's profit. So yes, Bob should take the k items with the largest b_i for free.

So, in the case where |S| >= k, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum of the k largest b_i in S - sum(a_i for i in S).

Wait, no. Bob takes k items for free, specifically the ones with the largest b_i, to minimize Alice's profit. So, Alice's profit would be sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items with the largest b_i in S.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for i in T) - sum(a_i for i in S).

Which simplifies to sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for i in T).

But T contains the k items with the largest b_i in S.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think differently.

If Alice chooses a subset S of size m:

- If m < k, her profit is -sum(a_i for i in S).

- If m >= k, her profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum of the k largest b_i in S - sum(a_i for i in S).

Wait, no. If Bob takes the k items with the largest b_i for free, then Alice gets sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items with the largest b_i in S.

So, her profit is sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S).

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

Bob, to minimize Alice's profit, will choose T to minimize sum(b_i for i in S - T), which means choosing T to have the largest b_i in S.

So, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum of the k largest b_i in S - sum(a_i for i in S).

Which is equivalent to sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the k largest b_i in S).

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to frame this.

Let me consider the difference b_i - a_i.

If b_i - a_i > 0, it means Alice can make a profit on that item by selling it to Bob after buying it.

If b_i - a_i < 0, it means Alice loses money on that item.

But Bob can take up to k items for free, choosing the ones that minimize Alice's profit.

I need to think about how to optimally choose S to maximize profit, considering Bob's action.

Perhaps it's better to sort the items based on b_i in descending order.

Because Bob will take the top k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, if Alice selects S, Bob will take the k items in S with the highest b_i for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S).

To maximize this, Alice wants to select S such that the sum of b_i for S - T is as large as possible, and sum of a_i for S is as small as possible.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of selecting items where b_i - a_i is positive, but considering that Bob will take away the highest b_i items for free.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the net profit for each item:

If Alice selects an item, her cost is a_i, and her revenue is b_i if Bob doesn't take it for free.

But Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, for the items with the top k b_i in S, Alice doesn't get b_i from them.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the top k b_i in S).

This can be rewritten as -sum(a_i for i in S) + sum(b_i for i in S - T).

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S of size m.

- If m < k, her profit is -sum(a_i for i in S).

- If m >= k, her profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum of the k largest b_i in S - sum(a_i for i in S).

Wait, that seems redundant.

Wait, if m >= k, Bob takes the k items with the largest b_i in S for free, so Alice gets sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items in S with the largest b_i.

So, her profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum of the k largest b_i in S - sum(a_i for i in S).

Which is sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the k largest b_i in S).

This still seems messy.

Maybe I can consider that Alice can choose to not select some items, especially those with high a_i or low b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the items sorted by b_i in descending order.

Let's sort the items by b_i from highest to lowest.

Then, Bob will take the first k items in S for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the first k items in S).

Which is -sum(a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the first k items in S).

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, sum(b_i - a_i for i in S) is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum(a_i for i in S).

Then, sum(b_i for the first k items in S) is the sum of the k largest b_i in S.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum(a_i for i in S) - sum(b_i for the top k b_i in S).

Which simplifies to -sum(a_i for i in S) + sum(b_i for i in S - T).

This seems to be the same as above.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to buy items and sell them to Bob, but Bob can take up to k items for free, choosing the ones that minimize Alice's profit.

Perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset S of items, and then subtracting the cost a_i for each item in S, and adding b_i for the items in S that are not in the top k b_i in S.

This seems similar to what I had before.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting items where b_i - a_i is positive, but ensuring that the k items with the highest b_i are not all high b_i items.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the example to get some intuition.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=0

a=[2,1]

b=[1,2]

If Alice selects no items, her profit is 0.

If she selects item 1, profit is -2 +1 = -1

If she selects item 2, profit is -1 +2 =1

So, the maximum profit is 1.

In the second test case:

n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,1,4]

b=[3,3,2,3]

Possible selections:

- Select 1 item: profit is -a_i +0 (since k=1, Bob takes it for free)

  So, profits: -1, -2, -1, -4

- Select 2 items: say items 1 and 2, Bob takes the one with highest b_i, which is either item 1 or 2 (both have b=3).

  Suppose he takes item 1, then Alice gets b_2 - a_1 - a_2 = 3 -1 -2 =0

  Or takes item 2, gets b_1 - a_1 -a_2 =3 -1 -2=0

- Select 3 items: say 1,2,3

  Bob takes the one with highest b_i, which is item 1 or 2 (b=3)

  If he takes item 1, profit is b_2 +b_3 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3 =3 +2 -1 -2 -1=1

  If he takes item 2, same thing.

- Select 4 items: items 1,2,3,4

  Bob takes one with highest b_i, say item 1 or 2 or 4 (all b=3)

  Profit: sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S)

  = (3 +2 +3) - (1 +2 +1 +4) =8 - 8=0

So, the maximum profit is 1.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1, which matches one of the selections.

But in the explanation, it says Alice should buy items 1,2,3 and Bob takes item 1 for free, profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1)=1.

Wait, but according to my calculation, if she selects items 1,2,3, and Bob takes item 1 for free, profit is b_2 + b_3 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3=3+2 -1-2-1=1.

Similarly, if Bob takes item 2 for free, profit is b_1 + b_3 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3=3+2 -1-2-1=1.

If he takes item 3 for free, profit is b_1 + b_2 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3=3+3 -1-2-1=2.

Wait, but according to the problem, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he would choose to take item 3 for free, which gives profit 2.

But in the explanation, it says Bob could take item 2 for free, giving profit 1.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood.

Wait, the problem says Bob chooses which k items to take for free.

So, Bob will choose the k items that maximize his benefit, which means minimizing Alice's profit.

In this case, he would take the item with the highest b_i, which is item 1 or 2 or 4, all have b=3.

So, if he takes item 1 for free, profit is b_2 + b_3 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3=3+2 -1-2-1=1

If he takes item 2 for free, profit is b_1 + b_3 - a_1 -a_2 -a_3=3+2 -1-2-1=1

If he takes item 4 for free, profit is b_1 + b_2 - a_1 -a_2 -a_4=3+3 -1-2-4= -1

So, Bob would choose to take item 4 for free, giving Alice a profit of -1.

But in the explanation, it says the profit is 1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps Bob cannot choose which items to take for free; maybe he has to take the k items with the highest b_i.

But the problem says "Bob chooses which k items it will be".

So, Bob will choose the k items that minimize Alice's profit.

In this case, to minimize Alice's profit, he should take the items that have the highest b_i, because that reduces the sum Bob has to pay.

Wait, no. If Bob takes items with high b_i for free, then Alice's profit from those items is zero, but it reduces the sum she gets from the remaining items.

Wait, in the second test case, if Bob takes item 4 for free (b=3), then Alice's profit is b1 + b2 + b3 - a1 - a2 - a3 - a4 =3 +3 +2 -1 -2 -1 -4= -1

If he takes item 1 and item 4 for free, but k=1, so only one item.

Wait, k=1.

So, Bob takes one item for free, either item1, item2, or item4, all with b=3.

If he takes item1 for free, profit is b2 + b3 - a1 -a2 -a3=3 +2 -1 -2 -1=1

If he takes item2 for free, same as above.

If he takes item4 for free, profit is b1 + b2 - a1 -a2 -a4=3 +3 -1 -2 -4= -1

So, Bob will choose to take item4 for free, to minimize Alice's profit to -1.

But in the explanation, it says profit is1, but according to this, it seems it should be -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Bob cannot choose which item to take for free; maybe it's the k items with the highest b_i.

But the problem says "Bob chooses which k items it will be", meaning he can choose any k items, not necessarily the ones with the highest b_i.

But in this case, he can choose to take the item with highest b_i to minimize Alice's profit.

Wait, no, to minimize Alice's profit, he should take the items that make her profit as small as possible.

So, in the second test case, taking item4 for free gives Alice profit -1, while taking item1 or item2 for free gives her profit1.

So, Bob would choose to take item4 for free, making Alice's profit -1.

But in the sample output, it's1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free;

otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i-th item."

So, in the second test case, Alice selects items1,2,3,4.

Bob chooses to take one item for free (k=1).

He can choose any one item to take for free.

To minimize Alice's profit, he should choose the item that maximizes the sum of b_i for the remaining items.

Wait, no, to minimize Alice's profit, he should choose the item whose b_i is highest among the ones Alice selected.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items Bob doesn't take) - sum(a_i for all items Alice bought).

So, to minimize this, Bob should minimize sum(b_i for items not taken).

Therefore, he should take the item with the highest b_i among the selected items.

In this case, items1,2,4 have b=3, item3 has b=2.

So, Bob will take item1 or item2 or item4 for free, say item1.

Then, Alice's profit is b2 + b3 + b4 - a1 -a2 -a3 -a4=3 +2 +3 -1 -2 -1 -4=1 +2 +3 -1 -2 -1 -4=6 - 8= -2.

Wait, earlier calculation was different.

Wait, no: 3 + 2 + 3 =8, minus 1 + 2 +1 +4=8, so profit0.

Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the second test case, sample output is1.

But according to this, it should be -1 or0.

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to model this more formally.

Let S be the set of items Alice selects.

If |S| < k, Bob takes all items in S for free, so Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S).

If |S| >=k, Bob takes k items with the highest b_i in S for free, and pays b_i for the remaining items in S.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items in S with the highest b_i.

Our goal is to choose S to maximize this profit.

To maximize sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S), which is equivalent to sum(b_i - a_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can consider sorting the items based on b_i - a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the items where b_i - a_i >0.

If b_i - a_i >0, Alice wants to include them to maximize profit.

But Bob will take the items with highest b_i, which might include those with high b_i - a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the items in decreasing order of b_i, and then select a subset S such that the sum of b_i - a_i for S minus the sum of the top k b_i in S is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over possible sizes of S starting from k to n, and for each size, select the top items based on some criteria.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the items in decreasing order of b_i, and then for each possible m from k to n, select the top m items in terms of b_i, and compute the profit accordingly.

Wait, but Bob will take the top k items in S for free.

So, if I select m items, the profit would be sum(b_i - a_i for the m items) - sum of the top k b_i in those m items.

This seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to buy items and sell them to Bob, but Bob can take up to k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for items in S) minus sum of the top k b_i in S.

So, profit = sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum of top k b_i in S.

Which is equal to -sum(a_i for S) + sum(b_i for S - T), where T is the top k b_i in S.

This seems consistent with what I had before.

Now, I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems difficult.

Maybe I can consider selecting items in a certain order.

Let me try to sort the items based on some criterion.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for a given m (size of S), the top m items have the highest b_i.

Bob will take the top k among them, which are the top k in terms of b_i.

So, Alice's profit would be sum(b_i - a_i for the m items) - sum of the top k b_i among them.

Which is sum(b_i - a_i for the m items) - sum of the top k b_i among them.

This can be rewritten as sum(b_i - a_i for the m items excluding the top k b_i) - sum(a_i for the top k b_i).

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the items are sorted in decreasing order of b_i.

Let's say the items are ordered such that b1 >= b2 >= ... >= bn.

Then, for any subset S of size m >=k, Bob will take the first k items in S (since they have the highest b_i).

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for the remaining m -k items) - sum(a_i for the first k items).

Wait, no.

Wait, Bob takes the top k items in S for free, which are the first k items in the sorted list.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for the last m -k items) - sum(a_i for the first k items).

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, let's think.

If S contains the top m items sorted by b_i, then Bob takes the top k items in S, which are the first k items in the sorted list.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for the last m -k items) - sum(a_i for the first k items).

Which is sum(b_i for the last m -k items) - sum(a_i for all m items).

Because sum(b_i - a_i for last m -k items) is sum(b_i - a_i for last m -k items), and sum(a_i for first k items) is already included in sum(a_i for all m items).

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's total cost is sum(a_i for all m items).

Bob pays for the m -k items that are not taken for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for m -k items) - sum(a_i for m items).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, since the items are sorted by b_i in decreasing order, the last m -k items are the ones with the lowest b_i in S.

So, to maximize the profit, Alice wants m -k items with highest possible b_i, but since they are sorted in decreasing order, the last m -k items have the lowest b_i.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I need to select m items in a way that the sum of b_i for the last m -k items is maximized.

Wait, but since the items are sorted in decreasing order of b_i, the last m -k items have the smallest b_i in S.

So, to maximize sum(b_i for last m -k items), Alice wants to select S such that the smallest b_i in S are as large as possible.

Which means selecting the top m items in terms of b_i.

Wait, but in that case, the last m -k items would still have larger b_i than items not in S.

So, perhaps selecting the top m items in terms of b_i is the way to go.

But in the second test case, selecting items1,2,3 gives m=3, k=1.

Bob takes item1 for free (b=3), and Alice gets b2 + b3 - a1 -a2 -a3=3 +2 -1 -2 -1=1.

If she selects items1,2,4, m=3, k=1.

Bob takes item1 for free, profit is b2 + b4 - a1 -a2 -a4=3 +3 -1 -2 -4= -1.

So, selecting items1,2,3 is better than selecting items1,2,4.

So, perhaps Alice should select the m items with the highest b_i - a_i.

Wait, but in this case, item3 has b - a =2 -1=1, item4 has3 -4= -1.

So, item3 has positive b - a, item4 has negative.

So, maybe selecting items with positive b - a is better.

But in the second test case, items1:3-1=2, item2:3-2=1, item3:2-1=1, item4:3-4= -
