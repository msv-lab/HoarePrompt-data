Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework launch installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The task is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time. Since both installations start at the same time, their launch schedules are periodic with periods 'a' and 'b' respectively.

Let's think about the launch times:

- For the first installation: a, 2a, 3a, ..., up to some maximum time.

- For the second installation: b, 2b, 3b, ..., up to the same maximum time.

Each firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

I need to find a time when the number of overlapping visibility periods is maximized.

One approach is to consider the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at a certain time and find the time when their combined visibility is maximum.

Let's consider a specific time t. The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time t is the number of launch times t' where t' <= t <= t' + m, which is equivalent to t - m <= t' <= t.

Since t' is a multiple of a, t' = k*a for some integer k >=1.

So, the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time t is the number of k such that t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's the number of l such that t - m <= l*b <= t.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these two counts.

To maximize this sum, I need to choose t such that both counts are as large as possible.

But since a and b are generally different, finding such a t isn't straightforward.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the possible overlaps.

Each firework from the first installation covers an interval of m + 1 minutes.

Similarly, each firework from the second installation covers an interval of m + 1 minutes.

I need to find the time when the most of these intervals overlap.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a mathematical way to find the maximum number without iterating through all possible times.

Let me think about the frequency of launches.

The first installation launches every 'a' minutes, so the number of fireworks it launches in a given time frame is roughly time_frame / a.

Similarly, the second installation launches roughly time_frame / b fireworks in the same time frame.

But since each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes, the number of visible fireworks at any time depends on how many of these launches have fireworks still visible.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of visible fireworks by considering how many launches from each installation have fireworks visible at the same time.

Let me try to calculate for one installation first.

For the first installation, launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., and each firework is visible from t to t + m.

So, at any time t, the number of visible fireworks from the first installation is the number of launches k*a where t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly for the second installation.

But this seems similar to what I thought earlier.

Maybe I need to find a common time t where both counts are maximized.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, to find when both installations launch at the same time, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, if both installations launch at the same time, then their fireworks will overlap.

But given that a and b could be different, their launch times may or may not coincide.

I need to find a time t where the number of visible fireworks from both installations is maximized.

Let me consider that each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes.

Wait, the problem says "visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., from x to x + m inclusive."

So, the duration of visibility is m + 1 minutes.

But in the problem statement, it's mentioned as "visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., from x to x + m inclusive."

Wait, if x is the launch time, and it's visible from x to x + m inclusive, that's a total of m + 1 minutes.

So, the duration is m + 1 minutes.

Now, to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time, I need to find a time t where the sum of fireworks visible from both installations is maximized.

Let me consider the number of fireworks visible from the first installation at time t.

This would be the number of k such that t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the total visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these two counts.

I need to maximize this sum over all possible t.

This seems like a problem that can be solved by calculating the density of launches within a window of m minutes.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate for each installation the maximum number of launches whose fireworks are visible at some time t, and then sum these for both installations.

But I need to consider if there's any overlap in their launch schedules.

Wait, maybe I can calculate for each installation the number of launches whose fireworks are visible at time t, and then find the t that maximizes the sum.

But iterating over all possible t isn't feasible because t can be up to some large value.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the launch times modulo the periods.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a line with events (launches) and their visibility intervals, and find the time with the maximum overlap.

This sounds like a classic interval scheduling problem, where I need to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

But with two different installations, each with their own launch schedules, it might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can list all the launch times for both installations up to some time, and then for each launch time, consider the intervals during which their fireworks are visible, and find the time with the maximum overlap.

But with a, b, and m up to 10^18, it's impossible to list all launch times.

I need a mathematical approach.

Let me try to find a formula for the maximum number of visible fireworks.

First, for the first installation, the number of launches whose fireworks are visible at time t is floor((t - m)/a) - floor((t)/a - m/a).

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

The number of launches from the first installation that are visible at time t is the number of k such that t - m <= k*a <= t.

This is equivalent to ceil((t - m)/a) to floor(t/a).

So, the number of visible fireworks from the first installation at time t is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1

I need to maximize this sum over t.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to simplify it.

First, note that floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

I need to find t that maximizes the sum of these two counts.

Let me consider that for large t, this sum would be roughly (t/a + t/b), but that's not precise.

Wait, but m can be up to 10^18, and a and b can be up to 10^18, so I need a way that doesn't involve iterating over t.

Let me consider that the maximum number of visible fireworks occurs when t is such that both installations have as many launches as possible within their visibility windows.

Perhaps t should be chosen as a multiple of a and b, i.e., a multiple of LCM(a, b), to maximize overlaps.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe t should be set to m, or some other value related to m.

Wait, in the first sample input:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, t from 0 to some time.

At t = 7, as mentioned in the explanation, two fireworks are visible: one from the first installation launched at t = 7 - 4 = 3 (but 3 is not a multiple of 6), wait, no.

Wait, the first installation launches at t = 6, 12, 18, etc.

Second installation at t = 7, 14, 21, etc.

At t = 7, the first installation's firework launched at t = 0 (assuming it starts at t=0) is visible from t=0 to t=4, but t=7 is beyond that.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the launch times.

Wait, the installations start at t=0, and launch fireworks every a and b minutes thereafter.

So, first installation: launches at t = a, 2a, 3a, etc.

Similarly, second installation: t = b, 2b, 3b, etc.

Each firework is visible from launch time t to t + m.

So, at t=7, first installation's firework launched at t=6 is visible from t=6 to t=10, which includes t=7.

Second installation's firework launched at t=7 is visible from t=7 to t=11.

So, at t=7, two fireworks are visible, one from each installation.

Hence, the maximum is 2.

But according to my earlier formula, floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1

Plugging in t=7, a=6, b=7, m=4:

floor(7/6) = 1, ceil((7-4)/6) = ceil(3/6) = 1, so first part is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

floor(7/7) = 1, ceil((7-4)/7) = ceil(3/7) = 1, so second part is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

Total is 2, which matches.

In the third sample input:

a=7, b=8, m=56

t=112, as per the explanation.

floor(112/7) = 16, ceil((112-56)/7) = ceil(56/7) = 8, so first part is 16 - 8 + 1 = 9

floor(112/8) = 14, ceil((112-56)/8) = ceil(56/8) = 7, so second part is 14 - 7 + 1 = 8

Total is 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the sample output.

So, this formula seems correct.

Hence, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1 for some t.

But to find the maximum over all t, I need to find the t that maximizes this sum.

Looking at the sample inputs, it seems that choosing t to be a multiple of a or b, or perhaps LCM(a, b), might not always give the maximum.

Wait, in the first sample, t=7 is not a multiple of a or b, but it gives the maximum.

In the third sample, t=112 is a multiple of both a and b.

Wait, 112 is a multiple of 7 and 8.

Yes, 112 / 7 = 16, 112 / 8 = 14.

So, perhaps choosing t to be a multiple of LCM(a, b) gives a high number, but maybe not always the maximum.

Wait, but in the first sample, t=7 is not a multiple of LCM(6,7)=42.

So, perhaps choosing t to be a multiple of LCM(a, b) isn't necessary.

Alternatively, maybe choosing t such that t is as large as possible, but since m can be up to 10^18, and a and b can be up to 10^18, I need to find a general formula.

Looking back at the formula:

floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1

I need to maximize this expression over t.

Let me try to simplify it.

First, recall that floor(t/a) is the largest integer less than or equal to t/a.

Ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

So, ceil((t - m)/a) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to (t - m)/a.

Therefore, floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

Now, I need to find t that maximizes the sum of these two counts.

Let me consider that for large t, floor(t/a) is approximately t/a, and ceil((t - m)/a) is approximately (t - m)/a.

So, floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 ≈ t/a - (t - m)/a + 1 = (t - t + m)/a + 1 = m/a + 1.

Similarly for b.

Therefore, for large t, the sum is approximately m/a + 1 + m/b + 1 = m/a + m/b + 2.

But since m, a, and b can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to something large, this approximation might hold.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

First sample: m=4, a=6, b=7

m/a + m/b + 2 = 4/6 + 4/7 + 2 ≈ 0.666 + 0.571 + 2 ≈ 3.237, but the actual maximum is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Second sample: m=10, a=3, b=4

m/a + m/b + 2 = 10/3 + 10/4 + 2 ≈ 3.333 + 2.5 + 2 = 7.833, and the sample output is 7.

Third sample: m=56, a=7, b=8

m/a + m/b + 2 = 56/7 + 56/8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the sample output.

Wait, in the first sample, m=4, a=6, b=7

m/a + m/b + 2 = 4/6 + 4/7 + 2 ≈ 0.666 + 0.571 + 2 ≈ 3.237, but the sample output is 2.

So, the approximation doesn't hold in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to take the integer parts.

Let me try m//a + m//b + 2.

For first sample: m=4, a=6, b=7

m//a = 0, m//b = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

Second sample: m=10, a=3, b=4

m//a = 3, m//b = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Third sample: m=56, a=7, b=8

m//a = 8, m//b = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches.

So, it seems that m//a + m//b + 2 is the correct formula.

Wait, but why does this work?

Let me verify with the first sample.

m//a = 4//6 = 0

m//b = 4//7 = 0

So, 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In the second sample, m=10, a=3, b=4

m//a = 3, m//b = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

In the third sample, m=56, a=7, b=8

m//a = 8, m//b = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17.

This seems consistent.

Let me see if this formula holds in general.

Consider that for each installation, the number of launches whose fireworks are visible at time t is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1.

But, in the approximation, it seems that m//a + 1 is a good estimate for this.

Wait, m//a + 1 is equal to floor(m/a) + 1.

Similarly for b.

So, the sum would be floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2.

This seems to match the sample inputs.

Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2.

But why is this so?

Let me think about it.

For the first installation, the number of launches whose fireworks are visible at time t is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1.

But, in the limit as t increases, floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) approaches floor(m/a) + 1.

Wait, let's see:

floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 = floor(t/a) - ceil(t/a - m/a) + 1.

Now, ceil(t/a - m/a) = ceil(t/a - m/a).

If t/a is an integer, then ceil(t/a - m/a) = t/a - floor(m/a).

Otherwise, it's ceiling of a fractional value.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of visible fireworks from the first installation is floor(m/a) + 1, and similarly for the second installation.

Then, the total maximum would be floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2.

This seems to align with the sample inputs.

Therefore, the formula floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2 gives the maximum number of visible fireworks.

Hence, in the program, it's implemented as:

ans = m // a + m // b + 2

print(ans)

This matches the sample inputs and seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

For each test case, the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time is \(\boxed{\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2}\).

**Correctness:** **True**
