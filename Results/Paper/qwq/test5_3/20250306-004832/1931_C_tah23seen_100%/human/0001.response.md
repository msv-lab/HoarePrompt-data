Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers: i, j, and x, where i and j are indices between 1 and n (the size of the array), and x is any integer. Then, I set all elements from index i to j (inclusive) to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements I'm changing.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I need to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always do this.

First, I need to understand what the best strategy is. Since I can perform the operation only once, I need to choose which part of the array to change to make all elements equal.

One straightforward way is to choose a value x and set the entire array to x, which would cost n burles (since I'm changing all n elements). But maybe I can do better by only changing a portion of the array.

Wait, actually, if I set the entire array to x in one operation, that would cost n burles, but perhaps there are arrays where I can set only a part of the array and still make all elements equal.

For example, if the array is already all equal, then I don't need to do anything, cost is 0.

If the array has only two different values, and one of them appears only once, I can set that one element to the other value, costing 1 burle.

But in general, I need a way to find the minimal cost.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to get a better idea.

First sample input:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Output: 4

If I set elements from index 2 to 5 (values 2,3,4,5) to 1, that's j=5, i=2, cost is 4, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1]. That matches the output.

Second sample input:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Output: 0

All elements are already equal, so no operation needed.

Third sample input:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Output: 2

If I set elements from index 4 to 5 (1 and 2) to 8, that's j=5, i=4, cost is 2, and the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].

Fourth sample input:

1

1

Output: 0

Only one element, already equal.

Fifth sample input:

2

1 2

Output: 1

If I set either element to the other's value, cost is 1.

Sixth sample input:

3

1 2 3

Output: 2

If I set the first two elements to 3, cost is 2, or set the last two to 1, cost is 2, or set the middle one to 1 or 3, cost is 1, but wait, the output is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a different part.

Wait, perhaps the operation can only be performed once, and I need to choose the best single operation to minimize the cost.

Looking back at the problem, it says "no more than once", meaning zero or one times.

So, in cases where the array is already equal, cost is 0. Otherwise, I need to find the minimal cost of one operation to make the array equal.

But in the fifth sample, with [1,2], setting one element to the other's value costs 1, which matches the output.

In the sixth sample, [1,2,3], setting the middle element to 1 or 3 costs 1, but the output is 2. So perhaps I need to choose x differently.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x as a value not present in the array.

But in the sample, setting the middle element to 1 or 3 costs 1, but the output is 2. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x such that after the operation, all elements become equal.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x as one of the existing values in the array.

But in the sample, if I set the middle element to 1, the array becomes [1,1,3], which is not all equal. So I need to set it to 3, making [1,3,3], which is still not equal.

Wait, no, if I set the middle element to 1, it becomes [1,1,3], then I need to set the last element to 1, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the problem allows at most one operation.

So, in the case of [1,2,3], if I set i=2, j=3, x=1, the array becomes [1,1,1], which costs 2 burles.

Alternatively, setting i=1, j=2, x=3, the array becomes [3,3,3], which also costs 2 burles.

So, the minimal cost is 2, which matches the sample output.

So, the strategy seems to be: find the minimal cost to set a contiguous subarray to a value x such that the entire array becomes equal after this operation.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need to make all elements equal, and I can perform at most one operation.

An operation consists of choosing a subarray and setting all its elements to a single value x, with a cost equal to the length of the subarray.

I need to choose the operation that minimizes this cost.

But, perhaps I don't need to perform any operation if the array is already equal.

Otherwise, I need to choose which subarray to set and what value to set it to, so that the entire array becomes equal, with minimal cost.

Wait, but since I can only perform one operation, I need to make sure that after setting that subarray to x, all elements become equal.

This means that the value x has to be equal to the value that will be present in the entire array after the operation.

So, I need to choose x and a subarray such that after setting that subarray to x, all elements in the array are x.

This implies that the subarray I choose to set to x should cover all elements that are not already x.

Wait, no. Because if I set a subarray to x, then all elements in that subarray become x, and the elements outside remain as they are.

So, to make the entire array equal to x, I need to set all elements that are not x to x.

If I can perform multiple operations, I could set each non-x element to x one by one, but since I can perform at most one operation, I need to set all non-x elements in one operation.

But the operation allows me to set a contiguous subarray to x.

So, if all non-x elements are contiguous, then I can set that subarray to x in one operation.

If they are not contiguous, I may need to set multiple subarrays, but since I can only perform one operation, I need to find a way to cover all non-x elements with one subarray.

But that's not possible if non-x elements are not contiguous.

Wait, but the operation allows me to set a contiguous subarray to x, and I can choose x to be any value.

So, perhaps I should choose x to be the most frequent value in the array, and then set the subarray that contains all non-x elements to x.

But, if non-x elements are not contiguous, I cannot set them all in one operation.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal cost to make all elements equal to a chosen value x, with at most one operation.

I need to choose x and then set a subarray to x such that the entire array becomes x.

This means that I need to set all elements that are not x to x, and they have to be in a contiguous subarray.

So, for each possible x, find the minimal cost to set a subarray containing all non-x elements to x.

If all non-x elements are contiguous, then the cost is the length of that subarray.

If they are not contiguous, I cannot cover them with one subarray in one operation.

But the problem allows at most one operation, so in that case, it's impossible to make all elements equal to x with at most one operation.

But the problem says it's always possible, so there must be a way.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the operation is to set a subarray to x, and I can choose x to be any value.

So, perhaps I can choose x to be a new value not present in the array, but the array only contains integers between 1 and n, and x can be any integer, but in the problem, x is constrained to be between 1 and n.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says "the value x (1 ≤ x ≤ n)", so x must be between 1 and n.

So, x has to be one of the existing values in the array.

Wait, no, it says "the value x (1 ≤ x ≤ n)", but it doesn't say that x has to be present in the array.

It just has to be an integer between 1 and n.

So, x can be any integer between 1 and n, even if it's not present in the array.

But in the operation, I set the subarray to x, and the rest remains as is.

Then, after the operation, all elements should be equal to x.

So, I need to set all elements that are not x to x, and they have to be in a contiguous subarray.

If the non-x elements are not contiguous, I cannot set them all in one operation.

But the problem says it's always possible, so perhaps there's another way.

Wait, maybe I can set a subarray that includes some x's and some non-x's, but I need to ensure that after setting that subarray to x, all elements become x.

Wait, perhaps I need to set the subarray such that after setting it to x, the entire array becomes x.

So, if I have some x's outside the subarray, I need to make sure that they are already x.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to make the entire array equal to a particular value x.

Then, I need to set all elements that are not x to x.

But I can only set a contiguous subarray to x in one operation.

So, I need to choose a subarray that contains all the non-x elements.

If the non-x elements are contiguous, then I can set that subarray to x in one operation.

If they are not contiguous, I need to set a larger subarray that contains all non-x elements, but that would include some x's as well, which is fine, because setting them to x again doesn't change them.

So, for each possible x, I need to find the minimal subarray that contains all non-x elements.

Then, the cost is the length of that subarray.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of the minimal subarray containing all non-x elements.

Wait, but in the sample input [1,2,3,4,5,1], if I choose x=1, the non-x elements are positions 2,3,4,5.

They are contiguous from position 2 to 5, so I can set them to 1 with cost 4.

If I choose x=2, the non-x elements are positions 1,3,4,5,6.

They are not fully contiguous, but I can set from position 1 to 6 to 2, which would set positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 to 2, making the array [2,2,2,2,2,2].

The cost is 6, which is higher than 4.

Similarly, for x=3, non-x elements are positions 1,2,4,5,6, which are not fully contiguous, so I need to set from position 1 to 6 to 3, cost 6.

Similarly for x=4 and x=5.

So, the minimal cost is when x=1, which is 4, matching the sample output.

Another sample input: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

If I choose x=8, non-x elements are positions 4 and 5.

They are contiguous, so I can set positions 4 and 5 to 8 with cost 2.

If I choose x=1, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Setting positions 1 to 8 to 1 would cost 8.

Similarly for x=2.

So, minimal cost is 2.

Another sample input: [1,2,3]

If I choose x=1, non-x elements are positions 2 and 3.

They are contiguous, so set positions 2 and 3 to 1, cost 2.

If I choose x=2, non-x elements are positions 1 and 3.

They are not contiguous, so I need to set positions 1 to 3 to 2, cost 3.

If I choose x=3, non-x elements are positions 1 and 2.

Set positions 1 and 2 to 3, cost 2.

So, minimal cost is 2.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2, which matches.

Another sample input: [4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

If I choose x=1, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,4,7.

These are not fully contiguous, so I need to set positions 1 to 7 to 1, cost 7.

If I choose x=2, non-x elements are positions 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Not fully contiguous, set positions 1 to 7 to 2, cost 7.

If I choose x=3, non-x elements are positions 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Set positions 1 to 7 to 3, cost 7.

If I choose x=4, non-x elements are positions 2,3,5,6,7.

Set positions 2 to 7 to 4, cost 6.

If I choose x=7, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Set positions 1 to 7 to 7, cost 7.

So, the minimal cost is 6 when x=4.

But the sample output is 6, which matches.

Another sample input: [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

If I choose x=9, non-x elements are positions 3,5,6,7,8,9.

They are not fully contiguous, so I need to set positions 1 to 9 to 9, cost 9.

If I choose x=2, non-x elements are positions 1,2,4,6,7,8,9.

Set positions 1 to 9 to 2, cost 9.

If I choose x=5, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,4,5,9.

Set positions 1 to 9 to 5, cost 9.

If I choose x=3, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Set positions 1 to 8 to 3, cost 8.

But in the sample output, it's 7.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose x to be a value not present in the array, but the problem says x must be between 1 and n, but it doesn't have to be present in the array.

If I choose x=10 (assuming n=9), then non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Set positions 1 to 9 to 10, cost 9.

That's not better than choosing x=9, which also costs 9.

Wait, but the sample output is 7, so maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be a value that minimizes the cost.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal cost over all possible x, including those not in the array.

But in this case, choosing x=5, non-x elements are positions 1,2,3,4,5,9.

Positions 1,2,3,4,5 are contiguous, positions 6,7,8 are 5, and position 9 is 3.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a given x, the minimal subarray that contains all non-x elements has to be found.

Then, the cost is the length of that subarray.

If all non-x elements are contiguous, then it's straightforward.

If not, I need to find the smallest subarray that covers all non-x elements.

In the case where non-x elements are not contiguous, the smallest subarray covering all non-x elements is from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

So, for a given x, the minimal subarray containing all non-x elements is from the first position that is not x to the last position that is not x.

So, for x=9, first non-x is position 3, last non-x is position 9, so set positions 3 to 9 to 9, cost 7.

Similarly, for x=2, first non-x is position 1, last non-x is position 9, set positions 1 to 9 to 2, cost 9.

For x=5, first non-x is position 1, last non-x is position 9, set positions 1 to 9 to 5, cost 9.

For x=3, first non-x is position 1, last non-x is position 8, set positions 1 to 8 to 3, cost 8.

So, the minimal cost is 7 when choosing x=9.

That matches the sample output.

So, the general approach is:

- For each possible x from 1 to n:

- Find the first position that is not x.

- Find the last position that is not x.

- The cost is last - first + 1.

- If there are no non-x elements, cost is 0.

- Take the minimal cost over all possible x.

But, since x can be from 1 to n, and n can be up to 2e5, this approach would be too slow because t can be up to 1e4, and n up to 2e5, leading to a time complexity of O(t*n^2), which is not feasible.

I need a more efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal length of the interval that covers all positions where a[i] != x, for all x.

But doing this for each x separately would be too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the first and last positions where a[i] != x for each x.

But still, that seems inefficient.

Wait, maybe I can think differently.

Suppose I fix the subarray to be modified, and then choose x accordingly.

But that might not lead anywhere.

Wait, another idea: since I can set a subarray to any x, and I want all elements to be equal after that, then the value that the entire array will be set to is x.

So, I need to choose a subarray to set to x such that, after setting, all elements are x.

This means that all elements outside the subarray must already be x.

So, the elements outside the subarray must all be x.

Therefore, I need to choose a subarray such that all elements outside it are already x.

Then, I set the subarray to x, and the entire array becomes x.

So, for a chosen x, I need to find the subarray from the first non-x element to the last non-x element, and set that subarray to x.

The cost is last - first + 1.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal such cost over all possible x.

This seems correct based on the samples.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to, for each possible x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

Then, the cost is last - first + 1.

If there are no non-x elements, cost is 0.

Then, take the minimal cost over all x.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

So, in code, for each test case, I can iterate through all possible x from 1 to n, and for each x, find the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

But iterating x from 1 to n for each test case would be too slow because t*n^2 is too big.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that a[i] is between 1 and n, so the possible values of x are from 1 to n.

But n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total n across all test cases is up to 2e5.

So, perhaps I can optimize by iterating through the array once and collecting the positions for each x.

So, for each test case, I can create a dictionary or list of lists where each x has its list of positions.

Then, for each x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

Wait, actually, for each x, the positions where a[i] == x are known, and I need to find the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

So, for each x, find the first i where a[i] != x, and the last i where a[i] != x.

Then, the minimal subarray to cover all non-x elements is from first to last.

If there are no non-x elements, then cost is 0.

So, for each x, cost is last - first + 1, or 0 if no non-x elements.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of these costs.

To optimize, I can precompute the first and last positions where a[i] != x for each x.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array once and collect the positions where a[i] == x for each x.

Then, for each x, the first non-x is the first position before the first a[i] == x, and the last non-x is the last position after the last a[i] == x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

So, find the first i where a[i] != x, and the last i where a[i] != x.

Then, the subarray from first to last covers all non-x elements.

So, for each x, cost is last - first + 1, or 0 if no non-x elements.

Then, minimal cost is the minimum over all x of these costs.

To implement this efficiently, I can:

- Create a list of lists, positions[x] = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == x]

- Then, for each x, if positions[x] is empty, then all elements are non-x, so cost is n.

- Else, find the first i where a[i] != x, which is 0 if a[0] != x, otherwise the next position after positions[x][0].

- Similarly, find the last i where a[i] != x, which is n-1 if a[n-1] != x, otherwise the previous position before positions[x][-1].

Wait, this seems complicated.

Perhaps a better way is:

- Find the overall first and last positions where a[i] != x, for each x.

- To do this efficiently, iterate through the array once and collect for each x the positions where a[i] == x.

- Then, for each x, the first non-x is the first i that is not in positions[x].

- Similarly, the last non-x is the last i that is not in positions[x].

- So, for each x, first_non_x = min(i for i in range(n) if a[i] != x)

- last_non_x = max(i for i in range(n) if a[i] != x)

- Then, cost is last_non_x - first_non_x + 1, or 0 if there are no non-x elements.

But implementing this for each x separately would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the intersection of all intervals where a[i] != x for all x.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: realize that for the minimal cost, I can choose x to be the value that appears the most, because then the number of non-x elements is minimized.

But actually, in the operation, I need to set all non-x elements to x in one subarray, so I need to cover all non-x elements with one subarray.

So, choosing x with the most frequency might help reduce the number of non-x elements, but I need to make sure that all non-x elements are covered in one subarray.

Wait, but in the earlier example, choosing x=1 in [1,2,3,4,5,1] has non-x elements from position 2 to 5, which are contiguous, so cost is 4.

Choosing x=1 is better than choosing x=2, where non-x elements are positions 1,3,4,5,6, which are not fully contiguous, so I have to set from position 1 to
