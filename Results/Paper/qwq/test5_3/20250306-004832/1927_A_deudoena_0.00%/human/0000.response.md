Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a strip of cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'). I need to choose one continuous segment to paint white, and after painting, all the black cells in that segment become white, while the white ones stay white. My goal is to find the minimum length of such a segment that, when painted, will make the entire strip white.

First, I need to understand what happens when I paint a segment white. It seems that only the black cells in that segment are changed to white, and the white cells remain unchanged. So, if I choose a segment from index i to j, all 'B's in that range become 'W's.

Now, I need to make sure that after this operation, the entire strip is white. That means, any 'B' in the strip must be covered by this segment. So, the segment has to include all the 'B's in the strip.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem says "all n cells to become white". If I paint a segment that covers all 'B's, then all 'B's become 'W's, and the rest are already 'W's, so the whole strip would be 'W's. So, yes, the segment needs to cover all 'B's.

But the problem allows me to choose only one segment to paint. So, I need to find the smallest possible segment that covers all 'B's.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check the example to see if that's the case.

In the first test case:

n = 6

s = W B B W B W

If I choose the segment from position 2 to 5 (1-based indexing), which is "BBWB", and paint it white, then it becomes "WWWW". So the entire strip becomes "W W W W W W", which is all white. The length of this segment is 4.

According to the problem, this is the minimum length required.

Another test case:

n = 1

s = B

I need to paint the single cell, so the minimum length is 1.

n = 2

s = W B

I need to paint the second cell, so length 1.

n = 3

s = B B W

I need to paint the first two cells, so length 2.

n = 4

s = B W W B

I need to paint from first to fourth, which is length 4.

n = 6

s = B W B W W B

I need to paint from first to sixth, which is length 6.

n = 6

s = W W B B W B

I need to paint from position 3 to 6, which is length 4.

n = 9

s = W B W B W W W B W

I need to paint from position 2 to 8, which is length 7.

So, in all these cases, it seems that the minimum length is equal to the distance from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

Wait, but in the first example, the first 'B' is at position 2, and the last 'B' is at position 5, so length is 4, which matches.

In n=3, B B W, first 'B' at position 1, last 'B' at position 2, length 2.

In n=4, B W W B, first 'B' at position 1, last 'B' at position 4, length 4.

In n=6, B W B W W B, first 'B' at position 1, last 'B' at position 6, length 6.

In n=6, W W B B W B, first 'B' at position 3, last 'B' at position 6, length 4.

In n=9, W B W B W W W B W, first 'B' at position 2, last 'B' at position 8, length 7.

So, it seems consistent that the minimum segment length is from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

So, the approach should be:

1. Find the index of the first 'B' from the left.

2. Find the index of the last 'B' from the right.

3. The minimum segment length is last_B_index - first_B_index + 1.

But wait, I need to make sure that all 'B's are covered within this segment.

In the first test case, s = W B B W B W

First 'B' at position 2, last 'B' at position 5.

So, segment from 2 to 5, length 4, which covers all 'B's.

Similarly in other cases.

So, this seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

inpstr = input()

ind1 = 0

ind2 = 0

outind = 0

for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):

if j == 'B':

ind1 = i

break

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

So, it's reading the input string, finding the first 'B' from the left (ind1), and the first 'B' from the right (ind2), and then computing the length as len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1.

Wait, is this correct?

Let's see with the first test case:

s = W B B W B W

ind1 = 1 (since indexing starts at 0, first 'B' at position 1)

ind2 = 1 (since from the right, the first 'B' is at position 4, which is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 from the left, but wait, this seems confusing.

Wait, the way ind2 is calculated:

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

So, for s = 'W B B W B W', len(inpstr) = 6

i starts from 0:

inpstr[-1 - 0] = s[5] = 'W' → not 'B'

i=1:

inpstr[-1 -1] = s[4] = 'B' → ind2 = 1

So, ind2 = 1

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, which matches the expected output.

Similarly, in n=3, s='B B W'

ind1=0 (first 'B' at position 0)

ind2=0 (from the right, first 'B' at position 2, which is inpstr[-1] = 'W', so i=0: inpstr[-1] = 'W', i=1: inpstr[-2] = 'B' → ind2=1

Wait, n=3, s='B B W'

len(inpstr)=3

for ind1: i=0, j='B' → ind1=0

for ind2:

i=0: inpstr[-1] = 'W' → not 'B'

i=1: inpstr[-2] = 'B' → ind2=1

then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 3 - 1 - 0 = 2, which matches the expected output.

Another test case: n=4, s='B W W B'

ind1=0 (first 'B' at position 0)

ind2=0 (from the right, first 'B' at position 3, inpstr[-1]='B' → i=0: inpstr[-1]='B' → ind2=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 4 - 0 - 0 = 4, which matches the expected output.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, ind2 should be the distance from the end.

Wait, maybe I need to understand ind2 better.

In the program, ind2 is the index from the end where the first 'B' is found.

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 should give the length from ind1 to the end minus ind2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of positions.

Let's define:

first_B = ind1 (from the left, 0-based)

last_B = len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1 (since ind2 is the distance from the end)

Then, the length should be last_B - first_B + 1

But in the program, it's computing len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1, which is:

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = (last_B - first_B + 1) only if last_B = len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1

Wait, let's verify:

last_B = len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1

first_B = ind1

length = last_B - first_B + 1 = (len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1) - ind1 + 1 = len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1

Yes, that matches the program's computation.

So, the program is correctly computing the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

Therefore, the program is correct.

I can confirm that with the example inputs and outputs provided.

Hence, the correctness is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
