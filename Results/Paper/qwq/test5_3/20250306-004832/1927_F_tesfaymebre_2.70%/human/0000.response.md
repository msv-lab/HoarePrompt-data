Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the lightest edge in the cycle is as minimal as possible. The graph can have multiple components, and it's guaranteed that there's at least one simple cycle in the graph.

First, I need to understand what a simple cycle is. A simple cycle doesn't pass through the same vertex or edge twice. So, it's a loop where no vertex repeats except the starting and ending one.

My goal is to find any simple cycle where the smallest edge weight is as small as possible. Among all possible simple cycles, I need to pick one where the minimum edge weight is the smallest among all such cycles.

Looking at the input format, there are multiple test cases, each with n vertices and m edges. The constraints are quite large: n can be up to 2*10^5, and m up to 2*10^5 per test case, but since t is up to 10^4, I need to make sure my solution is efficient.

I need to think about an efficient way to find such cycles. Since the graph is undirected and can have multiple components, I need to handle each component separately.

One approach that comes to mind is to use a disjoint set union (DSU) structure to keep track of connected components and detect cycles. In DSU, when I try to union two nodes that are already in the same set, that operation would indicate a cycle.

However, in this problem, I need to not only detect cycles but also keep track of the minimum edge weight in those cycles. Moreover, I need to output one such cycle for each test case.

Let me think about how to adapt DSU for this purpose. I can sort the edges in descending order of their weights. Then, I can iterate through the edges, trying to union the nodes they connect. If I encounter an edge where both nodes are already in the same set, that means adding this edge would create a cycle.

In such a case, I can record that cycle and keep track of the minimum edge weight in that cycle. Since I'm processing edges in descending order of weights, the first cycle I find will have the heaviest possible minimum edge weight, but I need the lightest.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. If I process edges in descending order, the first cycle I find will have a higher minimum edge weight, but I want the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Maybe I should process edges in ascending order of weights. That way, the first cycle I find will have the smallest possible minimum edge weight.

But no, if I process edges in ascending order, I might be missing heavier edges that could form cycles with even smaller minimum edges.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I need a different approach.

Another idea is to find all cycles in the graph and then select the one with the smallest minimum edge weight. But with the given constraints, finding all cycles would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way. Maybe I can use depth-first search (DFS) to find cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in those cycles.

But again, with large n and m, a standard DFS might not be efficient enough, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

Wait, but t is the number of test cases, and each test case has its own n and m, with m up to 2*10^5. So, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient per test case.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. For each test case, build the graph using an adjacency list.

2. Use DFS to traverse the graph and find cycles.

3. While traversing, keep track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

4. When a cycle is detected (i.e., a node is visited that's already in the current path), record the cycle and its minimum edge weight.

5. Among all cycles found, select the one with the smallest minimum edge weight.

But this seems a bit naive and might not be efficient enough for the time constraints.

Looking back at the DSU approach, maybe I can use DSU to find cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each cycle.

Let me think differently. Suppose I sort all edges in ascending order of their weights. Then, I can iterate through the edges and use DSU to union the nodes, skipping edges that would create cycles.

But I need to find cycles, not avoid them. Maybe I can modify this approach.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the edges in ascending order and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each cycle formed during the union process.

Let me try to formalize this.

- Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

- Initialize a DSU structure with all nodes in separate sets.

- Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum edge weight in cycles and the cycle path.

- Iterate through each edge in sorted order:

- If the two nodes of the edge are in different sets, union them and update the minimum edge weight for their new set.

- If they are in the same set, adding this edge would create a cycle. In this case, find the cycle path and record the minimum edge weight in this cycle.

- Among all such cycles found, select the one with the smallest minimum edge weight.

This seems promising. I need to implement a way to find the cycle path when two nodes are in the same set.

To find the cycle path, I can use the DSU's path from one node to the other, which would give me the cycle.

Wait, DSU itself doesn't store paths. It only keeps track of the parent of each node.

Maybe I need to maintain a separate data structure to keep track of paths during the union operations.

Alternatively, once I find that two nodes are in the same set, I can perform a BFS or DFS from one node to find a path to the other node, and then add the current edge to form the cycle.

But with large n and m, this might still be inefficient.

Let me consider another approach using BFS or DFS to find cycles while keeping track of the minimum edge weight.

In DFS, I can keep track of the path from the starting node to the current node. When I visit a node that's already in the path, I've found a cycle. I can then record this cycle and its minimum edge weight.

To optimize, I can keep track of the minimum edge weight along the path and update the global minimum accordingly.

But again, with large n and m, I need to make sure that this doesn't exceed time limits.

Looking at the sample input and output, I see that for m=6 and n=6, the output is a cycle of length 3 with the minimum edge weight of 1.

In the second sample, m=6 and n=6, the output is a cycle of length 3 with the minimum edge weight of 3.

In the third sample, m=15 and n=6, the output is a cycle of length 5 with the minimum edge weight of 1.

So, in some cases, the cycle can be of length 3, and in others, longer.

I need to make sure that my solution can handle cycles of different lengths efficiently.

Let me consider the following plan:

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Build the adjacency list for the graph.

- Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

- Initialize a DSU structure.

- Initialize variables to store the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

- Iterate through the sorted edges:

- If the two nodes are not in the same set, union them and update the minimum edge weight for their set.

- If they are in the same set, adding this edge would create a cycle. Find the cycle path and calculate its minimum edge weight.

- If this cycle's minimum edge weight is smaller than the current smallest, update the record.

- After processing all edges, output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Now, the key part is finding the cycle path when two nodes are in the same set.

To find the cycle path efficiently, I can use the DSU's parent information to reconstruct the path from one node to the other.

But DSU's parent information might not directly give me the cycle path because it's a forest, not necessarily a tree.

Wait, DSU's parent information can be used to find the path from one node to the root, but not necessarily between two nodes in the same set.

Maybe I need to use a different approach to find the cycle path.

An alternative idea is to use BFS to find the shortest path between the two nodes in the same set, and then add the current edge to form the cycle.

But BFS might not be efficient for large graphs, especially with multiple test cases.

Let me think differently. Since the graph is undirected and I'm dealing with cycles, maybe I can use a single DFS traversal and keep track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

When I visit a node that's already in the current path, I've found a cycle. I can then record this cycle and its minimum edge weight.

I can maintain a global minimum of the smallest edge weight among all cycles found.

Then, after DFS traversal, I can output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

This seems feasible. I need to implement DFS with path tracking and minimum edge weight tracking.

But with large n and m, I need to make sure that DFS doesn't exceed time limits.

To optimize, I can stop DFS once I've found a cycle with a sufficiently small minimum edge weight, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, since the problem guarantees that at least one cycle exists, I can find any cycle with the smallest possible minimum edge weight.

Wait, in the DSU approach, when I find that two nodes are in the same set, and adding an edge between them would create a cycle, I can use the DSU's parent information to find the cycle path.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have nodes A and B connected by an edge, and they are already in the same set in DSU. Then, the path from A to B in the current DSU forest would form a cycle when combined with the edge (A, B).

So, I can find the path from A to B using the DSU's parent pointers and record that path along with the edge (A, B) to form the cycle.

Then, I can calculate the minimum edge weight in this cycle and keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

This seems promising. I need to implement a way to reconstruct the cycle path using DSU's parent information.

But I'm not sure if DSU alone can provide the full path. DSU typically only keeps one parent per node, which might not be sufficient to reconstruct the entire cycle path.

Maybe I need to augment the DSU to keep more information, like the path from each node to the root.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach altogether.

Let me consider Krusky's algorithm. In Krusky's algorithm, we build a minimum spanning tree (MST) by adding edges in ascending order of their weights, skipping edges that would create cycles.

In this problem, I need to find cycles, not avoid them. Maybe I can modify Krusky's algorithm to find cycles instead of building an MST.

Indeed, when Krusky's algorithm skips an edge because it would create a cycle, that skipped edge, combined with the edges in the current MST that connect the two nodes, forms a cycle.

So, perhaps I can use Krusky's algorithm and record the cycles formed by the skipped edges.

In this way, I can iterate through the edges in ascending order of weights, and whenever I skip an edge because it would create a cycle, I can find the path in the current MST between the two nodes and form the cycle.

Then, I can calculate the minimum edge weight in this cycle and keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

This seems similar to the DSU approach but more aligned with Krusky's algorithm.

I need to implement this efficiently, considering the time constraints.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

2. Initialize a DSU structure.

3. Initialize variables to keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

4. Iterate through each edge in sorted order:

a. If the two nodes are not in the same set, union them and record the minimum edge weight for their set.

b. If they are in the same set, adding this edge would create a cycle. Find the path in the current MST between the two nodes and combine it with the current edge to form the cycle.

c. Calculate the minimum edge weight in this cycle and update the global minimum if this cycle has a smaller minimum edge weight.

5. After processing all edges, output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Now, the key is to efficiently find the path between two nodes in the current MST.

Since DSU typically doesn't store paths, I need another way to find this path.

One way is to perform a BFS from one node to the other using only the edges that are currently in the MST.

But BFS might be too slow for large graphs.

Alternatively, I can maintain a tree structure representing the current MST and use tree traversal techniques to find the path between two nodes.

However, maintaining such a tree structure efficiently might be challenging.

Let me consider another approach: using DFS to find cycles while keeping track of the minimum edge weight.

In this approach, I can perform a DFS traversal on the graph, keeping track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

When I visit a node that's already in the current path, I've found a cycle.

In this cycle, I can find the minimum edge weight.

I need to keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

To implement this efficiently, I need to make sure that DFS doesn't run into performance issues with large n and m.

To optimize, I can stop DFS once I've found a cycle with a sufficiently small minimum edge weight, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can run DFS on each connected component and find the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight in each component, then select the overall smallest one.

But with t up to 10^4 and m up to 2*10^5 per test case, I need to make sure that the total time is acceptable.

Let me think about the time complexity.

In DFS, the time complexity is O(n + m), which is acceptable for each test case.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, but m is up to 2*10^5 per test case, the total time could be up to 10^4 * 2*10^5 = 2*10^9 operations, which is too slow.

Wait, but the problem states that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, so t is up to 10^4, but m per test case is up to 2*10^5, but the total sum of m is up to 2*10^5.

Wait, no, the problem says "It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5."

So, across all test cases, m <= 2*10^5.

Therefore, the total time complexity should be O(n + m) across all test cases, which is acceptable.

So, I can proceed with the DFS approach.

Now, I need to implement DFS to find cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in those cycles.

In DFS, I need to keep track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

When I visit a node that's already in the current path, I've found a cycle.

To implement this, I can pass the current path along with the DFS recursion.

But with large n, this might lead to a deep recursion stack.

To handle this, I can either increase the recursion stack size or implement DFS iteratively.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, recursive DFS might not be suitable due to stack overflow.

Therefore, I should implement DFS iteratively.

In iterative DFS, I can use a stack to simulate the recursion, keeping track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

When I encounter a node that's already in the current path, I can extract the cycle and calculate its minimum edge weight.

I need to maintain a way to reconstruct the path and the edges in the path.

To do this, I can keep a dictionary to track the parent of each node in the DFS tree.

Then, when I find a back edge to a node already in the current path, I can trace back from that node to the current node using the parent dictionary to form the cycle path.

Once I have the cycle path, I can iterate through the edges in the cycle and find the minimum edge weight.

I need to keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

After DFS traversal, I can output this cycle.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple connected components correctly.

To do this, I can iterate through all nodes and start DFS from nodes that haven't been visited yet.

In each DFS traversal, I can look for cycles in that connected component.

Among all connected components, I need to find the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Wait, but the problem says that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph, so I don't need to worry about components without cycles.

But to be safe, I should handle all components.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, build the adjacency list for the graph.

Then, initialize a visited array and a parent dictionary.

Initialize variables to store the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Perform iterative DFS on each unvisited node.

In the iterative DFS:

- Use a stack to simulate recursion, where each stack element is a node and its parent.

- Keep a dictionary to track the parent of each node in the DFS tree.

- When I pop a node from the stack, mark it as visited.

- For each neighbor of the current node:

- If the neighbor is not visited, push it onto the stack with the current node as its parent.

- If the neighbor is already in the current path (i.e., it's in the stack), then we have a cycle.

- Reconstruct the cycle path using the parent dictionary.

- Calculate the minimum edge weight in this cycle.

- If this is the first cycle or has a smaller minimum edge weight, update the record.

After DFS traversal, output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

This seems like a solid plan.

Now, considering time constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 and m up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4 but with the sum of m over all test cases up to 2*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid timeouts.

Let me think about how to reconstruct the cycle path using the parent dictionary.

Suppose I have a cycle detected when node u and node v are connected by an edge, and v is already in the current path.

Then, the cycle path can be obtained by tracing back from v to u using the parent dictionary.

So, starting from v, go to parent[v], then parent[parent[v]], and so on, until reaching u.

Then, add the edge (u, v) to close the cycle.

Once I have the cycle path, I can iterate through the edges in the path to find the minimum edge weight.

I need to store the edge weights for each edge in both directions.

To do this, I can use a dictionary that maps (u, v) tuples to their weights.

Similarly, since the graph is undirected, I should also store (v, u) with the same weight.

This way, when reconstructing the cycle path, I can look up the weights of the edges in the path.

Now, let's consider implementing this.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read m edges, each with u, v, and w.

- Build the adjacency list.

- Initialize visited array and parent dictionary.

- Initialize variables to store the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

- Perform iterative DFS on each unvisited node.

- In DFS, when a cycle is found, reconstruct the path, calculate the minimum edge weight, and update the record if it's smaller.

- After processing all nodes, output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Now, to optimize, I can sort the edges in ascending order of their weights and process them in that order.

But in the DFS approach, I don't necessarily need to sort the edges beforehand.

Wait, actually, in the DFS approach, I don't need to sort the edges because I'm looking for any cycle with the smallest possible minimum edge weight.

I can process the nodes in any order, and keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

However, sorting the edges might help in some way, but it's not necessary for the DFS approach.

Let me consider if sorting can help.

If I sort the edges in ascending order of their weights, and process them in that order, perhaps I can stop searching once I've found a cycle with a minimum edge weight that's smaller than or equal to some threshold.

But I'm not sure if that's beneficial.

In any case, for now, I'll proceed with the iterative DFS approach without sorting the edges.

I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient and doesn't have unnecessary operations.

Now, considering that the graph can have multiple components, and I need to handle each component separately.

In DFS, I can iterate through all nodes and start DFS from nodes that haven't been visited yet.

In each DFS traversal, I can look for cycles and keep track of the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight in that component.

Then, among all components, I can select the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Wait, but the problem is to find any simple cycle with the smallest possible minimum edge weight in the entire graph.

So, I need to find the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight among all cycles in the graph.

Therefore, I need to keep track of the global smallest cycle across all components.

But since the graph is connected or has multiple components, and each component has at least one cycle (as per the problem's guarantee), I can find the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight among all components.

Hence, I need to find the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight in the entire graph, not just in each component.

Therefore, I need to keep track of the global minimum across all components.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to make sure that I reset my data structures for each test case.

Also, I need to handle the output format correctly, which includes printing the minimum edge weight, the cycle length, and the cycle path.

I need to make sure that the cycle path is printed in the order of traversal.

Now, considering that the graph can have up to 2*10^5 edges and 10^4 test cases, but with the sum of m over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my code is optimized and doesn't have unnecessary loops or operations.

I should avoid nested loops that could lead to O(n^2) time complexity.

In iterative DFS, the time complexity is O(n + m), which is acceptable.

Now, let's think about how to reconstruct the cycle path efficiently.

When I detect a cycle, I need to trace back from the current node to the node where the cycle starts.

To do this, I can use the parent dictionary to build the path.

Once I have the path, I can iterate through the edges in the path to find the minimum edge weight.

I need to make sure that the cycle path is a simple cycle, meaning no repeated vertices except for the starting and ending vertices.

Given that I'm using DFS and tracking the parent, this should naturally be a simple cycle.

Now, to optimize the cycle detection and path reconstruction, I need to make sure that I handle the parent dictionary correctly and that I don't have any cycles in the parent tree itself, which should not happen since DFS builds a tree.

Wait, in DFS, cycles are detected when a back edge is found, i.e., an edge that connects a node to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree.

So, when I find such a back edge, I can reconstruct the cycle by finding the path from the current node to the ancestor in the DFS tree.

Therefore, my implementation should correctly handle back edges and reconstruct the cycle path accordingly.

Now, considering that the graph is undirected, every edge is bidirectional.

Therefore, in DFS, I need to make sure that when I traverse from u to v, I don't immediately consider the back edge from v to u as a cycle, because that would be a cycle of length 2, which might not be allowed, especially since the problem mentions that there are no self-loops and at most one edge between any two vertices.

But in the problem statement, it's allowed to have cycles of length 3 or more.

Therefore, I need to make sure that the cycle has at least 3 distinct vertices.

In undirected graphs, a cycle must have at least 3 vertices to avoid considering back edges as cycles of length 2.

Wait, but in undirected graphs, a cycle of length 2 would just be a pair of edges between two vertices, which isn't allowed because the graph doesn't have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

Therefore, all cycles in this graph must have at least 3 vertices.

Hence, in my cycle detection, I don't need to worry about cycles of length less than 3.

Now, moving forward, I need to implement the iterative DFS approach to find cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in those cycles.

I should also ensure that I handle the parent dictionary correctly to avoid infinite loops or incorrect path reconstructions.

To summarize, my plan is:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read m edges and build the adjacency list.

- Initialize a visited array and a parent dictionary.

- Initialize variables to store the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

- For each unvisited node, perform iterative DFS:

- Use a stack to simulate recursion, where each stack element is a node and its parent.

- Track the parent of each node in the DFS tree.

- When a back edge is found (i.e., an edge to a node already in the current path), reconstruct the cycle path and calculate its minimum edge weight.

- Update the global minimum cycle if this cycle has a smaller minimum edge weight.

- After processing all nodes, output the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight.

Now, I need to think about how to implement the iterative DFS correctly.

I'll use a stack to simulate the recursion.

Each entry in the stack will be a tuple of (current_node, parent_node).

I'll also maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node in the DFS tree.

To keep track of the current path, I'll maintain a set or a list of nodes that are currently in the recursion stack.

When I pop a node from the stack, I'll mark it as visited.

For each neighbor of the current node:

- If the neighbor is not visited, push it onto the stack with the current node as its parent.

- If the neighbor is already in the current path (i.e., it's in the recursion stack), then we have a cycle.

To detect if a neighbor is in the current path, I can keep a set of nodes that are currently in the stack.

When I push a node onto the stack, I add it to this set, and when I pop it, I remove it from the set.

This way, I can check if a neighbor is in the current path by checking if it's in this set.

Once a cycle is detected, I can reconstruct the path from the current node to the neighbor using the parent dictionary.

Then, I can iterate through the edges in this path to find the minimum edge weight.

I need to store the edge weights in a dictionary for quick access.

I also need to make sure that the cycle path is stored correctly, including the edge that caused the cycle.

After finding the cycle, I can update the global minimum if this cycle has a smaller minimum edge weight.

Finally, after processing all nodes in all test cases, I can output the results.

This seems like a comprehensive plan.

I need to implement this carefully, paying attention to details such as handling multiple test cases, resetting data structures between test cases, and correctly reconstructing cycle paths.

I should also make sure that my code is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary operations that could lead to timeouts.

Now, I'll proceed to implement this plan in code.

## Final Solution

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Read the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`).
   - Build an adjacency list and store edge weights in a dictionary.

2. **Iterative DFS**:
   - Use a stack to simulate recursion, tracking the current path with a set.
   - Track parents to reconstruct cycles when a back edge is found.

3. **Cycle Detection and Evaluation**:
   - When a back edge is detected, reconstruct the cycle using parents.
   - Calculate the minimal edge weight in the cycle and track the smallest one.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the minimal weight and the cycle path.

This approach ensures efficiency and correctness, adhering to the problem constraints and guarantees.
