Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. So, Nikita has some cubes and he's building a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in each move. I need to determine if, after a certain number of moves, the tower can have exactly m cubes.

First, let's understand the problem clearly. Nikita starts with no cubes in the tower. Each move, he can either add one cube or remove one cube from the top. So, it's like he's manipulating the tower by increasing or decreasing its height by one cube at a time.

Given that, I need to find out if, after n moves, the tower can have exactly m cubes. I need to consider all possible sequences of adding and removing cubes to see if m is achievable.

Let me think about this in terms of additions and subtractions. Each add operation increases the number of cubes by one, and each remove operation decreases it by one, but only if there's at least one cube to remove.

Wait, but in the problem, it says he can remove exactly one cube from the top in one move, assuming there is one to remove. So, I need to be careful not to remove a cube when the tower is empty.

But in terms of possible sequences, what's the maximum and minimum number of cubes he can have after n moves?

Let's consider the maximum number of cubes he can have. That would be if he adds a cube in every move. So, the maximum is n.

The minimum would be if he tries to remove a cube in every move, but he can't remove more than what's there. So, if he starts with zero, he can't remove any cubes because there are none to remove. So, the minimum is 0.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully. If he alternates between adding and removing, he can end up with different amounts.

For example, if n=1 and m=1, he can add one cube and have m=1.

If n=2 and m=0, he can add one and then remove one, ending with m=0.

If n=3 and m=1, he can add, add, remove, ending with m=1.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, for n=3 and m=3, it's yes, which would mean he adds three times. For n=2 and m=4, it's no, which makes sense because he can't have more than n cubes if he only adds.

Wait, but n=5 and m=3 is yes in the example. So, how is that possible?

Let me see: if he adds 5 times, he has 5 cubes. But if he adds and removes in some sequence, he can end up with less.

Wait, but removing reduces the count, so to end up with m=3 after n=5 moves, he could have added 4 times and removed once, for example.

Wait, but in that case, 4 adds and 1 remove would be m=3, which matches.

So, in general, if he does a adds and b removes, where a + b = n, and a - b = m.

Because each add increases m by 1, and each remove decreases m by 1.

So, a - b = m and a + b = n.

I can solve these equations: a = (m + n)/2 and b = (n - m)/2.

For a and b to be non-negative integers, (m + n) must be even, and n >= m.

Because he can't remove more cubes than he has, so the number of removes can't exceed the number of adds.

Wait, but in reality, since he can't remove a cube that isn't there, there are some constraints on the order of operations.

For example, if he tries to remove a cube when the tower is empty, that operation can't happen.

But in terms of the final count, as long as a >= b, and a + b = n, and a - b = m, it should be possible.

But from a = (m + n)/2 and b = (n - m)/2, for a and b to be integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even as well, since both a and b must be integers.

Wait, actually, if (m + n) is even, then (n - m) is also even, because m + n and n - m differ by 2m, which is even.

So, if (m + n) is even, then both a and b are integers.

Moreover, a and b must be non-negative, so a >= 0 and b >= 0.

Given that a = (m + n)/2 >= 0 and b = (n - m)/2 >= 0.

Also, since he can't remove more cubes than he has at any point, the sequence must be such that the number of removes doesn't exceed the current number of cubes.

But if I just consider the final counts, as long as n >= m and (n - m) is even, it should be possible.

Wait, in the example, n=3, m=3: n - m = 0, which is even, and n >= m, so yes.

n=2, m=4: n < m, so no.

n=5, m=3: n - m = 2, which is even, and n >= m, so yes.

Seems consistent.

So, the condition is n >= m and (n - m) is even.

In the program, it's checking if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0, which matches this condition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
