Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked.

We have n cubes, each showing a value a_i. There's a favorite cube at index f (1-based). Dmitry sorts the cubes in non-increasing order based on their values and removes the first k cubes. I need to determine if the favorite cube is removed in all possible arrangements, not removed in any arrangement, or if it's uncertain.

First, I need to parse the input. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have n, f, k, and then the list of a_i.

I should pay attention to the fact that the sorting is non-increasing, meaning from largest to smallest, and that if there are ties, the order of those ties can be arbitrary.

My goal is to see where the favorite cube could end up after sorting and whether it's among the first k removed.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Step 1: Understand the sorting.

- Sorting in non-increasing order means the largest values come first.

- If there are multiple cubes with the same value, their relative order is unspecified.

Step 2: Determine the position of the favorite cube after sorting.

- Since the sorting is non-increasing, the position of the favorite cube depends on its value compared to others.

- If its value is unique, its position is determined.

- If its value is the same as others, its position can vary within the group of cubes with the same value.

Step 3: Check if the favorite cube is among the first k removed.

- If its position is within the first k, it's removed.

- If not, it's not removed.

- But since the order within equal values is arbitrary, I need to consider all possible positions within the group.

Let me think about the possible scenarios:

Case 1: The favorite cube's value is higher than the k-th cube's value.

- In this case, it will always be among the first k removed.

Case 2: The favorite cube's value is lower than the k-th cube's value.

- In this case, it will never be among the first k removed.

Case 3: The favorite cube's value is equal to the k-th cube's value.

- Here, its position relative to other cubes with the same value matters.

- It could be among the first k or not, depending on the arrangement.

So, I need to handle these cases accordingly.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

It reads n, f, k and adjusts f and k to 0-based indexing.

It reads the list a.

It stores the favorite cube's value in x.

It sorts a in reverse order (non-increasing).

Then, it checks the relationship between a[k] and x.

If a[k] > x, it prints 'NO'.

If a[k] < x, it prints 'YES'.

If a[k] == x, it checks if k is the last position or if a[k-1] < x, then prints 'YES', else 'MAYBE'.

Wait, this seems a bit off.

Let me think about what a[k] represents.

After sorting in non-increasing order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If x > a[k], then the favorite cube is among the top k and will be removed.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if a[k] > x.

So, if a[k] > x, that means x is less than the k-th largest value, so it's not among the top k, so 'NO'.

Similarly, if a[k] < x, then x is greater than the k-th largest value, so it is among the top k, 'YES'.

If a[k] == x, it's more complicated.

In this case, the favorite cube has the same value as a[k].

Now, depending on the arrangement of cubes with value x, it might or might not be among the first k.

So, in this case, it's possible that it's removed or not, hence 'MAYBE'.

But the code has a condition: 'YES' if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x else 'MAYBE'

Wait, if k == n-1, that means we're removing the last cube, so regardless, the favorite cube would be removed.

But k is 0-based, so k == n-1 corresponds to removing the n-th cube, which is the last one.

Also, if a[k-1] < x, that means the (k)-th cube is x, and the (k-1)-th cube is smaller, so all cubes before k have values greater than x, and the cubes after k have values less than or equal to x.

Wait, but since it's sorted in non-increasing order, a[k] >= a[k+1].

If a[k] == x and a[k-1] < x, then all cubes before k have values greater than x, and at position k, it's x.

So, the favorite cube is at position k, and it's removed.

Hence, 'YES'.

Otherwise, if a[k-1] == x, then there are multiple cubes with value x, and their order is arbitrary.

In this case, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not, hence 'MAYBE'.

So, the code seems to be handling this correctly.

Wait, but in the condition, it's 'YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE'.

But when k == n - 1, it's removing the last cube, which is the smallest one.

So, if k == n - 1, and a[k] == x, then the favorite cube is the last one removed.

But according to the condition, it would print 'YES', meaning it's removed.

But actually, if k == n - 1, and a[k] == x, it means the favorite cube is the last one, and it's being removed.

So, 'YES' is correct.

Also, if a[k - 1] < x, meaning the cube just before k has a value less than x, but since it's sorted in non-increasing order, this should not happen because a[k - 1] should be >= a[k].

Wait, but if a[k] == x and a[k - 1] > x, then it means that at position k, it's x, and before that, it's larger than x.

So, the favorite cube is exactly at position k, and it's removed.

Hence, 'YES'.

If a[k - 1] == x, then there are multiple cubes with value x, and their order is arbitrary, so the favorite cube could be among the first k or not.

Hence, 'MAYBE'.

So, the code seems correct.

Let me check with some examples.

Example 1:

Input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

After sorting: [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]

k = 2 (0-based), so removing the first 2 cubes.

a[k] = 3

x = a[1] = 3

So, a[k] == x.

Now, check if k == n - 1 (4 == 4? No) or a[k - 1] < x.

a[k - 1] = a[1] = 3 < x=3? No.

So, 'MAYBE'

Which matches the sample output.

Example 2:

Input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

After sorting: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

k=3 (0-based), removing first 3 cubes.

a[k]=2

x=a[4]=1

a[k]=2 > x=1, so 'NO'

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's "YES". Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the sample input, for this case, it's "YES". But according to this, it should be 'NO'.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the test case mapping.

Wait, the sample input has 12 test cases, but I'm looking at the first few.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the correct test case.

Wait, in the sample input, the second test case is:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

And the output is "YES"

But according to my calculation, it should be 'NO'.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let's double-check.

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

x = a[4] = 1

a[k=3-1=2] = 2

Since 2 > 1, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, this is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output.

Wait, the first test case is:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

Output: MAYBE

Second test case:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

Output: YES

But according to my calculation, it should be 'NO'.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the 0-based indexing correctly.

Wait, in Python, list indices start at 0.

In the code, f -=1 and k -=1, so f is now 0-based, k is 0-based.

But in the sorting, a is sorted in reverse.

Then, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest.

In the second test case:

n=5, f=5-1=4, k=3-1=2

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

After sorting: [5,4,3,2,1]

x = a[4] =1

a[k=2] =2

Since 2 >1, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This inconsistency suggests that there might be an error in the code.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, looking back:

Sample input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

...

Sample output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for the second test case, it's "YES"

But according to my calculation, it should be 'NO'

This discrepancy indicates a problem with the code.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the logic.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

In the second test case:

a[k=2] =2 > x=1, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition is reversed.

Wait, maybe it should be:

if a[k] < x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] > x:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO' if k == n - 1 and a[k - 1] > x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the first k cubes are removed.

If the favorite cube's value is greater than a[k], it will always be among the first k and removed.

If it's less than a[k], it will never be among the first k.

If it's equal to a[k], it depends on the arrangement within the group of cubes with value a[k].

So, in the second test case:

a_sorted = [5,4,3,2,1]

x=1

a[k=2]=2 >1, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This suggests that the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider 1-based vs 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the code, f -=1 and k -=1, which makes them 0-based.

n=5, f=4, k=2

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

a_sorted=[5,4,3,2,1]

x=1

a[k=2]=2 >1, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says:

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed.

Output is "MAYBE" for this case.

But in the second test case:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

Output: "YES"

Given the inconsistency, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the condition should be:

if a[k-1] > x:

print('YES')

elif a[k-1] < x:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to find the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting.

Given that sorting is non-increasing, and ties can be in any order.

So, after sorting, the positions are determined by value, with higher values first, and equal values can be in any order.

I need to find the range of possible positions for the favorite cube.

Then, check if this range is fully within the first k positions, fully outside, or partially overlapping.

If fully within, output 'YES'

If fully outside, output 'NO'

If partially overlapping, output 'MAYBE'

To find the possible positions, I need to find the positions where the value is equal to x.

Wait, perhaps I should count how many cubes have value greater than x, equal to x.

Let me formalize this.

Let:

- count_gt = number of cubes with value > x

- count_eq = number of cubes with value == x

Then, after sorting:

- The cubes with value > x come first.

- Then cubes with value == x.

- Then cubes with value < x.

Now, the favorite cube can be anywhere within the count_eq positions.

So, the possible positions of the favorite cube are from count_gt to count_gt + count_eq -1 (0-based).

Then, if k >= count_gt + count_eq, i.e., removing up to the position k-1 >= count_gt + count_eq -1, then it's possible that the favorite cube is removed.

Wait, I need to think carefully.

Let's define:

- The positions are from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the highest value.

- If k cubes are removed, which are positions 0 to k-1.

- The favorite cube is at some position p, where count_gt <= p <= count_gt + count_eq -1.

Now, if count_gt + count_eq -1 < k, then p < k, so it's always removed.

If count_gt >= k, then p >= k, so it's never removed.

If count_gt <= k <= count_gt + count_eq -1, then it depends on p.

So, in code terms:

- Find count_gt: number of a_i > x

- Find count_eq: number of a_i == x

- If count_gt >= k, then 'NO' (favorite cube is at p >= k, not removed)

- If count_gt + count_eq -1 < k, then 'YES' (favorite cube is at p < k, removed)

- Else, 'MAYBE'

Wait, but in the code provided, it's sorting a and checking a[k] with x.

I think this approach is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to map this logic to the code.

In the code:

- Sort a in reverse.

- Check a[k] with x.

- If a[k] > x, then 'NO'

- If a[k] < x, then 'YES'

- If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, then 'YES'

- Else, 'MAYBE'

But in my logic:

- count_gt = number of a_i > x

- count_eq = number of a_i == x

- If count_gt >=k, 'NO'

- If count_gt + count_eq -1 <k, 'YES'

- Else, 'MAYBE'

I need to see if these two logics are equivalent.

Let's see.

After sorting in reverse, a[k] is the k-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, then x is less than the k-th largest, so it's not among the first k, hence 'NO'

If a[k] < x, then x is greater than the k-th largest, so it's among the first k, hence 'YES'

If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1, meaning we're removing up to the last cube, so 'YES'

- Or if a[k-1] < x, which would mean that a[k] is the smallest among the first k, so x is exactly at position k, hence 'YES'

- Else, 'MAYBE'

Wait, but in my earlier logic, it's based on count_gt and count_eq.

I need to see if both logics coincide.

Let me consider:

- count_gt = number of a_i > x

- If count_gt >=k, then 'NO'

- Because the favorite cube, with value x, is at position >=k

- If count_gt + count_eq -1 <k, then 'YES'

- Because the favorite cube is at position <k

- Else, 'MAYBE'

Now, in the code's logic:

- If a[k] > x, 'NO'

- Which corresponds to count_gt >=k

- If a[k] < x, 'YES'

- Which corresponds to count_gt + count_eq <=k

- If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, 'YES'

- Else, 'MAYBE'

Wait, but if a[k] == x and a[k-1] < x, that means that a[k] is the smallest among the first k, so count_gt + count_eq -1 <k, which should be 'YES'

Otherwise, 'MAYBE'

So, it seems that the code's logic aligns with my count-based logic.

Therefore, the code should be correct.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier test case analysis.

Let's re-examine the second test case:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=a[4]=1

count_gt = number of a_i >1, which are 4,2,3,5 =>4

count_eq=1 (only a[4]=1)

So, count_gt=4, count_eq=1

k=3

If count_gt >=k, which is 4>=3, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This contradiction suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my logic, it should be 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that removing k cubes means removing the first k cubes after sorting.

In the second test case:

a_sorted=[5,4,3,2,1]

k=3, so removing the first 3 cubes: 5,4,3

The favorite cube is 1, which is not among the first 3, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This suggests that either the sample output is wrong or my logic is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the favorite cube could be among the removed ones if its value is >= a[k]

Wait, but in this case, a[k]=2 > x=1, so x < a[k], so it's not among the removed ones.

But sample output is "YES", which contradicts.

This indicates that either the sample output is incorrect or there's a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, maybe I need to re-read the problem.

"he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order."

"he removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have changed after sorting)."

"For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

- After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

- After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed."

Wait, in this example, the output is "MAYBE", which aligns with the logic that the favorite cube could be removed or not, depending on the arrangement within the equal values.

But in the second test case, according to my calculation, it should be 'NO', but the sample output is "YES"

This inconsistency suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

12

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

...

Output:

MAYBE

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

MAYBE

MAYBE

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for the second test case (5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5), output is "YES"

But according to my logic, it should be 'NO'

This suggests that either the sample output is incorrect or my logic is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that k is removed, but the output is "YES", meaning that the favorite cube is always removed.

Wait, in this case, a_sorted=[5,4,3,2,1], x=1, k=3, removing 5,4,3

So, favorite cube is not removed.

But output is "YES", which suggests that the favorite cube is always removed.

This contradiction implies that there's a mistake in the code or my understanding.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that k cubes are removed, starting from the highest.

So, in this case, removing the top 3 cubes: 5,4,3

The favorite cube is 1, which is not among them, so should be 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This suggests that either the sample output is wrong or there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that k cubes are removed, starting from the highest, but if the favorite cube is among the top k, it's removed.

In this case, x=1 is not among the top 3, so 'NO'

But sample output is "YES"

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the problem statement again.

"he arranged the cubes in non-increasing order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same value, they can go in any order."

"he removed the first k cubes."

"he became interested in whether he removed his favorite cube"

"For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

- After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

- After sorting a=[4, 3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed."

"Output:

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either removed or left."

In the second test case, according to the sample output, it's "YES", meaning that the favorite cube is always removed.

But according to my calculation, it should be 'NO'

This suggests that either the sample output is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Wait, in the second test case:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=a[
