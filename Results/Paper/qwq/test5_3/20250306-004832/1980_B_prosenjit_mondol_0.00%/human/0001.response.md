Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f, and he's going to sort all the cubes in non-increasing order based on their values. After sorting, he removes the first k cubes and wants to know if his favorite cube is among those removed.

First, I need to understand the input and output requirements. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with three integers: n, f, and k. Then, there's a list of n integers representing the values on the cubes. For each test case, I need to output "YES" if the favorite cube is always removed, "NO" if it's never removed, or "MAYBE" if it could go either way.

Okay, so let's think about how the sorting works. The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, meaning from largest to smallest. If there are ties, the order of cubes with the same value is unspecified, which means they can be in any order relative to each other.

My goal is to determine whether the favorite cube, which has value x (where x = a[f]), is among the first k cubes after sorting.

Given that ties can be in any order, I need to consider different possible arrangements of the cubes with the same value.

Let me consider the extreme cases:

1. If x is larger than all other cubes, then it will be in the first position after sorting, and it will be removed if k >=1.

2. If x is smaller than all other cubes, it will be in the last position after sorting, and it won't be removed unless k >= n.

3. If there are cubes with the same value as x, then the position of the favorite cube depends on how the ties are ordered.

So, I need to consider the best and worst-case scenarios for the favorite cube being removed.

I think I need to find the highest and lowest possible positions the favorite cube can have after sorting.

- The highest position it can have is when it's sorted as early as possible, meaning it's considered larger or equal to others.

- The lowest position is when it's sorted as late as possible, meaning it's considered smaller or equal to others.

Given that, I can determine:

- If the highest possible position is still within the first k, then it's always removed ("YES").

- If the lowest possible position is still within the first k, then it might or might not be removed, depending on the arrangement ("MAYBE").

- If the lowest possible position is beyond the first k, then it's never removed ("NO").

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many cubes have values greater than x, and how many have values equal to x.

Let's define:

- Let count_gt be the number of cubes with values greater than x.

- Let count_eq be the number of cubes with values equal to x.

So, the favorite cube has value x, and there are count_eq cubes with the same value.

In the sorted list, the positions of these count_eq cubes can be anywhere within a block of positions where the value is x.

The first few cubes will have values greater than x, then the cubes with value x can be in the next positions, and so on.

So, the first count_gt cubes have values greater than x.

Then, the next count_eq cubes have value x.

Therefore, the positions of the cubes with value x are from position count_gt +1 to count_gt + count_eq.

Now, since the sorting is non-increasing, positions are from 1 to n.

So, the favorite cube could be in any position from p_low to p_high, where:

p_low = count_gt +1

p_high = count_gt + count_eq

Now, if p_high <= k, then the favorite cube is always removed, because even in the lowest possible position, it's still within the first k.

If p_low > k, then the favorite cube is never removed, because even in the highest possible position, it's beyond the first k.

If p_low <= k < p_high, then it's possible for the favorite cube to be removed or not, depending on its exact position.

Therefore, the output should be:

- "YES" if p_high <= k

- "NO" if p_low > k

- "MAYBE" otherwise

Wait, but I need to make sure about the indices.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

x = a[1] = 3

count_gt = number of cubes with value >3, which is 1 (the cube with value 4)

count_eq = number of cubes with value ==3, which is 3

So, p_low = 1 + 1 = 2

p_high = 1 + 3 = 4

k=2

So, p_low <= k < p_high, which is 2 <= 2 < 4, so "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=a[4]=5

count_gt=0 (no cube has value >5)

count_eq=1 (only one cube with value 5)

p_low=1

p_high=1

k=3

p_high <=k, so "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

x=3

count_gt=2 (5 and 4)

count_eq=1 (3)

p_low=3+1=4

p_high=4

k=2

p_high >k, so "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, in the code provided, let's see what it's doing.

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

So, it's processing each test case one by one.

It reads n, f, k, then the list a.

It adjusts f and k to 0-based indexing.

Then, it sorts a in reverse order.

Then, it checks:

- if a[k] > x: print 'NO'

- elif a[k] < x: print 'YES'

- else: print 'YES' if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x else 'MAYBE'

Wait, is this correct?

Let me compare it with my earlier reasoning.

In my reasoning:

- p_low = count_gt +1

- p_high = count_gt + count_eq

- if p_high <=k: "YES"

- elif p_low >k: "NO"

- else: "MAYBE"

In the code:

- It sorts a in reverse order.

- Then, checks a[k] with x.

- If a[k] > x: print 'NO'

- elif a[k] < x: print 'YES'

- else: print 'YES' if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x else 'MAYBE'

Wait, is this equivalent?

Let me see.

After sorting in reverse order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest element.

If a[k] > x, that means the (k+1)-th largest element is greater than x.

So, all elements up to position k are greater than x.

Therefore, the positions where x can be are from p_low onwards, which would be after position k.

Since p_low >=k+1, but k is 0-based, so position k+1 in 1-based indexing.

Wait, I'm getting confused with 0-based and 1-based indexing.

Let me clarify:

In the code, k is adjusted to 0-based, so k ranges from 0 to n-1.

a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest element.

If a[k] > x, that means the (k+1)-th largest element is greater than x.

So, the first k+1 elements are all greater than x.

Therefore, the positions where x can be are from p_low = count_gt +1 onwards.

But count_gt is the number of elements greater than x.

So, p_low = count_gt +1

If count_gt +1 > k +1, which is count_gt > k, then p_low > k+1, which means the favorite cube is not among the first k+1 elements, so not removed.

Wait, but in the code, if a[k] > x, it prints 'NO', meaning the favorite cube is not removed.

So, is this consistent?

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, if p_low >k+1, then "NO"

So, in the code, if a[k] > x, which implies count_gt > k, then p_low >k+1, so "NO"

Therefore, this seems correct.

Next, if a[k] < x, which means the (k+1)-th largest element is less than x.

That implies that the first k elements are all greater than or equal to x.

But since a[k] < x, the elements before k are greater than x.

So, count_gt = k

And count_eq = number of elements equal to x.

But since a[k] < x, count_eq are all before position k.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

If a[k] < x, that means x is larger than the (k+1)-th largest element.

So, x is among the top k elements.

Therefore, the favorite cube is always removed.

Hence, "YES"

Which matches the code.

Now, if a[k] == x, which is the else case.

In this case, the (k+1)-th largest element is equal to x.

So, the positions where x can be range from p_low to p_high.

We need to see if p_high <=k or p_low >k, etc.

Wait, in the code, it prints 'YES' if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, else 'MAYBE'

So, let's see:

If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1, which is the last position, then it's removed (since k cubes are removed, and k == n-1 means removing all but the last one).

- Or, if a[k-1] < x, which means the k-th largest element is x, and the (k+1)-th is less than x.

In this case, all elements from 1 to k include all elements >=x, so the favorite cube is among them.

Hence, "YES"

Otherwise, it's 'MAYBE'

So, is this correct?

Let me verify.

If a[k] == x, and k == n-1, then p_high = count_gt + count_eq

If k == n-1, then p_high <=k+1, because p_high <= n, and k+1 == n.

So, p_high <=k+1, which should be "YES"

Alternatively, if a[k-1] < x, which means the k-th largest element is x, and the (k+1)-th is less than x.

This means that all elements from 1 to k are >=x, and the rest are <x.

Therefore, all cubes with value x are within the first k, so "YES"

Otherwise, if a[k-1] == x, then there are cubes with value x beyond k, so it could be removed or not, hence "MAYBE"

Yes, this seems correct.

Therefore, the given code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
