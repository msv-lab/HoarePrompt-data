Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to create an array of length n, where each element is between 1 and 10^9, and exactly k out of the n possible cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is obtained by taking the elements starting from the x-th position and then wrapping around to the beginning. For example, if n=4 and a=[1,2,3,3], the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1,2,3,3] (original array)

- x=2: [2,3,3,1]

- x=3: [3,3,1,2]

- x=4: [3,1,2,3]

Out of these, only the first one is sorted.

So, the task is to construct an array such that exactly k of these n shifts are sorted.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n can be up to 10^3, and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^3, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^3. That means I need an efficient solution.

- k can be from 1 to n, inclusive.

I need to find any array that satisfies the condition, or determine that no such array exists.

Let me consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

n=2, k=2

Possible array: [1,1]

Cyclic shifts:

- [1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1] (sorted)

So, both shifts are sorted, which matches k=2.

Another possible array: [1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2] (sorted)

- [2,1] (not sorted)

Only one shift is sorted, which is k=1.

So, to have k=2 for n=2, all shifts must be sorted. This seems to require that all elements in the array are equal.

Wait, in the first example, [1,1] works for k=2, but [1,2] works for k=1.

So, for k=2 (which is n=2), all elements need to be equal.

Similarly, for n=3, k=1:

One possible array is [69420,69,420]

Shifts:

- [69420,69,420] (not sorted)

- [69,420,69420] (sorted)

- [420,69420,69] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which matches k=1.

Another example: n=3, k=2

The output is -1, meaning no such array exists.

Hmm, interesting.

So, for n=3, k=2, there is no array where exactly two cyclic shifts are sorted.

I need to find a general way to determine whether such an array exists for given n and k, and if it does, construct one.

Let me think about the properties of cyclic shifts and sortedness.

Suppose I have an array where all elements are equal. Then, all cyclic shifts are sorted because the array is non-decreasing.

So, for any n, if k=n, I can just set all elements to be the same.

Similarly, if k=1, I need exactly one cyclic shift to be sorted.

From the example, for n=3, k=1, an array like [69420,69,420] works.

But for n=3, k=2, it's impossible.

I need to find a pattern or a condition that determines when such an array exists.

Let me consider the minimal case where n=1.

For n=1, k must be 1, since there's only one shift, which is the array itself. So, [any number] would work.

Now, for n=2:

- k=1: [1,2] works

- k=2: [1,1] works

- k=0: Is it possible to have no sorted cyclic shifts? Let's see:

Possible array: [2,1]

Shifts:

- [2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2] (sorted)

So, only one shift is sorted, which is k=1. So, no array exists for k=0.

Hence, for n=2, k=0 is impossible.

But according to the problem, k is at least 1, so k=0 is not a concern.

Wait, the problem says 1 ≤ k ≤ n, so k=0 is not allowed.

Wait, no, it says 1 ≤ k ≤ n, but in the problem statement, it's 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

Wait, double-check:

"exactly k of them are sorted."

"k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3)"

So, k can be from 1 to n, inclusive.

Hence, k=0 is not allowed, as per the problem constraints.

Good.

Now, for n=3, k=1: possible, as shown in the example.

n=3, k=2: impossible, as per the example output of -1.

n=3, k=3: possible by setting all elements equal.

So, for n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible, but k=2 is not.

Similarly, for n=4:

- k=1: is it possible?

- k=2: is it possible?

- k=3: is it possible?

- k=4: possible by setting all elements equal.

Let me try n=4, k=1.

Possible array: [4,1,2,3]

Shifts:

- [4,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,1,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, so k=1.

For n=4, k=2:

Is there an array where exactly two cyclic shifts are sorted?

Let me try [1,2,3,4]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, so k=1.

Not enough.

Another attempt: [1,2,2,1]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

So, two sorted shifts, k=2.

Wait, this seems to work.

So, for n=4, k=2 is possible with [1,2,2,1].

But according to the example for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me consider the number of sorted cyclic shifts in relation to the array's structure.

Suppose I have an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order. Then, all its cyclic shifts are sorted only if the array is constant.

Wait, no. If the array is sorted and not constant, some cyclic shifts may not be sorted.

For example, [1,2,3,4] has only one sorted shift.

Wait, in the earlier example, [1,2,2,1] has two sorted shifts.

I need to find a relationship between the array's structure and the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

Let me consider that an array has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts if there are exactly k starting positions x where the cyclic shift starting at x is sorted.

So, I need to find an array where exactly k such starting positions exist.

Is there a way to count the number of sorted cyclic shifts for a given array?

Yes, by checking for each starting position x whether the cyclic shift is sorted.

But I need to find an array that has exactly k such positions.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the array's periodicity or some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the array as a sequence where certain conditions are met to achieve exactly k sorted shifts.

Let me consider that for an array to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts, the array must have some repeating pattern that allows exactly k shifts to be sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k and n.

For example, if k divides n, maybe there's a way to construct such an array.

Wait, in the first example, n=2, k=2: k divides n.

n=3, k=1: k divides n only if k=1, which always divides n.

n=3, k=3: k divides n.

n=4, k=2: k divides n.

n=4, k=4: k divides n.

But in n=3, k=2: k does not divide n, and it's impossible.

So, maybe a necessary condition is that k divides n.

But is it sufficient?

In n=4, k=2: k divides n, and it's possible.

n=4, k=1: k divides n (since 1 divides any n), and it's possible.

n=4, k=4: possible.

So, in these cases, k dividing n seems to be sufficient.

But wait, n=3, k=1: k divides n, and it's possible.

n=3, k=2: k does not divide n, and it's impossible.

n=3, k=3: k divides n, and it's possible.

Similarly, n=4, k=2: possible.

Wait, but n=4, k=3: k=3 does not divide n=4, so perhaps it's impossible.

Wait, but n=4, k=3 is not in the examples.

Let me check n=4, k=3.

Is there an array where exactly three cyclic shifts are sorted?

Let me try [1,1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Not enough.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Two sorted shifts, k=2.

Still not enough.

Another attempt: [1,1,1,1]

All shifts are sorted, k=4.

Not k=3.

Another attempt: [1,1,1,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,3] (sorted)

- [1,1,3,1] (not sorted)

- [1,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Seems like it's impossible to have exactly three sorted shifts for n=4.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that k must divide n.

In which case, for n=4, k=2 is allowed because 2 divides 4, and k=4 because 4 divides 4, and k=1 because 1 divides 4, but k=3 is not allowed because 3 does not divide 4.

Similarly, for n=3, k=1 and k=3 are allowed, but k=2 is not.

So, perhaps the general rule is that k must be a divisor of n.

Is that always the case?

Let me check for n=1: k=1, which divides 1.

n=2: k=1 and k=2, both divisors of 2.

n=3: k=1 and k=3, both divisors of 3.

n=4: k=1,2,4, all divisors of 4.

Seems consistent.

So, perhaps the condition is that k must be a divisor of n.

But is this always true?

Let me check for n=5, k=1: possible with [1,2,3,4,5], which has only one sorted shift.

n=5, k=5: [1,1,1,1,1], all shifts sorted.

n=5, k=2: is 2 a divisor of 5? No, because 5 is prime.

So, k=2 and k=3 and k=4 should not be possible for n=5.

Let me try n=5, k=2.

Is there an array where exactly two cyclic shifts are sorted?

Probably not, given that 2 does not divide 5.

Hence, perhaps the general rule is that k must be a divisor of n.

But is this sufficient?

In other words, if k divides n, then such an array exists.

From earlier examples, it seems to hold.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider n=4, k=2.

We saw that [1,2,2,1] has exactly two sorted shifts.

Similarly, for n=6, k=2: since 2 divides 6, it should be possible.

Let me try [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,3,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Here, three shifts are sorted, which is more than k=2.

Not what I need.

Another attempt: [1,2,1,2,3,4]

Shifts:

- [1,2,1,2,3,4] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,3,4,1,2] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,1,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,1,2,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which is less than k=2.

Not enough.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,3,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Three sorted shifts, which is more than k=2.

Still not what I need.

Perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think about constructing an array where the number of sorted cyclic shifts is exactly k.

If k divides n, perhaps I can repeat a certain pattern that ensures every n/k -th shift is sorted.

Wait, let's consider that.

If k divides n, then n/k is an integer, say m.

So, m = n/k.

Then, if I create an array where every m positions, the pattern repeats in a way that ensures the shift is sorted.

Wait, maybe I can divide the array into k equal parts, each of size m = n/k, and arrange the elements such that only the shifts starting at the beginning of each part are sorted.

Is that possible?

Let me try with n=4, k=2, m=2.

Array: [1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Here, shifts at positions 1 and 3 are sorted.

So, exactly two sorted shifts.

This matches k=2.

Similarly, for n=6, k=2, m=3.

Array: [1,1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only shifts at positions 1 and 4 are sorted.

Hence, exactly two sorted shifts.

So, this seems to work.

Generalizing, for k dividing n, set m = n/k.

Then, divide the array into k blocks of size m.

In each block, set the elements to be equal and increasing from block to block.

Wait, in the above example, [1,1,1,2,2,2], blocks are [1,1,1] and [2,2,2].

Then, only shifts starting at the beginning of each block are sorted.

Similarly, for n=4, k=2, m=2: [1,1,2,2], shifts at positions 1 and 3 are sorted.

So, this seems to be a general approach.

Now, for k=1, m=n/1 = n.

So, only one block of size n, meaning all elements equal, which makes all shifts sorted, but k=1 requires only one sorted shift.

Wait, this contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the approach for k=1.

Wait, in the earlier example for n=3, k=1: [69420,69,420]

This is not following the pattern above.

So, perhaps for k=1, it's a special case.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps for k=1, I can set the array to be strictly increasing except for one element that breaks the sortedness in all other shifts.

Wait, that might be too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set one element to be much larger or smaller than the others to ensure only one shift is sorted.

Like in the example: [69420,69,420]

Here, 69420 is large, 69 is small, and 420 is in between.

So, only the shift starting at index 2: [69,420,69420] is sorted.

The other shifts are not sorted due to the discrepancy in element values.

So, for k=1, perhaps I can set the array such that there's only one shift where the elements are in increasing order.

Similarly, for k greater than 1, but dividing n, I can divide the array into k blocks of equal size m = n/k, and set each block to have equal elements, with each block's element value increasing from one block to the next.

This seems to work for the cases I've tried.

Hence, perhaps the general solution is:

- If k divides n, then construct the array as described above.

- If k does not divide n, then no such array exists.

But wait, in the example for n=3, k=1, which does not fit into this pattern since k=1 divides n=3, but in that case, the array is not composed of blocks as in the earlier examples.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve k sorted shifts, but the condition remains that k divides n.

So, perhaps the key condition is that k divides n, and based on that, we can construct the array accordingly.

Hence, in the code, I can check if k divides n.

If yes, construct the array as per the pattern.

If not, output -1.

But in the provided code, it seems to handle k >=2 and k=1 separately.

Let me look at the provided code:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

if k >= 2:

if n == k:

print(*[k for j in range(k)])

else:

print('-1')

else:

print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])

So, for k >=2:

- If n == k, print an array where all elements are equal to k.

- Else, print -1.

For k ==1:

- Print an array [1,2,3,...,n]

Wait, is this correct?

Let's verify.

First, for k >=2:

- If n == k, print [k,k,k,...,k] (n times)

- Else, print -1.

From earlier reasoning, if k divides n, then such an array exists.

So, for k >=2:

- If k divides n, then n % k ==0.

- If n ==k, then n % k ==0.

Wait, but n ==k implies n % k ==0.

But n % k ==0 is a more general condition.

For example, n=4, k=2: n % k ==0.

In this case, the code prints -1, which is incorrect because, as shown earlier, an array like [1,1,2,2] works for n=4, k=2.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect for k >=2.

It only handles the case when n ==k, but not when n !=k but k divides n.

Hence, the code is incomplete.

Additionally, for k==1, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which is not correct because, as shown earlier, for n=3, k=1, [1,2,3] would have only one sorted shift, which is the array itself.

But in the example, [69420,69,420] is given, which also has only one sorted shift.

However, [1,2,3] for n=3, k=1 would have one sorted shift, which is [1,2,3].

But according to the problem, for n=3, k=1, [69420,69,420] is acceptable.

So, [1,2,3] should also be acceptable for n=3, k=1.

But in the example, for n=3, k=1, the output is [69420,69,420].

So, perhaps the problem expects a different kind of array for k=1.

Wait, but [1,2,3] should also work for n=3, k=1.

Hence, the provided code's approach for k==1 is acceptable.

But for k >=2, it's incomplete.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists an array of length \( n \) with exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts that are sorted. We need to output such an array if it exists, or `-1` otherwise.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Cyclic Shifts and Sortedness**:
   - A cyclic shift of an array is created by rotating its elements.
   - We need exactly \( k \) of these shifts to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For an array to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts, \( k \) must be a divisor of \( n \) (i.e., \( n \% k == 0 \)).
   - If \( k \) divides \( n \), we can construct an array where every \( \frac{n}{k} \) elements form a block of equal values, and these blocks increase progressively.

3. **Construction of Array**:
   - For \( k \) dividing \( n \), create blocks of size \( \frac{n}{k} \), each with equal values, and ensure that each block's value is greater than the previous block's value.
   - For \( k = 1 \), we can simply create an array that is only sorted in one specific cyclic shift.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k = n \), setting all elements equal ensures all shifts are sorted.
   - If \( k = 1 \), constructing an array where only one specific shift is sorted.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    for s in data[1:t+1]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            # For k=1, construct an array with only one sorted cyclic shift
            a = [1] * n
            a[0] = n
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        elif n % k == 0:
            # For k dividing n, construct blocks of size n/k with increasing values
            m = n // k
            a = []
            val = 1
            for _ in range(k):
                a.extend([val] * m)
                val += 1
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        else:
            print('-1')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input lines at once for efficiency.
   - Extract the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k = 1 \), create an array where all elements are 1 except the first element set to \( n \). This ensures only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - If \( k \) divides \( n \), create blocks of size \( \frac{n}{k} \), each filled with an increasing value to ensure only specific shifts are sorted.
   - If \( k \) does not divide \( n \), output `-1` since no such array exists.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the constructed array if it meets the criteria, otherwise print `-1`.

This approach ensures that we handle all cases efficiently and correctly, adhering to the problem constraints.
