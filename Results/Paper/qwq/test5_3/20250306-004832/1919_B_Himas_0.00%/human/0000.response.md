Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The penalty for each substring is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its values (where "+" is 1 and "-" is -1) multiplied by its length.

First, I need to understand what the penalty really means. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value means we just care about the magnitude of the sum, regardless of direction. Then, multiplying by the length gives a penalty that increases both with the magnitude of the sum and the length of the substring.

My goal is to split the string into parts such that the sum of these penalties is minimized.

Let me consider some examples to get a feel for this.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1.

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty 5.

Alternatively, if I split into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], the penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse.

So, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty in this case.

Third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split into [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1], the sum is 0, so penalty is |0| * 6 = 0.

Alternatively, splitting into [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1], each has sum 0, penalty 0, total 0.

So, in this case, both ways give the same total penalty.

Fourth example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

So, a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

If I split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ], sum is 7, penalty is |7| * 10 = 70.

Alternatively, split into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ].

Penalty for first part: | -2 | * 2 = 4

Penalty for second part: | +7 | * 7 = 49

Penalty for third part: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54, which is better than 70.

But apparently, according to the sample output, the minimum penalty is 4. So, there must be a better way to split.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First part sum: +7, penalty: |7| * 9 = 63

Second part: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total: 64, which is worse than 54.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Second: | +7 | * 8 = 56

Third: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total: 1 + 56 + 1 = 58, which is worse than 54.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, which is much better than 54. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: sum = 4 - 2 = 2, penalty: |2| * 6 = 12

Second part: sum = 1 + 1 -1 = 1, penalty: |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 12 + 3 = 15, better than 54.

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: sum = -1 -1 +1 +1 = 0, penalty: |0| * 4 = 0

Second part: sum = 1 +1 +1 -1 = 2, penalty: |2| * 4 = 8

Total: 0 + 8 = 8, better than 15.

Still not 4.

Is there a way to split it to get penalty 4?

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First part: sum = -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 = 1, penalty: |1| * 5 = 5

Second part: sum = 1 +1 -1 = 1, penalty: |1| * 3 = 3

Total: 5 + 3 = 8.

Same as above.

Alternatively, [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: sum = 0, penalty 0

Second: sum = 2, penalty: |2| * 2 = 4

Third: sum = 0, penalty 0

Total: 0 + 4 + 0 = 4.

Ah, there it is. So, splitting into three parts gives a total penalty of 4.

This suggests that splitting in a certain way can lead to minimal penalty.

Now, looking at the problem, I need to find a general way to split any given string to minimize the total penalty.

I need to think about what makes a good split.

First, recall that the penalty for a substring is |sum of its elements| * length of the substring.

I need to minimize the sum of these penalties over all substrings in the split.

I should consider dynamic programming, as it's a minimization problem over substrings.

Let me define dp[i], which represents the minimum total penalty for the substring ending at position i.

I need to consider all possible ways to split the string up to position i, and choose the one with the minimal total penalty.

To compute dp[i], I can look at all possible split points j, where j < i, and compute dp[j] + penalty for the substring from j+1 to i.

Then, dp[i] would be the minimum over all such choices.

Finally, dp[n] would give the minimum total penalty for the entire string.

This seems like a feasible approach.

But, considering the constraints, n can be up to 5000, and t can be up to 1000, which means that a O(n^2) solution per test case would be too slow, as it would result in up to 5000 * 5000 * 1000 = 2.5 * 10^10 operations, which is unacceptable.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can consider the entire array as one substring and calculate its penalty, or split it into smaller substrings where the sum is zero, since penalty is zero for those.

Wait, in the third example, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives minimal penalty.

But in the fourth example, splitting into substrings with sum zero and minimal length gives better results.

Wait, in the fourth example, splitting into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ] gives penalties 0, 2*2=4, 0, totaling 4, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the string into substrings where the sum is zero, and if not possible, choose substrings with minimal absolute sum multiplied by their length.

But, this seems vague.

Let me think about the properties of such splits.

Suppose I have a substring with sum S and length L. Its penalty is |S| * L.

If I can split this substring into two parts with sums S1 and S2, and lengths L1 and L2, respectively, then the total penalty would be |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2.

I need to choose splits where |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2 < |S| * L.

This suggests that splitting is beneficial only if the sum of penalties of the parts is less than the penalty of the whole.

I need to find a way to split the string such that this condition is met as much as possible.

Another approach: consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I can think of sum as the difference between the number of "+" and "-" in the substring.

Wait, more precisely, sum = (number of "+") - (number of "-").

So, |sum| = |(number of "+") - (number of "-")|.

And length = number of "+" + number of "-".

So, penalty = |(number of "+") - (number of "-")| * (number of "+" + number of "-").

This seems like a function that can be minimized by balancing the number of "+" and "-" in each substring.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider the overall sum of the entire array.

If the entire array has sum S and length N, then the penalty would be |S| * N.

If I split the array into k substrings, each with sum S_i and length L_i, then the total penalty is sum over i of |S_i| * L_i.

I need to minimize this sum.

I need to find a way to split the array such that this sum is minimized.

I recall that in optimization problems involving sums over substrings, sometimes it's optimal to split at points where a certain cumulative sum repeats.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the cumulative sum as I traverse the string.

Let's define cum_sum[i] as the cumulative sum up to position i.

So, cum_sum[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i].

Then, the sum of a substring from j to i is cum_sum[i] - cum_sum[j-1].

And its penalty would be |cum_sum[i] - cum_sum[j-1]| * (i - j + 1).

I need to choose j's such that this expression, summed over all substrings, is minimized.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look for places where the cumulative sum returns to the same value, indicating that the sum of the substring between those places is zero, hence penalty zero.

In the fourth example, cum_sum would be:

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

a: -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -1

cum_sum: -1 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4

So, cum_sum values: [0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Wait, cum_sum[2] = -1, cum_sum[0] = -1, so the sum from 1 to 2 is zero.

Similarly, cum_sum[3] = 0, cum_sum[4] = 1, etc.

So, if I split at positions where cum_sum repeats, I can get substrings with sum zero, which have zero penalty.

In this case, splitting at position 3 (where cum_sum returns to 0), and at position 9 (where cum_sum is 4), but it's not clear.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that whenever cum_sum repeats, I can split there to get a substring with sum zero.

But in the fourth example, cum_sum[-1] = 0, cum_sum[2] = -1, cum_sum[0] = -1, cum_sum[3] = 0, etc.

So, cum_sum[3] = 0, which matches cum_sum[-1], so splitting at position 3 gives a substring from 0 to 3 with sum zero.

Then, from position 4 to 9, cum_sum goes from 1 to 5, and then back to 4.

It's not clear how to optimally split this.

Maybe I need to keep track of the positions where cum_sum is the same and split there.

But I need a more systematic way.

Perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where dp[i] is the minimum penalty for the first i characters.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of dp[j] + penalty from j+1 to i.

But as mentioned earlier, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=5000.

I need a faster approach.

Let me consider the overall sum of the array.

If the entire array has sum S, then the penalty is |S| * N.

But if I split it into two parts with sums S1 and S2, their penalties would be |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2.

I need to see if splitting reduces the total penalty.

In the fourth example, S = -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 = -2 +7 -1 = 4, N=10, so penalty would be |4| * 10 = 40.

But by splitting into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ], penalties are 0, 4, 0, total 4.

So, splitting greatly reduces the penalty.

I need to find a way to achieve such splits efficiently.

Another idea: try to balance the number of "+" and "-" in each substring to make their sums as close to zero as possible.

But how?

Maybe, group sequences of "+" and "-" in a way that their counts are similar.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of "+" and "-" in the entire string.

Let's say there are P "+" and M "-" characters.

Then, the total sum is P - M.

If I don't split the string, the penalty is |P - M| * N.

But if I split it into k substrings, each with their own P_i and M_i, the total penalty would be sum over i of |P_i - M_i| * L_i.

I need to minimize this sum.

I need to find a way to distribute the "+" and "-" across the substrings such that the sum of |P_i - M_i| * L_i is minimized.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between "+" and "-", and try to minimize the product of this difference and the length of the substring.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

I can think of sum as the difference between the number of "+" and "-", so |sum| is the absolute difference.

Then, penalty is this absolute difference multiplied by the total number of characters in the substring.

I need to minimize the sum of such penalties over all substrings in the split.

I need to find a way to group the characters such that the product of the absolute difference and the length is minimized.

Wait, maybe I can look for substrings where the number of "+" and "-" are as equal as possible, to make |sum| small, and thus the penalty small.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that for a substring, the penalty is |P - M| * (P + M).

I need to minimize sum over all substrings of |P - M| * (P + M).

I can think of P and M as variables and try to minimize this expression.

But it's not clear.

Let me consider that |P - M| is either P - M if P > M, or M - P if M > P.

So, penalty is (max(P, M) - min(P, M)) * (P + M).

This can be rewritten as max(P, M) * (P + M) - min(P, M) * (P + M).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each substring, if P >= M, penalty is (P - M) * (P + M) = P^2 - M^2.

Similarly, if M > P, penalty is (M - P) * (P + M) = M^2 - P^2.

So, in general, penalty is |P^2 - M^2|.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, penalty for a substring is |P^2 - M^2|, where P is the number of "+" and M is the number of "-" in the substring.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no.

Wait, (P - M)*(P + M) = P^2 - M^2.

Yes, but |P - M|*(P + M) = |P^2 - M^2| only if P + M is positive, which it is, since it's the length of the substring.

But actually, |P - M|*(P + M) is equal to |P^2 - M^2|.

Because |P - M|*(P + M) = |(P - M)*(P + M)| = |P^2 - M^2|.

So, penalty is |P^2 - M^2|.

That's an interesting observation.

But I'm not sure if that helps me minimize the total penalty.

Maybe I should think differently.

Let me consider that in order to minimize the total penalty, I need to minimize the penalty for each substring in the split.

Given that penalty is |sum| * length, perhaps I should aim to have substrings where the sum is zero, since that would make the penalty zero.

But in practice, that might not always be possible.

In the fourth example, splitting into substrings with sum zero gave a total penalty of 4.

But is there a better way?

Wait, in that case, it's already optimal.

So, perhaps the strategy is to maximize the number of substrings with sum zero.

But in the second example, all substrings have sum zero only if split into individual characters.

But in that case, the penalty is the sum of the absolute values, which is minimal.

Wait, no, in the second example, all characters are "-", so sum is negative, and splitting into individual characters gives penalty 1 for each, total 5.

Which is better than splitting into one substring with penalty 5 * 5 = 25.

So, in that case, splitting into individual characters is better.

Wait, but in the third example, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives penalty zero.

So, perhaps the strategy is to split the string into substrings where the sum is zero whenever possible.

But in the first example, with only one "+", I have to accept a penalty of 1.

In the second example, with all "-", splitting into individual characters minimizes the penalty.

In the third example, splitting into substrings with sum zero minimizes the penalty.

In the fourth example, splitting into substrings with sum zero or minimal sum achieves the minimal penalty.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to split the string at positions where the cumulative sum returns to a previous value, creating substrings with sum zero.

This way, each such substring contributes zero to the total penalty.

Then, for the remaining parts, where it's not possible to have sum zero, we need to choose splits that minimize the penalty.

This seems like a good approach.

To implement this, I can keep track of the positions where the cumulative sum takes each value.

When the cumulative sum returns to a value it has taken before, I can split the string between those positions, creating a substring with sum zero.

By doing this repeatedly, I can minimize the total penalty.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the positions where each cumulative sum value occurs.

Start with cum_sum = 0 at position -1.

Traverse the string, updating cum_sum at each position.

Whenever cum_sum has been seen before, split the string between the current position and the previous position where cum_sum was equal.

This creates a substring with sum zero, which has zero penalty.

Continue this process until the entire string is split into such substrings.

This should minimize the total penalty.

Let me test this approach with the fourth example.

s = "--+++++++-

cum_sum at each position:

pos: -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

a:    0 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -1

cum_sum: 0, -1, -2, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2

So, cum_sum values and their positions:

0: positions -1, 6

-1: positions 0, 5

-2: positions 1, 4

-3: position 2

2: positions 9

So, I can split between positions 6 and 9, since cum_sum is 0 at 6 and 2 at 9.

Wait, no.

Wait, between positions 2 and 4, cum_sum goes from -3 to -2 to -1 to 0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a different approach.

Let me consider that for each unique cum_sum value, I can keep track of all positions where it occurs.

Then, for each occurrence after the first, I can split between the first occurrence and this one, creating a substring with sum zero.

But I need to be careful about overlapping intervals.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that if cum_sum repeats, the sum between those positions is zero.

So, I can group positions with the same cum_sum and split between them.

In the fourth example:

cum_sum -3: position 2

-2: positions 1,4

-1: positions 0,5

0: positions -1,6

1: positions 3,7

2: positions 8,9

So, for cum_sum 0, positions -1 and 6.

So, split between 6 and 7.

For cum_sum -1, positions 0 and 5.

So, split between 5 and 6.

For cum_sum -2, positions 1 and 4.

So, split between 4 and 5.

For cum_sum -3, position 2 alone.

For cum_sum 1, positions 3 and 7.

So, split between 3 and 7.

For cum_sum 2, positions 8 and 9.

So, split between 8 and 9.

Wait, but this doesn't seem to make sense in terms of minimizing the penalty.

Wait, perhaps I need to pair the positions where cum_sum repeats and split between them.

So, for cum_sum 0, split between positions -1 and 6.

This gives substring from 0 to 6: sum zero, penalty zero.

Then, from 6 to 9: sum 4, penalty 4*4=16, which is worse than the sample output of 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to split at every repetition of cum_sum.

So, for cum_sum -1 at positions 0 and 5, split between 0 and 5.

Similarly, for cum_sum -2 at 1 and 4, split between 1 and 4.

For cum_sum -3 at position 2, no split.

For cum_sum 0 at -1 and 6, split between -1 and 6.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Perhaps I need to consider all possible splits and choose the one with minimal penalty.

But that's not practical for n=5000.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" characters minus the number of "+" characters, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, in the fourth example, P=7, M=3, P - M = 4, which matches the sample output of 4.

Similarly, in the second example, P=0, M=5, |0 - 5| = 5, which matches the sample output of 5.

In the third example, P=3, M=3, |3 - 3| = 0, which matches the sample output of 0.

In the first example, P=1, M=0, |1 - 0| = 1, which matches the sample output of 1.

In the fifth example, P=14, M=6, |14 - 6| = 8, but the sample output is 4, which does not match.

Wait, perhaps it's not simply |P - M|.

Wait, in the fifth example, P=14, M=6, but output
