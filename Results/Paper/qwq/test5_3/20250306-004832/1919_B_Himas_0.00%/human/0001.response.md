Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate these substrings, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-") multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to split the string optimally to minimize the total penalty.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value and multiplying by the length means that the penalty is higher for longer substrings with a larger imbalance between "+" and "-".

I need to find a way to split the string to minimize the sum of these penalties. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I can build up the solution by considering smaller substrings and combining their results.

Let me think about the base cases. If the string has only one character, say "+", then a = [1], and the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1. Similarly, if it's "-", the penalty is |-1| * 1 = 1. So, for single-character strings, the penalty is always 1.

Now, for longer strings, I need to consider different ways to split them and choose the one with the minimum total penalty.

Let's take an example from the problem:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+e"

Wait, the example given is:

6

+-+-+-

So, s = "+-+-+e"

Wait, the problem says s consists of "+" and "-", so probably it's "+-+-+-"

But in the example output, it's 0, which suggests that splitting it into two parts, each with sum 0, gives a total penalty of 0.

So, perhaps splitting the string into parts where the sum is zero is beneficial because their penalty is zero.

Another example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

Which is all "-", so a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements, each has penalty 1, total penalty 5.

Alternatively, if I split it into one substring, the sum is -5, and penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse.

So, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, the minimal penalty is 5, which is indeed from splitting into individual elements.

In the third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+e"

Wait, probably it's "+-+-+-"

Then a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into two substrings: [1, -1, 1, -1] and [1, -1], the sums are 0 and 0, so penalties are 0 and 0, total penalty 0.

That's better than splitting into individual elements, which would give a total penalty of 6.

So, splitting into parts where the sum is zero reduces the penalty.

Another example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++e"

Probably "--++++++++"

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Sum is 7 - 2 = 5, so if I split it into substrings that have sums canceling each other, I can minimize the penalty.

Wait, in this case, the output is 4.

I need to figure out how to achieve that.

Let me try to split it into "--++++" and "+++e", but I need to see the sums.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

I need a general approach.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i characters.

Then, for each i, I can try to split the string at position j (where j < i), and compute the penalty for the substring from j to i-1, and add it to dp[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + penalty(j to i-1))

The base case is dp[0] = 0.

To compute penalty(j to i-1), I need to calculate the sum of a[j to i-1] and multiply by (i - j).

But this would be O(n^2), which for n=5000 might be too slow, but let's see.

First, precompute the prefix sums.

Define sum[i] as the sum of the first i elements.

So, sum from j to i-1 is sum[i] - sum[j].

Then, penalty(j to i-1) = |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j))

This seems correct.

Now, implement this.

But n=5000, so O(n^2) might be acceptable because t=1000, but actually, t=1000 and n=5000 would make it 5,000,000 operations, which might be acceptable, but let's see if there's a better way.

Looking for optimizations.

Is there a way to avoid checking all j < i for each i?

Maybe by observing some properties of the sum and the penalty.

Let me think about the sum array.

If I plot sum[j] vs j, and for each i, I need to choose j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j).

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can group j's based on sum[j], and for each sum[j], find the j that minimizes the penalty.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some kind of slope optimization.

Wait, perhaps convex hull optimization can be applied here.

Let me recall that in convex hull optimization, if the transition can be expressed in a certain way, we can optimize the inner loop.

In this case, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j))

This is similar to dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + C(j, i)), where C(j, i) is |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

But the issue is that C(j, i) involves both sum[j] and sum[i], and it's not straightforward to optimize.

Maybe I need to consider sum[j] and j separately.

Let me consider that sum[j] is a linear function of j, but it's not necessarily linear.

Wait, sum[j] is the cumulative sum, which is not linear unless the sequence is constant.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's another approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum[b] - sum[a]| * (b - a), for a substring from a to b-1.

Wait, in the dp transition, it's |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

I need to minimize dp[i] = dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Perhaps I can consider the difference between sum[i] and sum[j], and see if there's a way to group j's based on sum[j].

Alternatively, maybe I can sort j's based on sum[j], and for each i, find the j that is closest to sum[i] in some way.

But this might not work because j must be less than i.

Wait, j must be less than i, so I need to process j in increasing order.

Maybe I can maintain a data structure that stores sum[j] and j, and for each i, find the j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

But this seems too slow for n=5000.

Perhaps I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum of substring| * length of substring.

I need to split the array into substrings such that the sum of penalties is minimized.

Maybe instead of dynamic programming, I can look for places where the sum changes sign, or where the cumulative sum reaches certain values.

Wait, perhaps I can look for substrings where the sum is zero, because their penalty is zero.

So, if I can find substrings with sum zero, I can split there, and the total penalty would be the sum of penalties of the remaining parts.

But this might not always lead to the optimal solution.

Let me think of another example.

Suppose s = "++--", n=4

a = [1,1,-1,-1], sum=0

If I split into ["++","--"], penalties are |2|*2 + | -2 |*2 = 4 + 4 = 8

If I split into ["++-","-"], penalties are |(1+1-1)|*3 + |-1|*1 = |1|*3 + 1*1 = 3 + 1 = 4

If I split into ["+","+-","-"], penalties are |1|*1 + |1 -1|*2 + |-1|*1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

If I split into ["++++-"], but wait, s is "++--", so "++++-" is different.

Wait, s="++--", so a=[1,1,-1,-1]

Splitting into ["++","--"] gives penalty 4 + 4 = 8

Splitting into ["++-","-"] gives penalty 3 + 1 = 4

Splitting into ["+","+-","-"] gives penalty 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Splitting into individual elements gives penalty 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

So, the minimal penalty is 2.

But according to my dp approach, it should work.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute sum of the entire array.

Wait, in this case, sum(a) = 0, so minimal penalty is 0, but in the example above, it's 2.

Wait, no, sum(a)=0, but the minimal penalty is 2.

Wait, in the split ["+","+-","-"], the penalties are 1, 0, 1, totaling 2.

Wait, but sum(a)=0, but minimal penalty is not zero.

Wait, in the split ["+++-","-"], sum([1,1,-1,-1])=0, penalty=0 + 1=1

Wait, no, s="++--", a=[1,1,-1,-1], sum=0.

Split into ["+++-","-"], but s is "++--", not "+++-".

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, s="++--", a=[1,1,-1,-1], sum=0.

Split into ["++","--"], penalties |2|*2 + | -2 |*2 = 4 + 4 =8

Split into ["+++","-"], a=[1,1,1,-1], penalties |3|*3 + |-1|*1 =9 +1=10

Wait, that's worse.

Split into ["++","-","-"], penalties |2|*2 + |-1|*1 + |-1|*1 =4 +1 +1=6

Split into ["+","+-","-"], penalties |1|*1 + |1-1|*2 + |-1|*1 =1 +0 +1=2

Split into ["+","+", "-","-"], penalties |1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |-1|*1=1 +1 +1 +1=4

So, the minimal penalty is 2.

But according to the dp approach, it should work, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of absolute values of the differences between the cumulative sum and the total sum.

Wait, that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the individual elements, which in this case would be |1| + |1| + |-1| + |-1| =4, but that's not the minimal penalty.

Wait, but in this split, ["+","+-","-"], the penalty is 2, which is less than 4.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of sign changes or something.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to minimize the penalty, I need to balance the sum of the substrings.

So, substrings with sum zero have zero penalty, which is ideal.

Substrings with non-zero sum have a penalty proportional to the absolute sum and the length.

Therefore, it's better to have substrings with small sums and small lengths.

But, if I have a substring with sum zero, no matter the length, the penalty is zero, which is better.

So, perhaps I should look for the longest possible substrings with sum zero, and split the remaining parts further.

But, in the example above, "++--" can be split into ["++","--"], each with sum zero, giving total penalty zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that splitting into ["+","+-","-"] gives penalty 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, s="++--", a=[1,1,-1,-1]

sum([1,1,-1,-1])=0

sum([1,1,-1])=1

sum([-1])=-1

So, p([1,1,-1])=|1|*3=3

p([-1])=1

Total penalty=4

Wait, but earlier I thought it was ["+","+-","-"], with penalties 1,0,1, total 2.

Wait, let's recalculate.

s="++--"

Possible splits:

1. ["++","--"] => p([1,1])=|2|*2=4, p([-1,-1])=| -2 |*2=4 => total 8

2. ["+++","-"] => p([1,1,1])=|3|*3=9, p([-1])=1 => total 10

3. ["++","-","-"] => p([1,1])=4, p([-1])=1, p([-1])=1 => total 6

4. ["+","+-","-"] => p([1])=1, p([1,-1])=0, p([-1])=1 => total 2

5. ["+","+", "-","-"] => p([1])=1, p([1])=1, p([-1])=1, p([-1])=1 => total 4

6. ["+++-","-"], but s="++--", so invalid.

So, indeed, the minimal penalty is 2.

Wait, but if I split into ["++","--"], sum is 0 for each, penalty is 4 + 4=8

But according to the earlier example, splitting into ["++","--"] gives penalty 5, but in this case, it's 8.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait, in the third example, n=6, s="+-+-+-", output is 0.

Wait, but in my example with n=4, s="++--", minimal penalty is 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider something else.

Let me look back at the problem.

It says:

"For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible penalty you will receive."

In the example:

Input:

5

1

+

5

-----

6

+-+-+-

10

--+++++++e

20

+---++++-+++++---++e

Output:

1

5

0

4

4

Wait, in the second test case, n=5, s="-----", which is all "-", so a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]

If I split into individual elements, penalty is 1*5=5

If I split into ["-----"], penalty is | -5 | *5=25

So, indeed, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty of 5.

In the third test case, n=6, s="+-+-+-", which is [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1], sum=0

Splitting into ["++","--"] would give penalty 8, but according to the output, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps splitting into ["+ - + - + -"], where each pair "+ -" has sum 0, penalty 0.

Wait, but "+ - + - + -" is ["+","-","+", "-","+", "-"], each with penalty 1,0,1,0,1,0 => total 3.

Wait, but the output is 0, so there must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps splitting into ["+-","+-","+-"], each with sum 0, penalty 0.

So, total penalty is 0.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives penalty zero.

Hence, the minimal penalty is zero.

So, in general, if I can split the string into substrings with sum zero, the total penalty is zero.

But, in my earlier example with n=4, s="++--", sum=0, splitting into ["++","--"] gives sum=0 for each, penalty=4+4=8, which is worse than splitting into ["+","+-","-"] with penalty 2.

Wait, but in that case, sum(["+","+-","-"]) is [1,0,-1], penalties [1,0,1], total 2.

So, it's better not to have substrings with sum zero in this case.

Wait, but sum(["++","--"]) is [2,-2], penalties [4,4], total 8.

So, why is splitting into ["+","+-","-"] better?

Because it gives penalties [1,0,1], total 2.

So, in this case, having some substrings with non-zero sum gives a better total penalty.

Wait, but in the third test case, splitting into ["+-","+-","+-"] gives penalty zero, which is better.

So, perhaps it depends on the string.

I need to find a general way to minimize the penalty.

Perhaps, instead of dynamic programming, I can consider the entire string and find a way to split it optimally based on the sum of parts.

But, I'm still stuck with the dp approach being too slow for n=5000.

Wait, perhaps I can optimize the dp by observing that for a given i, the optimal j is the one that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j).

Given that i is fixed, and j < i, perhaps I can find a way to choose j such that sum[j] is as close as possible to sum[i] * some factor.

Wait, maybe I can fix i and iterate j from 0 to i-1, keeping track of sum[j], and find the j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

But this seems too slow for n=5000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the sum[j] values and use a data structure like a set or a balanced binary search tree to quickly find the j that minimizes the expression.

For example, I can keep a sorted list of (sum[j], j) for j < i, and for each i, find the j where sum[j] is closest to sum[i].

But I need to minimize |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j), which is not just the difference in sum[j].

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the penalty as |sum[j] - sum[i]| * (i - j), and since i - j is positive, minimizing |sum[j] - sum[i]| * (i - j) is equivalent to minimizing |sum[j] - sum[i]| for a fixed i.

But actually, (i - j) increases with j, so it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the slope between sum[j] and j.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a fixed i, I need to choose j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

This can be rewritten as |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

I need to minimize this over j < i.

Let me fix i and try to find the j that minimizes this expression.

Let me consider that for a fixed i, sum[i] is constant.

So, I need to choose j that makes sum[j] as close as possible to sum[i] * something.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as minimizing the product of the difference in sums and the difference in indices.

This seems like a non-trivial optimization problem.

Maybe I need to look for patterns in the sum array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if sum[j] == sum[i], then |sum[i] - sum[j]| = 0, and the penalty is zero.

But, sum[j] == sum[i] might not always be possible.

In the earlier example, sum(["++","--"]) = [2, -2], which are not equal.

Wait, in that case, sum[j] = 2, sum[i] = 0, so |0 - 2| * 4 = 8

But, in the split ["+","+-","-"], sum[j] for j=1 is 1, sum[i]=0, |0 - 1| * 3 = 3, plus p([+])=1, total 4, which is still higher than 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that O(n^2) is the way to go and optimize it as much as possible.

Given that t=1000 and n=5000, total operations would be around 5,000,000, which should be acceptable, as modern computers can handle around 10^8 operations per second.

But, to be safe, I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient.

Let me proceed with the dp approach.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

Read n, the length of the string.

Read the string s.

Convert s to the array a, where '+' is 1 and '-' is -1.

Compute the prefix sums.

Initialize dp[0] = 0

For i from 1 to n:

dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j))

Finally, output dp[n]

But this is O(n^2), which might be too slow for t=1000 and n=5000.

Perhaps I can optimize it by noticing that for a given i, the optimal j is the one where sum[j] is closest to sum[i].

But, since j must be less than i, and sum[j] increases or decreases depending on the string, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can group j's based on sum[j], and for each sum[j], keep track of the minimal dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

But this still requires checking all j for each i.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the sum[j] values and use a binary search to find the j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]|.

But, since j must be less than i, I need to maintain the sum[j] values for j < i in a sorted order.

I can use a list or a set to keep track of sum[j] for j < i, and for each i, find the j with sum[j] closest to sum[i].

Then, dp[i] = dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j)

But, even then, finding the closest sum[j] for each i would require O(log n) time per i, leading to O(n log n) time per test case.

But, I need to make sure that this approach gives the correct answer.

Let me try it with the example where n=4, s="++--"

sum[0] = 0

sum[1] = 1

sum[2] = 2

sum[3] = 1

sum[4] = 0

Initialize dp[0] = 0

For i=1:

Find j < 1, only j=0

sum[1] - sum[0] = 1 - 0 =1

dp[1] = 0 + |1| *1 =1

For i=2:

j=0: |2 - 0| *2 =4

j=1: |2 -1| *1=1

Choose j=1, dp[2] = 0 +1=1

For i=3:

j=0: |1 -0| *3=3

j=1: |1 -1| *2=0

j=2: |1 -2| *1=1

Choose j=1, dp[3]=0 +0=0

For i=4:

j=0: |0 -0| *4=0

j=1: |0 -1| *3=3

j=2: |0 -2| *2=4

j=3: |0 -1| *1=1

Choose j=0, dp[4]=0 +0=0

So, dp[4]=0, which matches the minimal penalty.

Wait, but earlier I thought the minimal penalty was 2, but according to this, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, s="++--", sum[4]=0.

If I split into ["++","--"], penalties 4 +4=8

But according to dp, dp[4]=0, which suggests that there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating dp[3].

sum[3]=1

For i=3:

j=0: |1 -0| *3=3

j=1: |1 -1| *2=0

j=2: |1 -2| *1=1

So, choose j=1, dp[3]=dp[1] +0=1 +0=1

Wait, dp[1]=1

Wait, dp[3]=dp[j=1] +0=1 +0=1

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j))

For i=3:

j=0: dp[0] + |1 -0| *3=0 +3=3

j=1: dp[1] + |1 -1| *2=1 +0=1

j=2: dp[2] + |1 -2| *1=1 +1=2

So, dp[3]=1

For i=4:

j=0: dp[0] + |0 -0| *4=0 +0=0

j=1: dp[1] + |0 -1| *3=1 +3=4

j=2: dp[2] + |0 -2| *2=1 +4=5

j=3: dp[3] + |0 -1| *1=1 +1=2

So, dp[4]=0

But according to earlier thinking, splitting into ["++","--"] gives penalty 8, but dp says 0.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to split it with penalty 0.

Wait, s="++--", a=[1,1,-1,-1]

If I split into ["++","--"], penalties 4 +4=8

If I split into ["+","+-","-"], penalties 1 +0 +1=2

If I split into ["++-","-"], penalties 3 +1=4

If I split into ["+++","-"], penalties 9 +1=10

If I split into ["+","+", "-","-"], penalties 1 +1 +1 +1=4

Wait, but dp says dp[4]=0, which seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dp calculation.

Wait, dp[4]=0, but how?

Wait, dp[4]=min over j <4 of dp[j] + |sum[4] - sum[j]| * (4 - j)

j=0: dp[0]=0 + |0 -0|*4=0

j=1: dp[1]=1 + |0 -1|*3=1 +3=4

j=2: dp[2]=1 + |0 -2|*2=1 +4=5

j=3: dp[3]=1 + |0 -1|*1=1 +1=2

So, the minimum is 0, from j=0.

But splitting into ["++++"], penalty |0|*4=0, but s="++--", which is ["++","--"], sum=0, penalty=0.

Wait, but s="++--", a=[1,1,-1,-1], sum=0.

So, splitting into ["++--"], penalty |0|*4=0.

So, dp[4]=0 is correct.

But earlier I thought that splitting into ["+","+-","-"] gives penalty 2, but actually, there's a better split with penalty 0.

So, dp approach is correct.

Hence, I can proceed with the dp approach.

Implementing it in code.

But, with n=5000 and t=1000, total operations would be around 5,000,000, which should be acceptable.

But to make it faster, perhaps I can optimize the inner loop.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal dp[j] + |sum[i] - sum[j]| * (i - j) by maintaining sum[j] in a sorted order and using binary search to find the j that minimizes |sum[i] - sum[j]|.

But, even then, for each i, I need to consider multiple j's, and it's not clear if it will be faster.

Given time constraints, perhaps O(n^2) is acceptable.

I'll proceed with that.

Implement the dp array, precompute the prefix sums, and iterate through each i and j to compute dp[i].

Finally, output dp[n].

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it's correct.

Given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

s = int(input())

e = input()

P = 0

M = 0

for q in e:

if q == '+':

P += 1

else:

M += 1

print(P - M)

This program reads t, then for each test case, reads n and s, counts the number of '+' and '-', and prints P - M, which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-'.

But according to the problem, we need to split the string into substrings and minimize the sum of penalties, where penalty is |sum of substring| * length of substring.

The given program completely ignores the splitting part and just calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-', which is not related to the minimal penalty.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
