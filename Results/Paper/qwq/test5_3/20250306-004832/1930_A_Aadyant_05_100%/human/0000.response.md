Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. The goal is to maximize my total score after all moves.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized. It seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, to maximize the sum, you'd want to add the largest possible numbers. But here, I have to add the smaller number of each pair.

Let me think about the example given:

In the first test case, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. So, I can only make one move, pairing 2 and 3, and add the smaller one, which is 2, to my score. That makes sense.

In the second test case, n=2, and the numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1. The solution says to pair 1 and 1 first, add 1 to the score, then pair 1 and 2, add 1 again, totaling 2.

But is there a better way? What if I pair 1 and 2 first, add 1, and then pair the remaining two 1's, adding another 1, totaling the same 2. So, it's the same score.

Is there a way to get a higher score? Let's see. If I pair 1 and 1 first, add 1, then pair 1 and 2, add 1. Or pair 1 and 2 first, add 1, then pair 1 and 1, add 1. Seems like I can't get more than 2 in this case.

The note says it's not possible to get a score greater than 2, so okay.

In the third test case, all numbers are 1, so pairing any two will always add 1 each time, totaling 3 for n=3.

So, the general approach seems to be pairing the smallest numbers together. But why?

Wait, in the second test case, if I pair the smallest available numbers each time, I'm pairing 1 and 1 first, then 1 and 2. That gives me 1 + 1 = 2.

Is there a better way? Let's say I pair 1 and 2 first, adding 1, then pair 1 and 1, adding another 1. Still 2.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 1 first, adding 1, then pair 1 and 2, adding another 1. Again, 2.

Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score in this particular case.

But is this always the case? Let's think of another example.

Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.

If I pair 1 and 2, add 1, then pair 3 and 4, add 3, total score is 4.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 3, add 1, then pair 2 and 4, add 2, total score is 3.

Or pair 1 and 4, add 1, then pair 2 and 3, add 2, total score is 3.

So, pairing the two smallest together gives a higher score in this case: 4.

Wait, but in the previous test case, it didn't matter.

Hmm.

Wait, in the first example, pairing the two smallest together gives the highest possible min value for each pair.

Wait, in the first example, pairing 1 and 1 gives min=1, then pairing 1 and 2 gives min=1, total 2.

In the second example, pairing 1 and 1 gives min=1, then pairing 2 and 4 gives min=2, total 3.

Wait, but in the sample input, the second test case is n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1, and the output is 2.

But in my new example, n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,4, and pairing the two smallest together and then the next two, gives 1+2=3.

Is there a better way? If I pair 1 and 2, get 1, pair 3 and 4, get 3, total 4.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 3, get 1, pair 2 and 4, get 2, total 3.

Or pair 1 and 4, get 1, pair 2 and 3, get 2, total 3.

So, pairing the two smallest together and then the remaining gives the highest score of 4 in this case.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=2, numbers=1,1,2,1, pairing the two smallest (1 and 1) gives 1, then pairing the remaining 1 and 2 gives 1, total 2.

Is there a way to get higher than 2? Let's see.

If I pair 1 and 2 first, get 1, then pair the remaining 1 and 1, get 1, total 2.

Or pair 1 and 1 first, get 1, then pair 1 and 2, get 1, total 2.

Seems like 2 is the maximum possible.

So, in this case, pairing the two smallest together doesn't necessarily lead to the highest possible sum.

Wait, but in my previous example, it did.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider sorting the array in non-decreasing order.

So, for n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1. Sorting gives 1,1,1,2.

Then, pairing the first two (1 and 1), add 1, then pairing the next two (1 and 2), add 1, total 2.

In my earlier example, n=2, numbers=1,2,3,4. Sorting gives 1,2,3,4. Pairing first two (1 and 2), add 1, then pairing next two (3 and 4), add 3, total 4.

Is there a better way? Pairing 1 and 3, add 1, pair 2 and 4, add 2, total 3.

Or pairing 1 and 4, add 1, pair 2 and 3, add 2, total 3.

So, pairing the smallest available numbers each time seems to give the best result.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's also doing that: sorting and pairing the smallest ones.

In the sample input, after sorting, it's 1,1,1,2. Pairing 1 and 1, add 1, then pair 1 and 2, add 1, total 2.

Is there a way to get more than 2? If I pair 1 and 2 first, add 1, then pair the remaining 1 and 1, add 1, total 2.

Same as above.

So, in that case, it's the same.

So, the strategy seems to be: sort the array in non-decreasing order, and pair the first two, then the next two, and so on, adding the first of each pair (since it's the smaller one).

This seems to be a consistent approach.

Let me think about why this works.

If I sort the array, the smallest numbers are grouped together, so when I pair them, I'm adding the smallest possible number to my score, but since I have to add the min of each pair, this ensures that I'm not wasting larger numbers by pairing them with even larger ones.

Wait, no, actually, by pairing the smallest with the next smallest, I'm ensuring that the smaller numbers are being added to the score, and the larger numbers are being used to pair with others without losing their value.

Wait, but since I have to add the min of each pair, pairing a large number with an even larger one would add the large number, but if I pair it with a smaller one, I'd add the smaller one, which is less than the large one.

So, to maximize the sum, I should pair the smallest available with the next smallest available, so that the smaller one is added, and the larger one is preserved for another pair if possible.

But in practice, since each number is used exactly once, it's about pairing them in such a way that the min of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, but in the sorted list, pairing the first two, then the next two, and so on, ensures that the min of each pair is the smallest possible in each step, but overall, it maximizes the sum.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the sum of mins.

In sorted order, the mins of each pair are the first, third, fifth, etc., elements.

So, in sorted order, sum of a0 + a2 + a4 + ... + a2k, where k = n.

In the sample input, sorted array is [1,1,1,2], sum of a0 + a2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

In my earlier example, [1,2,3,4], sorted as [1,2,3,4], sum of a0 + a2 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

Suppose I pair 1 with 2, get 1, and pair 3 with 4, get 3, total 4.

Alternatively, pair 1 with 3, get 1, pair 2 with 4, get 2, total 3.

Or pair 1 with 4, get 1, pair 2 with 3, get 2, total 3.

So, indeed, pairing the first two and then the next two gives the highest sum.

Another example: n=3, numbers=1,1,1,1,1,1. Sorted: [1,1,1,1,1,1]. Sum of a0 + a2 + a4 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Which matches the sample input.

Another example: n=3, numbers=1,2,3,4,5,6. Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Sum of a0 + a2 + a4 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

Pair 1 with 2 (add 1), pair 3 with 4 (add 3), pair 5 with 6 (add 5), total 9.

Alternatively, pair 1 with 3 (add 1), pair 2 with 4 (add 2), pair 5 with 6 (add 5), total 8.

Or pair 1 with 4 (add 1), pair 2 with 5 (add 2), pair 3 with 6 (add 3), total 6.

So, again, pairing the first two, then next two, and so on, gives the highest sum.

Therefore, the strategy seems to be:

- Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

- Sum the elements at even indices (0,2,4,...,2n-2).

This will give the maximum possible score.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

n = input()

final = []

for num in range(int(n)):

s = 0

list2 = []

a = input()

list1 = []

b = input()

list1 = b.split()

for str in list1:

list2.append(int(str))

list2.sort()

for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):

s = s + int(list2[i])

final.append(s)

for fin in final:

print(fin)

Let's analyze this code.

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Reads the list of 2n integers.

- Sorts the list in ascending order.

- Sums the elements at even indices (0,2,4,...).

- Appends the sum to a list.

- After processing all test cases, prints each sum in the list.

This seems to align with the strategy I just thought of: sort the array and sum the elements at even indices.

But wait, in Python, list indices start at 0, so list2[0] is the smallest, list2[2] is the third smallest, and so on.

In the sorted list, these are indeed the smallest elements in each pair.

But earlier, in my reasoning, I thought that pairing the smallest with the next smallest would maximize the sum of mins.

And this is what the code is doing.

Therefore, this should be correct.

But let's verify with the sample input.

Sample Input:

3

1

2 3

2

1 1 2 1

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

According to the code:

- For n=1, numbers=[2,3], sorted=[2,3], sum=2.

- For n=2, numbers=[1,1,2,1], sorted=[1,1,1,2], sum=1+1=2.

- For n=3, numbers=[1,1,1,1,1,1], sorted=[1,1,1,1,1,1], sum=1+1+1=3.

Which matches the sample output.

So, it seems correct.

But is there any edge case where this might fail?

Let me think about a case where the numbers are all the same.

For example, n=2, numbers=[3,3,3,3]. Sorted=[3,3,3,3], sum=3+3=6.

Alternative pairings:

- Pair 3 and 3, add 3; pair 3 and 3, add 3; total 6.

- Pair 3 and 3, add 3; pair 3 and 3, add 3; total 6.

So, same result.

Another case: n=3, numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6], as before.

Sum=1+3+5=9.

Alternative pairings:

- Pair 1 and 2 (add 1), pair 3 and 4 (add 3), pair 5 and 6 (add 5), total 9.

- Pair 1 and 3 (add 1), pair 2 and 4 (add 2), pair 5 and 6 (add 5), total 8.

- Pair 1 and 4 (add 1), pair 2 and 5 (add 2), pair 3 and 6 (add 3), total 6.

So, the code's approach gives the maximum.

Another case: n=1, numbers=[10,10], sorted=[10,10], sum=10.

Only one pair, min=10, which is correct.

n=1, numbers=[1,100], sorted=[1,100], sum=1.

Which is correct, since pairing 1 and 100 gives min=1.

Is there a case where pairing differently could give a higher sum? It doesn't seem possible, since the min of each pair is fixed based on the smaller number in the pair.

Hence, the approach seems valid.

Now, looking at the code itself.

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Reads the list of 2n numbers.

- Sorts the list.

- Sums the elements at even indices.

- Appends the sum to a list.

- After all test cases, prints each sum in the list.

Seems straightforward.

But there are a few improvements that can be made:

- Variable names could be more descriptive.

- There's no need to create list1 and list2; you can directly work with one list.

- The code can be more concise.

- In Python, you can read all inputs at once and process them.

But in terms of correctness, it seems fine.

Potential issues to consider:

- Make sure that the input is read correctly.

- Ensure that the list is sorted correctly.

- Handle cases where n=0, but according to constraints, n >=1.

- Ensure that the list has exactly 2n elements.

But according to the problem, the inputs are valid, so no need to handle invalid cases.

Given that, the code should work correctly.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the final score by optimally pairing numbers from a list of 2n integers and summing the smaller number from each pair. The solution involves sorting the list and pairing the smallest numbers together to maximize the sum of their minimum values.

## Approach
1. **Read Input:** Read the number of test cases, t.
2. **Process Each Test Case:**
   - Read the integer n, which indicates there are 2n integers.
   - Read the list of 2n integers.
   - Sort the list in non-decreasing order.
   - Sum the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2), as these represent the smaller numbers in each pair when sorted.
3. **Output Results:** For each test case, print the computed sum.

## Solution Code
```python
def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        s = sum(a[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        results.append(s)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation
- **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases, t.
- **Step 2:** For each test case:
  - Read n and then read the list of 2n integers.
  - Sort the list to ensure the smallest numbers are paired together.
  - Calculate the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2), which are the smaller numbers in each sorted pair.
- **Step 3:** Print the sum for each test case.

This approach ensures that we are always pairing the smallest available numbers together, thereby maximizing the sum of their minimum values. The sorting step is crucial as it allows us to efficiently pair and sum the smallest numbers in each pair.
