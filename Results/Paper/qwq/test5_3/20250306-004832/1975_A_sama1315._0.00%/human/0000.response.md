Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it: split the array into a prefix and a suffix, and swap them. She can do this operation any number of times, including zero, and the goal is to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after these operations.

First, I need to understand what exactly the operation allows. The operation is to split the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and swap them. For example, if the array is [3,1,4,1,5], she can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5], and swap them to get [4,1,5,3,1]. Another example is choosing x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[] , which results in the same array since swapping doesn't change anything.

So, essentially, this operation allows her to rotate the array in a specific way. It's not a standard rotation where elements are shifted by a certain number of positions, but rather a split and swap.

Now, I need to figure out if, by performing this operation any number of times, the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

3

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

5

7 9 2 2 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

No

Yes

Yes

So, for the first test case with n=6 and array [1,1,4,5,1,4], it's "No", meaning it cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order with any number of operations.

For the second test case with n=5 and array [7,9,2,2,3], it's "Yes", and the explanation provides a sequence of operations to achieve a sorted array.

For the third test case with n=3 and array [1,2,3], it's already sorted, so "Yes".

I need to find a general way to determine this for any given array within the constraints.

Let me think about what this operation accomplishes. Each operation effectively rotates the array by splitting at a certain point and swapping the parts.

For example, with array [a,b,c,d]:

- Split at position 1: x=[a], y=[b,c,d], swap to get [b,c,d,a]

- Split at position 2: x=[a,b], y=[c,d], swap to get [c,d,a,b]

- Split at position 3: x=[a,b,c], y=[d], swap to get [d,a,b,c]

So, it's like a circular shift but with swapping parts.

I need to see if, by applying such shifts, I can arrange the array into a non-decreasing sequence.

One approach could be to consider all possible rotations achievable through this operation and check if any of them is sorted.

But given that n can be up to 50, and t up to 1000, checking all possible rotations for each test case might not be efficient enough.

I need a smarter way to determine if such a arrangement is possible.

Let me think about the properties of the array that would allow it to be sorted through these operations.

First, note that the operation preserves the multiset of the array; it only rearranges the order of elements.

Therefore, if the array cannot be sorted even in the best arrangement, meaning that the multiset cannot form a non-decreasing sequence, then the answer is "No".

For example, if there are duplicates that cannot be ordered correctly, or if the minimal element is not present enough times at the start, etc.

Wait, but since we can perform the operation any number of times, perhaps there's a way to cycle elements into their correct positions.

Wait, but the operation is not just a single rotation; it's a swap of two parts.

I need to understand the permutation group generated by this operation.

Let me consider the operation more carefully.

Given array a = x + y, where x and y are two parts, the operation sets a := y + x.

So, it's essentially a rotation by the length of x.

But it's not just any rotation; it's a specific type where you split into x and y and swap them.

Wait, but in the example, they show that by performing this operation multiple times, they can achieve a sorted array.

So, perhaps, the key is to find if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

But that doesn't seem right, because in the first test case, it's not a rotation of a sorted array.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], it's "No", meaning it cannot be sorted through these operations.

In the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], it's "Yes", and they show a sequence of operations to make it [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, perhaps the condition is that the array becomes sorted after some rotations, but not just any rotations, only those achievable through the operation defined.

Wait, but the operation is equivalent to rotating the array by the length of x.

So, if x has length k, then it's rotating the array by k positions.

But actually, it's swapping the prefix of length k with the suffix.

Wait, given a = x + y, and then a := y + x.

So, it's reversing the order of x and y.

So, it's like reversing two blocks.

Wait, but it's not reversing the elements, just swapping the blocks.

So, it's permuting the blocks.

I need to think about the cyclic structure of this permutation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of sorting the array and checking if it's a rotation of the original array.

But that might not be sufficient, because the operation allows multiple swaps of different prefixes and suffixes.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as a circular sequence, and see if the sorted version can be obtained by slicing this circular sequence in some way.

Let me consider that.

If I consider the array as a circular sequence, meaning that the end connects back to the beginning, then I can choose any starting point and unfold it into a linear array.

If I can choose a starting point such that the unfolded array is sorted, then the answer is "Yes".

In other words, if the array is a rotation of a sorted array, then "Yes".

But wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], is it a rotation of a sorted array?

Let's see:

Possible rotations:

1. [1,1,4,5,1,4] → No

2. [1,4,5,1,4,1] → No

3. [4,5,1,4,1,1] → No

4. [5,1,4,1,1,4] → No

5. [1,4,1,1,4,5] → No

6. [4,1,1,4,5,1] → No

None of these are sorted, so "No" is correct.

In the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3]:

Possible rotations:

1. [7,9,2,2,3] → No

2. [9,2,2,3,7] → No

3. [2,2,3,7,9] → Yes, this is sorted.

So, "Yes".

In the third test case, [1,2,3], it's already sorted, so "Yes".

So, it seems that the condition is whether the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

But wait, in the first test case, it's not a rotation of a sorted array, hence "No".

In the second test case, one of the rotations is sorted, hence "Yes".

In the third test case, it's already sorted, hence "Yes".

So, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

But let's verify this with another example.

Suppose the array is [3,4,1,2].

Is this a rotation of a sorted array?

Possible rotations:

1. [3,4,1,2] → No

2. [4,1,2,3] → No

3. [1,2,3,4] → Yes, sorted.

4. [2,3,4,1] → No

So, "Yes".

But according to the operation defined, can we reach [1,2,3,4] from [3,4,1,2]?

Let's see:

Start with [3,4,1,2].

Option 1: Split into x=[3], y=[4,1,2], swap to get [4,1,2,3].

Option 2: Split into x=[3,4], y=[1,2], swap to get [1,2,3,4].

Ah, so in one operation, we can reach the sorted array [1,2,3,4].

So, "Yes".

Another example: [5,1,2,3,4].

Possible operations:

Split x=[5], y=[1,2,3,4], swap to get [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

So, "Yes".

Another example: [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted, so "Yes".

So, it seems that if the array is a rotation of a sorted array, then "Yes", else "No".

But wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], is it a rotation of a sorted array?

Let's see:

If we sort it, we get [1,1,4,4,5,1], but this is [1,1,4,4,5,1], which is not a rotation of the original array [1,1,4,5,1,4].

Wait, no, [1,1,4,4,5,1] is sorted, but it's not a rotation of the original array.

Wait, rotation means shifting elements circularly.

So, original array: [1,1,4,5,1,4]

Possible rotations:

- [1,1,4,5,1,4]

- [1,4,5,1,4,1]

- [4,5,1,4,1,1]

- [5,1,4,1,1,4]

- [1,4,1,1,4,5]

- [4,1,1,4,5,1]

None of these are equal to [1,1,4,4,5,1], which is the sorted version.

Hence, "No".

So, the condition seems to be that the array must be a rotation of its sorted version.

But wait, in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], one of its rotations is [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, in the third test case, [1,2,3], it's already sorted, hence "Yes".

So, the approach is to sort the array and check if it's a rotation of the original array.

To check if one array is a rotation of another, I can check if one array is a substring of the doubled version of the other.

For example, to check if b is a rotation of a, I can check if a is a substring of b+b.

But since both arrays have the same length, I need to check if a is equal to some rotation of b.

Given that, I can implement this check.

Now, looking at the provided program:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

def func_2():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

index = 0

t = int(data[index])

index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index])

index += 1

arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))

index += n

result = func_1(arr)

results.append(result)

print('\n'.join(results))

So, func_2 reads the input, processes each test case by calling func_1, and collects the results.

Func_1 seems to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, we need to check if the array is a rotation of a sorted array, not just if it's already sorted.

But in func_1, it seems to return 'Yes' if the array is already sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

But according to our earlier examples, even if the array is not sorted, if it's a rotation of a sorted array, we should return 'Yes'.

But in the provided program, func_1 only checks if the array is already sorted.

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

Wait, this seems confusing.

The first condition checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, returns 'Yes'.

The second condition checks if there is any arr[i] > arr[i+1], and if so, returns 'No'.

But the else clause says 'Yes', which would be executed only if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is already covered in the first condition.

This seems redundant and potentially incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the conditions.

Let me rephrase func_1:

def func_1(arr):

if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):

return 'Yes'

elif any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):

return 'No'

else:

return 'Yes'

But the else clause here would only be reached if the array is empty or has only one element, since if there are elements and they are all non-decreasing, the first condition would be true, and if there are any decreasing elements, the second condition would be true.

Wait, but in the problem statement, n is at least 2, so the else clause might not be necessary.

But in any case, this func_1 only checks if the array is already sorted, and returns 'No' if it's not.

But according to our earlier reasoning, we need to check if the array can be sorted by performing the operation any number of times, which corresponds to checking if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

Hence, this func_1 is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these two parts.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Operation**: 
   - The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, and then swapping them. This is equivalent to a specific kind of rotation.
   - For example, if `a = x + y`, then after the operation, `a` becomes `y + x`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The array can be transformed into a sorted array if it is a rotation of a sorted array.
   - To check this, we can compare the original array with its sorted version to see if one is a rotation of the other.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Sort the array and check if the sorted array is a substring of the original array concatenated with itself.
   - This efficiently checks if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

## Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    double_arr = arr + arr
    return 'Yes' if ''.join(map(str, sorted_arr)) in ''.join(map(str, double_arr)) else 'No'

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_be_sorted(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Function `can_be_sorted(arr)`**:
  - Sorts the array `arr`.
  - Concatenates the original array with itself to handle rotations.
  - Checks if the sorted array is a substring of the doubled array.
  - Returns 'Yes' if it finds the sorted array within the doubled array, indicating it's a rotation; otherwise, 'No'.

- **Function `main()`**:
  - Reads input data.
  - Processes each test case by extracting the array and checking if it can be sorted using the operation.
  - Collects and prints the results for all test cases.

This approach efficiently determines if the array can be sorted by checking for rotations, ensuring optimal performance within the given constraints.
