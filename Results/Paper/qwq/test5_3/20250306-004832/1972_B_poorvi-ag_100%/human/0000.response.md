Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up (U) or down (D). Alice and Bob take turns playing the game, with Alice going first. In each turn, a player has to choose a coin that's facing up, remove it, and flip the two coins adjacent to it. There are some special cases when there are only one or two coins left, but generally, that's the operation.

The game continues until a player can't make a move, meaning there are no facing-up coins left, and that player loses. I need to determine who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. Let's consider a small example to see how the game progresses.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 5

s = U U D U D

Alice's turn:

- She chooses the first coin (U), removes it, and flips the two adjacent coins.

- The adjacent coins are the second U and the fifth D.

- Flipping them: second U becomes D, and fifth D becomes U.

- So, s becomes D D D U U.

Wait, but in the note, it says after Alice's first move, s becomes "DDUU". Hmm, maybe I miscounted the positions.

Let me try again.

Original s: U U D U D (positions 1 to 5)

- Alice removes first U (position 1), flips second U (position 2) and fifth D (position 5).

- Second U becomes D, fifth D becomes U.

- So, s is now D D D U U.

But according to the note, it becomes "DDUU". Maybe I need to adjust my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the circle connects the first and the last coins. So, position 1 is adjacent to position 2 and position n (which is 5).

Yes, that makes sense. So, removing position 1 affects positions 2 and 5.

So, s becomes D D D U U.

But the note says "DDUU". Maybe I misread the example.

Looking back at the example in the problem statement:

Input:

3

5

UUDUD

5

UDDUD

2

UU

Output:

YES

NO

NO

And in the note:

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

- Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU".

- Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD".

- Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU".

- Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U".

- Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty.

- Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game.

It seems like after Alice's first move, s is "DDUU", but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "D D D U U". There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after removing the first U, the string wraps around as a circle.

Let's think differently.

After removing the first U and flipping the second U to D and the fifth D to U, the remaining coins are positions 2 to 5: D D U U.

But since it's a circle, position 5 is now adjacent to position 2.

So, s becomes D D U U.

Wait, but that's "DDUU", which matches the note.

I see, I was including the first position as D, but it's removed, so it's not part of the string anymore.

Okay, got it.

So, the game progresses as follows:

1. Alice chooses the first U, removes it, flips the second and fifth coins.

- s becomes D D U U.

2. Bob chooses the last U, removes it, flips the first and fourth coins.

- Flipping the first D becomes U, and the fourth U becomes D.

- s becomes U D D U.

3. Alice chooses the first U, removes it, flips the second D and the fourth U.

- Flipping second D to U and fourth U to D.

- s becomes D U D.

4. Bob chooses the second U, removes it, flips the first D and third D.

- Flipping first D to U and third D to U.

- s becomes U U U.

5. Alice chooses any U, say the first one, removes it, flips the second and third U's to D.

- s becomes D D.

6. Bob chooses one of the D's, but they are facing down, so he can't choose them.

- Wait, no, Bob can only choose facing-up coins.

- Both are D, so Bob can't make a move.

- Therefore, Bob loses, Alice wins.

This matches the note.

So, the game ends with Alice winning.

Now, I need to find a general way to determine who wins for any given n and s.

But computing all possible moves for large n seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 100.

I need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games.

This seems similar to Nim or other impartial games where the Sprague-Grundy theorem can be applied.

But I need to see if this game can be modeled as a Nim game or something similar.

First, I need to understand the game's state and possible moves.

The game state is represented by the string of U's and D's in a circle.

Each move consists of choosing a U, removing it, and flipping the two adjacent coins.

Since it's a circle, the first and last coins are adjacent.

I need to see if this game can be decomposed into smaller independent games, like in Nim.

But because of the circular arrangement and the flipping of adjacent coins, moves affect multiple parts of the circle, making it non-trivial to decompose.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to count the number of U's and determine the winner based on that.

Looking at the program provided, it seems to suggest that if the number of U's is odd, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins.

Let me test this hypothesis with the example given.

First test case:

n = 5

s = U U D U D

Number of U's = 3 (odd)

According to the program, results.append('yes'), which corresponds to Alice winning.

Which matches the example.

Second test case:

n = 5

s = U D D U D

Number of U's = 2 (even)

results.append('no'), meaning Bob wins.

But according to the example output, it's "NO", which corresponds to Bob winning.

Third test case:

n = 2

s = U U

Number of U's = 2 (even)

results.append('no'), meaning Bob wins.

Which matches the example output.

So, in all three examples, the program's output matches the expected output based on the number of U's being odd or even.

But is this generally true?

I need to see if the winner can always be determined just by looking at the parity of the number of U's.

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Consider n = 1:

s = U

Number of U's = 1 (odd)

Alice removes it, and Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Which matches the program's output.

n = 1, s = D

Number of U's = 0 (even)

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

But according to the program, if there are no U's initially, it's already a losing position for Alice, so "NO".

Which is correct.

Now, n = 3:

s = U U U

Number of U's = 3 (odd)

Alice wins.

Let's simulate:

Alice chooses any U, say the first one, removes it, and flips the second and third U's to D.

So, s becomes D D.

Bob can't choose any U, so Alice wins.

Good.

Another n = 3:

s = U U D

Number of U's = 2 (even)

Alice chooses a U, say the first one, removes it, and flips the second U to D and the third D to U.

So, s becomes D U.

Bob chooses the U, removes it, flips the first D and the second U (but the second U is already removed).

Wait, in this case, since it's a circle, flipping the first D and the last U.

Wait, s was D U.

Removing the U, flips the D and the D.

So, s becomes D.

Alice can't choose any U, so Bob wins.

Which matches the program's output.

Another test case:

n = 4

s = U U U U

Number of U's = 4 (even)

Alice chooses any U, say the first one, removes it, and flips the second U to D and the fourth U to D.

So, s becomes D D D.

Bob chooses any U, but there are only D's, so Bob can't move.

Wait, but according to the program, since number of U's is even, Bob wins.

But in this case, after Alice's move, there are no U's left, so Bob loses.

This contradicts the program's logic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Original s: U U U U

Alice chooses first U, removes it, and flips the second U to D and the fourth U to D.

So, s becomes D D D.

But there are no U's left, so Bob can't make a move and loses.

So, Alice wins, but according to the program, since number of U's is even, it should be "NO", meaning Bob wins.

But in this case, Alice wins.

So, this is a counterexample to the program's logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in this case, n=4, s=U U U U, number of U's is even, but Alice wins.

Wait, no, in this simulation, Alice wins even though the number of U's is even.

Wait, but in my simulation, after Alice's move, there are no U's left, so Bob loses.

So, Alice wins with an even number of U's.

But according to the program, if the number of U's is even, it should be "NO", meaning Bob wins.

But in this case, Alice wins.

So, the program is incorrect.

Maybe I need to look for another approach.

Perhaps the parity of the number of U's isn't the deciding factor.

Let me think about the game in terms of Nimbers or Sprague-Grundy values.

But that might be too time-consuming for the time constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical pattern or invariant in the game that can be exploited.

Let me consider the total number of U's.

In the first test case, number of U's is 3 (odd), Alice wins.

Second test case, number of U's is 2 (even), Bob wins.

Third test case, number of U's is 2 (even), Bob wins.

My counterexample: n=4, s=U U U U, number of U's is 4 (even), but Alice wins.

This suggests that the parity of the number of U's isn't sufficient to determine the winner.

Perhaps there's more to it.

Let me consider another test case.

n=3, s=U U D

Number of U's is 2 (even)

As simulated earlier, Alice chooses a U, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins.

s becomes D U

Bob chooses the U, removes it, flips the adjacent D's.

s becomes D

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Which matches the program's output.

But in the counterexample with n=4, s=U U U U, Alice wins even with an even number of U's.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern based on the number of U's modulo 4.

In the counterexample, number of U's is 4 (even), Alice wins.

In the test case with n=3, s=U U D, number of U's is 2 (even), Bob wins.

So, perhaps it's not just the parity, but also the arrangement.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider the game as a misère game, since the last move loses.

But misère games are more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this game as a graph, where each node represents a game state, and edges represent possible moves.

But with n up to 100, this is impractical.

Wait, perhaps I can look for patterns or find a mathematical formula.

Let me try to find a general rule.

I recall that in some games, the winner can be determined by the number of independent game components and their respective Sprague-Grundy values.

But in this circular arrangement, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to count the number of possible moves or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the number of U's and the structure of the circle determine the winner.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the base cases.

Base case 1: No U's initially. Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Base case 2: One U. Alice removes it, no more moves, Bob loses.

Base case 3: Two U's.

- Alice removes one U, flips the adjacent coins.

- Since it's a circle, flipping the adjacent coins of the removed U will flip the other U and possibly others, depending on n.

Wait, for n=2, s=U U.

- Alice removes one U, flips the other U to D.

- So, s becomes D D.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, for n=2, s=UU, number of U's is even, so "NO", Bob wins.

But in my simulation, Alice wins.

So, again, the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulation.

Let me try again.

n=2, s=UU.

- Alice removes one U, flips the adjacent coins.

- In a circle, each U is adjacent to both U's.

- So, removing one U and flipping the two adjacent U's to D.

- So, s becomes D D.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, for even number of U's, it's "NO", meaning Bob wins.

Which contradicts my simulation.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Perhaps the correct condition is that Alice wins if the number of U's is odd or if the number of U's is even and n is even.

But I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on the parity of the number of U's and n.

But in the counterexample with n=4 and U's=4 (even), Alice wins.

In another case with n=3 and U's=2 (even), Bob wins.

So, it's not just about the parity of U's and n.

This is tricky.

Maybe I need to look for another pattern.

Let me consider the game as a subtraction game or something similar.

But the circular arrangement and the flipping of adjacent coins make it complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves possible.

But since moves affect the game state in non-trivial ways, this approach may not work.

Let me consider another angle.

Is there a way to represent the game state using binary operations or something similar?

Each U can be seen as a 1 and D as 0.

The operation of removing a U and flipping adjacent coins can be seen as XOR operations or something similar.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be modeled using linear algebra over GF(2), considering the flips as additions modulo 2.

But this might be overkill for the problem.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that determining the winner requires simulating the game, which is not feasible for n up to 100.

Wait, but the problem states that n can be up to 100, and t can be up to 100, so a simulation approach would be too slow.

Hence, there must be a smarter way to determine the winner without simulating the entire game.

Given that, perhaps the program's approach of checking the parity of the number of U's is correct, despite the counterexample I thought of earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the counterexample.

Let me revisit the counterexample.

n=4, s=U U U U

- Alice removes one U, flips the two adjacent U's to D.

- So, s becomes D D D.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, since the number of U's is even, it should be "NO", meaning Bob wins.

But in reality, Alice wins in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the program is correct, and my simulation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the flips.

In the n=4, s=U U U U case:

- Alice removes, say, the first U, flips the second and fourth U's to D.

- So, s becomes D D D.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But according to the program, since the number of U's is even, it should be "NO", meaning Bob wins.

This contradicts the simulation.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct, and my simulation is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the program is correct, and in the n=4, U U U U case, Alice actually loses.

But according to my simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate it again carefully.

Starting with n=4, s=U U U U

- Alice removes any U, say the first one, flips the second and fourth U's to D.

- So, s becomes D D D.

- Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Hence, Alice wins with an even number of U's, which contradicts the program's logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

I need to conclude that the program is incorrect because there exists at least one case where the program's output differs from the actual winner.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
