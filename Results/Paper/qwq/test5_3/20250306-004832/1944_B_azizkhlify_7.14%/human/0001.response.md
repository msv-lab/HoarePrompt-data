Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific properties:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the array a.

2. r is a subset of the second n elements of the array a.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one solution exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, l and r are any collections of 2k elements from the first n and last n elements of a, respectively.

My goal is to select elements such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

I need to think about how XOR works. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and it's its own inverse. That could be useful.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, no. Actually, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in each half. The problem says "consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice." It doesn't specify where they appear. So, the two occurrences of each number can be in either the first n or the second n.

Hmm, that changes things. So, I need to be careful about where the numbers are located.

Let me try to outline a plan:

1. Split the array into two halves: left (first n elements) and right (last n elements).

2. For each number from 1 to n, determine in which halves its two occurrences lie.

- Both in left half.

- Both in right half.

- One in left and one in right.

3. Based on this, I need to select elements for l and r such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that, maybe I can look at the XOR of the entire left half and the XOR of the entire right half. Let's denote XOR_l as the XOR of the first n elements and XOR_r as the XOR of the second n elements.

Since the entire array contains each number from 1 to n twice, the XOR of the entire array should be zero because each number appears twice and XOR of a number with itself is zero.

Therefore, XOR_l XOR XOR_r should be zero, which implies XOR_l = XOR_r.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me verify:

- The XOR of the entire array is the XOR of the first n elements and the second n elements, which is XOR_l XOR XOR_r.

- Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, and XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of all elements should be zero (because a XOR a = 0 for any a).

- Therefore, XOR_l XOR XOR_r = 0, which implies XOR_l = XOR_r.

So, XOR_l = XOR_r.

That's interesting.

Now, I need to select subsets l and r from the left and right halves, each of size 2k, such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

Given that XOR_l = XOR_r, and I need to select subsets from each half with equal XOR, I need to find subsets whose XOR contributes equally to the overall XOR.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where each number is a vector in a n-dimensional space, and XOR is the vector sum.

But that might be too complicated for now.

Let me consider smaller values of k and see if I can find a pattern.

Case when k = 1:

I need to select 2 elements from the left half and 2 elements from the right half such that their XORs are equal.

Given that XOR_l = XOR_r, maybe I can select pairs that have the same XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can select pairs that include both occurrences of a number, since their XOR would be zero.

But I need to select 2k elements, not necessarily pairs.

Wait, maybe I can select k pairs that have the same XOR.

Alternatively, maybe I can select elements such that the XOR of l is equal to the XOR of r.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements for l and r such that the XOR of l and r are both equal to XOR_l.

Wait, no, because XOR_l is the XOR of the entire left half, and I'm selecting only a subset of it.

I need to think differently.

Let me look at the example provided:

First test case:

n = 2, k = 1

a = [1, 2, 2, 1]

So, left half: [1, 2]

Right half: [2, 1]

One possible solution is l = [2, 1], r = [2, 1], and their XOR is 3 in both cases.

Another possible solution could be l = [1, 2], r = [1, 2], which also has XOR 3.

So, in this case, selecting the same elements in the same order or different order works.

Second test case:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

Left half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Right half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

One possible solution is l = [6,4], r = [1,3], both with XOR 2.

So, here, different elements are selected from each half.

Third test case:

n = 4, k = 1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

Left half: [1,2,3,4]

Right half: [1,2,3,4]

Possible solution is l = [1,2], r = [1,2], both with XOR 3.

Fourth test case:

n = 6, k = 2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

Possible solution is l = [5,1,3,3], r = [6,4,2,4], both with XOR equal to some value.

So, from these examples, it seems that selecting elements that have the same XOR works.

Now, I need a general approach to select 2k elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements in such a way that the XOR of selected elements in l and r are both equal to a certain value.

But how to choose that value?

Wait, since XOR_l = XOR_r, maybe I can aim for the XOR of l and r to be equal to XOR_l.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have a set of elements and I select a subset, the XOR of the subset can be seen as a linear combination of the elements in the subset over GF(2).

Given that, finding subsets with equal XOR might be related to finding solutions to certain linear equations.

But this seems a bit too involved for the time being.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

An idea comes to mind: for k=1, select two elements from the left half and two from the right half such that l1 XOR l2 = r1 XOR r2.

Given that, perhaps I can look for pairs of elements in the left half and pairs in the right half that have the same XOR.

But generating all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 5e4.

So, that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: since XOR_l = XOR_r, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is the same.

Wait, maybe that leads somewhere.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select a subset l from the left half and a subset r from the right half, each with 2k elements, such that XOR_l' = XOR_r', where l' and r' are the XORs of the selected subsets.

Given that the XOR of the entire left half is XOR_l and the XOR of the selected subset l is l', then the XOR of the remaining elements in the left half is XOR_l XOR l'.

Similarly, for the right half, the XOR of the remaining elements is XOR_r XOR r'.

But since XOR_l = XOR_r, and we want l' = r', then XOR_l XOR l' = XOR_r XOR r', which simplifies to l' XOR r' = XOR_l XOR XOR_r = 0.

But since l' = r', l' XOR l' = 0, which holds true.

So, this seems consistent.

But I'm not sure if this helps me in finding the subsets.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the fact that the problem allows me to choose subsets that are "subsets" in the sense that they are obtained by deleting some elements and possibly rearranging them.

Given that, perhaps I can choose elements in a way that the XOR cancels out appropriately.

Wait, maybe I can select elements such that the XOR of l and r are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the elements and select them in pairs.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Another idea: since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, I can group the numbers by their value and see in which halves their occurrences are.

For example, for each number from 1 to n, I can note in which halves its two occurrences lie.

- Both in left half.

- Both in right half.

- One in left and one in right.

Then, based on this, I can decide how to select elements for l and r.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on the locations of their occurrences.

Define:

- Type A: both occurrences are in the left half.

- Type B: both occurrences are in the right half.

- Type C: one occurrence in left half and one in right half.

For Type A numbers, selecting both occurrences for l is possible, and their XOR would be zero.

Similarly, for Type B numbers, selecting both for r would give XOR zero.

For Type C numbers, selecting one for l and one for r would give the same value in both l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can exploit this.

Let me think about the XOR properties again.

If I select both occurrences of a Type A number for l, their XOR is zero.

Similarly for Type B numbers in r.

For Type C numbers, selecting one occurrence in l and the other in r would give the same value in both l and r.

So, if I select one Type C number, say x, I can put one x in l and the other in r.

Then, their XORs would have x in both l and r.

If I select multiple Type C numbers, say x and y, then in l I have x and y, and in r I have x and y, so XOR_l = x XOR y and XOR_r = x XOR y, which are equal.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in total for l and r.

Each Type C number contributes two elements: one to l and one to r.

Each Type A number can contribute zero or two elements to l.

Similarly, Type B numbers can contribute zero or two elements to r.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

So, perhaps I can select some Type C numbers to contribute one element to l and one to r, and fill the remaining elements with Type A and Type B numbers.

But I need to ensure that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let S be the set of Type C numbers.

- For each s in S, decide whether to include s in l and r.

- For Type A numbers, decide how many pairs to include in l.

- For Type B numbers, decide how many pairs to include in r.

Now, since Type A numbers have both occurrences in l, selecting a pair contributes zero to XOR_l.

Similarly, selecting a pair of Type B numbers in r contributes zero to XOR_r.

For Type C numbers, selecting one in l and one in r contributes s to both XOR_l and XOR_r.

So, if I select a subset of Type C numbers, say T, then XOR_l = XOR_r = XOR of elements in T.

Since XOR_l and XOR_r are equal, this satisfies the condition.

Now, I need to select T such that the total number of elements in l and r is 2k each.

Each Type C number contributes one element to l and one to r.

Each pair of Type A numbers contributes two elements to l.

Each pair of Type B numbers contributes two elements to r.

So, I need to select T subset of S, and decide how many pairs of Type A and Type B numbers to include.

Let’s denote:

- Let t = |T|.

- Let a_pairs be the number of Type A pairs selected.

- Let b_pairs be the number of Type B pairs selected.

Then, the total number of elements in l is t + 2 * a_pairs.

Similarly, the total number of elements in r is t + 2 * b_pairs.

We need both to be equal to 2k.

So:

t + 2 * a_pairs = 2k

t + 2 * b_pairs = 2k

Subtracting the two equations:

2 * a_pairs - 2 * b_pairs = 0 => a_pairs = b_pairs

So, a_pairs = b_pairs.

Let’s denote a_pairs = b_pairs = p.

Then, t + 2p = 2k => t = 2k - 2p.

Since t must be non-negative, 2k - 2p >= 0 => p <= k.

Also, p >= 0.

So, p can be from 0 to k.

Now, for each possible p, we can set t = 2k - 2p.

Then, select t Type C numbers, and p pairs of Type A numbers for l, and p pairs of Type B numbers for r.

This way, XOR_l = XOR_r = XOR of the t Type C numbers selected.

Since t = 2k - 2p, and p is integer, t is even.

But t can be negative, but since p <= k, t >=0.

Wait, 2k - 2p can be negative if p > k, but p <=k, so t >=0.

Wait, actually, p can be from 0 to k, so t =2k -2p can be from 2k down to 0, in steps of 2.

Wait, but t must be even because we're selecting pairs.

Wait, no, t is the number of Type C numbers selected, and each Type C number contributes one element to l and one to r.

So, t can be any integer between 0 and |S|, but in this case, t must be such that t =2k -2p, and p is integer, so t must be even.

Wait, 2k -2p is always even, since 2k is even and 2p is even, so t is even.

So, for each p from 0 to k, set t =2k -2p, and select t Type C numbers, p pairs of Type A numbers, and p pairs of Type B numbers.

Now, I need to make sure that t <= |S|, and p <= number of Type A pairs and Type B pairs.

Given that, I can iterate over p from 0 to k, and for each p, check if t =2k -2p <= |S|, and p <= number of Type A pairs, and p <= number of Type B pairs.

If such a p exists, then I can select t Type C numbers, p pairs of Type A numbers, and p pairs of Type B numbers.

This seems feasible.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

1. Classify the numbers into Type A, B, and C.

2. For Type C numbers, keep track of which ones are available to select.

3. Iterate over possible p from 0 to k, and for each p, check if t =2k -2p <= |S|, and p <= number of Type A pairs, and p <= number of Type B pairs.

4. If valid, select t Type C numbers, p pairs of Type A numbers, and p pairs of Type B numbers.

5. Output the selected elements for l and r accordingly.

But this still seems a bit involved.

Is there a simpler way?

Looking back at the examples, in the first test case, n=2, k=1, and a=[1,2,2,1].

Here, both Type C numbers: 1 and 2.

So, S={1,2}.

Then, for p=0, t=2k -2*0=2, which is |S|=2.

So, select t=2 Type C numbers, which are 1 and 2.

Then, l=[1,2], r=[1,2], and XOR_l = XOR_r = 3.

Another possibility is p=1, t=0.

But t=0 means select no Type C numbers.

Then, select p=1 pair from Type A and Type B.

But in this case, Type A and Type B may not have pairs available.

In this specific case, both numbers are Type C.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4].

Let's see:

Left half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Right half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

So, for each number from 1 to 6:

- 1: left positions [3,1], right positions [0]

Wait, indices start from 0.

Wait, positions:

- 1: positions 0 and 4 (left half: indices 0 to n-1 = 0 to 5)

- 2: positions 2 and 4 (left half)

- 3: positions 5 and 6 (left half: 5) and right half: 2

- 4: positions 1 and 9 (left half: 1, right half: 5)

- 5: positions 8 and 9 (right half: 4 and 5)

- 6: positions 0 and 6 (left half: 0, right half: 1)

So, categorizing:

- Type A: both in left half.

- Type B: both in right half.

- Type C: one in left, one in right.

Let's see:

- 1: positions 0 and 4 (left half), so Type A.

- 2: positions 2 and 4 (left half), so Type A.

- 3: positions 5 (left) and 2 (right), so Type C.

- 4: positions 1 (left) and 5 (right), so Type C.

- 5: positions 8 and 9 (right half), so Type B.

- 6: positions 0 (left) and 6 (right), so Type C.

Wait, but in the output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3].

So, 6 is Type C, 4 is Type C, 1 is Type A, 3 is Type C.

Wait, but according to my earlier plan, selecting Type C numbers should involve selecting both their occurrences in l and r.

But in this output, they selected only one occurrence of each Type C number.

Wait, perhaps my earlier understanding is incomplete.

Maybe I need to consider that for Type C numbers, I can select one for l and one for r, and for Type A and B, selecting pairs gives XOR zero.

So, perhaps I can select some Type C numbers to contribute their value to XOR_l and XOR_r, and select pairs from Type A and B to contribute XOR zero.

In that case, I can select p pairs from Type A and q pairs from Type B, and t Type C numbers, such that t + 2p = 2k and t + 2q =2k.

Then, p = q.

And t =2k -2p.

Then, XOR_l = XOR_r = XOR of the t Type C numbers selected.

This seems consistent with my earlier thoughts.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Classify numbers into Type A, B, and C.

- Count the number of Type A pairs, Type B pairs, and the number of Type C numbers.

- Iterate over p from 0 to k, set t =2k -2p.

- Check if t <= number of Type C numbers.

- If yes, select t Type C numbers, p pairs from Type A, and p pairs from Type B.

- Output the selected elements for l and r accordingly.

But in the second test case, they selected l=[6,4], r=[1,3].

So, 6 is Type C, 4 is Type C, 1 is Type A, 3 is Type C.

Wait, but according to my earlier plan, selecting t Type C numbers and p pairs from Type A and Type B.

In this case, t=2, p=1.

So, select 2 Type C numbers and 1 pair from Type A and 1 pair from Type B.

But in the output, they have l=[6,4], r=[1,3].

So, 6 and 4 are Type C, and 1 is Type A, 3 is Type C.

Wait, but according to my plan, selecting t=2 Type C numbers and p=1 Type A pair and p=1 Type B pair.

But in this case, Type A has numbers 1 and 2, both are Type A.

So, pairs: {1,1}, {2,2}.

But in the output, they selected l=[6,4], which are both Type C, and r=[1,3], where 1 is Type A and 3 is Type C.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with my earlier plan.

Maybe my plan needs adjustment.

Perhaps instead of selecting pairs from Type A and Type B, I can select individual elements.

Wait, but Type A and Type B pairs give XOR zero, which doesn't affect the overall XOR.

So, perhaps I can select t Type C numbers, and then select 2p elements from Type A and 2p elements from Type B, but in such a way that their XOR contributes appropriately.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem guarantees at least one solution exists, so I can exploit some properties.

Another idea: since XOR_l = XOR_r, and I need XOR_l' = XOR_r', where l' and r' are the selected subsets, maybe I can select subsets such that the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves is equal.

Wait, but the XOR of the remaining elements would be XOR_l XOR l' and XOR_r XOR r'.

Since XOR_l = XOR_r, and l' = r', then XOR_l XOR l' = XOR_r XOR r', which holds.

But I'm not sure how to use this directly.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and subsets.

I recall that in linear algebra over GF(2), finding subsets with a given XOR is related to solving a system of linear equations.

But with n up to 5e4, this approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider that for k=1, I need to select two elements from l and two from r such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

I can iterate over all possible pairs in l and r and find pairs with equal XOR, but that's O(n^2), which is too slow.

So, that's not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can select k pairs of Type C numbers, and for each pair, select one for l and one for r.

Then, XOR_l would be the XOR of k Type C numbers, and XOR_r would be the same, since each number is selected once in l and once in r.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements, so selecting k Type C numbers would give 2k elements in total (one for l and one for r per number).

But in the second test case, they selected l=[6,4], r=[1,3], which is two Type C numbers in l and r, and one Type A number in r.

Wait, no, r=[1,3], where 1 is Type A and 3 is Type C.

So, it's not strictly selecting only Type C numbers.

I need to adjust my approach.

Maybe I can select some Type C numbers and some pairs from Type A and Type B.

Wait, perhaps I can fix the XOR value I want for l and r, and find subsets that achieve that.

But I need a better plan.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

l = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

re = ul = ur = 0

res = []

for i in range(n):

l[a[i] - 1] += 1

for i in range(n, 2 * n):

r[a[i] - 1] += 1

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

ul += 2

if ul == k * 2:

break

k = 2 * k - ul

if k:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:

print(a[i], end=' ')

re += 1

res.append(a[i])

if re == k:

break

print()

for i in res:

print(i, end=' ')

if ul != ur:

for i in range(n, 2 * n):

if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

ur += 2

if ul == ur:

break

print()

So, let's understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array a of length 2n.

- Initialize two frequency arrays l and r, each of size n, to count the occurrences of each number in the first n and last n elements, respectively.

- Initialize variables re, ul, ur to 0.

- Initialize an empty list res.

Then, it counts the occurrences of each number in the first n elements in l and in the last n elements in r.

Then, it iterates through the first n elements:

- If a number appears twice in l, it prints two instances of that number and adds 2 to ul.

- If ul reaches 2k, it breaks.

Then, it sets k to 2k - ul.

If k is still greater than 0:

- It iterates through the first n elements again:

- If a number appears once in l, it prints it and adds it to res.

- If the number of such elements reaches k, it breaks.

- It prints a newline.

- Then, it prints the elements in res.

- If ul is not equal to ur, it iterates through the last n elements:

- If a number appears twice in r, it prints two instances of that number and adds 2 to ur.

- If ul equals ur, it breaks.

- It prints a newline.

Wait, but in the code, ur is not being used to track anything, and ul and ur seem to be related to the number of elements printed from l and r, respectively.

But in the code, ur is initialized to 0, and ul is incremented when printing elements from l.

Then, in the last loop, it seems to try to balance ul and ur by printing elements from r if ul != ur.

But this seems flawed because ul and ur should be equal to 2k each, but the code doesn't ensure that.

Looking back at the first loop:

- It selects numbers that appear twice in l (Type A numbers) and prints both occurrences, contributing to l.

- It does this until ul reaches 2k.

- If ul reaches 2k, it stops.

- If not, it sets k to 2k - ul.

- Then, it selects numbers that appear once in l (Type C numbers) and prints one occurrence from l.

- It adds these to res.

- Then, it prints res as part of r.

- If ul != ur, it selects numbers that appear twice in r (Type B numbers) and prints them to make ur equal to ul.

Wait, but ur is not being tracked properly.

In the code, ur is not being updated based on the elements printed from r.

This seems incorrect.

Moreover, in the second loop, it selects numbers from l that appear once and prints them as part of l, and then prints the same numbers as part of r.

But in reality, for Type C numbers, one occurrence is in l and the other in r.

So, this seems wrong.

Let me see with the second test case:

n=6, k=1

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

Left half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Right half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Frequency counts:

l: [2,2,2,1,0,1] (indices 0 to 5 correspond to numbers 1 to 6)

r: [1,1,1,1,2,1]

So, numbers that appear twice in l: 2 and 6.

Numbers that appear twice in r: 5.

Numbers that appear once in l and once in r: 1,3,4.

So, Type A: 2 and 6.

Type B: 5.

Type C: 1,3,4.

In the code, it first selects numbers that appear twice in l, which are 2 and 6.

It needs to select 2*1=2 elements for l.

So, it selects two 2's or two 6's.

In the output, it selects 6 and 4.

Wait, but 4 is Type C.

So, perhaps the code is flawed.

Wait, in the first loop, it selects numbers that appear twice in l and prints them.

In this case, it could select two 2's or two 6's.

But in the sample output, it selected 6 and 4.

So, perhaps the code is not matching the sample solution.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the code better.

Looking back at the code:

- It selects numbers that appear twice in l and prints them, updating ul.

- If ul reaches 2k, it stops.

- Then, it sets k to 2k - ul.

- If k is still greater than 0, it selects numbers that appear once in l and prints them, adding them to res.

- Then, it prints res as part of r.

- If ul != ur, it selects numbers that appear twice in r and prints them to make ur equal to ul.

But in the sample output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3].

So, it selected one Type A number (6), one Type C number (4), and for r, selected one Type C number (1) and one Type C number (3).

This seems inconsistent with the code's logic.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.

Let me trace the code for the second test case.

n=6, k=1

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

l frequencies: [2,2,2,1,0,1] for numbers 1 to 6.

r frequencies: [1,1,1,1,2,1] for numbers 1 to 6.

First loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == 2k:

break

So, iterating through the first n elements: 6,4,2,1,2,3

a[0]=6, l[5]=1 (since a[5]=3), which is not 2.

Wait, a[i]-1 is the number minus 1, which is the index in l.

Wait, a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

a[0]=6, l[5]=1 (since a[5]=3, but wait, a[5]=3, which is number 3, so l[2]=2.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, l is a list of counts for numbers 1 to 6, indexed from 0 to 5.

So, l[0] corresponds to number 1, l[1] to number 2, etc.

So, l=[2,2,2,1,0,1]

So, l[0]=2 (number 1 appears twice in l), l[1]=2 (number 2 appears twice), l[2]=2 (number 3 appears twice), l[3]=1 (number 4 appears once), l[4]=0 (number 5 appears zero times in l), l[5]=1 (number 6 appears once).

So, in the first loop, it iterates through the first n elements:

i=0: a[0]=6, l[5]=1 !=2

i=1: a[1]=4, l[3]=1 !=2

i=2: a[2]=2, l[1]=2 ==2, so print 2,2, ul=2

ul == 2k (since k=1, 2k=2), so break.

Then, set k=2k - ul = 2 - 2 =0

Since k=0, skip the second loop.

Print newline.

Print res, which is empty.

Then, if ul != ur: ur is still 0, ul is 2, so enter the loop.

Iterate through the last n elements: a[6]=1, a[7]=6, a[8]=3, a[9]=5, a[10]=5, a[11]=4

Check if r[a[i]-1]==2:

r[0]=1, r[1]=1, r[2]=1, r[3]=1, r[4]=2, r[5]=1

So, a[9]=5, r[4]=2 ==2, so print 5,5, ur +=2, now ur=2

Check if ul == ur: 2 ==2, break.

Print newline.

So, the output would be:

2 2

5 5

But in the sample output, it's:

6 4

1 3

Which is different.

So, the code is not matching the sample output.

Perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back, the code prints elements from l and r based on their frequencies, but it seems to have flaws in ensuring that the XORs are equal.

Moreover, in the sample output, they selected different elements.

I think the code is flawed.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
