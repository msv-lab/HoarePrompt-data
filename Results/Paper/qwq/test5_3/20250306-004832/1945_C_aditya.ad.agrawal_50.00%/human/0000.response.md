Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference for which side they want to live on, represented by a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 means they want to live on the left side and 1 means the right side.

The task is to decide where to build this road so that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. Satisfaction means that they get to live on the side they wanted. The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house.

The goal is to choose the position for the road that is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions that are equally close to the middle, we should choose the one with the smaller position number.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. We have a sequence of houses, each with a preference of 0 or 1. We need to pick a position to build the road such that:

1. On the left side (houses before the road), at least half of the residents want to be on the left side (i.e., have a preference of 0).

2. On the right side (houses after the road), at least half of the residents want to be on the right side (i.e., have a preference of 1).

And among all such possible positions, we need to choose the one where the road is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions with the same closeness to the middle, we choose the one with the smaller position.

Let's consider an example to make this clearer. Take the first example from the problem:

n = 3

a = 101

Possible positions for the road are after house 1, after house 2, or after house 3, or before house 1.

- If the road is built before house 1, the left side has 0 houses, and the right side has all 3 houses.

- For the right side, we have two 1s and one 0. So, number of satisfied residents is 2 (the two 1s), which is more than half of 3 (which is 1.5, rounded up to 2). So, this position is acceptable.

- If the road is built after house 1, the left side has one house with a=1, which should want to be on the right, but it's on the left, so 0 out of 1 are satisfied, which is less than half. Not acceptable.

- After house 2: left side has two houses with a=1 and a=0, so one satisfied (the 0), which is exactly half of two. Right side has one house with a=1, and one satisfied (the 1), which is exactly half. So, both sides meet the condition.

- After house 3: left side has all three houses, right side has zero houses.

- For the left side, we have two 1s and one 0, so one satisfied (the 0), which is exactly half of three.

So, both positions 0 (before house 1) and 2 (after house 2) are acceptable. But we need to choose the one closest to the middle. For n=3, the middle is position 1.5, so position 2 is closer to 1.5 than position 0 is.

Wait, positions are between houses or before/after them. Positions are 0,1,2,3 for n=3.

Position 0: before house 1

Position 1: after house 1

Position 2: after house 2

Position 3: after house 3

The middle of the village is after house 1.5, so position 1.5. So, position 1 (after house 1) is closer to the middle than position 2.

But in the example, the output is 2. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the middle position.

Wait, the problem says to minimize |i - n/2|, where i is the position.

For n=3, n/2=1.5. So, positions are 0,1,2,3.

|0 - 1.5| = 1.5

|1 - 1.5| = 0.5

|2 - 1.5| = 0.5

|3 - 1.5| = 1.5

So, positions 1 and 2 are equally close to the middle. Then, we choose the smaller one, which is position 1.

But in the example, the output is 2. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the position is considered as the number of houses on the left side. So, position 0: 0 houses on the left, position 1: 1 house on the left, position 2: 2 houses on the left, position 3: 3 houses on the left.

So, to minimize |i - n/2|, where i is the number of houses on the left.

For n=3, n/2=1.5. So, positions are i=0,1,2,3.

|0 - 1.5| = 1.5

|1 - 1.5| = 0.5

|2 - 1.5| = 0.5

|3 - 1.5| = 1.5

Again, positions 1 and 2 are equally close, so we choose the smaller one, which is position 1.

But the example output is 2. So, perhaps the problem considers position i as after house i, and i ranges from 0 to n.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the position of the house after which the road should be laid", so position i means after house i.

In the first example, output is 2, meaning after house 2.

But according to my earlier calculation, position 1 (after house 1) and position 2 (after house 2) are both acceptable, but position 1 is closer to the middle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating position 1.

Let's check position 1: left side has house 1 with a=1, which wants to be on the right, so 0 out of 1 are satisfied, which is less than half. So, not acceptable.

Position 2: left side has houses 1 and 2, with a=1 and a=0, so one satisfied out of two, which is exactly half. Right side has house 3 with a=1, one satisfied out of one, which is more than half. So, position 2 is acceptable.

Position 0: left side has 0 houses, right side has all three houses. For right side, two 1s and one 0, so two satisfied out of three, which is more than half.

Position 3: left side has all three houses, two 1s and one 0, so one satisfied out of three, which is exactly half. Right side has zero houses.

So, positions 0 and 2 are acceptable.

Now, to minimize |i - n/2|, where i is the number of houses on the left.

For position 0: i=0, |0 - 1.5| = 1.5

Position 2: i=2, |2 - 1.5| = 0.5

Position 3: i=3, |3 - 1.5| = 1.5

So, position 2 is better.

Hence, output is 2.

I see, so position 1 (after house 1) is not acceptable because on the left side, only 0 out of 1 are satisfied, which is less than half.

So, acceptable positions are 0, 2, and 3, but among them, positions 2 and 3 have the same minimal distance of 0.5, and since we choose the smaller i, it's position 2.

Wait, position 3 has i=3, |3 - 1.5| = 1.5, which is worse than position 2's 0.5.

Wait, no, position 3 has i=3, |3 - 1.5| = 1.5, which is worse than position 2's 0.5.

So, position 2 is better.

Hence, output is 2.

Okay, now I understand.

So, to generalize, for each possible position i (from 0 to n), we need to check:

- Left side: houses 1 to i. Among them, count the number of 0s (satisfied residents). This should be at least ceil(i / 2).

- Right side: houses i+1 to n. Among them, count the number of 1s (satisfied residents). This should be at least ceil((n - i) / 2).

Then, among all positions i that satisfy these conditions, choose the one with the minimal |i - n/2|. If there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

Also, n can be up to 3e5, and t (number of test cases) up to 2e4, but sum of n over all t is up to 3e5.

So, we need an efficient solution, O(n) per test case.

Let's think about how to compute the counts efficiently.

We can precompute prefix sums for the number of 0s and 1s.

Let's define:

- prefix_z[i]: number of 0s in houses 1 to i

- prefix_o[i]: number of 1s in houses 1 to i

Then, for a given position i:

- Left side: houses 1 to i

- Number of satisfied residents on left side: prefix_z[i]

- Total residents on left side: i

- So, condition: prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Right side: houses i+1 to n

- Number of satisfied residents on right side: total 1s in right side = total 1s in all houses - 1s in houses 1 to i = (total 1s) - prefix_o[i]

- Total residents on right side: n - i

- Condition: (total 1s) - prefix_o[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Also, we need to handle the cases when i=0 or i=n.

- i=0: left side has 0 houses, right side has all n houses.

- For left side: 0 >= ceil(0 / 2) which is 0 >= 0, which is true.

- For right side: number of 1s >= ceil(n / 2)

- i=n: left side has all n houses, right side has 0 houses.

- For left side: number of 0s >= ceil(n / 2)

- For right side: 0 >= ceil(0 / 2), which is 0 >= 0, true.

So, for i=0 and i=n, we need to check the respective conditions.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we can precompute:

- total_z = total number of 0s

- total_o = total number of 1s

- prefix_z[i] = number of 0s in first i houses

- prefix_o[i] = number of 1s in first i houses

Then, for each position i (from 0 to n):

- Left side: prefix_z[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Right side: (total_o - prefix_o[i]) >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

We need to find the i that satisfies both conditions and has minimal |i - n/2|, choosing the smallest i in case of ties.

To compute ceil(x / 2), we can use (x + 1) // 2.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

input_string = input()

arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]

z = arr.count(0)

o = arr.count(1)

z_r = z

o_r = o

z_l = 0

o_l = 0

(dist, ans, pos) = (abs(n / 2), 0, 0)

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:

b_d = dist

else:

b_d = 30001

for i in arr:

pos += 1

if i == 0:

z_l += 1

z_r -= 1

else:

o_l += 1

o_r -= 1

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)):

ans = pos

b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

print(ans)

t -= 1

So, it's trying to iterate through the positions, keeping track of the counts on the left and right sides.

Let's see:

- z_r starts as total number of 0s

- o_r starts as total number of 1s

- z_l and o_l start at 0

- dist is set to abs(n / 2), which is n / 2 since n is positive.

- Then, it checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, and sets b_d to dist if true, else to 30001.

- Then, it iterates through the array, updating z_l and o_l based on the current house's preference, and correspondingly decrementing z_r and o_r.

- For each position i (from 1 to n), it checks:

- o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2

- z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2

- and if |pos - n/2| < b_d, then update ans and b_d.

Wait, but pos is the position after house i, so pos ranges from 1 to n.

But positions can also be 0 (before house 1) and n (after house n). The code seems to miss position 0 and position n.

Also, in the check, it's using o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2.

But according to my earlier analysis, for the right side, it should be (total_o - prefix_o[i]) >= ceil((n - i)/2), which is o_r >= ceil((n - i)/2).

Wait, but o_r is the remaining 1s on the right side, which is correct.

And ceil((n - i)/2) can be written as (n - i + 1) // 2.

But in the code, it's using o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2, which is not the same.

Wait, z_r + o_r is the total number of houses on the right side, which is n - i.

So, (z_r + o_r)/2 is (n - i)/2.

So, o_r >= (n - i)/2.

But ceil((n - i)/2) would be (n - i + 1) // 2.

But in the code, it's using floating point division, so (n - i)/2 could be a float, and >= compares accordingly.

For integers, o_r >= (n - i)/2 is equivalent to o_r >= ceil((n - i)/2) when n - i is odd.

Wait, no.

Wait, suppose n - i = 3, then ceil(3/2) = 2, and 3/2 = 1.5, so o_r >= 1.5, which means o_r >= 2, since o_r is integer.

Similarly, if n - i = 2, ceil(2/2)=1, and 2/2=1, so o_r >=1.

So, using floating point comparison is acceptable here.

Similarly for the left side, z_l >= (z_l + o_l)/2.

Wait, z_l + o_l = i, so z_l >= i/2, which is correct for ceil(i/2) when i is integer.

Again, using floating point division is acceptable.

So, the checks seem correct.

Now, about positions:

- The loop iterates through arr, pos from 1 to n.

- But positions can also be 0 and n.

- For position 0: need to handle separately.

- Similarly, position n needs to be handled.

In the code, it seems position 0 is handled before the loop, but not correctly.

Let's see:

Before the loop, it sets (dist, ans, pos) = (abs(n / 2), 0, 0)

Then, checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r)/2, sets b_d to dist, else to 30001.

What's the purpose of this?

Wait, z_r + o_r is n, since all houses are on the right side initially.

So, o_r >= n/2.

If o_r >= n/2, then set b_d to dist (which is n/2), else to a large number 30001.

Then, in the loop, it iterates pos from 1 to n, updating z_l and o_l, and checking the conditions.

But, for position 0, it seems to be handled before the loop, but not correctly integrated into the loop.

Wait, perhaps the variable ans is set to 0 if the condition for position 0 is met.

But in the loop, it starts from pos=1 to n.

Also, position n is not handled in the loop.

So, the code seems incomplete or incorrect in handling positions 0 and n.

In the first example, n=3, a=101.

- position 0: left side 0 houses, right side 3 houses with two 1s and one 0.

- o_r = 2 >= ceil(3/2) = 2, so acceptable.

- |0 - 1.5| = 1.5

- position 1: left side one house with a=1, z_l=0 < ceil(1/2)=1, not acceptable.

- position 2: left side two houses with a=1 and a=0, z_l=1 >= ceil(2/2)=1, right side one house with a=1, o_r=1 >= ceil(1/2)=1, acceptable.

- |2 - 1.5| = 0.5

- position 3: left side three houses with two 1s and one 0, z_l=1 >= ceil(3/2)=2? 1 < 2, not acceptable.

So, only positions 0 and 2 are acceptable.

Position 0 has |0 - 1.5| = 1.5

Position 2 has |2 - 1.5| = 0.5

So, position 2 is better.

But in the code, for position 0, it seems to set b_d to dist=1.5 if o_r >= n/2, which is true here (o_r=2 >= 1.5).

Then, in the loop, it checks positions 1 to n.

For position 1: z_l=0 >= 0.5? No, skip.

Position 2: z_l=1 >=1, o_r=1 >=0.5, and |2 -1.5|=0.5 < 1.5, so set ans=2, b_d=0.5

Position 3: z_l=1 >=1.5? No, skip.

So, ans=2, which is correct.

But in position 0, it sets b_d to dist=1.5 if o_r >= n/2, which is correct.

Then, in the loop, it checks positions 1 to n, and updates ans if a better position is found.

Seems correct in this example.

But let's check another example.

Take n=6, a=010111

- position 0: left 0, right 6 with o_r=4 >= ceil(6/2)=3, acceptable, |0 -3|=3

- position 1: left 1 house with a=0, z_l=1 >= ceil(1/2)=1, right 5 houses with o_r=3 >= ceil(5/2)=3, acceptable, |1 -3|=2

- position 2: left 2 houses with z_l=1 >=1, right 4 houses with o_r=3 >=2, acceptable, |2-3|=1

- position 3: left 3 houses with z_l=2 >=2, right 3 houses with o_r=2 >=2, acceptable, |3-3|=0

- position 4: left 4 houses with z_l=2 >=2, right 2 houses with o_r=2 >=1, acceptable, |4-3|=1

- position 5: left 5 houses with z_l=3 >=3, right 1 house with o_r=1 >=1, acceptable, |5-3|=2

- position 6: left 6 houses with z_l=3 >=3, right 0 houses with o_r=0 >=0, acceptable, |6-3|=3

So, acceptable positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Among them, position 3 has minimal |i -3|=0

So, output should be 3

But according to the sample input, for n=6, a=010111, output is 3, which matches.

Another sample input: n=6, a=011001, output=2

Let's verify:

- position 0: o_r=3 >=3, acceptable, |0-3|=3

- position 1: z_l=1 >=1, o_r=3 >=2.5, acceptable, |1-3|=2

- position 2: z_l=1 >=1, o_r=2 >=2, acceptable, |2-3|=1

- position 3: z_l=2 >=2, o_r=2 >=1.5, acceptable, |3-3|=0

- position 4: z_l=2 >=2, o_r=1 >=1, acceptable, |4-3|=1

- position 5: z_l=3 >=3, o_r=1 >=0.5, acceptable, |5-3|=2

- position 6: z_l=3 >=3, o_r=0 >=0, acceptable, |6-3|=3

So, positions 3 and 4 have minimal |i-3|=0 and 1, but position 3 is smaller, so output should be 3

But according to the sample, output is 2. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for n=6, a=011001

- position 0: left 0, right 6: o_r=3 >=3, acceptable, |0-3|=3

- position 1: left 1 (a=0), z_l=1 >=1, right 5 (a=11001), o_r=3 >=3, acceptable, |1-3|=2

- position 2: left 2 (a=01), z_l=1 >=1, right 4 (a=1001), o_r=2 >=2, acceptable, |2-3|=1

- position 3: left 3 (a=011), z_l=1 >=2, not acceptable

Wait, z_l=1 <2, so not acceptable.

Wait, in the sample, output is 2, which matches position 2.

But according to my earlier logic, position 3 is not acceptable, so position 2 is the best with |2-3|=1

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, position 3 is not acceptable because z_l=1 < ceil(3/2)=2

Yes, that's correct.

So, acceptable positions are 0,1,2,4,5,6

Among them, position 2 has |2-3|=1, position 4 has |4-3|=1, position 0 has 3, position 1 has 2, position
