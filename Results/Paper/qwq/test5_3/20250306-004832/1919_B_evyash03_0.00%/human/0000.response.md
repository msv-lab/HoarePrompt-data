Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding array values multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to minimize the total penalty.

First, I need to understand how the array a is defined. Each "+" in the string corresponds to a 1 in the array, and each "-" corresponds to a -1. So, the string "++-+" would correspond to the array [1, 1, -1, 1], for example.

Now, I need to split this array into non-empty subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate the penalty as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. Then, sum up all these penalties and find the minimum possible value.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1.

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second test case:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty is 5.

Alternatively, if I split it into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], the sum is -5, and the penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25.

So, the minimal penalty is 5.

Third test case:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+ -"

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into [1, -1, 1, -1] and [1, -1], the sum of the first subarray is 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0, so penalty is |0| * 4 = 0, and the second subarray sum is 1 -1 = 0, penalty is |0| * 2 = 0. Total penalty is 0.

That's interesting. So, if I can split the array such that each subarray's sum is zero, the penalty is zero.

But, I need to find the minimum possible penalty, so I should aim to make the sum of each subarray zero if possible.

Wait, but in the second test case, all elements are -1, so I can't make the sum zero in any subarray unless I have an even number of elements, which isn't the case here.

So, perhaps I need to consider the balance of "+" and "-" in the subarrays.

Let me think in terms of balancing the number of "+" and "-" in each subarray.

If I have equal numbers of "+" and "-", the sum is zero, and the penalty is zero.

But, if I have an imbalance, the penalty is the absolute sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.

Given that, perhaps I should try to group sequences where the number of "+" and "-" are equal.

But, in the general case, it might not be possible to make all subarrays have equal numbers of "+" and "-".

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimum penalty to split the first i elements.

Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, dp[i] = min(dp[j] + penalty(j+1 to i))

But, with n up to 5000, and t up to 1000, this would be O(n^2), which might be too slow for the time constraints.

Wait, 5000 * 5000 is 25 million operations per test case, and with t=1000, that's 25 billion operations, which is definitely too slow.

So, I need a more efficient approach.

Maybe there's a greedy way to split the array.

Let me consider the cumulative sum of the array.

Define prefix sums:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a[0]

prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix[n] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]

If I split the array at positions k1, k2, ..., km, then the sum of each subarray is prefix[k_{i+1}] - prefix[k_i]

And the penalty for each subarray is |prefix[k_{i+1}] - prefix[k_i]| * (k_{i+1} - k_i)

So, the total penalty is sum over i from 0 to m of |prefix[k_{i+1}] - prefix[k_i]| * (k_{i+1} - k_i)

I need to choose the split positions to minimize this total penalty.

This seems similar to segmenting the prefix sum array in a way that minimizes the cost based on the differences and lengths.

But, it's still not clear how to optimize this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the entire array as one subarray.

Then, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the third test case, sum(a) = 0, so penalty is 0.

In the second test case, sum(a) = -5, penalty is 25.

In the first test case, sum(a) = 1, penalty = 1.

So, in some cases, it's better to split the array into smaller subarrays where the sum is zero.

But, in other cases, like the second test case, where all elements are negative, splitting into individual elements gives a better penalty.

So, perhaps I need to identify segments where the sum is zero, and keep them together, and for segments where the sum is not zero, maybe split them into individual elements.

Wait, but in the second test case, splitting into individual elements gives a better penalty than having longer subarrays with negative sums.

Wait, in the second test case, sum of any subarray is negative, and taking absolute value makes it positive, but longer subarrays would have larger penalties.

So, in that case, splitting into smallest possible subarrays is better.

In the third test case, grouping subarrays where the sum is zero gives zero penalty.

So, perhaps I need to group subarrays where the sum is zero, and for parts where the sum is not zero, maybe handle them differently.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of balancing the "+" and "-" signs.

Let me consider that each "+" adds 1 and each "-" adds -1.

If I have a sequence where the number of "+" equals the number of "-", the sum is zero.

So, if I can group such sequences together, their penalty is zero.

In the third test case, "+-+-+ -", which is [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1], the sum is zero, so penalty is zero.

In the second test case, all are "-", so I can't make the sum zero in any subarray, so splitting into individual elements minimizes the penalty.

Wait, but in the second test case, splitting into individual elements gives penalty 1 for each element, total 5, whereas splitting into two subarrays of size 2 and 3 would give penalties |sum of first 2|*2 + |sum of last 3|*3 = |(-1)+(-1)|*2 + |(-1)+(-1)+(-1)|*3 = | -2 |*2 + | -3 |*3 = 4 + 9 = 13, which is worse than 5.

So, splitting into individual elements is better.

Similarly, in the first test case, splitting into single element gives penalty 1, which is the only option.

In the third test case, splitting into two subarrays [1,-1,1,-1] and [1,-1] both have sum zero, so total penalty is zero.

So, perhaps the strategy is to maximize the number of subarrays with sum zero.

But, in some cases, even if a subarray doesn't sum to zero, it might be better to keep it together with another subarray that cancels it out.

Wait, for example, if I have "+-+", sum is 1, but if I split it into [+, -] and [+] , penalties are |1 -1|*2 + |1|*1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is worse than keeping it as [+, -, +], sum is 1, penalty is |1|*3 = 3.

So, same penalty.

But, if I have "+-++-", sum is 1 -1 +1 +1 -1 = 1, penalty is |1|*5 = 5.

If I split into [+, -] and [+, +, -], penalties are |1 -1|*2 + |1 +1 -1|*3 = 0*2 + 1*3 = 3, which is better than 5.

So, sometimes splitting can reduce the penalty even if individual subarrays don't have sum zero.

So, maximizing the number of subarrays with sum zero is not always optimal.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the prefix sums again.

Letâ€™s define prefix sums as follows:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a[0]

prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix[n] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]

Then, the penalty for a subarray from i to j is |prefix[j] - prefix[i]| * (j - i)

So, the total penalty for a splitting is sum over all subarrays of |prefix[j] - prefix[i]| * (j - i)

I need to minimize this total penalty.

I need to find a way to group the subarrays optimally.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal penalty.

Suppose I have a subarray from i to j, and another from j to k.

The total penalty is |prefix[j] - prefix[i]| * (j - i) + |prefix[k] - prefix[j]| * (k - j)

I need to see if it's better to merge them into one subarray from i to k, with penalty |prefix[k] - prefix[i]| * (k - i)

So, I need to compare |prefix[j] - prefix[i]| * (j - i) + |prefix[k] - prefix[j]| * (k - j) vs |prefix[k] - prefix[i]| * (k - i)

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a way to model this with dynamic programming.

Let me try defining dp[i], which is the minimal penalty for the first i elements.

Then, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty(j, i)

Where penalty(j, i) is |prefix[i] - prefix[j]| * (i - j)

This is a standard dynamic programming approach, but with n=5000 and t=1000, it would be too slow because it's O(n^2) per test case, leading to 25 billion operations in total.

I need a faster approach.

Let me see if I can find a way to split the array into subarrays where the sum is zero, and handle the remaining parts optimally.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider runs of "+" and "-" signs.

Wait, let's consider that.

If I have a run of "+" signs, their sum is positive, and if I have a run of "-" signs, their sum is negative.

If I can balance positive and negative runs, perhaps I can make the sum zero in some subarrays.

For example, in the third test case, "+-+-+ -", which is [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1], the sum is zero.

So, splitting into subarrays where the number of "+" equals the number of "-" would be ideal.

But, in practice, it might not always be possible.

Maybe I can group runs in a way that the sum is zero, or as close to zero as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of matching "+" and "-" signs.

Like matching parentheses, where "+" is an opening parenthesis and "-" is a closing one.

Then, I can find matching pairs and make their sum zero.

But, this might not work directly, because the order matters.

Wait, perhaps I can use a balance similar to parenthesis balancing.

Let me define a balance variable that increases by 1 for each "+", and decreases by 1 for each "-".

I can iterate through the array, keeping track of this balance.

Whenever the balance becomes zero, I can split the array there, as the sum up to that point is zero.

Then, continue with the remaining part.

In the third test case:

Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5

       + - + - + -

Balance:1 0 1 0 1 0

So, at indices 1, 3, 5, the balance is zero.

So, I can split at these points.

If I split at index 1 and 3, I get subarrays [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], each with sum zero, total penalty zero.

Alternatively, I can split at index 3 and 5, making subarrays [0,3] and [4,5], both with sum zero.

Or, split at index 5 only, making one subarray [0,5] with sum zero.

All these give total penalty zero.

So, in this case, the greedy approach of splitting whenever the balance is zero works.

In the second test case:

n=5, s="-----"

Balance: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5

Never becomes zero, so no splits where the sum is zero.

In this case, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- Iterate through the array, keeping track of the balance.

- Whenever the balance becomes zero, make a split there.

- For parts where the balance doesn't reach zero, split them into individual elements.

Wait, but in the second test case, balance is always negative, so no splits where balance is zero, so split into individual elements.

In the third test case, balance reaches zero multiple times, so split at those points.

This seems promising.

But, let's check another example.

Fourth test case:

n=10

s="--+++++++ -"

So, a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Balance:

Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

       - - + + + + + + + -

Balance:-1 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4

Here, balance becomes zero at index 3.

So, if I split at index 3, I get subarrays [0,3] and [4,9].

Sum of [0,3]: -1 -1 +1 +1 = 0, penalty 0.

Sum of [4,9]: +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 = 4, penalty |4| * 6 = 24.

Total penalty: 0 + 24 = 24.

But, according to the sample output, the minimal penalty is 4.

So, my approach doesn't give the minimal penalty here.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider multiple splits where the balance is zero.

In this case, balance is zero at index 3, and at no other point.

So, splitting at index 3 gives total penalty 0 + 24 = 24.

But the minimal penalty is 4.

So, perhaps splitting at different points can give a better penalty.

Let me see.

If I split at index 3 and index 9:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,9]: sum 4, penalty |4| * 6 = 24.

Total: 24.

Not better.

If I split at index 3 and index 5:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,5]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[6,9]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 4 = 8.

Total: 0 + 4 + 8 = 12.

Better than 24, but still not 4.

Wait, maybe I can split at more points.

If I split at index 3, index 5, and index 9:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,5]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[6,9]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 4 = 8.

Total: 0 + 4 + 8 = 12.

Same as above.

If I split at index 3, index 5, and index 7:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,5]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[6,7]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[8,9]: sum 0, penalty 0.

Total: 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 8.

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, maybe I need to split at different positions.

If I split at index 3 and index 7:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,7]: sum 4, penalty |4| * 4 = 16.

[8,9]: sum 0, penalty 0.

Total: 0 + 16 + 0 = 16.

Worse than previous splits.

Alternatively, split at index 3 and index 5:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,5]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[6,9]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 4 = 8.

Total: 0 + 4 + 8 = 12.

Same as before.

Wait, how can the minimal penalty be 4?

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps splitting into [0,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8,9]:

[0,3]: sum 0, penalty 0.

[4,5]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[6,7]: sum 2, penalty |2| * 2 = 4.

[8,9]: sum 0, penalty 0.

Total: 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 8.

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider splitting at positions where the balance is the same.

Wait, perhaps equalizing the balance in some way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the array to minimize the penalty, but no, the array is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of splits where the sum is zero.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the minimal penalty is 4, but according to my approach, I can't get below 8.

So, perhaps my approach is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the penalty for a subarray is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum over all subarrays of |sum| * length.

I need a way to group elements such that this sum is minimized.

Perhaps I can look for segments where the sum is as small as possible in absolute value.

But, that seems too vague.

Let me consider that for a subarray with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

I need to minimize the sum of |S| * L over all subarrays.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that |S| is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray.

If the subarray has more "+" than "-", S is positive, if more "-" than "+", S is negative, and |S| is its absolute value.

I need to minimize |S| * L.

So, for a given subarray, |S| * L is minimized when |S| is small.

But, I need to consider the balance between |S| and L.

If I have a long subarray with S close to zero, the penalty could be small, but if S is not exactly zero, it might be better to split it into smaller subarrays.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

But, in practice, it's hard to quantify "as close to zero as possible" in a way that leads to an efficient algorithm.

Maybe I need to consider the problem differently.

Let me consider that each "+" is a +1 and each "-" is a -1.

I need to split the array into subarrays and for each subarray, calculate |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the total sum of these penalties.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize this total.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of unbalanced "+" and "-" signs.

Wait, but that's not clear.

Let me consider that in the third test case, all "+" and "-" are balanced, so penalty is zero.

In the second test case, all are "-", so I can't balance them, so penalty is the sum of individual penalties, which is 5.

In the fourth test case, the minimal penalty is 4.

Wait, in the fourth test case, s = "--+++++++ -"

Which is [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Sum is -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 -1 = -2 + 7 -1 = 4

If I split into subarrays where the sum is as close to zero as possible, I can minimize the penalty.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of minimizing the product of the absolute sum and the length.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the sum in some way.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think about the minimal penalty in terms of the number of unbalanced elements.

Wait, perhaps I can count the number of "-" signs that don't have a corresponding "+" sign to cancel them out.

Similarly, the number of "+" signs without a corresponding "-" sign.

In the second test case, all are "-", so all are unbalanced, giving a penalty of 5.

In the third test case, all "-" have a corresponding "+", so penalty is zero.

In the fourth test case, there are two "-" and seven "+", so five "+" are unbalanced (7 - 2 = 5), giving a penalty of 5 * 1 = 5, but the sample output is 4.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal possible penalty, which is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of unbalanced elements multiplied by their group lengths.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that don't have a corresponding "+" sign after them, considering the order.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of flips needed to make the sum zero.

But, that doesn't directly help.

Let me consider that in the fourth test case, I have two "-" and seven "+", so I can pair each "-" with a "+", and have five "+" left unpaired.

Each unpaired "+" will contribute to the penalty.

But, according to the sample output, the minimal penalty is 4, not 5.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions of the "-" signs.

In the fourth test case:

Indices: 0: -, 1: -, 2: +, 3: +, 4: +, 5: +, 6: +, 7: +, 8: +, 9: -

So, two "-" at positions 0 and 1, and one "-" at position 9.

I can pair the first two "-" with two "+" signs, and have five "+" left, but that would suggest a penalty of 5, not 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of unpaired "-" signs.

Wait, but in the second test case, all are "-", so penalty is 5.

In the fourth test case, penalty is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by their positions or something.

This isn't leading me anywhere.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the minimal number of "-" signs that can't be paired with "+" signs.

But, in the fourth test case, I have two "-" and seven "+", so I can pair two "-" with two "+", and have five "+" left, which would suggest a penalty of 5, but the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps it's not that.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by the length of the subarrays they are in.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the unpaired "-" signs multiplied by their group lengths.

But, again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each "-" sign, I can try to pair it with a "+" sign that comes after it, and the penalty is the distance between them.

But, that seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that don't have a corresponding "+" sign after them.

In the fourth test case, positions 0 and 1 have "-", and positions 2 to 8 have "+", and position 9 has "-".

So, I can pair the first two "-" with two of the seven "+", and have five "+" left, but the last "-" doesn't have any "+" after it to pair with.

Wait, but in this case, I have seven "+" and two "-", so I can pair all "-" with "+", and have five "+" left.

But, according to the sample output, the minimal penalty is 4, not 5.

So, perhaps it's not just the number of unpaired "-" signs.

Wait, maybe it's the number of unpaired "-" signs plus the number of unpaired "+" signs.

But, in this case, there are no unpaired "-" signs, since I can pair all "-" with "+", and have five "+" left, which are unpaired.

So, penalty would be 5, but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of unpaired signs in some way.

This isn't working.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the minimal number of "-" signs that are not followed by a "+" sign.

In the fourth test case, the first two "-" are followed by "+" signs, and the last "-" is not followed by a "+" sign, but since it's the last position, it's followed by nothing.

So, one unpaired "-" sign, but the sample output is 4, not 1.

So, that can't be.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the unpaired subarrays.

But, again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays that cannot be paired to sum to zero.

But, I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of all subarrays, each multiplied by their length, after optimally pairing subarrays to cancel out their sums.

But, this seems too vague to implement.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not canceled by a "+" sign.

But, again, in the fourth test case, I have two "-" and seven "+", so I can cancel two "-" with two "+", leaving five "+" unpaired.

But, the sample output is 4, not 5.

So, perhaps it's not that.

Wait, maybe it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by 2.

No, 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the sample output of 4.

Wait, but in the second test case, all are "-", so no "+" to pair with, so penalty should be 5, which matches.

In the third test case, three "-" and three "+", all can be paired, so penalty is zero.

In the fourth test case, two "-" and seven "+", so two "-" are paired, leaving five "+" unpaired.

If each unpaired "-" contributes 2 to the penalty, then 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the second test case, all are "-", so no "+" to pair with, so penalty is 5, which doesn't match 2 * 5 = 10.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by 1, not 2.

Wait, in the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by the number of unpaired "+" signs.

But, that doesn't make sense.

I'm clearly missing something.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not canceled by a "+" sign, multiplied by 2.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, five unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 10, but the sample output is 5.

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by 1.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 2, but sample output is 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by the number of unpaired "+" signs.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" and five unpaired "+", giving 2 * 5 = 10, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by something else.

This isn't working.

I need to think of another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the unpaired subarrays.

But, again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays that cannot be paired to cancel each other out.

But, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the sums of all subarrays, each multiplied by their length, after grouping subarrays optimally.

But, I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not canceled by a "+" sign, where each unpaired "-" contributes a penalty equal to the number of "+" signs after it.

Wait, not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to minimize the sum over all subarrays of |sum of subarray| * length of subarray.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize this sum.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each "-" sign, I can pair it with the nearest "+" sign after it, and consider the penalty accordingly.

But, I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as matching "-" signs with "+" signs, and the penalty is the distance between them.

But, again, not sure.

Let me consider that each "-" sign needs to be matched with a "+" sign, and the penalty is the distance between them.

Then, the total penalty would be the sum of these distances.

But, in the fourth test case, matching two "-" with two "+" would give a penalty of, say, 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, all are "-", so no "+" to match with, so penalty is the sum of individual penalties, which is 5.

In the third test case, three "-" and three "+", so matching them would give penalty zero, since the sums can be zero.

This seems promising.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to twice the number of unpaired "-" signs.

Wait, in the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs give penalty 4, which matches.

In the second test case, five unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 10, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the penalty is equal to the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by 2.

In the fourth test case: 2 * 2 = 4.

In the second test case: 5 * 1 = 5.

Wait, that matches.

But, why would it be multiplied by 2?

Wait, perhaps for each unpaired "-" sign, the penalty is 2.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs give penalty 4.

In the second test case, five unpaired "-" signs give penalty 10, but sample output is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the penalty for each unpaired "-" sign is 1.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 2, but sample output is 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps the penalty for each unpaired "-" sign is equal to the number of "+" signs after it.

In the fourth test case, positions 0 and 1 have "-", and positions 2 to 8 have "+", position 9 has "-".

So, for the first "-" at position 0, there are 7 "+" signs after it.

For the second "-" at position 1, there are 7 "+" signs after it.

For the third "-" at position 9, there are no "+" signs after it.

So, total penalty would be 7 + 7 + 0 = 14, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by the number of unpaired "+" signs.

In the fourth test case, two unpaired "-" signs and five unpaired "+" signs, 2 * 5 = 10, which doesn't match 4.

This isn't working.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not followed by a "+" sign.

In the fourth test case, the first two "-" are followed by "+", and the last "-" is not followed by any sign since it's the last position.

So, one unpaired "-", but the sample output is 4, not 1.

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of consecutive "-" signs multiplied by something.

In the fourth test case, there are two consecutive "-" at the start, and one at the end.

So, total of three "-" that are not followed by "+", but actually, the first two "-" are followed by "+", and the last "-" is not followed by any sign.

So, only one unpaired "-", but sample output is 4.

Still not matching.

I need to think of another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the lengths of subarrays consisting entirely of "-" signs.

In the fourth test case, there are two "-" at the start and one at the end.

So, lengths are 2 and 1, sum is 3, but sample output is 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the squares of the lengths of "-" runs.

2^2 + 1^2 = 5, which doesn't match 4.

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the lengths of "-" runs multiplied by 2.

2 + 1 = 3, multiplied by 2 is 6, not 4.

No.

This isn't leading me anywhere.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not part of a pair with a "+" sign.

In the fourth test case, two "-" can be paired with two "+", leaving five "+" unpaired.

But, the sample output is 4, not 2.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs plus the number of unpaired "+" signs.

Two unpaired "-" and five unpaired "+", total 7, which doesn't match 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of unpaired "-" signs multiplied by 2.

Two unpaired "-" signs give penalty 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, five unpaired "-" signs would give penalty 10, but the sample output is 5.

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps for the second test case, it's the number of unpaired "-" signs.

Five unpaired "-" signs give penalty 5.

In the fourth test case, it's twice the number of unpaired "-" signs.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I need to find a consistent rule.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not followed by a "+" sign, multiplied by some factor.

In the fourth test case, only the last "-" is not followed by a "+", so one unpaired "-", but sample output is 4.

No.

This isn't working.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the balance goes negative.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the balance is:

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Balance: -1 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4

So, the balance goes negative at indices 0 and 1, but then recovers to zero at index 3.

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the balance is negative.

In the fourth test case, balance is negative at indices 0 and 1, so penalty is 2, but sample output is 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances.

At index 0: -1, index 1: -2, index 2: -1, index 3: 0, etc.

Sum of absolute negative balances: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Interesting.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances.

In the fourth test case, sum is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

In the second test case, balance is -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, sum of absolute negatives is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal possible sum of absolute negative balances over all possible ways of splitting.

But, in the second test case, splitting into individual elements gives balance -1 at each step, sum of absolute negatives is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, sum is 4, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances when processed in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances in a single pass.

In the fourth test case: -1 + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = sum of negatives is -1 + (-2) + (-1) = -4, absolute value is 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case: -1 + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) = -15, absolute value is 15, but sample output is 5.

Wait, but earlier I thought that splitting into individual elements gives sum of absolute negatives as 5, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances when processing the array.

But, I need to confirm this.

In the first test case: balance is +1, sum of negatives is 0, but sample output is 1.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances at each step.

In the fourth test case: sum of absolute negatives is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches.

In the second test case: sum of absolute negatives is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, but sample output is 5.

Wait, but if I split into individual elements, the sum is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances when splitting into individual elements.

But, in the fourth test case, splitting into individual elements would give sum of absolute negatives as 1 (for first "-") + 1 (for second "-") + 0 (for "+") ... + 1 (for last "-") = 3, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps not.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times the balance is negative.

In the fourth test case, balance is negative at indices 0,1,2, so 3, but sample output is 4.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the absolute values of the negative balances, but considering the length of subarrays.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of "-" signs that are not canceled by a "+" sign, where each uncancelled "-" contributes a penalty equal to the number of "+" signs after it plus one.

In the fourth test case, two uncancelled "-" signs:

- First "-": seven "+" after it.

- Second "-": six "+" after it.

- Third "-": zero "+" after it.

So, penalty would be 7 + 6 + 0 = 13, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of uncancelled "-" signs multiplied by the number of "+" signs after them.

Two uncancelled "-" signs, with seven and six "+" after them, but that would be 7 + 6 = 13 again.

No.

This isn't working.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the sum over all positions of the absolute value of the balance at that position.

In the fourth test case: balances: 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4

Sum is 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 23, which doesn't match the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps sum of negative balances only.

In the fourth test case, negative balances: -1, -2, -1, sum 4, which matches.

In the second test case: balances: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, sum 15, but sample output is 5.

Wait, but if I consider only the sum of absolute negatives in individual elements, it's 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum over all positions of the absolute value of the negative balance.

In other words, for each position, if the balance is negative, add its absolute value to the penalty.

In the fourth test case: positions 0,1,2 have balances -1, -2, -1, sum 4.

In the second test case: positions 0 to 4 have balances -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, sum 1
