Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at position i, then the string must have exactly that letter at position i. If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, then the string must have a different lowercase letter at that position.

So, for example, if t has 'a' at position i, then s must have 'a' at position i. If t has 'A' at position i, then s must have any letter except 'a' at position i.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template t. That means, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Additionally, c should not match the template t. That means there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to find a template t that satisfies these conditions.

Let me consider the constraints:

- n can be from 1 to 20.

- Strings a, b, c are consisting of only lowercase Latin letters.

- Template t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Given that n is small (up to 20), I might be able to iterate through possible templates, but the number of possible templates is 52^n, which is too large for n=20.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let's think about each position independently.

For each position i, I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, then:

- a[i] must equal t[i].

- b[i] must equal t[i].

- c[i] must not equal t[i].

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then:

- a[i] must not equal t[i]'s lowercase.

- b[i] must not equal t[i]'s lowercase.

- c[i] must equal t[i]'s lowercase.

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so its lowercase version is the corresponding lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i]:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

For lowercase t[i]:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

So, for each position i, I have two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

Each choice has constraints on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to choose for each position whether to make it lowercase or uppercase, such that all positions satisfy their individual constraints.

This sounds like a problem where I need to check if there's an assignment of t[i] being lowercase or uppercase that satisfies all the conditions for a, b, and c.

Let me consider each position independently and see what possibilities exist.

For each position i:

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

- Then, a[i] must equal t[i].

- b[i] must equal t[i].

- c[i] must not equal t[i].

So, for this choice:

- a[i] == b[i] (since both equal t[i])

- c[i] != a[i]

If a[i] != b[i], then this choice is invalid because a[i] and b[i] must both equal t[i].

If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then this choice is possible.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, for this choice:

- a[i] != some lowercase letter (which is t[i].lower())

- b[i] != the same lowercase letter

- c[i] == that lowercase letter

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so t[i].lower() is a specific lowercase letter.

Let me denote t[i].lower() as some lowercase letter, say 'x'.

Then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

So, 'x' must be a lowercase letter that is different from a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be equal to 'x'.

Therefore, 'x' must not be equal to a[i] or b[i], but equal to c[i].

So, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], because 'x' can't be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Wait, no.

Wait, 'x' is t[i].lower(), which is some uppercase letter's lowercase version.

But t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is a specific lowercase letter.

But in this case, 'x' must be equal to c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, no.

Wait, from the conditions:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

So, 'x' must be different from a[i] and b[i], but equal to c[i].

Therefore, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for this choice to be possible:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

Otherwise, there's no 'x' that satisfies a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

So, summarizing:

For each position i:

- If choosing t[i] as lowercase:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

- If choosing t[i] as uppercase:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

Additionally, in the uppercase choice, t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

So, for each position i, I need to check if either of these two choices is possible.

Now, for the entire string, I need to choose for each position i whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that:

- For all positions i:

- If t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Or t[i] is uppercase: c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Wait, but in the uppercase case, t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

But in the problem statement, it's not specified what t[i] is in the uppercase case, only that s[i] must be different from t[i].lower().

But in our case, for the uppercase choice, t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to set t[i].lower() to c[i] in the uppercase choice.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase, then t[i].lower() is some lowercase letter, say 'x'.

Then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

So, 'x' must be equal to c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for the uppercase choice:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

And t[i] is the uppercase version of c[i].

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, and t[i].lower() is c[i].

So, t[i] is the uppercase version of c[i].

But c[i] is lowercase, so t[i] is uppercase version of c[i].

But in Python, if c[i] is lowercase, t[i] = c[i].upper().

So, in this case, t[i] is uniquely determined as c[i].upper().

Therefore, for the uppercase choice, t[i] is c[i].upper(), and the conditions are a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Similarly, for the lowercase choice:

- t[i] = some lowercase letter.

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

So, t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

Therefore, for the lowercase choice to be possible:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

And for the uppercase choice to be possible:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

Now, for each position i, I need to choose either lowercase or uppercase for t[i], with the corresponding constraints.

Moreover, in the uppercase choice, t[i] is fixed to c[i].upper().

In the lowercase choice, t[i] is fixed to a[i] (which must equal b[i]).

So, in summary:

For each position i:

- If choosing lowercase:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

- t[i] = a[i]

- If choosing uppercase:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

- t[i] = c[i].upper()

Now, I need to assign to each position i either lowercase or uppercase, with the above constraints.

This seems like a problem where I need to check if there's an assignment of choices (lowercase or uppercase) to each position, such that all constraints are satisfied.

Given that n is small (up to 20), I could potentially iterate through all possible assignments of choices, but that would be 2^n, which for n=20 is about a million, which is acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think about it.

For each position i, I have two choices: lowercase or uppercase.

Each choice has its own constraints.

I need to ensure that for all positions, the choices are consistent.

In particular, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can't choose lowercase, because for lowercase, a[i] must equal b[i].

Similarly, for uppercase, I need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for each position i:

- If a[i] != b[i], I can only choose uppercase, provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- If a[i] == b[i], I have two options:

- Choose lowercase, provided that c[i] != a[i].

- Choose uppercase, provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but since a[i] == b[i], choosing uppercase requires c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which is the same as c[i] != a[i], since a[i] == b[i].

So, in this case, choosing uppercase requires c[i] != a[i].

Choosing lowercase requires c[i] != a[i].

So, when a[i] == b[i], both choices require c[i] != a[i].

If a[i] != b[i], then I can only choose uppercase if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in this case, a[i] != b[i], so a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] must hold for the uppercase choice.

Wait, no, the condition is c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I can only choose uppercase if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, I have no choice but to choose lowercase, but lowercase requires a[i] == b[i], which is not the case here.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must choose uppercase, and the condition is c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I can't choose uppercase, but I have no other choice, so in this case, it's impossible.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], it's only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

In other words, for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

For positions where a[i] == b[i], I have two choices:

- Choose lowercase: c[i] != a[i]

- Choose uppercase: c[i] != a[i]

So, in this case, as long as c[i] != a[i], I can choose either.

If c[i] == a[i], then I can't choose anything, because both choices require c[i] != a[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] == a[i], it's impossible.

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] == a[i], impossible

- Else, can choose either lowercase or uppercase

So, the overall condition for the existence of such a template t is:

- For all positions i:

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

Wait, no.

Wait, for positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] == a[i], it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible to choose either lowercase or uppercase.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], it's only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, to have a valid template, I need:

- For all positions i:

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

Wait, but for positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] == a[i], it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible.

So, to have a valid template, I need that for all positions i:

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

In other words, for all positions i:

- c[i] != a[i] (since if a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i]; if a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i])

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != b[i]

Wait, let's see.

Wait, from the above:

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i]

So, in all positions, c[i] != a[i]

- Additionally, for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != b[i]

So, overall, c != a, and for positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != b[i]

Wait, but c != a means that there exists at least one i where c[i] != a[i], but in our condition, we need c[i] != a[i] for all i where a[i] == b[i].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think differently.

I need to ensure that for all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

So, in other words:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i]

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

This seems straightforward.

So, to check if such a template exists, I need to verify that for all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If this holds, then I can construct the template by choosing for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i], choose lowercase (t[i] = a[i])

- If a[i] != b[i], choose uppercase (t[i] = c[i].upper())

Wait, but in the uppercase choice, t[i].lower() must be c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but in the position where a[i] != b[i], I have to choose t[i] as c[i].upper(), provided that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which is already ensured by the conditions.

So, in summary, if the above conditions hold for all positions, then such a template exists.

Otherwise, it doesn't.

Therefore, in the code, I need to iterate through each position and check these conditions.

If all positions satisfy their respective conditions, then print "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait, but in the problem, it's "YES" if such a template exists, "NO" otherwise.

So, implementing this logic should solve the problem.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

The provided program is:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

counter = 0

for x in c:

if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

counter += 1

if no:

print('NO')



So, let's analyze this.

First, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, a, b, c.

Then, it sets no = True.

Then, checks if c == a or c == b. If so, sets no = False and prints 'NO'.

Else, it iterates through each character in c, and for each character, checks if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]. If this is true for any position, it sets no = False and prints 'YES'.

If after checking all positions no such position is found, it prints 'NO'.

Wait, is this correct?

Let's see.

First, if c == a or c == b, it prints 'NO'.

This makes sense because if c is exactly equal to a or b, then c matches the template that a and b match, which contradicts the requirement that c does not match the template.

So, this is correct.

Then, for each position, it checks if c[i] not in a[i] and c[i] not in b[i].

Wait, but a and b are strings, so a[counter] is a single character, same for b[counter].

So, x not in a[counter] means x != a[counter], since a[counter] is a single character.

Similarly, x not in b[counter] means x != b[counter].

So, the condition is:

if x != a[counter] and x != b[counter]:

Then, set no = False and print 'YES'.

Otherwise, continue.

Wait, but in the problem, for positions where a[i] == b[i], we need c[i] != a[i].

And for positions where a[i] != b[i], we need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, the provided code is checking for each position if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which corresponds to the condition for positions where a[i] != b[i].

But for positions where a[i] == b[i], it only needs c[i] != a[i].

But the code is checking c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] for all positions.

Wait, but if a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i] implies c[i] != b[i], since a[i] == b[i].

So, the condition c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] is equivalent to c[i] != a[i], because if a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i] implies c[i] != b[i].

Similarly, if a[i] != b[i], the condition is c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, in both cases, the condition c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] is sufficient for positions where a[i] != b[i], and for positions where a[i] == b[i], it's equivalent to c[i] != a[i].

Therefore, the provided code is checking for each position if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If there exists at least one position where this is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

But according to our earlier reasoning, we need to check that for all positions, the conditions hold.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the provided code, it checks if c == a or c == b, then prints 'NO'.

Else, if there exists at least one position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, 'NO'.

But according to our earlier reasoning, we need all positions to satisfy their respective conditions.

So, the provided code seems insufficient because it only checks if there exists at least one position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], but it doesn't ensure that all positions satisfy their conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the four possible scenarios for each position i:

1. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]: In this case, we can choose lowercase for t[i].

2. a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]: In this case, we can choose uppercase for t[i].

3. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i]: Impossible.

4. a[i] != b[i] and (c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]): Impossible.

So, for the template to exist, all positions must fall into either category 1 or 2.

Therefore, for all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

So, to check if such a template exists, we need to ensure that for all positions i, the above conditions hold.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- If c == a or c == b, then it's impossible, print 'NO'

- Else, check if for all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- If all positions satisfy their conditions, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'

But the provided code only checks if there exists at least one position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which is not sufficient.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible that some positions are fine with lowercase and some with uppercase.

So, perhaps the provided code is incorrect.

Let me look at the example provided.

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's analyze the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

So, position 1:

a[1]=a, b[1]=b, c[1]=c

Since a[1] != b[1], we need c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1]. c[1]=c != a and c != b, so it's possible.

So, the answer is 'YES', which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

So, position 1:

a[1]=a, b[1]=b, c[1]=a

a[1] != b[1], so need c[1] != a and c[1] != b. But c[1]=a != b is false, since a == a.

So, it's impossible.

Thus, 'NO', matching the sample output.

Third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

I need to check for each position:

For positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i]

For positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Let's compare:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Position 1: m != l, so need c[1] != m and c[1] != l. c[1]=a != m and a != l.

Position 2: a != u, need c[2] != a and c[2] != u. c[2]=d != a and d != u.

Position 3: t != c, need c[3] != t and c[3] != c. c[3]=h != t and h != c.

Position 4: h != k, need c[4] != h and c[4] != k. c[4]=o != h and o != k.

Position 5: f == f, need c[5] != f. c[5]=c != f.

Position 6: o == o, need c[6] != o. c[6]=c != o.

Position 7: r == r, need c[7] != r. c[7]=d != r.

Position 8: c == c, need c[8] != c. c[8]=e != c.

Position 9: e == e, need c[9] != e. c[9]=d != e.

Position 10: s == s, need c[10] != s. c[10]=r != s.

All positions satisfy the conditions, so 'YES', matching the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=3

a=acc

b=abd

c=abc

Let's check each position:

Position 1: a != a, need c[1] != a and c[1] != a. c[1]=
