Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. There are multiple test cases, up to 1000 of them.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, different positions can have the same values, but they are considered different subsequences if their positions differ.

So, for example, if I have an array [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty subsequence

- [1]

- [2]

- [3]

- [1,2]

- [1,3]

- [2,3]

- [1,2,3]

That's a total of 8 increasing subsequences.

Wait, but according to the problem, the empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so I need to include that as well.

Now, the problem is to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, and the array should have at most 200 elements, and each element should be in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is related to the array's structure.

Let me consider a simple case. If the array is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,...,n], then every subset of the array is an increasing subsequence. The total number of subsets is 2^n, including the empty set.

So, for a strictly increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Wait, but in the example given, [1,2,3] has 8 increasing subsequences, which is 2^3.

So, in general, for a strictly increasing array of length n, there are 2^n increasing subsequences.

But the problem allows for any array, not necessarily strictly increasing, as long as the increasing subsequences count to X.

So, perhaps I can construct an array that is not fully increasing, but still achieves the desired count of increasing subsequences.

I need to think about how to control the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me think about smaller examples.

Take X=2.

If I have an array of length 1, say [a], then the increasing subsequences are the empty subsequence and [a], totaling 2. So, for any single element array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2.

So, for X=2, an array of length 1 suffices.

Similarly, for X=3, can I find an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences?

If I have an array of length 2, say [a,b], where a < b, then the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [a]

- [b]

- [a,b]

That's 4 subsequences, which is 2^2.

Wait, but I need exactly 3. So, perhaps if I make a >= b, then some subsequences may not be increasing.

Wait, if a >= b, then [a,b] is not increasing, so the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [a]

- [b]

Total of 3.

So, for X=3, an array of length 2 with a >= b works.

Wait, but the problem allows elements to be equal, and considers different positions as different subsequences.

Wait, in this case, if a == b, then [a] and [b] are different subsequences, but they have the same values.

So, for X=3, [a,a] would have:

- Empty

- [a] (first position)

- [a] (second position)

That's 3 increasing subsequences, since [a,a] is not increasing because a is not less than a.

Wait, but according to the problem, increasing means strictly increasing, so [a,a] is not considered increasing.

So, for X=3, [a,a] works.

Similarly, for X=4, I need to find an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences.

If I take an array of length 2 with a < b, then I have 4 increasing subsequences: empty, [a], [b], [a,b].

So, that works for X=4.

Wait, but earlier for X=3, I had [a,a], which gives 3 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose I have an array where some elements are in increasing order, and others are not.

I need to find a way to construct the array such that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

I need to think about how to calculate the total number of increasing subsequences in an array.

One way to think about it is to consider each position, and keep track of the number of increasing subsequences ending at that position.

But that might not be helpful here, since I need to find the total number over all possible subsequences.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

I recall that in binary sequences, the number of subsets is 2^n.

Similarly, for strictly increasing sequences, it's also related to subsets.

But here, the array may not be strictly increasing, so I need to find a way to control the count.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representations or something.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can build the array step by step, deciding at each step whether to add a new element that is larger than all previous elements or not.

If I add an element larger than all previous elements, it will increase the number of increasing subsequences in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of increasing subsequences being a sum of powers of 2 or something.

Wait, maybe I should look for a way to represent X in binary and map that to the array structure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X to determine the array's structure.

Let me think about this.

Suppose X is given, and I want to represent it in binary.

Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2.

Maybe I can construct the array such that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of certain powers of 2, depending on the bits set in X.

But I need to make sure that the total is exactly X.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think recursively.

Suppose I have an array of length n, and I want to add another element.

Depending on where I place the new element, the number of increasing subsequences changes.

If I add an element smaller than all previous elements, it can only form its own single-element subsequence and possibly some others.

If I add an element larger than all previous elements, it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let dp[i] be the number of increasing subsequences in the first i elements of the array.

Then, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element).

But this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion isn't the right approach.

Let me consider the following:

If I have an array that is strictly increasing, then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

If I have an array that is not strictly increasing, then some subsequences are not increasing, so the total number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^n.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [a,a] had 3 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, [a,b] with a < b has 4.

[a,b,c] with a < b < c has 8.

So, it seems that for a strictly increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

For arrays that are not strictly increasing, it's less than 2^n.

But how much less depends on which elements are not increasing.

I need a way to control this count to make it exactly X.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by choosing elements such that the number of increasing subsequences is multiplied or added in a way that allows me to reach X.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary decisions.

Each element in the array can either be included in a subsequence or not, but with constraints based on the ordering.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a binary tree or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, where each power corresponds to including or excluding certain elements.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I build the array step by step, and at each step, I decide whether to make the new element larger than all previous elements or not.

If I make it larger than all previous elements, then it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, effectively doubling the number of increasing subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element).

Wait, but actually, if I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, then for each existing increasing subsequence, I can choose to include it at the end or not.

So, the number of increasing subsequences becomes twice the previous number.

Wait, but also, I need to consider the empty subsequence.

Wait, let's say I have an array of length n with S increasing subsequences.

If I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, then:

- All existing increasing subsequences remain valid.

- For each existing increasing subsequence, I can append the new element to it, creating a new increasing subsequence.

- Also, the new element itself is an increasing subsequence.

Wait, but actually, the new element can be added to any existing increasing subsequence, including the empty one.

So, the total number of increasing subsequences becomes 2*S.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for [1,2], S=4, and adding 3 makes it [1,2,3], with S=8, which is 2*4.

Similarly, starting with an empty array, S=1 (just the empty subsequence), adding an element makes S=2, then adding another larger element makes S=4, and so on.

So, in general, adding a new element larger than all previous elements doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Now, if I add an element that is not larger than all previous elements, say it's equal to some previous element or smaller, then it cannot be appended to all existing increasing subsequences.

In that case, it can only be included in subsequences where it's not violating the increasing order.

This seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representations.

If I can double the number of increasing subsequences by adding a larger element, and add fewer by adding a smaller or equal element, perhaps I can use this to build up to X.

Wait, let's consider X in binary.

Suppose X is 5, which is 101 in binary.

Does that mean I can construct an array by choosing elements in a way that corresponds to the binary digits?

Wait, perhaps not directly, but maybe I can use the binary representation to decide when to add a larger element and when to add a smaller one.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, and decide whether to double the number of increasing subsequences or add a certain amount based on the bit.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of a binary tree, where each level corresponds to adding a new element, and the branches correspond to including or excluding the new element.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote S as the number of increasing subsequences.

Initially, with an empty array, S=1.

Adding a new element, say 0, makes S=2 (empty and [0]).

Now, if I add another element that is larger than 0, say 1, then S=4 (empty, [0], [1], [0,1]).

If I add another element that is larger than 1, say 2, then S=8 (empty, [0], [1], [2], [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [0,1,2]).

So, each time I add a larger element, S doubles.

Now, if instead, after [0,1], I add an element that is not larger than 1, say 0 again, what happens?

The array becomes [0,1,0].

The increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first 0)

- [1]

- [0] (second 0)

- [0,1]

- [0,0] (not increasing)

- [1,0] (not increasing)

So, only the first four are increasing: empty, [0], [1], [0].

So, S=4.

Wait, but earlier with [0,1], S=4, and adding another 0 didn't change S.

Wait, but [0,0] and [1,0] are not increasing, so they are not counted.

So, S remains 4.

Wait, but according to the problem, [0,0] is considered a subsequence, but it's not increasing, so it's not counted.

Hence, S=4.

Now, if I add another element that is equal to the previous one, it seems S doesn't change.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for X=5, the output is [0,1,0], which has S=4, but X=5.

That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the array [0,1,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first 0)

- [1]

- [0] (second 0)

- [0,1]

That's 5 subsequences.

Wait, but [0,0] and [1,0] are not increasing, so they are not counted.

So, S=5.

Ah, I see. I missed [0,1] in my earlier count.

So, S=5.

That makes sense.

So, by adding a element that is not larger than the previous elements, I can control the increase in S.

So, perhaps I can think of it as:

- Adding a larger element: S doubles.

- Adding an element that is not larger: S remains the same, but I can choose to add specific subsequences.

Wait, but in the case above, adding a 0 after [0,1] increased S by 1, from 4 to 5.

How did that happen?

Wait, let's see:

Original S with [0,1]: 4 (empty, [0], [1], [0,1])

After adding 0, the new increasing subsequences are:

- All previous ones: empty, [0], [1], [0,1]

- New ones: [0] (second 0)

So, S=5.

Wait, but why didn't [0,0] and [1,0] count? Because they are not strictly increasing.

Hence, only the new [0] is added.

So, in general, adding an element y after a sequence with existing elements:

- If y is larger than all previous elements, S doubles.

- If y is not larger than some previous elements, S increases by the number of increasing subsequences where y can be appended.

Wait, more precisely, when adding y:

- If y is larger than all previous elements, it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling S.

- If y is not larger than some previous elements, it can only be appended to those subsequences where the last element is less than y.

So, in the case of [0,1,0], when adding 0, it can only be appended to the empty subsequence and to [0], but [0,0] is not increasing, so only [0] is added.

Wait, but [0] is already present, so S increases by 1 (the new [0]).

Hence, S=5.

Now, if I want to build X=5, I can:

- Start with an empty array, S=1.

- Add 0, S=2.

- Add 1, S=4.

- Add 0, S=5.

That achieves X=5.

Similarly, for X=13, as in the example, [2,2,3,4,2]:

- Start with empty, S=1.

- Add 2, S=2.

- Add 2, S=3.

- Add 3, S=6.

- Add 4, S=12.

- Add 2, S=13.

So, it's adding elements in a way that controls S to reach 13.

So, perhaps I can think of it as:

- Adding a larger element: S doubles.

- Adding an element not larger: S increases by some amount based on previous elements.

But I need a systematic way to reach any X.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of binary representation again.

Suppose X is represented in binary as b_k b_{k-1} ... b_0, where b_k is the highest bit.

Then, I can build the array by deciding to double S or add 1 at each step, corresponding to the bits.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array from the highest bit to the lowest bit, and decide whether to add a larger element (double S) or add a small element (add 1).

Wait, let's try with X=5 (101 in binary).

- Start with S=1.

- Add a larger element, S=2 (corresponding to the highest bit 1).

- Add a larger element, S=4.

- Add a small element, S=5.

That matches the earlier construction.

Similarly, for X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add a larger element, S=2.

- Add a larger element, S=4.

- Add a larger element, S=8.

- Add a small element, S=9.

- Add a small element, S=10.

- Add a larger element, S=20.

- But this doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can build the array by choosing to add elements in a way that S increases by powers of 2 or by 1.

Wait, perhaps I can think of S as being built by adding elements that are larger than all previous ones (doubling S) or adding elements that are equal to some previous elements (adding 1).

Wait, but in the [0,1,0] case, adding the second 0 increased S by 1.

Similarly, in [2,2,3,4,2], adding the second 2 increased S by 1.

So, perhaps adding an element that is equal to the previous one adds 1 to S.

Wait, but in [0,1,0], adding 0 added 1 to S, but in [2,2,3,4,2], adding 2 also added 1 to S.

So, perhaps adding an element y that is equal to the previous element adds 1 to S.

But in [0,1,0], 0 is not equal to 1, but it's equal to the first 0.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps adding an element y that is equal to any previous element adds 1 to S.

But in [0,1,0], adding 0 would add 1 to S.

Similarly, in [2,2,3,4,2], adding 2 adds 1 to S.

So, perhaps adding an element y that is equal to some previous element adds 1 to S, specifically the subsequence consisting of the new y alone.

While adding a larger element doubles S.

Wait, but in [0,1,0], adding 0 adds only [0] (the new one), so S increases by 1.

Similarly, in [2,2,3,4,2], adding 2 adds [2] (the new one), so S increases by 1.

So, perhaps in general, adding an element y that is equal to some previous element adds only the new y as a subsequence, hence S increases by 1.

While adding a larger element doubles S.

If that's the case, then I can think of building S by choosing to either double S (by adding a larger element) or add 1 (by adding an element equal to some previous one).

So, to reach X, I can find a sequence of operations: double or add 1, starting from S=1, to reach S=X.

This sounds similar to building X in binary, where each bit represents whether to double or add 1.

Wait, actually, it's similar to the binary representation of X.

Let me think about this.

Suppose X is 5, which is 101 in binary.

Starting from S=1:

- The highest bit is 1 (2^2), so I double S to 2.

- The next bit is 0, so I add 1 to S, making it 3.

- The lowest bit is 1, so I add 1 to S, making it 4.

Wait, but 101 in binary is 5, but in this process, I got 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to interpret the bits differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of building S by choosing to double or add 1 in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a binary tree, where each bit decides whether to double or add 1.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the binary representation, but with a specific order.

Wait, maybe I should look at X in binary and decide the sequence of operations based on the bits.

Let me try with X=5 (101 in binary).

Starting with S=1.

- Look at the highest bit: 1 (2^2). Perform double operation: S=2.

- Next bit: 0 (2^1). Since it's 0, don't perform any operation, or perhaps perform add 1 operation but skip it.

- Next bit: 1 (2^0). Perform add 1 operation: S=3.

Wait, but 2 + 1 = 3, which is not 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should start from S=1 and build up to X by choosing to double or add 1 at each step.

This resembles the binary representation, where each bit represents whether to double or add 1.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the binary representation, but with the operations corresponding to the bits.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building X in binary, where each '1' bit represents an add 1 operation after doubling.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each time I add a larger element, S doubles, and each time I add an equal element, S increases by 1.

Wait, but in reality, adding an equal element increases S by 1, as it only adds the new element as a subsequence.

So, perhaps I can build S by choosing to double or add 1 at each step.

Given that, I can represent X in binary, and for each bit, decide whether to double or add 1.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the binary representation, where each bit indicates whether to add a power of 2 or not.

But I need to relate it to doubling S or adding 1.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building X in binary, and for each bit, if it's set, I perform an add 1 operation after doubling.

Wait, maybe I should look at the binary representation of X and determine the sequence of operations.

Let me try with X=5 (101 in binary).

Starting with S=1.

- The highest bit is 1 (2^2). So, I perform double operation: S=2.

- The next bit is 0 (2^1). Since it's 0, I don't add 1, so S remains 2.

- The next bit is 1 (2^0). So, I add 1 to S: S=3.

But 3 is not equal to 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should interpret the bits differently.

Wait, perhaps I should start from S=1 and for each bit in X, if the bit is set, I add 1 after doubling.

Wait, let's try again.

For X=5 (101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Look at the highest bit (2^2=4). Since it's set, I double S to 2, then add 1 to make S=3.

Wait, but 4 corresponds to doubling twice.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the exponents of 2.

Wait, maybe I should think of X as a sum of powers of 2, where each power corresponds to a sequence of double operations, followed by an add 1 operation if the bit is set.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence of operations: double or add 1.

Each double operation corresponds to adding a larger element to the array, which doubles S.

Each add 1 operation corresponds to adding an element equal to some previous element, which adds 1 to S.

So, I need to find a sequence of these operations that starts from S=1 and reaches S=X.

This is similar to the binary representation of X, where each bit indicates whether to add 1 after doubling.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine the sequence of operations.

Let me consider X=5 (101 in binary).

So, 5 in binary is 101, which is 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0.

So, I can think of it as:

- Start with S=1.

- Perform double operation: S=2.

- Since the second bit from the right is 0, don't add 1.

- Perform double operation again: S=4.

- Since the rightmost bit is 1, add 1: S=5.

So, sequence of operations: double, double, add 1.

Corresponding to the binary representation.

Similarly, for X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Double: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

- Double: S=10.

- Add 1: S=11.

- Double: S=22.

- But this doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should read the binary representation from left to right.

For X=5 (101):

- Start with S=1.

- Highest bit is 1 (2^2): double and add 1: S=3.

- Next bit is 0 (2^1): double: S=6.

- Next bit is 1 (2^0): add 1: S=7.

But 7 is not 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to interpret the bits differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the binary representation in reverse.

Wait, maybe I need to think recursively.

Let me think about how S changes with each operation.

- Double: S -> 2*S

- Add 1: S -> S + 1

So, to reach X, I can find a sequence of double and add 1 operations that transform S from 1 to X.

This is similar to finding the steps to build X using these operations.

This resembles the way numbers are built in binary, where each bit represents whether to double or add 1.

Wait, actually, this is similar to the binary representation, where each bit indicates whether to add 1 before doubling.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building X in binary, where each '1' bit means add 1, and each '0' bit means just double.

Wait, let's try that.

For X=5 (101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

That works.

Similarly, for X=13 (1101 in binary):

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Add 1: S=3.

- Double: S=6.

- Double: S=12.

- Add 1: S=13.

Yes, that works.

So, in general, I can represent X in binary, and for each bit from the most significant to the least significant:

- If the bit is 1, perform add 1 operation.

- Then, always perform a double operation, except for the last bit.

Wait, in the above examples, it seems to work.

Wait, for X=5 (101):

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

For X=13 (1101):

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Add 1: S=3.

- Double: S=6.

- Double: S=12.

- Add 1: S=13.

So, it seems that for each '1' in the binary representation, I perform an add 1 operation, and between them, I perform double operations.

Wait, but in the second example, after the second add 1, I double twice before adding 1 again.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as building X in binary, and for each bit, if it's 1, add 1, then always double, except after the last bit.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it in terms of the binary representation, and process the bits from least significant to most significant.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the binary representation and the operations required to build X.

Wait, maybe I should look at the binary representation and determine the sequence of operations accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me represent X in binary: X = x_k x_{k-1} ... x_0, where x_k is the highest bit.

Start with S=1.

For each bit from the highest to the lowest:

- If the bit is 1, perform add 1 operation: S = S + 1.

- Then, perform a double operation: S = 2*S.

Except for the last bit, where I don't double after.

Wait, let's try with X=5 (101):

- Start with S=1.

- Highest bit is 1: S = S + 1 = 2.

- Double: S = 4.

- Next bit is 0: skip add 1.

- Double: S = 8.

- Next bit is 1: S = S + 1 = 9.

- Don't double after the last bit.

But 9 is not 5, so this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I should process the bits from least significant to most significant.

Let me try that.

For X=5 (101):

- Start with S=1.

- Least significant bit is 1: add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Next bit is 0: add 1 if bit is 1, but it's 0, so skip.

- Double: S=8.

- Next bit is 1: add 1: S=9.

Again, not 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to only double when the next bit is present.

Wait, perhaps I should only double after adding 1 if there are more bits to process.

Let me try with X=5 (101):

- Start with S=1.

- Least significant bit is 1: add 1: S=2.

- Since there are more bits, double: S=4.

- Next bit is 0: add 1 if it's 1, else skip: skip.

- Since there are more bits, double: S=8.

- Next bit is 1: add 1: S=9.

Still not 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to only double when the current bit is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each time I add a larger element, I double S, and each time I add an equal element, I add 1 to S.

So, to reach X, I need to choose a sequence of operations: double or add 1, to go from S=1 to S=X.

This is similar to the binary representation, but with a specific sequence of operations.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine the sequence of operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building X in binary, where each '1' corresponds to an add 1 operation, and each '0' corresponds to a double operation, but with some adjustments.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the binary representation and build the sequence accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can look at the binary representation and for each bit, decide whether to double or add 1.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine the number of times I need to double or add 1.

Wait, maybe I need to think of it in terms of exponents.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and each power corresponds to a sequence of double operations followed by an add 1 operation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the binary representation, where each '1' bit represents an add 1 operation after a certain number of double operations.

Wait, maybe I should look at the binary representation and for each set bit, perform add 1 after the corresponding number of double operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have X, and I want to build it using double and add 1 operations.

If X is even, then the last operation must have been a double, because double operation multiplies S by 2.

If X is odd, then the last operation must have been an add 1, because add 1 operation adds 1 to S.

So, I can work backwards.

Start from X, and try to reach S=1 by reversing the operations.

- If X is even, the last operation was a double, so divide X by 2.

- If X is odd, the last operation was an add 1, so subtract 1 from X.

Repeat until X becomes 1.

Then, the sequence of operations is the reverse of the steps I took.

This way, I can determine the sequence of operations needed to build S from 1 to X.

Let's try with X=5.

- X=5 is odd: subtract 1 -> X=4

- X=4 is even: divide by 2 -> X=2

- X=2 is even: divide by 2 -> X=1

So, the sequence of operations in reverse is: subtract 1, then divide by 2, then divide by 2.

Therefore, the actual sequence of operations is: double, double, add 1.

Which matches what I did earlier.

So, to reach X=5, the sequence is double, double, add 1.

Similarly, for X=13:

- X=13 is odd: subtract 1 -> X=12

- X=12 is even: divide by 2 -> X=6

- X=6 is even: divide by 2 -> X=3

- X=3 is odd: subtract 1 -> X=2

- X=2 is even: divide by 2 -> X=1

So, the sequence in reverse is: subtract 1, divide by 2, divide by 2, subtract 1, divide by 2.

Therefore, the actual sequence is: double, subtract 1, double, double, add 1.

Wait, but this seems inconsistent with the earlier example.

Wait, perhaps I need to map these operations to adding larger or equal elements.

Wait, perhaps adding a larger element corresponds to doubling, and adding an equal element corresponds to adding 1.

So, in the sequence:

- Double: add a larger element.

- Double: add another larger element.

- Add 1: add an equal element.

So, for X=5, the sequence is: add larger, add larger, add equal.

Which corresponds to the array [a, b, a], where a < b.

But in the example, it's [0,1,0], which matches this.

So, a=0, b=1.

Hence, [0,1,0] corresponds to double, double, add 1.

Similarly, for X=13, the sequence is double, subtract 1, double, double, add 1.

Wait, but subtract 1 corresponds to adding an equal element.

Wait, perhaps I need to map add 1 to adding an equal element, and double to adding a larger element.

So, in the sequence for X=13, it's double, double, double, add 1, add 1.

Wait, but according to the reverse operations, it's subtract 1, divide by 2, subtract 1, divide by 2, divide by 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to build the sequence for X=13.

From the earlier steps:

- X=13 is odd: last operation is add 1.

- X=12 is even: last operation is double.

- X=6 is even: last operation is double.

- X=3 is odd: last operation is add 1.

- X=2 is even: last operation is double.

- X=1 is the starting point.

So, the sequence is: double, double, add 1, double, add 1.

Wait, but according to this, to reach X=13, the operations are:

Start with S=1.

- Double: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

- Double: S=10.

- Add 1: S=11.

But 11 is not 13.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence.

Wait, perhaps the sequence should be:

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

- Double: S=10.

- Add 1: S=11.

- Double: S=22.

- Subtract 1: S=21.

- Subtract 1: S=20.

- Subtract 1: S=19.

- Subtract 1: S=18.

- Subtract 1: S=17.

- Subtract 1: S=16.

- Subtract 1: S=15.

- Subtract 1: S=14.

- Subtract 1: S=13.

But this is inefficient and doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a better way to map the operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that adding an equal element adds only 1 to S, while adding a larger element doubles S.

So, perhaps I need to prioritize adding larger elements to maximize S, and add equal elements only when necessary.

Wait, perhaps I can think of building the array by starting with a strictly increasing sequence to get S=2^n, and then adjust by adding equal elements to fine-tune S to reach X.

Wait, for example, for X=13, which is between 8 and 16, I can start with 3 larger elements to get S=8, then add equal elements to increase S by 1 each time until I reach 13.

So, add 3 larger elements: S=8.

Then add 5 equal elements: S=8+5=13.

But in reality, in the example, they added 5 elements to reach S=13.

Wait, but in practice, adding equal elements only adds 1 each time, as shown in [2,2,3,4,2]:

- Start with S=1.

- Add 2: S=2.

- Add 2: S=3.

- Add 3: S=6.

- Add 4: S=12.

- Add 2: S=13.

So, it's not exactly matching my earlier assumption.

Wait, in this sequence:

- Start with S=1.

- Add 2 (larger): S=2.

- Add 2 (equal): S=3.

- Add 3 (larger): S=6.

- Add 4 (larger): S=12.

- Add 2 (equal): S=13.

So, it's a combination of adding larger and equal elements.

So, perhaps I can build the array by first adding larger elements to get S=2^k, then adding equal elements to increment S by 1 each time.

But in the above example, they added a larger element after adding an equal element.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to combine adding larger and equal elements to reach exactly X.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the binary representation of X.

Each time I add a larger element, S doubles.

Each time I add an equal element, S increases by 1.

So, to reach X, I can decompose X into a sum of powers of 2 and 1's.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of distinct powers of 2 and 1's, depending on the operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the binary representation, where each '1' bit corresponds to an add 1 operation after a certain number of double operations.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the binary representation of X and determine the sequence of operations accordingly.

Let me try with X=13 (1101 in binary).

- The binary representation is 1101, which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

So, I need to perform operations that correspond to these powers.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as adding a larger element for each '1' bit, and adding equal elements in between.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the positions of '1's in the binary representation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine when to add larger or equal elements.

Wait, maybe I should look at the exponents where the bits are set.

For X=13, which is 1101 in binary, which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0.

So, I need to perform operations that correspond to these exponents.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by adding larger elements to achieve the powers of 2, and add equal elements to adjust for the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can start with the largest power of 2 less than or equal to X, and subtract it, then repeat with the remainder.

But this seems similar to the binary representation.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by starting with the smallest possible elements and adding larger ones as needed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine the positions where I add larger elements or equal elements.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have an array where I can choose to add larger or equal elements.

Each time I add a larger element, S doubles.

Each time I add an equal element, S increases by 1.

So, to reach X, I need to find a sequence of these operations that starts from S=1 and reaches S=X.

This is similar to building X using the operations double and add 1.

This is similar to the binary representation, where each bit represents whether to add 1 or double.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the sequence of operations based on the binary representation of X.

Let me consider X=5, which is 101 in binary.

- The binary representation is 101.

- Starting from the least significant bit:

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

Which matches.

Similarly, for X=13 (1101):

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.

- Double: S=10.

- Add 1: S=11.

- Double: S=22.

- But this doesn't reach 13.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I need to process the bits from most significant to least significant.

For X=13 (1101):

- Start with S=1.

- Add 1: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add 1: S=5.
