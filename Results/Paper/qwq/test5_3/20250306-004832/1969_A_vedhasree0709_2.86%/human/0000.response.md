Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. For a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and all p_i are distinct, this means that the best friendships are pairwise unique. In other words, if friend A's best friend is B, then friend B's best friend is A, and so on.

Wait, actually, the problem says that all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, it's like a permutation where no element is in its own position, and each p_i maps uniquely to another friend.

But, in the example given:

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 2's is 1, friend 3's is 2, friend 4's is 5, and friend 5's is 4.

In this case, if Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5, both will come because their best friends (5 and 4 respectively) are also invited. So, with just 2 invitations, he gets 2 friends coming to the party.

Another example:

p = [2, 3, 4, 1]

Here, friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's is 3, friend 3's is 4, and friend 4's is 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3, then:

- Friend 1 will come because friend 2 is invited.

- Friend 2 will come because friend 3 is invited.

- Friend 3 will come because friend 4 is invited, but friend 4 isn't invited, so friend 3 won't come.

Wait, according to the problem, friend 3 needs both themselves and their best friend (friend 4) to be invited to come to the party. So, friend 3 won't come because friend 4 isn't invited.

Friend 1 will come because friend 2 is invited, and friend 2 will come because friend 3 is invited, but since friend 3 isn't coming (because friend 4 isn't invited), does that affect friend 2's attendance? Wait, no, friend 2 only needs friend 3 to be invited, which they are, so friend 2 will come. Friend 1 needs friend 2 to be invited, which they are, so friend 1 will come.

So, in this case, friends 1 and 2 will come, but friend 3 won't because friend 4 isn't invited. So, with 3 invitations (1, 2, 3), he gets 2 friends coming to the party.

The problem asks for the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

i = 0

j = 0

while i <= n - 1:

if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:

print(2)

j = 1

break

i += 1

if j == 0:

print(3)

So, this function processes multiple test cases (up to 5000). For each test case:

- Read n (number of friends, 2 ≤ n ≤ 50)

- Read the list l of best friends, where l[i] is the best friend of friend i+1

The program then iterates through the list, checking for a specific condition:

if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:

If this condition is met for any i, it prints 2 and sets j to 1, breaking the loop. If no such i is found, it prints 3.

I need to verify if this program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

Let's analyze the condition being checked:

l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1

Given that l is 1-indexed in the input, but Python lists are 0-indexed, so l[i] corresponds to the best friend of friend i+1.

So, l[i] == i + 2 means that the best friend of friend i+1 is friend i + 2.

And l[i + 1] == i + 1 means that the best friend of friend i + 2 is friend i + 1.

In other words, friends i+1 and i+2 are best friends of each other.

So, the program is checking for consecutive pairs of friends who are best friends with each other.

If such a pair is found, it prints 2, meaning that by inviting these two friends, both will come to the party.

If no such pair is found, it prints 3.

Is this logic correct?

Let's consider the first example:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

So, l = [3,1,2,5,4]

Let's see if there's any i where l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:

For i = 0:

l[0] = 3 == 2? No (since i + 2 = 2)

l[1] = 1 == 1? Yes

But since l[0] != 2, this doesn't satisfy.

For i = 1:

l[1] = 1 == 3? No

l[2] = 2 == 2? Yes

So, l[1] == 3? No, l[1] = 1 != 3.

Wait, seems like there's a mistake in this logic.

Wait, the condition is l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1.

In Python, list indices start at 0, but the friends are 1 to n.

So, l[0] is p_1, which is the best friend of friend 1.

Similarly, l[1] is p_2, the best friend of friend 2.

So, for i = 0:

l[0] == 2? (since i + 2 = 2)

l[1] == 1? Yes.

But l[0] = 3 != 2, so condition not met.

For i = 1:

l[1] == 3? (i + 2 = 3)

l[2] == 2? Yes.

l[1] = 1 != 3, so no.

For i = 2:

l[2] == 4? (i + 2 = 4)

l[3] == 3? Yes.

l[2] = 2 != 4, so no.

For i = 3:

l[3] == 5? (i + 2 = 5)

l[4] == 4? Yes.

l[3] = 5 == 5? Yes.

l[4] = 4 == 4? Yes.

So, for i = 3, the condition is met.

Hence, it prints 2.

Which matches the first test case.

Now, second test case:

n = 4

p = [2,3,4,1]

l = [2,3,4,1]

Check for i from 0 to 2:

i = 0:

l[0] == 2? Yes.

l[1] == 1? Yes.

So, condition met, prints 2.

But in the example, it should print 3.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], the answer is 3.

But according to the program, it would print 2 because for i=0, l[0]=2==2 and l[1]=3==1? No, l[1]=3 !=1.

Wait, let's check:

for i=0:

l[0] == 2? Yes.

l[1] ==1? l[1]=3 ==1? No.

So, condition not met.

i=1:

l[1]=3 ==3? Yes.

l[2]=4 ==2? No.

i=2:

l[2]=4 ==4? Yes.

l[3]=1 ==3? No.

So, no i satisfies the condition, so it prints 3.

Which matches the example.

Third test case:

n=2

p=[2,1]

l=[2,1]

i=0:

l[0]=2 ==2? Yes.

l[1]=1==1? Yes.

So, condition met, prints 2.

Which matches the example.

So, in these cases, it seems correct.

But is this logic generalizable?

Let's think about what the program is doing.

It's looking for two consecutive friends, say friend A and friend B, where:

- A's best friend is B.

- B's best friend is A.

In other words, they are each other's best friends.

In such a case, by inviting both A and B, both will come to the party, since each has their best friend invited.

Hence, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

If no such pair exists, the program assumes that 3 invitations are needed.

Is this always the case?

Let's consider a scenario where there are no such consecutive pairs, but there are pairs that are best friends but not consecutive in the list.

For example:

n=4

p=[3,4,1,2]

So, l=[3,4,1,2]

Check for i=0:

l[0]=3==2? No.

l[1]=4==1? No.

i=1:

l[1]=4==3? No.

l[2]=1==2? No.

i=2:

l[2]=1==4? No.

l[3]=2==3? No.

So, no such i where l[i]==i+2 and l[i+1]==i+1.

Hence, the program would print 3.

Is that correct?

Let's see:

If Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3.

- Friend 1 needs friend 3 to be invited, which they are, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2 needs friend 4 to be invited, who isn't, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 needs friend 1 to be invited, which they are, so friend 3 comes.

- Friend 4 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

So, with invitations to 1, 3, friend 1 and 3 come. That's 2 friends coming.

Alternatively, Monocarp could invite friends 2, 3, and 4.

- Friend 2 needs friend 4 to be invited, which they are, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 needs friend 1 to be invited, who aren't, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- Friend 4 needs friend 2 to be invited, which they are, so friend 4 comes.

So, friends 2 and 4 come.

Similarly, inviting 1, 2, 3 would make friends 1 and 3 come.

So, in this case, 3 invitations are needed to get at least 2 friends to come.

Is there a way to do it with fewer than 3 invitations?

Let's try inviting only 2 friends.

Say, invite friends 1 and 3.

- Friend 1 needs friend 3 to be invited, which they are, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 3 needs friend 1 to be invited, which they are, so friend 3 comes.

- Friends 2 and 4 aren't invited, so don't come.

So, with only 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

But according to the program, it would print 3.

But in this case, 2 invitations suffice.

So, the program is incorrect in this scenario.

Wait, but in this scenario, p=[3,4,1,2], which is a permutation where:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3.

- Friend 2's best friend is 4.

- Friend 3's best friend is 1.

- Friend 4's best friend is 2.

So, it's two cycles: 1 <-> 3 and 2 <-> 4.

In this case, inviting any two friends from the same pair (like 1 and 3 or 2 and 4) would make both come.

But the program doesn't account for this because the pairs aren't consecutive in the list.

In the list, p=[3,4,1,2], so:

- l[0]=3 (friend 1's best friend is 3)

- l[1]=4 (friend 2's best friend is 4)

- l[2]=1 (friend 3's best friend is 1)

- l[3]=2 (friend 4's best friend is 2)

So, for i=0:

l[0]=3 ==2? No.

l[1]=4==1? No.

i=1:

l[1]=4==3? No.

l[2]=1==2? No.

i=2:

l[2]=1==4? No.

l[3]=2==3? No.

Hence, no i satisfies the condition, so the program prints 3.

But in reality, inviting just 2 friends from the same pair (like 1 and 3) would suffice.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Another example:

n=4

p=[4,3,2,1]

l=[4,3,2,1]

Check for i=0:

l[0]=4==2? No.

l[1]=3==1? No.

i=1:

l[1]=3==3? Yes.

l[2]=2==2? Yes.

So, condition met, prints 2.

In this case, inviting friends 2 and 3 would make both come, since:

- Friend 2's best friend is 3, who is invited.

- Friend 3's best friend is 2, who is invited.

So, with 2 invitations, 2 friends come.

Hence, the program is correct in this case.

But in the earlier case where p=[3,4,1,2], the program fails.

So, the issue is that the program only checks for consecutive pairs in the list, but there might be non-consecutive pairs that are best friends.

To fix this, the program needs to check for any pair of friends who are each other's best friends, not just consecutive ones in the list.

In other words, for any two friends A and B, if A's best friend is B and B's best friend is A, then inviting both A and B would make both come, achieving the goal with 2 invitations.

If no such pair exists, then Monocarp might need to invite more friends.

In the earlier counterexample, p=[3,4,1,2], there are two such pairs: 1 and 3, and 2 and 4.

But since the program only checks for consecutive pairs, it misses these non-consecutive pairs.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
