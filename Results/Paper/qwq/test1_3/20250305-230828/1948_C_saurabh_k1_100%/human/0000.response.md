Alright, I have this problem to solve. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns, and each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1) and needs to reach cell (2,n). Every second, two things happen: the robot moves in one direction (left, right, down, or up), and then it moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. The robot has a choice of moving left, right, down, or up initially, but it can't move outside the grid, and it can't skip the move. After that, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

Given that the grid has only two rows, moving up from row 1 would take the robot to row 2, and moving down from row 2 would take it to row 1. Moving left decreases the column number, and moving right increases it.

The goal is to determine if there's a sequence of moves that can take the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Looking at the provided program, it seems to iterate through each test case, read n, and then read the strings representing the arrows in each row.

The program then loops through the columns from 1 to n-1 in steps of 2 (i.e., odd indices, considering columns are 0-indexed). For each of these columns, it checks two conditions:

1. If i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'

2. Or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'

If either of these conditions is true for any i, it prints 'No' and breaks the loop. Otherwise, after checking all such i, it prints 'yes'.

I need to verify if this logic correctly determines whether the robot can reach cell (2,n).

First, let's consider what these conditions are checking.

Condition 1: a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'

- a[i] is the arrow in row 1, column i + 1 (since strings are 0-indexed).

- b[i + 1] is the arrow in row 2, column i + 2.

- So, this condition checks if the arrow in row 1, column i + 1 points left, and the arrow in row 2, column i + 2 points left.

Condition 2: a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'

- b[i - 1] is the arrow in row 2, column i.

- So, this checks if the arrow in row 1, column i + 1 points left, and the arrow in row 2, column i points left.

I'm not entirely sure why these specific conditions are being checked. It seems like the program is looking for some pattern in the arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching (2,n), but I need to understand the reasoning behind these checks.

Let me think about how the robot can move through the grid.

The robot starts at (1,1). It can choose to move right, down, or possibly left (though starting at column 1, moving left would be invalid).

Wait, but the problem says no arrow points outside the grid, so arrows in the first column won't point left, and arrows in the last column won't point right.

But in this problem, it's stated that no arrow points outside the grid, so I don't need to worry about invalid moves due to arrows.

The robot's movement each second consists of two parts: a chosen move (left, right, down, up), followed by moving according to the arrow in the current cell.

Given that, the robot's path can be quite complex, as it can change rows and columns in various ways.

I need to find a way to simplify this movement to determine reachability.

One approach could be to model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges represent possible moves the robot can make.

However, given the constraints (n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4), a graph approach might be too slow if not optimized properly.

I need a smarter way to determine reachability.

Let me consider the properties of the movement.

Each second, the robot chooses a direction to move, then follows the arrow in the cell it ends up in after that move.

Given that, the robot has some control over its movement, but it's also constrained by the arrows.

I need to find a sequence of choices that leads from (1,1) to (2,n).

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check every second column (i from 1 to n-1 in steps of 2), which corresponds to columns 2, 4, 6, etc., assuming 1-based indexing.

Wait, but in the code, the loop is from 1 to n-1 in steps of 2, and i is the index in the strings, which are 0-indexed.

So, for n=4, columns are 0,1,2,3.

The loop iterates over i=1 and i=3.

For i=1, it checks a[1] and b[2] (column 3), and a[1] and b[0] (column 1).

Similarly for i=3, but for n=4, i=3 is the last column.

But the condition checks if a[i] and b[i+1] are '<', or a[i] and b[i-1] are '<'.

I need to understand why these specific checks are being performed.

Maybe the author is looking for configurations where the robot cannot cross from one row to another or progress to higher columns.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=4

a = ">><<"

b = ">>><"

According to the program, it would iterate over i=1 and i=3.

For i=1:

a[1] = '<', b[2] = '<', so both are '<', which matches the first condition. So, it should print 'No'. But according to the example, it should print 'Yes'.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, no, in the code, it's checking if a[i] == b[i+1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'.

For i=1:

a[1] = '<', b[2] = '<', so first condition is true, so it should print 'No'.

But according to the example, it should print 'Yes'. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the loop.

Looking back, the loop is:

for i in range(1, n, 2):

if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':

print('No')

break

else:

print('yes')

In the first test case, n=4, a=">><<", b=">>><"

For i=1:

a[1] = '<', b[2] = '<', so a[i] == b[i+1] == '<', so it should print 'No'.

But according to the example, it should print 'Yes'. So, the program seems incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the program.

Alternatively, maybe I need to understand the logic behind these conditions.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I model the grid as a graph where each cell is a node, and I add edges based on possible moves the robot can make.

But given the time constraints, this might not be efficient.

Is there a pattern or invariant that can help determine reachability without simulating the entire process?

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows by choosing to move down or up, and it can move left or right, but it must follow the arrow after its chosen move.

I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that allows the robot to go from (1,1) to (2,n).

Perhaps I can think in terms of possible paths and see if there are any obstacles that would prevent such a path.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=4

a = ">><<"

b = ">>><"

Let's map out the arrows:

Row 1: > < <

Column 1: > (from a[0])

Column 2: < (from a[1])

Column 3: < (from a[2])

Column 4: < (from a[3])

Row 2: > > <

Column 1: > (from b[0])

Column 2: > (from b[1])

Column 3: < (from b[2])

Column 4: < (from b[3])

Wait, no, the strings represent the directions of the arrows in each cell.

So, a[i] is the arrow in cell (1, i+1), and b[i] is the arrow in cell (2, i+1).

Given that, in row 1:

Column 1: >

Column 2: <

Column 3: <

Column 4: <

In row 2:

Column 1: >

Column 2: >

Column 3: <

Column 4: <

Now, according to the example, one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Let's simulate this:

Start at (1,1):

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

Wait, that's not what happens.

Wait, according to the problem, first the robot chooses a move, then it moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, starting at (1,1):

- Choose to move right to (1,2).

- Then, follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

So, it ends up back at (1,1).

Not helpful.

Alternative approach:

- Choose to move down to (2,1).

- Then, follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so move right to (2,2).

- Choose to move up to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so move left to (1,1).

Not helpful.

Another approach:

- Choose to move right to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', move left to (1,1).

- Choose to move down to (2,1).

- Follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', move right to (2,2).

- Choose to move up to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', move left to (1,1).

Stuck in a loop.

Wait, but the example says there is a path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Maybe I misinterpreted the sequence.

Let's try:

- Start at (1,1).

- Choose to move right to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', move left to (1,1).

Not helpful.

Alternative:

- Start at (1,1).

- Choose to move down to (2,1).

- Follow the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', move right to (2,2).

- Choose to move up to (1,2).

- Follow the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', move left to (1,1).

Still stuck.

Wait, perhaps there's another way.

Looking back at the example's claimed path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

Let's see:

- From (1,1), choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1). Not helpful.

- Alternatively, from (1,1), choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2).

- From (2,2), choose up to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1). Back to start.

- From (2,2), choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2). Stuck.

- From (2,2), choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1). Back to start.

Seems like a dead end.

But according to the example, it's possible. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps choosing different initial moves.

Let's try:

- Start at (1,1).

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1).

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2).

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2).

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1).

Still stuck.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps choosing to move left at some point.

But column 1 has no left, and in row 1, column 1 points right.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the robot can choose to move left even if the arrow points right, but then it must follow the arrow after moving.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to model this as a state machine, where states are (row, column), and transitions are based on the robot's choices and the arrows.

But that might be too time-consuming for the time constraints.

Is there a better way to model this?

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move in any direction (left, right, up, down), but it must follow the arrow after that move.

So, effectively, from each cell, there are up to four possible moves, depending on the direction chosen and the arrow in the cell after the initial move.

Wait, but the initial move is chosen by the robot, and then it must move according to the arrow in the cell it ends up in after that move.

So, it's a two-step process: chosen move + arrow move.

I need to model this combined movement.

Let me try to define the possible combined movements from each cell.

For example, from cell (r,c):

- If the robot chooses to move left:

- It moves to (r, c-1), then follows the arrow in (r, c-1).

- Similarly for right, up, down.

So, the combined movement is: chosen move + arrow move.

Wait, but the arrow move is determined by the arrow in the cell after the chosen move.

This seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe I can precompute for each cell and each possible chosen move where the robot ends up after the two steps.

Given that, I can build a graph where edges represent the possible two-step movements from each cell.

Then, I can check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

Given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient way to do this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find some invariant or property that allows reachability.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check for specific patterns in the arrows that block the path.

Specifically, it checks for columns where certain arrows point left in a way that might trap the robot.

But as seen in the first test case, it incorrectly reports 'No' when the example shows it should be 'Yes'.

Therefore, the program seems flawed.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that since n is even, and the grid has only two rows, perhaps there's a pattern based on parity or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to reach (2,n) unless there are cycles or blocked paths that trap the robot.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows by choosing to move down or up, and it can move left or right, but it must follow the arrow after its chosen move.

Given that, perhaps the robot can always reach (2,n) unless there are specific configurations that prevent it.

But this doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can move freely within the grid, except for certain arrow configurations that create loops or dead ends.

But again, this is too broad.

Let me consider that since the grid is only two rows, I can model the movement in terms of row transitions.

Let me try to think in terms of possible paths.

The robot starts at (1,1). To reach (2,n), it needs to switch rows and move to the last column.

It can switch rows by choosing to move down or up, but it must follow the arrow after that move.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering the row switches.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move right to progress columns, and use up/down moves to switch rows.

But the arrows can force it to move in certain directions, which might hinder progress.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column transitions, considering the row switches.

Given that, perhaps I can keep track of the possible columns in each row that the robot can reach.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider dynamic programming approach.

Define dp[r][c] as whether the robot can reach cell (r,c).

Initialize dp[1][1] = True.

Then, for each cell, based on the possible moves the robot can make, update the dp for the cells it can reach.

But given the constraints on n and t, a straightforward DP approach would be too slow, as it could be O(t*n^2).

I need a more efficient way.

Perhaps I can find that the robot can always reach (2,n) unless there are specific patterns that block the path.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check for certain arrow configurations that might block the path.

Specifically, it checks for columns where the arrow in row 1 points left and the arrow in row 2 for the next column points left, or similar.

But as seen in the first test case, this logic fails.

Therefore, I need to find a better way to determine reachability.

Let me consider that the robot can move freely across the grid, except for certain arrow configurations that create loops or dead ends.

In that case, perhaps I can check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n) by ensuring that there are no such blocking configurations.

But I need to define what these blocking configurations are.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where edges represent possible two-step moves (chosen move + arrow move), and then check for connectivity from (1,1) to (2,n).

But building such a graph for large n would be inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find that the robot can always reach (2,n) unless there are specific patterns that trap it in a cycle or prevent progress.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the robot can make progress to higher columns as long as there are arrows that allow movement to the right.

But in this problem, arrows only point left or right, not up or down, which complicates things.

Wait, no, the arrows represent movement left or right within the current row.

When the robot chooses to move up or down, it switches rows.

So, the arrows only affect movement within the same row.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row separately, considering the row switches.

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows at any time by choosing to move up or down.

Given that, perhaps the key is to ensure that the robot can progress to higher columns by switching rows appropriately.

But I still need a way to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach any cell in the grid unless there are arrows that create loops that prevent progress.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that the robot can reach (2,n) if it can find a sequence of moves that allows it to progress to higher columns, switching rows when necessary, without getting stuck in a loop.

But determining whether such a sequence exists seems non-trivial.

Given the time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach (2,n) unless there are specific patterns of arrows that block the path.

For example, if there are arrows that force the robot to cycle indefinitely without making progress.

But identifying such patterns seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the robot can always reach (2,n) by carefully choosing its moves.

But the third test case in the example outputs 'No', so that's not the case.

Therefore, there must be specific configurations where reachability is impossible.

I need to find a way to identify these configurations efficiently.

Given that n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to iterate through the columns in steps of 2 and checks specific arrow configurations.

But as seen in the first test case, it incorrectly reports 'No' when the correct answer is 'Yes'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that the robot can reach (2,n) if it can find a path that allows it to progress to higher columns, possibly switching rows when needed, without getting stuck in a loop.

To model this, perhaps I can consider the grid as a directed graph where nodes represent cells, and edges represent possible two-step moves (chosen move + arrow move).

Then, I can check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But building such a graph for large n is inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find that the robot can reach (2,n) unless there are specific patterns of arrows that block the path.

For example, if there are columns where the arrows in both rows point left in a way that creates a loop preventing progress.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the robot can make progress to the right as long as there are arrows that allow movement to higher columns.

However, if there are columns where the arrows are set in a way that forces the robot to move left indefinitely, then it can get stuck in a loop.

Therefore, perhaps I need to check if there are any such loops that block progress to the last column.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that for the robot to reach (2,n), it needs to be able to progress to column n, possibly switching rows along the way.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the possible rows the robot can be in at each column.

Then, for each column, based on the possible rows and the arrows, determine the possible rows for the next column.

If, at the end, the robot can be in row 2 of column n, then the answer is 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a state as the current row and column of the robot.

At each step, the robot chooses a direction to move, then follows the arrow in the cell it ends up in after that move.

Given that, I need to model all possible states the robot can reach.

But this still seems too broad.

Let me try to think in terms of possible movements between columns.

For example, from column c to column c+1, the robot can move right in the same row, or switch rows by moving down or up.

Similarly, moving left would be moving from column c to c-1.

Given that, perhaps I can model the possible movements between columns and see if the robot can reach column n.

But I need to consider the arrows' directions.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible transitions between columns, considering the row switches and the arrows.

Let me try to define dp[c] as a set of rows the robot can be in at column c.

Initialize dp[1] = {1} since the robot starts at (1,1).

Then, for each column c from 1 to n-1, and for each row r in dp[c], determine the possible rows the robot can move to in column c+1.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Let me think about how the robot can move from column c to c+1.

From cell (r,c), the robot can:

- Choose to move right to (r,c+1), then follow the arrow in (r,c+1), which is either left or right.

- Choose to move left to (r,c-1), but only if c > 1, and then follow the arrow in (r,c-1).

- Choose to move down to (3 - r,c), assuming two rows, then follow the arrow in (3 - r,c).

- Choose to move up to (3 - r,c), same as down.

Wait, moving down from row 1 goes to row 2, and moving up from row 2 goes to row 1.

Given that, moving down or up doesn't change the column.

So, if the robot chooses to move down or up, it stays in the same column but switches rows, and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

But the arrow only affects movement within the same row, so after switching rows, it follows the arrow in the new row's current column.

Wait, but the arrow in the new cell dictates movement within that row.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after switching rows, the arrow in the new cell dictates potential further movement within that row.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize the possible moves:

From cell (r,c):

1. Choose to move left to (r,c-1), then follow the arrow in (r,c-1):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r,c-2).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r,c).

2. Choose to move right to (r,c+1), then follow the arrow in (r,c+1):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r,c).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r,c+2).

3. Choose to move down to (3 - r,c), then follow the arrow in (3 - r,c):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (3 - r,c-1).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (3 - r,c+1).

4. Choose to move up to (3 - r,c), then follow the arrow in (3 - r,c):

- Same as moving down.

Wait, moving up or down takes the robot to the other row, and then it follows the arrow in that row's current column.

This is getting too involved for a straightforward solution.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the provided program has a flaw and try to fix it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to determine reachability based on the arrow configurations.

Let me consider that the robot can reach (2,n) if it can find a path that allows it to progress to higher columns without getting stuck in a loop.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of possible row transitions.

Specifically, I can track whether the robot can be in row 1 or row 2 for each column, considering the arrow directions.

Then, for each column, based on the possible rows and the arrows, determine the possible rows for the next column.

If, at the end, row 2 is possible for column n, then the answer is 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize a set of possible rows for column 1: {1}.

Then, for each column c from 1 to n-1:

For each possible row r in the current column:

- If r == 1:

- Choose to move right to (1,c+1), then follow arrow a[c+1]:

- If a[c+1] == '>', move to (1,c+2).

- If a[c+1] == '<', move to (1,c).

- Choose to move down to (2,c), then follow arrow b[c]:

- If b[c] == '>', move to (2,c+1).

- If b[c] == '<', move to (2,c-1).

- Choose to move left to (1,c-1), if c > 1, then follow arrow a[c-1]:

- If a[c-1] == '>', move to (1,c+1).

- If a[c-1] == '<', move to (1,c-2).

- Choose to move up: not possible from row 1.

- Similarly for row 2.

This seems too complicated to implement efficiently for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the robot can reach (2,n) if it can find a sequence of moves that allows it to progress to higher columns, possibly switching rows, without getting stuck in a loop.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column progressions, considering the row switches.

But I need a more efficient way.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check for specific arrow configurations that might block the path.

Specifically, it checks for columns where the arrow in row 1 points left and the arrow in row 2 for the next column points left.

But as seen in the first test case, this logic is flawed.

Therefore, I need to find a different approach.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the problem requires a more sophisticated graph traversal approach, which may not be feasible given the time limits.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of columns or rows that can be exploited.

But I need to find a way to determine reachability efficiently.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach (2,n) unless there are columns where the arrows are set in a way that prevents progress.

Specifically, if there are columns where both rows have arrows pointing left, which could create a situation where the robot gets stuck.

But in the first test case, even with such configurations, it's still possible to reach (2,n), as per the example.

Therefore, this approach is also flawed.

Given that, perhaps the provided program is incorrect, and I need to find a better way to solve the problem.

However, given time constraints, I'll have to conclude that the provided program is incorrect based on the first test case.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
