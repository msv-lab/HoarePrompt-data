Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the problem is: Given a tree with n vertices, I need to find the maximum number x such that by removing exactly k edges, each remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

Now, the task is to remove exactly k edges, not less, not more, and ensure that every resulting connected component has at least x vertices. And I need to maximize x.

I need to think about how removing edges affects the tree. Each time I remove an edge, I split the tree into two smaller trees. So, removing k edges will result in k+1 connected components.

My goal is to maximize x, which is the minimum size of these connected components after removing k edges.

This sounds like a binary search problem. I can binary search on x, the minimum size of the components.

Let me think about the constraints. The smallest x can be is 1, and the largest it can be is n, but probably smaller because we have to remove exactly k edges.

Wait, but if I remove k edges, I get k+1 components. Each of these components must have at least x vertices.

So, for a given x, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

If it's possible, I can try a larger x; if not, I need to decrease x.

That makes sense. So, I'll implement a binary search over x, from 1 to n.

Now, for each x in the binary search, I need a way to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

How can I check that?

I need to find a way to partition the tree into components where each has at least x vertices by removing exactly k edges.

One approach is to perform a DFS and count the number of components that have at least x vertices.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges. So, I need to choose k edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can think in terms of dynamic programming on trees.

Alternatively, since the tree is a special graph, maybe there's a way to traverse it and count the number of components that would be formed if I remove edges where the subtree size is at least x.

Let me think about that.

In a tree, if I have a node and its subtree has size greater than or equal to x, then I can potentially remove the edge connecting this subtree to the rest of the tree.

So, for each node, I can calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, for each edge, I can determine if removing it would result in two components, both with at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, so I need to choose k such edges to remove.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing any k edges; I need to ensure that after removing those k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

In the given code, there's a binary search on x, from 1 to 100001 (which is more than n, but n can be up to 10^5, so it's fine).

For each x in the binary search, it performs a DFS to count the number of cuts that can be made, i.e., the number of edges that can be removed such that the subtree has at least x vertices.

Then, it checks if the number of cuts is greater than k, or if it's equal to k and the leftover vertices (the root component) have at least x vertices.

If so, it sets L = x, else R = x.

Finally, it prints L, which should be the maximum x.

Let me try to understand this approach.

In the DFS function, for each node, it calculates the size of its subtree.

If the subtree size is greater than or equal to x and it's not the root, then it's a potential cut.

So, it increments the cut count and returns 0 to the parent, indicating that this subtree is separated.

Otherwise, it adds the subtree size to the parent's subtree size.

At the end, it checks if the number of cuts is greater than k, or equal to k and the root component has at least x vertices.

If so, it means x is achievable, and we can try a larger x.

Else, we need to decrease x.

This seems logical.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first sample input:

6

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

2 1

1 2

6 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5 6

3 1

1 2

1 3

8 2

1 2

1 3

2 4

2 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

6 2

1 2

2 3

1 4

4 5

5 6

So, for the first test case: n=5, k=1

Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 3-4, 3-5

In the reference solution, it performs a binary search on x from 1 to 100001.

Let's see for x=2.

It performs DFS starting from node 1.

Calculate subtree sizes:

Node 1: size=5

Node 2: size=1

Node 3: size=3

Node 4: size=1

Node 5: size=1

In the DFS:

- Start with node 1, parent=1, so subtree size=5, but since a!=p (1!=1?), wait, a is not equal to p only if a!=p.

Wait, in the code, it's "if vertices >= x and a != p".

So, for node 1, a=1, p=1, so a == p, so it doesn't count a cut.

Then, for node 3, which has subtree size=3 >=x=2, and a!=p, so numCuts=1, and returns 0 to parent.

Similarly, node 2 has size=1 <2, so adds 1 to parent.

Node 4 and 5 have size=1 <2, so adds 1 to parent.

So, the total numCuts=1.

Then, leftover=dfs(1,1), which would be 2 (nodes 1 and 2).

Since numCuts==k and leftover >=x, it sets L=2.

Similarly, for x=3:

numCuts=1 (same as above), but leftover=2 <3, so R=3.

So, L=2, R=3.

Since R - L =1, it stops and outputs L=2.

This matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Let me check another test case.

n=2, k=1

Edges: 1-2

For x=1:

numCuts=1 (remove edge 1-2), leftover=1 >=1, so L=1.

For x=2:

numCuts=0 (since subtree sizes are 1 <2, so no cuts), but k=1, so numCuts <k, set R=2.

So, L=1, R=2, output L=1.

Again, matches the sample output.

Looks good.

Another test case: n=6, k=1

Edges: 1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5,5-6

For x=3:

numCuts=1 (e.g., remove edge 3-4, resulting in components 1-2-3 and 4-5-6, both have size>=3).

Leftover depends on which edge is removed, but in this case, it's possible, so L=3.

For x=4:

numCuts=1, but one of the components might have size less than 4, depending on which edge is removed.

Suppose remove edge 3-4:

components: 1-2-3 (size=3 <4) and 4-5-6 (size=3 <4).

So, numCuts=1, but leftover=3 <4, so R=4.

So, L=3, R=4, output L=3.

But in the sample output, it's 3, which matches.

Good.

Another test case: n=3, k=1

Edges:1-2,1-3

For x=1:

numCuts=1 (remove any edge), leftover=2 >=1, so L=1.

For x=2:

numCuts=1 (remove edge 1-3, components:1-2 and 3, but 3 <2, so numCuts=1 but leftover=2 >=2.

Wait, in the code, it's "numCuts == k and leftover >=x", so for x=2, numCuts=1==k, and leftover=2>=2, so L=2.

But in reality, one component has size 1 <2, which violates the condition.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the DFS:

For x=2:

- Start with node 1, parent=1, subtree size=3 >=2, so numCuts=1, return 0 to parent.

- But the root component is 0, which is <2, but in the code, it checks "if numCuts == k and leftover >=x", where leftover=dfs(1,1)=0 <2, so it sets R=2.

Wait, but in the code, it's "if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >=x)", so numCuts=1==k=1, but leftover=0 <2, so it's not setting L=2, but R=2.

Wait, no, in the code, it's:

if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >=x):

L = x

else:

R = x

So, in this case, numCuts ==k and leftover <x, so it sets R=x.

So, L=1, R=2.

Then, it repeats the loop while R - L >1.

x=(1+2)//2=1.

But earlier, for x=1, numCuts=1==k=1, and leftover=2>=1, so L=1.

Then, x=(1+2)//2=1.

Again, same as L, so it stops and outputs L=1.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

So, correct.

Wait, but in my earlier thought process, I thought that for x=2, it should be invalid because one component has size 1 <2.

But according to the code, it's handling it correctly by setting R=2 when numCuts ==k but leftover <x.

Hence, L=1, R=2, outputs L=1.

So, correct.

Another test case: n=8, k=2

Edges:1-2,1-3,2-4,2-5,3-6,3-7,3-8

For x=1:

numCuts=2, leftover >=1, so L=1.

For x=2:

numCuts=2, leftover >=2, so L=2.

For x=3:

numCuts=2, but some components may have size <3, depending on which edges are removed.

If I remove two edges, say 1-2 and 1-3, then components are:1,2-4-5,3-6-7-8, all have size >=3.

So, L=3.

For x=4:

numCuts=2, but components might be 1,2-4-5,3-6-7-8, where 1 <4, but wait, in this case, numCuts=2, but one component has size 1 <4, which violates.

So, need to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

But in the code, it's only checking that the leftover (the root component) has at least x, but there might be other components formed by the cuts that have less than x vertices.

Is the code handling this correctly?

Wait, in the DFS approach, it's considering the cuts made by removing edges where the subtree has size >=x.

But it's not directly ensuring that the other side also has size >=x.

Wait, in the DFS, when it decides to cut an edge, it's because the subtree has size >=x.

But the remaining tree might have a subtree with size <x.

So, is there a problem with that?

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

In the DFS, when it decides to cut an edge, it's separating a subtree of size >=x.

The remaining tree must also have size >=x after all cuts.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with n=3, k=1, x=2:

- Remove edge 1-3, components:1-2 (size=2 >=2) and 3 (size=1 <2).

So, even though one component has size >=2, the other doesn't satisfy.

But in the code, it only checks that the leftover (the root component) has size >=x, but it doesn't check the components formed by the cuts.

Is this a flaw in the code?

Wait, no. Because when it decides to cut an edge, it's because the subtree has size >=x.

So, each cut separates a subtree of size >=x, and the remaining tree must have size >=x after all cuts.

Wait, but in the n=3, k=1, x=2 case, it's removing edge 1-3, which separates subtree 3 (size>=2? No, size=1 <2), but according to the code, it's considering the subtree size >=x and a!=p.

Wait, no, in that case, subtree of node 3 has size=1 <2, so it doesn't cut that edge.

Wait, but in reality, to have x=2, I need to ensure that all components have size >=2.

So, in this case, it's not possible to have x=2 with k=1 for n=3.

But according to the sample output, for n=3, k=1, the answer is 1.

So, the code is correctly handling it.

Wait, in the n=3, k=1 case:

- For x=1:

numCuts=1, leftover=2 >=1, so L=1.

- For x=2:

numCuts=0 (since subtree sizes: node 1:3>=2, but if we cut it, leftover=0 <2), so R=2.

Hence, L=1, R=2, outputs L=1.

Correct.

Another test case: n=6, k=2

Edges:1-2,2-3,1-4,4-5,5-6

For x=1:

numCuts=2, leftover >=1, so L=1.

For x=2:

numCuts=2, but need to check if all components have size >=2.

If I remove two edges, say 1-2 and 1-4, components:1,2-3,4-5-6, all have size >=2.

So, L=2.

For x=3:

numCuts=2, but one component is 1 <3, so R=3.

Hence, L=2, R=3, outputs L=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Great.

So, overall, the approach seems correct.

It uses binary search on x, and for each x, it performs a DFS to count the number of cuts that can be made, i.e., the number of edges that can be removed such that the subtree has size >=x.

Then, it checks if the number of cuts is greater than or equal to k, and if the leftover (root component) has size >=x.

If so, it tries a larger x; else, it decreases x.

This ensures that all components have size >=x after removing exactly k edges.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{2} \]
