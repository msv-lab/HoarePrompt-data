Alright, I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n disks in a plane, each with integer coordinates for centers and positive integer radii. No two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent to each other. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of these disks such that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

2. No two disks overlap in a positive area.

3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And the new radii can be any positive real numbers, not necessarily integers, and the centers stay fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. So, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.

Now, the problem allows us to change the radii, but tangent disks must remain tangent. That means if two disks were tangent before, their new radii must still satisfy that the sum of their new radii equals the distance between their centers.

Also, no two disks should overlap in a positive area, meaning that for any two disks that weren't tangent before, their new radii should satisfy that the sum of their radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

Additionally, the sum of all radii must strictly decrease.

So, essentially, we need to find new radii for each disk such that:

- For tangent disks: r_i' + r_j' = distance between centers.

- For non-tangent disks: r_i' + r_j' ≤ distance between centers.

- Sum of all r_i' < sum of original r_i.

Given that, I need to figure out if such a set of new radii exists.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, I can represent the disks and their tangencies as a graph, where each disk is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if their disks are tangent.

So, we have a graph G with n nodes and edges representing tangencies.

Now, for each edge (i,j), we have the constraint: r_i' + r_j' = d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between centers i and j.

For non-adjacent pairs, we have r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_kl for k != l.

But the main constraints are on the tangent pairs.

I need to find r_i' for all i such that:

- For each edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' = d_ij.

- For each non-edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

- Sum of r_i' < sum of original r_i.

This seems like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

Maybe I can approach this by fixing some radii and solving for others based on the tangency constraints, then check if the sum can be made strictly less than the original sum.

Wait, but with real numbers and inequalities, this might be tricky.

Let me consider the graph G.

If G is a tree, then I can assign radii uniquely based on the tangency constraints.

Wait, no. If G is a tree, I can assign radii up to a global scaling factor, I think.

But in this case, the radii are fixed by the distances and the tangency conditions.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of linear algebra.

Let me consider that for each tangency edge (i,j), I have the equation r_i' + r_j' = d_ij.

This is a system of linear equations.

The number of equations is equal to the number of edges, say m.

The number of variables is n (the radii r_i').

So, the system is A r' = d, where A is a matrix with rows corresponding to edges, and columns to disks, with entries 1 where the disk is involved in the edge, and 0 otherwise.

d is the vector of distances between centers for each edge.

So, A is a incidence matrix of the graph G.

Now, to solve for r', we need to solve A r' = d.

This is a system of linear equations.

The solution space, if it exists, is determined by the rank of A.

If the system is consistent, then the general solution is r' = r_p + r_h, where r_p is a particular solution and r_h is a solution to A r_h = 0.

Now, for the system to be consistent, d must be in the column space of A.

Given that the disks are positioned such that the tangencies are possible, the system should be consistent.

Assuming the system is consistent, the general solution is r' = r_p + r_h, where r_h is in the null space of A.

Now, I need to ensure that for non-adjacent pairs (i,j), r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

Also, sum of r_i' < sum of original r_i.

So, I need to find r' in the affine space r' = r_p + r_h, such that:

- For each non-edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

- Sum of r_i' < sum of original r_i.

Now, the null space solutions r_h correspond to assignments where r_i' + r_j' = 0 for each edge (i,j).

But since r_i' must be positive, this complicates things.

Wait, actually, r_h is in the null space of A, meaning that for each edge (i,j), (r_h)_i + (r_h)_j = 0.

So, (r_h)_j = - (r_h)_i.

This implies that for each connected component, the radii adjustments must be such that for any path in the component, the adjustments cancel out.

In other words, in a connected component, the radii adjustments can be represented by assigning a value to one disk and then determining the others based on the edge constraints.

Wait, but in this case, since G is connected (assuming it is), then the null space has dimension equal to the number of connected components.

If G is connected, then the nullity of A is 1, meaning that the general solution is r' = r_p + c * r_b, where r_b is a basis vector for the null space.

In this case, r_b would correspond to a constant scaling factor, but in our case, the null space condition is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall some graph theory.

In graph theory, for an undirected graph G with n nodes and m edges, the incidence matrix A has rank n - c, where c is the number of connected components.

Therefore, the nullity of A is c.

So, if G is connected, nullity is 1.

If G has c connected components, nullity is c.

So, in the general solution r' = r_p + r_h, where r_h is in the null space, r_h can be chosen such that for each connected component, there is a free variable.

In other words, for each connected component, I can adjust the radii by adding a constant value to all radii in that component.

Wait, but in our case, the null space condition is that for each connected component, the sum of r_h over the component is zero.

Wait, no.

Actually, if G is connected, and A is the incidence matrix, then the null space corresponds to assignments where the sum of r_h over the component is zero.

Wait, more precisely, for a connected graph, the null space of A is one-dimensional, and it corresponds to constant vectors.

But in our case, since A is the incidence matrix for undirected edges, the null space corresponds to assignments where for any cycle, the sum around the cycle is zero.

But in this specific case, since the edges represent equality constraints on sums, the null space corresponds to assignments where the adjustments are consistent across the graph.

This is getting a bit too abstract.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the tangency constraints fix the radii up to a certain degree.

If two disks are tangent, their radii must sum to the distance between their centers.

If there are multiple tangencies, these constraints might be interdependent.

So, perhaps I can model this as a system where the radii are variables connected by equality constraints.

This sounds similar to constraint satisfaction problems.

In such problems, variables are connected by constraints, and I need to find an assignment that satisfies all constraints.

In this case, the constraints are equalities for tangent disks and inequalities for non-tangent disks.

Moreover, I have an optimization aspect: I want to minimize the sum of radii.

Wait, but it's not necessarily an optimization problem; I just need to check if there exists a solution where the sum strictly decreases.

Perhaps I can think of it as checking if there exists a solution where the sum of radii is less than the original sum.

Given the equality constraints for tangent disks and inequality constraints for non-tangent disks.

This seems complex.

Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider that the tangency constraints form a system that can be represented by a graph, and the problem reduces to checking some property of this graph.

Given that, perhaps I can look for cycles or something similar in the graph.

Wait, maybe thinking in terms of graph theory can help.

Suppose I consider the graph G where nodes are disks and edges are tangencies.

Then, the problem is to adjust the radii such that for each edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' = d_ij, and for non-edges, r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_kl for k != l.

But more specifically, for non-adjacent pairs, r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

And sum of r_i' < sum of original r_i.

Now, perhaps I can fix one radius and solve for the others.

For example, fix r_1' to some value and then assign r_j' based on the tangency constraints.

But since there are multiple connected components, I need to handle each component separately.

Wait, no, if the graph is connected, then fixing one radius determines all others.

In that case, I can choose r_1' to be minimal possible and see if the sum decreases.

But I need to ensure that for non-adjacent pairs, r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider the current radii as one possible solution to the system.

Let me denote the original radii as r_i.

Given that, the original configuration satisfies for each edge (i,j), r_i + r_j = d_ij.

For non-edges, r_i + r_j ≤ d_ij.

And the sum is sum r_i.

I need to find another solution r_i' such that:

- For each edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' = d_ij.

- For each non-edge (i,j), r_i' + r_j' ≤ d_ij.

- sum r_i' < sum r_i.

Now, if I look at the difference s = sum r_i' - sum r_i, I need s < 0.

But I need to see if such a s exists given the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of adjusting the radii by adding or subtracting certain values, subject to the constraints.

Wait, perhaps considering the differences delta_i = r_i' - r_i.

Then, for each edge (i,j), delta_i + delta_j = 0, since r_i' + r_j' = r_i + r_j.

For non-edges, delta_i + delta_j ≤ 0.

And sum delta_i < 0.

Wait, that's interesting.

From the edge constraints, delta_i + delta_j = 0, meaning that for each edge, delta_i = -delta_j.

So, in a connected component, all deltas are determined by one delta.

Wait, in a connected component, if I set delta for one node, the deltas for all other nodes in the component are determined by the edge constraints.

In other words, in a connected component, all deltas are multiples of some base delta, with signs depending on the path from the base node.

But in this case, since delta_i + delta_j = 0 for edges, it's like a bipartition.

Wait, yes, exactly.

In a connected component, if I assign delta_i = c for some nodes and delta_j = -c for adjacent nodes, and so on, based on a bipartition of the graph.

If the connected component is bipartite, then this assignment is possible.

But wait, all cycle graphs with even cycles are bipartite, and those with odd cycles are not.

This seems relevant.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the graph is bipartite.

If the graph is bipartite, then I can assign delta_i = c for one partition and delta_j = -c for the other partition, for some c.

Then, sum delta_i = c * (|A| - |B|), where A and B are the partitions.

To have sum delta_i < 0, I need c * (|A| - |B|) < 0.

If |A| != |B|, then I can choose c such that the sum is negative.

If |A| == |B|, then sum delta_i = 0, which doesn't help because I need sum delta_i < 0.

Moreover, I need to ensure that for non-edges, delta_i + delta_j ≤ 0.

Given that, perhaps in bipartite graphs, this is possible.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for non-edges, delta_i + delta_j ≤ 0.

Given that delta_i and delta_j are assigned based on their partition, if A and B are the partitions, with delta_i = c for A and delta_j = -c for B, then for a non-edge between two nodes in A, delta_i + delta_j = 2c ≤ 0, which implies c ≤ 0.

Similarly, for a non-edge between two nodes in B, delta_i + delta_j = 2*(-c) = -2c ≤ 0, which implies c ≥ 0.

And for non-edges between A and B, delta_i + delta_j = c + (-c) = 0 ≤ 0, which is always true.

So, from these inequalities:

- c ≤ 0 (from non-edges within A)

- c ≥ 0 (from non-edges within B)

Thus, c = 0, which doesn't help because sum delta_i = c*(|A| - |B|) = 0.

So, in bipartite graphs, this approach doesn't lead to a decrease in the sum.

Wait, but in the first sample input, the graph seems to be bipartite, and the answer is YES.

Wait, in the first sample, it's possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, but according to this, c must be zero, but in the sample, they decreased the radii by 0.5 for some disks and increased others.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that in bipartite graphs, it's possible to adjust the radii in such a way that the sum decreases, provided that there exists a connected component where the sizes of the two partitions are different.

In that case, I can choose c to be a small positive or negative value to make the sum decrease.

But in the sample input, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but in the second sample input, which is a cycle of length 4, which is bipartite, and according to my earlier reasoning, c must be zero, but the answer is NO.

Wait, but in the second sample, it's not possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in bipartite graphs, if the partitions have different sizes, then it's possible to choose c such that sum delta_i < 0, otherwise not.

But in the second sample, the cycle of length 4 has two partitions of equal size, so sum delta_i = 0, which doesn't allow the sum to decrease.

In the first sample, perhaps the partitions have different sizes, allowing c to be chosen such that sum delta_i < 0.

Let me check the first sample.

From the description, there are 5 disks, with some tangencies forming a bipartite graph where one partition has more nodes than the other.

In that case, choosing c appropriately would make sum delta_i < 0.

So, perhaps the condition is that there exists at least one connected component that is bipartite and has partitions of unequal size.

In that case, it's possible to choose c such that sum delta_i < 0, while satisfying the non-edge constraints.

Wait, but in the second sample, the graph is a cycle of length 4, which is bipartite with equal partitions, so sum delta_i = 0, which doesn't allow the sum to decrease.

Hence, in that case, it's not possible.

So, perhaps the correctness of the program is to check if there exists at least one connected component that is bipartite and has partitions of unequal size.

If so, then output YES, else NO.

But I need to confirm this logic.

Let me think about it step by step.

1. Model the tangencies as a graph G with n nodes and m edges.

2. For each connected component in G:

a. Check if the component is bipartite.

b. If it's bipartite, find the sizes of the two partitions.

c. If the sizes are unequal, then it's possible to choose c such that sum delta_i < 0.

d. If sum delta_i can be made negative, then it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while satisfying all constraints.

3. If any connected component allows sum delta_i < 0, then output YES.

4. Otherwise, output NO.

This seems to align with the sample inputs.

In the first sample, there are 5 disks, likely forming a bipartite graph with unequal partition sizes, allowing sum delta_i < 0.

In the second sample, there are 4 disks forming a cycle, which is bipartite but with equal partition sizes, so sum delta_i = 0, and hence cannot decrease the sum.

Therefore, the program should check for each connected component:

- Is it bipartite?

- If yes, are the partition sizes equal?

- If partition sizes are unequal, then sum delta_i can be made negative.

- If all bipartite components have equal partition sizes, then sum delta_i cannot be made negative.

Also, if a component is not bipartite, then it's impossible to adjust the radii without violating the non-edge constraints.

Wait, why is that?

If a component is not bipartite, it has an odd cycle, which would make it impossible to assign delta_i = c and delta_j = -c consistently across the cycle.

Hence, only bipartite components allow such assignments.

Therefore, the program should perform a graph traversal (DFS or BFS) to check for bipartiteness and count the sizes of the two partitions in each bipartite component.

If any bipartite component has unequal partition sizes, output YES; else, NO.

Now, looking at the given program, it seems to implement this logic.

Let's analyze the code.

The function func_1() reads n and the disk data, then initializes visited and coef arrays.

It then iterates through each disk, and if not visited, sets coef[i] = 1, tot = 0, bipartite = True, and calls dfs(i).

After DFS, it checks if bipartite and tot != 0, and sets ok = True if so.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if ok, else 'NO'.

The DFS function seems to traverse the graph, setting coef[j] = -coef[i] for adjacent nodes, and checking for bipartiteness.

It also accumulates tot += coef[i].

So, it appears that tot is sum of coef[i] over the component.

If the component is bipartite, and tot != 0, then it means the partitions have unequal sizes, since tot would be |A| - |B|.

Hence, if |A| != |B|, tot != 0.

Therefore, the program is implementing the logic I described.

It checks for each connected component if it's bipartite and has unequal partition sizes.

If any component satisfies this, it outputs YES; else, NO.

Given that, the program seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of given disks while maintaining tangency conditions and ensuring the sum of radii strictly decreases.

## Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Represent disks as nodes in a graph.
    - Connect two nodes with an edge if their disks are tangent.

2. **Connected Components and Bipartiteness**:
    - For each connected component in the graph, check if it is bipartite.
    - If a component is bipartite and the two partitions have unequal sizes, it is possible to adjust radii to decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
    - Use DFS to traverse each connected component, checking for bipartiteness and counting the sizes of the two partitions.

4. **Decision Making**:
    - If any connected component is bipartite with unequal partition sizes, output "YES".
    - Otherwise, output "NO".

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n

            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                if not visited[j]:
                    coef[j] = -coef[i]
                    dfs(j)
                else:
                    bipartite = bipartite and coef[j] == -coef[i]

func_1()
```

## Explanation

- **Graph Construction**:
    - Nodes represent disks.
    - Edges connect tangent disks.

- **DFS Traversal**:
    - Assign coefficients (`coef`) of 1 and -1 to partitions to check bipartiteness.
    - Accumulate a total (`tot`) which is the difference in sizes of the two partitions.

- **Bipartite Check**:
    - If a component is bipartite and the partitions are of unequal sizes (`tot != 0`), it is possible to adjust radii to decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.

- **Output Decision**:
    - "YES" if any component allows radii adjustment to decrease the sum.
    - "NO" otherwise.

This approach ensures we correctly determine the possibility of adjusting radii under the given constraints.
