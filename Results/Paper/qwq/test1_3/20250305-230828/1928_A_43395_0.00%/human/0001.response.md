Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this process.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of its sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a by b, he can cut it into two rectangles of size a by something, or something by b.

Let's consider an example to get a better grasp. Take the example from the problem: a 2x6 rectangle. He can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, from these two 2x3 rectangles, he can arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6. So, in this case, the answer is "Yes."

Another example is a 2x1 rectangle. If he cuts it into two 1x1 rectangles, and then tries to arrange them, he can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original. So, in this case, the answer is "No."

Okay, so the key is to see if, after cutting and rearranging, Bob can get a rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one under rotation.

Let me think about the conditions under which this is possible.

First, consider that cutting the rectangle can be done in two ways: either along the length or along the width.

Suppose he cuts the rectangle along its length. So, if the rectangle is a x b, cutting along the length would produce two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c is some integer between 1 and b-1.

Similarly, cutting along the width would produce two rectangles of size d x b and (a - d) x b.

After cutting, Bob can rotate and move these pieces to form a new rectangle.

I need to consider all possible ways of cutting and arranging the pieces to see if any of them result in a new rectangle that's not equivalent to the original one.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let's think about the area. The area of the original rectangle is a * b. After cutting and rearranging, the total area remains the same. So, the new rectangle must also have area a * b.

So, possible dimensions of the new rectangle would be pairs of factors of a * b.

But, since rotations are considered the same, we only need to consider rectangles where the first dimension is less than or equal to the second.

Now, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a rectangle with dimensions x and y, where x <= y, x * y = a * b, and (x, y) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

Wait, but it's not just any rectangle with area a * b; it has to be formed by combining two rectangles that are obtained by cutting the original rectangle as described.

So, I need to ensure that these two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form the new rectangle.

Let's consider the cutting process more carefully.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle along its length, producing two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c).

Now, he can arrange these two rectangles in different ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally, forming a rectangle of size a x (c + (b - c)) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

2. Place them vertically, one on top of the other, forming a rectangle of size (a + a) x c, which is 2a x c.

Wait, but 2a x c might be the same as the original rectangle if 2a = a and c = b, but that doesn't make sense because 2a is not equal to a unless a = 0, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps when he cuts the rectangle into two parts, he can rotate them.

Let me consider the example again: 2x6.

He cuts it into two 2x3 rectangles.

Then, he can place them side by side horizontally to get 2x6, which is the original.

Or, he can place them vertically, stacking them to get 4x3.

Similarly, if he has two 1x3 rectangles, he can place them to get 1x6 or 2x3.

Wait, but in the 2x6 case, placing two 2x3 rectangles vertically gives 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this arrangement, he gets a new rectangle.

In the 2x1 case, cutting into two 1x1 squares, and arranging them gives 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original.

So, the condition seems to be that if he can arrange the two smaller rectangles into a new rectangle with different aspect ratio.

But, I need a general condition for any a and b.

Let me consider the possible cuts and arrangements.

First, cutting along the length:

- Cut into two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c).

- Arranging them horizontally gives a x b, which is the original.

- Arranging them vertically gives 2a x c.

Similarly, cutting along the width:

- Cut into two rectangles of size d x b and (a - d) x b.

- Arranging them horizontally gives 2d x b.

- Arranging them vertically gives (a - d) x b.

Wait, I think I'm missing something here.

Actually, when arranging the two pieces, he can rotate them.

So, if he has two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), he can rotate them to c x a and (b - c) x a, and then arrange them in different ways.

Let me try to find a general condition.

Suppose he cuts the rectangle into two parts, say p and q, where p + q = a * b.

But, since he cuts parallel to one side, the dimensions of the smaller rectangles are constrained.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Let me think about the GCD of a and b.

In the example, for 2x6, GCD is 2.

After cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, GCD of 2 and 3 is 1, which is different.

In the 2x1 case, GCD is 1, and cutting into two 1x1 squares, GCD remains 1.

Not sure if that helps.

Let me consider the area again.

The area is a * b.

After cutting and rearranging, the area remains the same.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x * y = a * b, and x <= y.

Now, the original rectangle has dimensions a and b, with a <= b without loss of generality.

So, if there exists another pair (x, y) with x <= y, x * y = a * b, and (x, y) != (a, b), then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But, I need to ensure that such a pair can actually be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

So, perhaps the condition is that a * b can be factored in more than one way.

But, for rectangles that are equivalent under rotation, we consider them the same.

So, the number of distinct rectangles with area a * b is the number of pairs (x, y) with x <= y and x * y = a * b.

If there is more than one such pair, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But, I need to ensure that it's possible to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form this new rectangle.

Wait, maybe that's always possible if there's another pair.

But, in the 2x1 case, a * b = 2, and the only pairs are (1,2), which is considered the same as (2,1), so only one distinct rectangle.

In the 2x6 case, a * b = 12, and possible pairs are (2,6), (3,4), and (4,3), but (3,4) and (4,3) are considered the same, so there are two distinct rectangles: (2,6) and (3,4).

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, the condition seems to be that the number of distinct rectangles with area a * b is greater than one.

In other words, the number of pairs (x, y) with x <= y and x * y = a * b is greater than one.

This would mean that a * b has more than one factorization into such pairs.

So, to generalize, if a * b has more than one distinct pair of factors (x, y) with x <= y, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No."

But, I need to confirm this with some examples.

Take a = 1, b = 1. Area = 1. Only pair is (1,1). So, "No."

a = 2, b = 1. Area = 2. Pairs: (1,2). Only one distinct rectangle. "No."

a = 2, b = 6. Area = 12. Pairs: (2,6), (3,4). Two distinct rectangles. "Yes."

a = 3, b = 2. Area = 6. Pairs: (2,3), (1,6). Two distinct rectangles. "Yes."

a = 2, b = 2. Area = 4. Pairs: (2,2), (1,4). Two distinct rectangles. "Yes."

a = 2, b = 4. Area = 8. Pairs: (2,4), (1,8). Two distinct rectangles. "Yes."

a = 6, b = 3. Area = 18. Pairs: (3,6), (2,9), (1,18). Two distinct rectangles (since (3,6) and (6,3) are the same). So, "Yes."

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "No" for a=6, b=3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Looking back at the sample output:

Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Wait, for a=6, b=3, output is "No."

But according to my earlier reasoning, I thought it should be "Yes."

So, perhaps my condition is not sufficient.

I need to think more carefully.

Maybe there's an additional constraint based on the cutting process.

Let me consider the cutting process again.

When Bob cuts the rectangle, he makes a cut parallel to one of its sides, dividing it into two smaller rectangles.

Then, he can rotate and move these pieces to form a new rectangle.

So, the new rectangle must be formable from these two pieces.

Let me consider the possible ways to cut and rearrange.

Case 1: Cut parallel to the shorter side.

Case 2: Cut parallel to the longer side.

Wait, but it's more general: he can choose to cut parallel to either side.

Let me consider that the cut is made parallel to the side of length a, dividing the side of length b into two parts, say c and b - c.

Then, the two smaller rectangles are a x c and a x (b - c).

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the side of length b, dividing the side of length a into d and a - d, resulting in (a - d) x b and d x b.

Now, from these two smaller rectangles, he can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.

Let me consider the possible arrangements.

Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally.

Option 2: Place them side by side vertically.

Option 3: Place one on top of the other.

But, in the example, placing two 2x3 rectangles side by side horizontally gives 2x6, which is the original, and placing them vertically gives 4x3, which is new.

So, in this case, he can form a 4x3 rectangle.

Similarly, if he has two 1x3 rectangles, placing them side by side horizontally gives 1x6, which is the same as the original 2x3 (considering rotations), or placing them vertically gives 2x3, which is again the same.

Wait, but in the sample input, a=2, b=4, output is "Yes."

Let's see: cutting parallel to a (side of length 2), dividing b=4 into, say, 1 and 3, resulting in two rectangles of 2x1 and 2x3.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives 2x4, which is the original.

Arranging them vertically gives 4x1 and 4x3, which can be combined to form what?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the way to arrange them is to place the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other, considering their dimensions.

Alternatively, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions are determined by the sum of the dimensions of the smaller rectangles.

Wait, in the 2x6 example, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, and placing them vertically gives a 4x3 rectangle.

So, the new dimensions are (a + a) x c = 4x3.

Similarly, in the 2x4 example, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and placing them vertically gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 under rotation.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "Yes," meaning a different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that 4x2 is considered the same as 2x4, so it's not a different rectangle.

But the sample output says "Yes," so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to cut and arrange.

Let me try cutting the 2x4 rectangle differently.

If I cut it parallel to the side of length 4, dividing it into two 2x2 rectangles, and then arrange them side by side horizontally, I get 2x4, which is the original.

If I arrange them vertically, I get 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 under rotation.

So, in this case, no new rectangle is formed.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes."

Wait, maybe there's another way to cut it.

Alternatively, perhaps cutting parallel to the side of length 2, dividing the side of length 4 into, say, 1 and 3, resulting in two rectangles of 1x2 and 3x2.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives 2x4, the original.

Arranging them vertically gives 4x2, again the same as the original.

Wait, but the sample output is "Yes," so there must be another way.

Perhaps cutting differently.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 1x4 rectangles, then arranging them vertically gives 2x4, which is the original.

Arranging them horizontally gives 1x8, which is a new rectangle.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

So, in my earlier reasoning, I missed that cutting parallel to the other side can lead to a different arrangement.

So, the condition is not just based on the number of factor pairs of a * b, but also on whether such a cutting and arrangement is possible.

In other words, it's necessary that a * b has more than one distinct factor pair, and that there exists a way to cut the rectangle into two parts that can be rearranged to form one of these other factor pairs.

So, perhaps the condition is that a * b is not a prime number and not a square of a prime number.

Wait, but in the sample input, a=2, b=2, which is 4, which is 2 squared, and the output is "Yes," because he can cut it into two 1x2 rectangles and arrange them to form a 1x4 rectangle.

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that a * b is not a square of a prime.

Wait, 2*2=4, which is 2 squared, but still "Yes."

Wait, 2*1=2, which is 2 squared? No, 2 is prime, but 2*1=2, and output is "No."

Wait, maybe it's that a * b has more than two distinct factor pairs.

Wait, but 4 has two factor pairs: (1,4) and (2,2). Considering rotations, there are two distinct rectangles: 1x4 and 2x2.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle: from 2x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them to form 1x4.

Hence, "Yes."

Similarly, for 1x1, area=1, only one factor pair: (1,1). "No."

For 2x1, area=2, factor pairs: (1,2). "No."

For 2x6, area=12, factor pairs: (2,6), (3,4), (1,12). "Yes."

For 3x2, area=6, factor pairs: (2,3), (1,6). "Yes."

For 2x2, area=4, factor pairs: (1,4), (2,2). "Yes."

For 2x4, area=8, factor pairs: (2,4), (1,8). "Yes."

For 6x3, area=18, factor pairs: (3,6), (2,9), (1,18). "Yes."

Wait, but according to the sample output, for a=6, b=3, it's "No."

But according to this, it should be "Yes."

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me check the cutting process for a=6, b=3.

Cutting parallel to the side of length 6, dividing the side of length 3 into, say, 1 and 2, resulting in two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2.

Arranging them side by side horizontally gives 6x3, the original.

Arranging them vertically gives 12x1 and 12x2, which can be arranged to form what?

Wait, placing them vertically would give a rectangle of (6+6)=12 in one dimension and 1 in the other, so 12x1.

But 12x1 is the same as 1x12, which is a valid rectangle.

However, in terms of the problem, is 12x1 considered different from 6x3?

Well, 6x3 can be rotated to 3x6, but 12x1 cannot be rotated to match 6x3, so it's a different rectangle.

But according to the sample output, it's "No," which contradicts this.

So, perhaps there's a constraint that I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says: "Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in this case, 12x1 and 1x12 are considered the same.

But 1x12 is different from 6x3, so it should be considered a different rectangle.

But the sample output is "No," so perhaps there's another constraint.

Maybe it's not possible to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a 12x1 rectangle.

Let's see: from a 6x3 rectangle, cutting into 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles.

If I arrange them vertically, I get a 12x1 rectangle.

Is this possible?

Well, placing one 6x1 rectangle on top of another 6x1 rectangle gives a 12x1 rectangle.

Similarly, placing the 6x2 rectangle next to the 6x1 rectangle horizontally gives a 6x3 rectangle, which is the original.

Alternatively, placing them vertically gives a 9x2 rectangle, which is not a valid rectangle because 9*2=18, which matches the area, but is it possible to arrange them in this way?

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, if I have a 6x1 and a 6x2 rectangle, placing them vertically gives a (6+6)x1 = 12x1 rectangle.

So, it's possible.

But according to the sample output, it's "No," so maybe there's an additional constraint that I'm missing.

Perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have integer sides, which it does, but maybe there's a restriction based on the original dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the cutting must be into two rectangles with integer sides, which it is, but perhaps there's a condition on the aspect ratio or something else.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, not just different in rotation.

Wait, but in the 2x6 example, the new rectangle is 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

In the 6x3 example, the new rectangle would be 12x1, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No."

So, perhaps there's a miscalculation on my part.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says: "However, from the 2 × 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two 1 × 1 rectangles, and from these, only the 1 × 2 and 2 × 1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same."

So, perhaps for the 6x3 rectangle, after cutting, the only possible arrangements are rectangles equivalent to the original one.

Wait, but I thought placing the 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles vertically gives a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose that a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle if and only if a * b has more than one distinct pair of factors (x, y) with x <= y, and x != a or y != b.

But, in the case of a=6, b=3, a * b = 18, which has factor pairs (1,18), (2,9), (3,6).

So, possible rectangles are 1x18, 2x9, and 3x6.

Considering rotations, these are all distinct.

So, from 6x3, which is the same as 3x6, he can form 2x9 or 1x18.

So, it seems like it should be "Yes."

But according to the sample output, it's "No."

So, perhaps there's a constraint based on the parity of the dimensions or something else.

Looking at the sample input and output:

1 1: No

2 1: No

2 6: Yes

3 2: Yes

2 2: Yes

2 4: Yes

6 3: No

I need to find a pattern that matches this.

Looking at the dimensions:

- For 1x1: both odd -> No

- 2x1: one even, one odd -> No

- 2x6: both even -> Yes

- 3x2: one odd, one even -> Yes

- 2x2: both even -> Yes

- 2x4: both even -> Yes

- 6x3: one even, one odd -> No

So, perhaps the condition is that both a and b are even.

But, in the 3x2 case, which is one even and one odd, the output is "Yes."

So, that can't be it.

Alternatively, maybe it's that at least one of them is even.

In the 1x1 and 2x1 cases, at least one is odd, and the output is "No."

In the other cases, at least one is even, and the output is "Yes," except for 6x3, where one is even and one is odd, and output is "No."

Wait, but 6x3 has one even and one odd, and output is "No."

So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, 6 is even, 3 is odd.

Similarly, 3x2 has one even and one odd, and output is "Yes."

So, perhaps there's another condition.

Let me consider the GCD of a and b.

For 2x6, GCD is 2.

For 3x2, GCD is 1.

For 2x2, GCD is 2.

For 2x4, GCD is 2.

For 6x3, GCD is 3.

So, perhaps if GCD is even, then "Yes," else "No."

In the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, which is odd, but output is "Yes."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps if both a and b are even, or if one is even and some condition holds.

Wait, maybe it's that a * b is even.

In the "No" cases, a * b is odd (1x1=1, odd) or one is even and one is odd, but in some cases "Yes," in others "No."

Wait, 2x1=2, even, output "No."

2x6=12, even, output "Yes."

3x2=6, even, output "Yes."

2x2=4, even, output "Yes."

2x4=8, even, output "Yes."

6x3=18, even, output "No."

So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on whether a divides b or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a divides b or b divides a.

In the 2x6 case, 2 divides 6.

In the 3x2 case, 2 doesn't divide 3, and 3 doesn't divide 2.

In the 2x2 case, 2 divides 2.

In the 2x4 case, 2 divides 4.

In the 6x3 case, 3 divides 6.

So, in the cases where a divides b or b divides a, and some other condition, the output is "Yes" or "No."

Wait, in the 2x1 case, 2 divides 1? No, 1 doesn't divide 2.

Wait, 1 divides 2, but output is "No."

In the 2x6 case, 2 divides 6, output "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, 2 doesn't divide 3, output "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, 2 divides 2, output "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, 2 divides 4, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, 3 divides 6, output "No."

Hmm, still not clear.

Wait, perhaps it's that a divides b and a is even.

In the 2x6 case, 2 divides 6, and 2 is even, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, 3 divides 6, but 3 is odd, output "No."

In the 3x2 case, 2 doesn't divide 3, but 3 divides 2? No, wait, neither divides the other, but output is "Yes."

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be able to be arranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions.

So, perhaps the condition is that a or b is even.

In the "No" cases, a and b are both odd, or one is even and one is odd, but in some cases "Yes," in others "No."

Wait, in the 2x1 case, one is even, one is odd, output "No."

In the 3x2 case, one is even, one is odd, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, one is even, one is odd, output "No."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on whether a is even or b is even, and a or b is divisible by some factor.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different pattern.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

1 1: No

2 1: No

2 6: Yes

3 2: Yes

2 2: Yes

2 4: Yes

6 3: No

I notice that in the "Yes" cases, a * b is divisible by 4.

In the "No" cases, a * b is not divisible by 4.

Wait, let's check:

1x1=1: Not divisible by 4, "No."

2x1=2: Not divisible by 4, "No."

2x6=12: Divisible by 4, "Yes."

3x2=6: Not divisible by 4, "Yes."

2x2=4: Divisible by 4, "Yes."

2x4=8: Divisible by 4, "Yes."

6x3=18: Not divisible by 4, "No."

Hmm, this doesn't hold for 3x2=6, which is not divisible by 4 but output is "Yes."

So, that can't be it.

Alternatively, maybe it's that a or b is even, but in the 3x2 case, b is even, and output is "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, b is odd, and output is "No."

But, in the 2x1 case, a is even, output is "No."

Wait, this is confusing.

Let me consider that for "Yes," at least one of a or b is even, except in the case where a is even and b is odd, and a divides b.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a=2 is even, b=6 is even, and 2 divides 6, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and 3 divides 6, output "No."

In the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, and 2 doesn't divide 3, output "Yes."

Wait, this seems a bit inconsistent.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the condition is that a * b is even, and a != b.

But, in the 2x1 case, a * b is even, and a != b, output is "No."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's that a * b is even, and a != b, and a doesn't divide b or b doesn't divide a.

But, in the 2x6 case, a divides b, and output is "Yes."

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Suppose that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if a * b is even, and a != b.

But, in the sample input, for a=2, b=1, a * b is even, a != b, output is "No."

So, that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a and b are both even.

But, in the 3x2 case, only one is even, and output is "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, one is even, one is odd, output is "No."

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's that a is even, and b is a multiple of a.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a=2 is even, and b=6 is a multiple of a, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, and b=3 is not a multiple of a, but output is "No."

In the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, b=2 is not a multiple of 3, output is "Yes."

This is still not consistent.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must have a common dimension that can be used to form a new rectangle with different proportions.

Wait, perhaps it's about the aspect ratio.

If the aspect ratio of the new rectangle is different from the original, then it's a different rectangle.

So, in the 2x6 case, original aspect ratio is 2:6 = 1:3.

The new rectangle is 4x3, which is 4:3, which is different.

In the 6x3 case, original aspect ratio is 6:3 = 2:1.

If he forms a 12x1 rectangle, aspect ratio is 12:1, which is different from 6:3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No," so perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that arrangement is possible.

Alternatively, maybe in the 6x3 case, it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, perhaps because a=6 is even, and b=3 is odd, and a is a multiple of b, then "No."

In the 2x6 case, a=2 is even, b=6 is even, and a divides b, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and a is a multiple of b, output "No."

In the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, and a doesn't divide b, output "Yes."

So, perhaps the condition is that a is even, or b is even, but not both a and b are multiples of each other.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2 even, and a divides b, output "Yes."

So, that doesn't hold.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a mathematical condition.

Let me consider that a rectangle can be transformed into another if a * b has more than one distinct pair of factors (x,y) with x <= y.

But, in the 6x3 case, a * b = 18, which has multiple factor pairs, but output is "No."

So, perhaps there's an additional constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a and b share a common even factor.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a and b share a common factor of 2, which is even.

In the 3x2 case, a and b share a common factor of 1, but output is "Yes."

Wait, perhaps it's that a and b share a common factor greater than 1.

But, in the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, output is "Yes."

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a or b is even, and a != b.

But, in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, a != b, output is "No."

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps it's that a and b are both even, or that a is even and b is odd, with some condition.

In the 2x6 case, both even, "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, one even, one odd, "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, both even, "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, both even, "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd, "No."

In the 2x1 case, one even, one odd, "No."

So, perhaps when a is even and b is odd, it's "Yes" only if a > b.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, a > b, output "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3 odd, a > b, output "No."

So, that doesn't hold.

This is really tricky.

Let me consider that in the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and a is a multiple of b.

Similarly, in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, a is a multiple of b, output "No."

In the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, a is not a multiple of b, output "Yes."

In the 2x6 case, a=2 even, b=6 even, a divides b, output "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2 even, a divides b, output "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, a=2 even, b=4 even, a divides b, output "Yes."

So, perhaps the condition is that a divides b or b divides a, and a != b, and a is even.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, a doesn't divide b, and a != b, and a is odd, output "Yes."

So, that doesn't hold.

I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be able to be arranged in a way that their dimensions combine to form new dimensions that are different from the original ones, considering rotations.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and then arrange the two pieces to see if I can get a new rectangle.

Let me consider that when Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, he can choose to cut it either along the length or along the width.

Then, he can arrange the two smaller rectangles in two ways: placing them side by side or placing one on top of the other.

In addition, he can rotate the smaller rectangles.

So, for each cutting option, there are multiple arrangement possibilities.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle along its width, dividing the side of length b into c and b - c.

Then, he has two rectangles: a x c and a x (b - c).

He can arrange them in the following ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally: forming a rectangle of a x b, which is the original.

2. Place them side by side vertically: forming a rectangle of (a + a) x c = 2a x c.

Similarly, if he cuts along the length, dividing the side of length a into d and a - d.

Then, he has two rectangles: d x b and (a - d) x b.

He can arrange them in the following ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally: forming a rectangle of a x b, which is the original.

2. Place them side by side vertically: forming a rectangle of (d + (a - d)) x b = a x b, which is the original.

Wait, this seems to suggest that no new rectangles can be formed, but that contradicts the sample input.

So, perhaps I'm missing the rotation part.

Let me consider that Bob can rotate the smaller rectangles.

So, for example, if he has two rectangles of a x c and a x (b - c), he can rotate them to c x a and (b - c) x a.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives c x a and (b - c) x a, which can be placed next to each other to form (c + b - c) x a = b x a, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, placing them vertically gives (a + a) x c = 2a x c.

Similarly, if he rotates them, he can place them in different orientations.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to arrange them differently.

Let me consider the 2x6 example again.

He cuts it into two 2x3 rectangles.

Then, placing them side by side horizontally gives 2x6, original.

Placing them vertically gives 4x3, which is new.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, for 3x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them vertically gives 2x2, which is different from 3x2.

Wait, but 2x2 is considered different from 3x2, since they are not rotations of each other.

Wait, no, 2x2 and 3x2 are different.

So, in this case, it's "Yes."

But according to the sample input, for a=3, b=2, output is "Yes."

Similarly, for a=2, b=4, cutting into two 1x4 rectangles, and arranging them vertically gives 2x4, which is the same as the original.

Wait, but according to the sample input, output is "Yes."

Wait, perhaps there's another way to cut it.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles, and arrange them vertically, I get 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 under rotation.

So, no new rectangle.

But earlier I thought cutting into two 1x4 rectangles, but that's the same as the original.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Perhaps in some cases, it's possible to form a new rectangle, in others, it's not.

Given that I'm having so much trouble figuring out the general condition, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be reduced to checking if a * b has more than one distinct pair of factors (x,y) with x <= y, and that these pairs correspond to possible new rectangles.

But, in the 6x3 case, a * b = 18, which has multiple factor pairs, but according to the sample output, it's "No."

So, perhaps there's an additional constraint based on the parity or divisibility.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that after cutting, the smaller rectangles cannot be arranged to form certain rectangles, even if the area matches.

This is getting too complicated for me to figure out manually.

Given the time constraints, I think I'll have to accept that I don't fully understand the condition, and perhaps implement a solution based on the sample inputs and try to find a pattern.

Given that, I'll assume that the condition is that a * b is even, and a != b, but that doesn't match the sample input.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a and b are both even, or that a is even and b is odd, with some conditions.

Given that, perhaps the
