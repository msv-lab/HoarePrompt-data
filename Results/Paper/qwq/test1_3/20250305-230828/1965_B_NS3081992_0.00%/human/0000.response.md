Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should have two properties:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v between 1 and n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v from 1 to n (except k), there is a subsequence that sums to v. That sounds a bit tricky.

Let me think about how to approach this. I know that with sequences of numbers, the sum of subsequences can cover a range of values, but there might be gaps or specific sums that can't be achieved.

One thing I recall is the concept of subset sum problems, where determining whether a subset of a set of integers sums to a particular value is NP-complete. However, since the constraints here are limited, and m is at most 25, I can probably find a way to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider the properties that the sequence should have.

First, it should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

Second, it should not be possible to get a sum of k from any subsequence.

Given that m is at most 25, and the elements can be up to 10^9, I have some flexibility in choosing the elements.

I need to ensure that the sequence can generate all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

One way to ensure that a sequence can generate a wide range of sums is to include elements that are powers of 2. For example, if I have [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], their subsets can generate any sum up to the sum of all elements.

But in this case, I need to exclude the sum k. So, I need to modify this approach to prevent any subsequence from summing to k, while still being able to sum to all other values up to n.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Output: [1]

- No subsequence sums to 2 (since [1] sums to 1, and the empty subsequence sums to 0).

- For v=1 (since v=2 is k), there is a subsequence [1] that sums to 1.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Output: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1.

- For v=2 to 6, there are subsequences that sum to each v except v=1.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Output: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- All subsequences sum to values from 1 to 7, but not 8.

- Since all elements are 1, any subsequence with m elements sums to m.

- So, subsequences sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 but not 8.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Output: [7,1,4,1]

- Need to ensure no subsequence sums to 3.

- And subsequences can sum to all other values from 1 to 9 except 3.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Output: [1,2,8,3]

- No subsequence sums to 7.

- Subsequences can sum to all other values from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these examples, I can see that different strategies are used depending on the values of n and k.

In the first test case, since k=2 and n=2, a single element suffices.

In the second test case, since k=1, and n=6, the sequence starts from 2 and goes up to 6.

In the third test case, since k=8 and n=8, using all 1's up to 7 sums to all values from 1 to 7.

In the fourth test case, with k=3 and n=9, a sequence with elements [7,1,4,1] is chosen, ensuring no subsequence sums to 3.

In the fifth test case, with k=7 and n=10, the sequence [1,2,8,3] is chosen.

From these, I can try to generalize a strategy.

One approach could be:

- If k=1, then all elements in the sequence can be at least 2, so no subsequence can sum to 1.

- For other k, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n except k.

- One way to prevent a sum of k is to exclude elements that can combine to form k.

- However, this needs to be done carefully to still allow sums for all other v.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

This reminds me of the concept of a minimal set that can generate a certain range of sums.

In particular, powers of 2 can generate all sums up to the sum of all elements.

But in this case, I need to exclude one particular sum, k.

So, perhaps I can start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

For example, if I have elements that cover all sums up to n, and then remove or adjust elements to prevent the sum k from being formed.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I have elements that are powers of 2, their subsets can sum to any number up to the sum of all elements.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can sum to any number from 1 to 15.

But I need to exclude one particular sum, k.

So, perhaps I can exclude k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

Wait, but I can't exclude k directly because the elements are non-negative integers, and k might not be present in the sequence.

Wait, the problem says "no subsequence sums to k", not that k is not present in the sequence.

So, even if k is not in the sequence, as long as no subsequence sums to k, it's okay.

For example, in the first test case, k=2 is not in the sequence [1], and no subsequence sums to 2.

In the second test case, k=1 is not in the sequence [2,3,4,5,6], and no subsequence sums to 1.

In the third test case, k=8 is not in the sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], and no subsequence sums to 8.

Wait, but in the third test case, the sequence is all 1's, so subsequences can sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but not 8.

So, it's possible to construct sequences where the sums cover a specific range excluding one value.

Another approach is to include elements that allow sums up to n, but modify the sequence to make sure that k cannot be formed.

One way to do this is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

For example, if I have elements that can form all sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For instance, if I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element that is necessary to form the sum k.

But this might not suffice, because removing one element might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that the sum k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Let me consider the case where k is 1.

If k=1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are possible.

In this case, I can choose all elements to be at least 2.

For example, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, the output is [2,3,4,5,6].

Any subsequence will have a sum of at least 2, so no subsequence sums to 1, and all sums from 2 to 6 are possible.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, k=8, the output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum to 1 through 7, but not 8.

So, in this case, since all elements are 1, the maximum sum is 7, which is less than 8.

So, for k=8, n=8, using seven 1's achieves the goal.

In the fourth test case, n=9, k=3, the output is [7,1,4,1].

Let's see the possible subsequences:

- [7]: 7

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [7,1]: 8

- [7,4]: 11

- [7,1,4]: 12

- [1,4]: 5

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [1,1]: 2

- [7,4,1]: 12

- [7,1,4,1]: 13

- [1,4,1]: 6

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [7,4,1,1]: 13

- [1,1,4]: 6

So, possible sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

Missing sums: 3,10.

But n=9, so sums up to 9 are considered.

Here, sums from 1 to 9 except 3 are possible.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=10, k=7, output [1,2,8,3].

Possible subsequences:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, possible sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Missing sums:7

n=10, so sums from 1 to 10 except 7 are possible.

So, in this case, the sequence [1,2,8,3] achieves the goal.

Now, I need to generalize this approach.

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

To do this, I can start with elements that allow me to generate sums up to n, excluding k.

One way to think about this is to use the minimal number of elements to cover the required sums.

Given that m is at most 25, I have some flexibility.

Let me consider the binary representation approach again.

If I include elements that are powers of 2, their subsets can sum to any value up to the sum of all elements.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can sum to any value from 1 to 15.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can modify this approach by excluding k and adjusting the sequence accordingly.

Alternatively, I can include elements that cover all sums except k.

Let me consider the case where k is not a power of 2.

For example, if k=3 and n=5, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but can sum to 1,2,4,5.

One possible sequence is [1,2,4]. Here, subsets are:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [4]:4

- [1,2]:3 â†’ which sums to 3, which is k.

- [1,4]:5

- [2,4]:6

- [1,2,4]:7

So, in this case, [1,2,4] includes a subsequence that sums to 3, which is k.

So, I need to modify this sequence to exclude the sum 3.

One way is to remove 2, but then I can't sum to 2 or 4 or 5.

Alternatively, I can replace 2 with another number.

For example, [1,3,4]. Subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [3]:3 â†’ which is k.

- [4]:4

- [1,3]:4

- [1,4]:5

- [3,4]:7

- [1,3,4]:8

Wait, [1,3] sums to 4, which is allowed, but [3] sums to 3, which is k.

So, I need to exclude any subsequence that sums to k.

So, in this case, I need to exclude 3 from being in the sequence.

What if I use [1,4]? Subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1,4]:5

Missing sums:2,3.

But I need to be able to sum to 2 and 5, but not 3.

So, perhaps [1,2,4] is necessary, but then I have the sum 3.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the elements.

Another idea is to include elements that allow generating all sums except k by ensuring that no combination of elements sums to k.

This might require carefully selecting elements that together cannot form k, but can form all other sums up to n.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence where the sums of subsequences cover all integers from 1 to n except k.

This is similar to having the entire set cover [1,n] minus {k}.

I need to ensure that the sequence's subset sums equal the set [1,n] \ {k}.

Wait, but it's not exactly equal; it's just that for every v in [1,n] \ {k}, there exists a subsequence that sums to v, but the subset sums may include other values beyond n.

But the problem likely assumes that n is the upper limit we care about.

Given that, I need to make sure that all v from 1 to n, except k, are achievable, and k is not achievable.

One way to ensure that k is not achievable is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This can be tricky, especially if k is small.

Let me consider the case where k=1.

If k=1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1.

This can be achieved by making sure that all elements in the sequence are at least 2.

Then, the smallest possible sum is 2, so no subsequence sums to 1.

Similarly, for v from 2 to n, I need to be able to form those sums.

This seems straightforward for k=1.

Similarly, for k=n, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to n, but can sum to all v from 1 to n-1.

This might involve choosing elements such that their maximum sum is less than n or ensuring that no combination reaches exactly n.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=8, k=8, and the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums up to 7, which is less than 8, so no subsequence sums to 8.

That works for that case.

But for other values of k, it's not so straightforward.

Let me consider another strategy.

Suppose I start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For example, if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element that is necessary to form the sum k.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements that allow generating all sums except k by carefully choosing elements that fill the sums appropriately.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that with a set of elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, where m is the number of elements.

Given that m is at most 25, 2^25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

But I need to ensure that exactly one sum is excluded, and that is k.

This seems manageable.

Let me consider building a sequence where the subset sums cover [1,n] \ {k}.

One way to think about this is to include elements that can generate all sums up to n, except for k.

This can be achieved by including elements that fill the sums appropriately, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

This sounds similar to the concept of a complete residue system modulo some number, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to include elements that allow me to cover as many sums as possible without covering k.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me initialize an empty sequence and a set of achievable sums starting with 0.

Then, iterate through numbers from 1 to n, excluding k, and add elements to the sequence such that each new element allows me to reach new sums.

But I need to ensure that k is never reachable.

This sounds similar to building a minimal set that covers the required sums.

However, implementing this efficiently within the time constraints is challenging, given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000.

I need a faster way.

Let me consider the binary representation approach again.

If I include elements that are powers of 2, their subsets can sum to any value up to the sum of all elements.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can sum to any value from 1 to 15.

If k is, say, 5, then I need to modify this sequence so that no subsequence sums to 5, but can sum to all other values up to n.

One way to do this is to include elements that allow summing to all values except 5.

For example, if I have [1,2,4], subsets sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

To exclude 5, I can remove 2 and include 3 and 4.

Then, [1,3,4] sums to 1,3,4,5,7.

Wait, still 5 is present.

Alternatively, [1,4], which sums to 1,4,5.

Still 5 is present.

Wait, in this case, it's hard to exclude 5 while covering other sums.

Maybe I need to include larger elements.

For example, [1,4,6], subsets sum to 1,4,5,6,7,10.

Missing 2,3,8,9.

So, not covering all sums up to n.

This isn't working.

Perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me consider that m is at most 25, and elements can be up to 10^9.

I can include larger elements to cover more sums.

For example, including n itself can help cover sums up to n, but I need to be careful with k.

Wait, if I include n, then any subsequence that includes n can sum to n, which might be allowed as long as k is not n.

But in the third test case, k=8 and n=8, so including 8 is not allowed, but in that case, the sequence is all 1's, summing up to 7, which is less than 8.

So, in that case, no subsequence sums to 8.

So, perhaps, when k=n, I can choose elements that sum to at most n-1.

Similarly, for other k, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Another idea is to include elements that are just enough to cover the required sums.

For example, if I include elements that cover all sums up to n except k, I need to ensure that the sums generated by the subsets exclude k.

This seems similar to the concept of a minimal generating set for the required sums.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k=1, then set all elements to be at least 2, and ensure that the sequence can sum up to n.

- If k=n, then ensure that the maximum sum of the sequence is n-1, so no subsequence can sum to n.

- For other k, include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This still seems vague.

Let me think about how to implement this.

One way is to start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For example, start with elements that are powers of 2 up to n, and then adjust to exclude k.

Wait, but in the earlier example, even with powers of 2, it's hard to exclude a specific sum.

Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that for k=1, setting all elements to be at least 2 works, as no subsequence can sum to 1.

Similarly, for k=n, choosing elements that sum to at most n-1 works.

For other k, it's trickier.

Perhaps I can divide the problem into cases based on the value of k relative to n.

Let me consider the following cases:

1. k=1:

- Set all elements to be at least 2.

- For example, [2,3,4,...], ensuring that sums cover from 2 to n.

2. k=n:

- Ensure that the maximum sum of the sequence is n-1.

- For example, include elements that sum to n-1, and none sum to n.

3. 1 < k < n:

- Need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, but can sum to all other v from 1 to n except k.

For case 1 (k=1), setting all elements to be at least 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and their sums can cover from 2 to n.

For case 2 (k=n), setting the sequence such that the maximum sum is n-1 ensures that no subsequence sums to n.

For case 3 (1 < k < n), it's more complicated.

In this case, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, but all other sums from 1 to n except k can be formed.

One idea is to include elements that can form all sums except k.

This might involve including elements that can cover the required sums in a way that avoids k.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider building the sequence step by step.

Start with an empty sequence and a set of achievable sums containing only 0.

Then, iteratively add elements such that each new element allows me to reach new sums, ensuring that k is never reachable.

But this seems time-consuming for large
