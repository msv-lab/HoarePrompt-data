Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific conditions related to subsequences and their sums. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me two integers, n and k. I need to create a sequence 'a' of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two main conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of 'a' that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there must be a subsequence of 'a' that sums up to v.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The problem also mentions that a solution always exists given the constraints, which is reassuring.

Let's consider what it means for a subsequence to sum up to a particular value. This is essentially a subset sum problem, where the order of elements in the sequence matters.

I need to ensure that every value from 1 to n, except k, can be achieved as a sum of some subsequence, and specifically, no subsequence sums up to k.

One approach to tackle this is to think about how to construct a set of numbers that can generate all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, their subsets can sum up to any number depending on their combination. For example, {1, 2, 4, 8} can sum up to any number from 1 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k and include sums for all other values up to n.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Output:

1

1

Here, the sequence is [1]. There's no subsequence that sums to 2, which is k. And there is a subsequence that sums to 1, which is v=1.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Here, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6]. There's no subsequence that sums to 1, which is k. But there are subsequences that sum to 2 through 6.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Sequence of seven 1's. No subsequence sums to 8, but all other sums from 1 to 7 are possible.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Sequence [7,1,4,1]. No subsequence sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, are possible.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Sequence [1,2,8,3]. No subsequence sums to 7, but all other sums from 1 to 10, except 7, are possible.

From these examples, I can see that the sequences provided satisfy the conditions, but I need to find a general way to construct such sequences for any given n and k.

Let me think about the properties required for the sequence 'a'.

First, the sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

This sounds similar to the subset sum problem, where we need to select a set of numbers that can form a certain set of sums.

However, there's an additional constraint: the sequence should not allow any subsequence to sum up to k.

Given that subsequences must maintain the order of elements, this adds a layer of complexity.

Wait, actually, the problem mentions "subsequence" but specifies that the order is maintained, without changing the order of the remaining elements. However, when considering sums, the order doesn't matter because addition is commutative. So perhaps the problem actually means subsets, not subsequences.

But the problem specifically says "subsequence," so I need to clarify this.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements."

But for sums, the order doesn't matter. So perhaps the problem allows for any subset, regardless of order.

However, the example provided uses sequences where the order is considered, but for sums, order is irrelevant.

I think there might be a confusion in the terminology here.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements."

But in the context of sums, since addition is commutative, the order shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering subsequences where the order is preserved, meaning that the elements in the subsequence must appear in the same order in the original sequence, but for sums, the order doesn't matter.

I think the key here is that the problem is about sums, and for sums, the order doesn't matter. So perhaps it's acceptable to treat subsequences as subsets for the purpose of sums.

Given that, I'll proceed by considering subsequences as subsets for the sum.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a set of numbers (with order, but since addition is commutative, order doesn't matter for sums) such that the subset sums cover all integers from 1 to n except for k.

Moreover, the sequence should have at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7, efficiency is important.

I need to find a way to construct such a sequence efficiently.

Let me consider the properties of subset sums.

If I have a set of numbers, the subset sums are all possible sums that can be formed by adding a subset of those numbers.

I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable, and that k is not achievable.

One way to approach this is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

However, directly constructing such a set might be tricky.

Another approach is to use the fact that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, their subset sums can generate any number up to the sum of all elements.

For example, {1, 2, 4, 8} can generate sums from 0 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude k and include all other sums up to n.

So, perhaps I can start with a set of powers of 2 up to some point, and then adjust the set to exclude k.

But I also have the constraint that the sequence should have at most 25 elements.

Given that 2^25 is over 33 million, which is larger than n's maximum of 10^6, using the first 20 powers of 2 would suffice to cover sums up to 10^6.

But I need to exclude k specifically.

Let me consider the total possible sums with a set of numbers.

If I have a set S, the subset sums are all possible sums of subsets of S.

I need to have all sums from 1 to n except k.

This means that the set of subset sums should be equal to {1,2,...,n} - {k}.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums cover [1,n] \ {k}.

I need to find a set S with at most 25 elements, where S is a sequence of non-negative integers, and the subset sums of S are exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, it's impractical to generate all possible subset sums explicitly for each test case.

I need a smarter way to construct the set S.

Let me consider the properties of the subset sums.

If I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s is at least n, but I need to exclude k.

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

I can start with a minimal set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

But how?

One way is to use the standard binary representation: include all powers of 2 up to the highest power that is less than or equal to n.

For example, to cover sums up to n=10, I can use {1,2,4,8}, which can sum up to 15, which is more than 10.

But I need to exclude k.

So, if k is in the subset sums, I need to modify the set to remove the possibility of summing to k.

One approach is to remove some elements that sum to k, but that might not be straightforward.

Another idea is to include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This means that for every v in [1,n] \ {k}, there exists at least one subset of S that sums to v, and no subset sums to k.

I need to find such a set S with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7, I need an efficient way to construct S.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements needed to generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

If I use the standard binary representation, I can cover sums up to 2^m - 1 with m elements.

But I need to exclude k, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then remove or adjust some elements to make k unachievable.

But removing elements might not be straightforward because it could affect other sums.

An alternative approach is to include elements in such a way that they cover all necessary sums without including k.

Let me consider specific cases to get an idea.

Case 1: n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

Subsequences:

- empty: sum 0

- [1]: sum 1

No subsequence sums to 2, which is k. And it sums to 1, which is v=1.

Case 2: n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

Subsequences:

- [2]: 2

- [3]: 3

- [4]: 4

- [5]: 5

- [6]: 6

- [2,3]: 5

- [2,4]: 6

- [3,4]: 7

- etc.

No subsequence sums to 1, which is k. And it covers sums from 2 to 6.

Wait, but in this sequence, sums can go beyond n=6, but the problem only requires covering sums up to n, except k.

So, as long as all v in [1,n] \ {k} are covered, and k is not covered, it's acceptable.

Another case: n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Subsequences:

- any number from 0 to 7 can be formed by selecting a subset of these 1's.

No subset sums to 8, which is k. And all other sums from 1 to 7 are possible.

This seems straightforward.

Another case: n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Possible subsets:

- [7]: 7

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1]:1

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [7,1,1]:9

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4]:12

- etc.

No subset sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, are possible.

This seems to work.

Another case: n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

Here, subsets can sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Wait, but k=7 should not be achievable, and indeed, there is no subset that sums to 7.

However, in the subset [1,2,3], the sum is 6, and [1,2,8,3] sums to 14, etc.

But according to the problem, for v=7, there should be no subsequence summing to 7, which is satisfied.

But looking closely, [1,2,3] sums to 6, and [1,2,8,3] sums to 14, but there is no subset summing to 7.

So, this sequence works for this test case.

From these examples, I can see that different strategies are used for different cases.

In the first case, a single element sufficed.

In the second case, multiple elements were needed.

In the third case, multiple 1's were used to cover sums up to 7.

In the fourth and fifth cases, a combination of elements was used to cover the required sums while excluding k.

I need to find a general approach to construct such sequences.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements required.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need to ensure that the sequence is not too large.

But 25 elements can cover sums up to 2^25 - 1, which is over 33 million, way more than n=10^6.

But the challenge is to exclude k while including all other sums up to n.

One idea is to use a standard set of powers of 2 up to the required sum, and then adjust for k.

For example, if I take the first m powers of 2 such that their sum is at least n, and then modify the set to exclude k.

But how?

Let me consider that the subset sums of {1,2,4,...,2^{m-1}} are all unique and cover from 0 to 2^m - 1.

If I can find a way to exclude only k from these sums, while keeping all others, that would solve the problem.

One way to exclude k is to remove k from the set, but that might not be sufficient because other subsets could still sum to k.

Wait, no, removing k would only prevent subsets that include k, but other subsets could still sum to k.

So that's not effective.

Another idea is to ensure that k cannot be formed by any subset.

One way to do this is to include elements in such a way that their subset sums cover everything except k.

This sounds tricky.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements needed.

If I can find a set S with subset sums equal to [1,n] \ {k}, then I'm done.

But finding such a set for arbitrary n and k seems non-trivial.

An alternative approach is to use the fact that with a set of elements, the subset sums form a certain set, and I need to craft this set to exclude only k.

I recall that if I have a set S, and I add a new element x, the new subset sums are the old subset sums plus the old subset sums each increased by x.

So, adding a new element extends the set of subset sums.

But how can I use this to exclude only k?

Perhaps I can start with a set that covers all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, start with powers of 2 up to n, which cover all sums from 0 to n.

Then, modify the set so that k cannot be formed.

But how?

One idea is to remove k from the set, but that might not be sufficient, as explained earlier.

Another idea is to include elements in such a way that their subset sums cover [1,n] except k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover [1,n] except k by carefully choosing them.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that covers [1, k-1] and [k+1, n], I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This seems circular; I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This means that for every v in [1,n] \ {k}, there exists at least one subset of S that sums to v, and no subset sums to k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of S are exactly [1,n] \ {k}.

This seems specific, and I need a general method to construct such a set S.

Let me consider the case when k=1.

If k=1, then I need to ensure that no subset sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are achievable.

In this case, I can choose a sequence where the smallest element is greater than 1, say starting from 2.

For example, [2,3,4,...] would cover sums from 2 upwards, and no subset sums to 1.

Similarly, for k=n, I need to ensure that no subset sums to n, but all other sums from 1 to n-1 are achievable.

This might require a different approach.

Wait, in the second test case, n=6 and k=1, the output is [2,3,4,5,6], which covers sums from 2 to 6, and no subset sums to 1.

This makes sense.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8 and k=8, the output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum up to anything from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

So, for k=8, using seven 1's allows sums from 0 to 7, which covers all v from 1 to 7, excluding k=8.

This is a valid solution.

In the fourth test case, n=9 and k=3, the output is [7,1,4,1], which covers sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=10 and k=7, the output is [1,2,8,3], which covers sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these examples, it seems that there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather, different strategies are used based on the values of n and k.

I need to find a general method that can handle any n and k within the constraints.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k=1, then I can choose a sequence starting from 2 upwards, ensuring that no subset sums to 1.

- If k=n, then I can choose a sequence that can sum up to n-1, but not n.

- For other values of k, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, but all other sums from 1 to n (except k) can be formed.

Wait, but in the third test case, k=8 and n=8, which is k=n, and the sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] can sum up to 7, which is n-1=7, and indeed, no subset sums to 8.

Similarly, in the first test case, k=2 and n=2, sequence [1], which can sum to 1, and not 2.

In the second test case, k=1 and n=6, sequence [2,3,4,5,6], which can sum to 2 through 6, excluding 1.

So, for k=1, choosing elements starting from 2 upwards works.

For k=n, choosing elements that can sum up to n-1, but not n, works.

But for general k, it's trickier.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of S should be equal to [1,n] \ {k}.

This seems specific, so perhaps I need to find a set S where the subset sums cover [1,n] \ {k}.

One way to approach this is to find a set S where the subset sums include all elements in [1,n] except k.

This is equivalent to finding a set S where the subset sums equal [1,n] \ {k}.

This is similar to the minimal number of elements required to generate a specific set of sums.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Identify that the subset sums of S should cover [1,n] \ {k}.

2. Find a set S with at most 25 elements that achieves this.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7, efficiency is crucial.

I need an approach that can handle large n efficiently.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can generate up to 2^m - 1 different non-empty subset sums.

Given that m <=25, 2^25 -1 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

So, in terms of the number of elements, it's feasible.

But I need to ensure that the subset sums cover exactly [1,n] \ {k}.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to use the fact that the subset sums of a set of integers form a certain structure.

I need to find a set S where the subset sums include all v in [1,n] except k.

One way to think about this is to include elements that allow generating all sums except k.

But how?

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude k.

But how can I modify it to exclude only k?

One idea is to remove k from the set if it's present, but that might not be sufficient.

Another idea is to include elements in such a way that their subset sums cover [1,n] except k.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This means that for every v in [1,n] \ {k}, there exists at least one subset of S that sums to v, and no subset sums to k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of S are exactly [1,n] \ {k}.

This seems specific, so perhaps I need to find a set S where the subset sums are exactly [1,n] \ {k}.

This sounds difficult, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula to construct such a set.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I adjust it to exclude k.

One way to do this is to remove some elements from S in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can still be formed.

But this might not be straightforward.

Another idea is to include elements that cover all necessary sums except k.

For example, if k is not a power of 2, I can include powers of 2 up to n, and adjust accordingly.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I add an element that makes k unachievable.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps
