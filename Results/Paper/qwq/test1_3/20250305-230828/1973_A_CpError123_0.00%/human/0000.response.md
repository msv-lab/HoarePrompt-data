Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or determine if the scores are impossible.

First, I need to understand the scoring system. Each game contributes either 2 points in total (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw, since both get 1 point). So, regardless of the outcome, each game adds 2 points to the total points accumulated by all players.

Given that, the total points p1 + p2 + p3 must be even because each game contributes 2 points. So, if the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, it's impossible, and I should return -1.

Next, I need to think about how to maximize the number of draws. A draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a game with a winner and a loser. But in terms of individual scores, a draw increases both players' scores by 1, while a game with a winner increases one player's score by 2.

To maximize draws, I should minimize the number of games with a winner and a loser. However, I need to satisfy the given scores p1, p2, and p3.

Let me consider the total number of games played. Since each game contributes 2 points to the total, the total number of games is (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

But I need to ensure that the distribution of points among the players is possible given the constraints of how points are awarded.

Let me think about the possible pairs that can play against each other. There are three friends, so there are three possible pairs: pair AB, pair AC, and pair BC.

Each pair can play any number of games, including zero.

I need to assign a number of games to each pair, with the outcomes being either a win for one player or a draw.

Let’s denote:

- n_AB: number of games between A and B

- n_AC: number of games between A and C

- n_BC: number of games between B and C

For each pair, in each game, either there is a winner and a loser, or a draw.

Let’s denote:

- For pair AB:

- a_AB: number of games A wins

- b_AB: number of games B wins

- d_AB: number of draws

- Similarly for n_AC = a_AC + b_AC + d_AC

- And for n_BC = a_BC + b_BC + d_BC

But this seems too detailed. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let’s think in terms of the total number of draws.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each player involved in the draw.

Each game with a winner contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

I need to maximize the number of draws while still achieving the given scores.

Let me consider the total points again.

Total points = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2 * total number of games.

So, total number of games = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, in terms of draws, each draw is a game that contributes 2 points to the total, just like a game with a winner and a loser.

But to maximize draws, I need to have as many draws as possible.

However, the scores constrain how many draws can happen.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have d draws in total.

Each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point.

So, for d draws, there are 2d points distributed among the players involved in these draws.

The remaining games are games with a winner and a loser.

Let’s denote w as the number of games with a winner.

Each such game contributes 2 points to the winner.

So, total points = 2w + 2d.

But total points = p1 + p2 + p3.

So, 2w + 2d = p1 + p2 + p3.

Simplify: w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

This is consistent with the total number of games.

Now, I need to maximize d, so I need to minimize w.

But there are constraints based on the individual scores.

Let’s consider the maximum possible d.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

What's the minimum w can be?

Well, w needs to be such that the differences in scores can be achieved.

Wait, p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

If I have only draws, then all players would have the same score, which is impossible unless p1 = p2 = p3.

But in that case, it's possible only if p1 = p2 = p3 and p1 is even, because each draw adds 1 to two players.

Wait, in the example, (0,0,0) is possible with 0 games, which is fine.

(0,1,1): let's see, total points is 2, so total games is 1.

If they play one game, which is a draw between player 2 and 3, then p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, which matches.

(1,1,1): total points is 3, which is odd, so impossible.

Wait, but in the example, it's -1, which matches.

(1,1,2): total points is 4, total games is 2.

Is it possible to have p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Let me see.

Possible scenario:

- Game 1: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw -> p2=1, p3=1

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins -> p1=1, p3=2

Total: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches.

Number of draws is 1.

But the program says 2, which seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the program, for (1,1,2), it calculates egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1) = 4 - 2*(2-1) - 2*(2-1) = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0.

Then, egalites // 2 = 0, but in reality, there was 1 draw.

So, maybe the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit the formula.

Looking back at the program:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites // 2.

In the case of (1,1,2), total_points = 4

p3 - p2 = 1

p3 - p1 = 1

So, egalites = 4 - 2*1 - 2*1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0

But in reality, there was 1 draw.

So, the formula seems incorrect.

Another example: (3,3,3)

total_points = 9, which is odd, so -1, which is correct.

(3,4,5)

total_points = 12

p3 - p2 = 1

p3 - p1 = 2

egalites = 12 - 2*1 - 2*2 = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6

6 // 2 = 3

But in the example, it's 6, but according to the output, it's 6.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's 6, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier case, it seemed off.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the formula better.

Let me try to derive a correct formula.

Let’s denote:

- d: total number of draws

- w: total number of games with a winner

We have:

- Total games: g = d + w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Total points from draws: 2d (since each draw contributes 2 points)

Total points from games with a winner: 2w (since each such game contributes 2 points to the winner)

So, total points = 2d + 2w = p1 + p2 + p3

Which is consistent.

But I need to maximize d.

However, there are constraints on how the points are distributed.

Let me consider the differences in scores.

Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, player 3 has the highest score, player 1 has the lowest.

The maximum number of draws would occur if as many games as possible end in draws, but still achieve the required score differences.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w, but w has to be enough to account for the differences in scores.

Wait, in a draw, two players each get 1 point, so it doesn't contribute to the differences in scores.

In a game with a winner, one player gets 2 points, the other gets 0, which increases the difference in scores.

Therefore, to minimize w, I need to maximize d, but d is limited by the need to achieve the score differences.

Let me think about the minimal number of games with a winner needed to achieve the score differences.

The differences are p2 - p1 and p3 - p2.

Wait, more precisely, p3 - p1, p3 - p2, and p2 - p1.

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the largest difference is p3 - p1.

To achieve a difference of p3 - p1 between player 3 and player 1, the minimal number of games with a winner involving these players is ceil((p3 - p1)/2), because each winning game can increase the difference by 2 points (if player 3 wins against player 1) or by 2 points in the opposite direction, but since p3 > p1, we need player 3 to win enough games to make up the difference.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal number of winning games needed to achieve the score differences.

Let me consider that.

To achieve p3 - p1, assuming that all winning games are between player 3 and player 1, each such game increases p3 by 2 and p1 by 0, so the difference increases by 2 per game.

Similarly, games between player 3 and player 2 increase p3 by 2 and p2 by 0, so difference between p3 and p2 increases by 2 per game.

Games between player 2 and player 1 increase p2 by 2 and p1 by 0, so difference between p2 and p1 increases by 2 per game.

Draws between any two players do not change the differences.

Therefore, to achieve the differences p3 - p2 and p2 - p1, the minimal number of winning games is ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2).

But since the number of games must be integer, and each winning game can only contribute up to 2 points difference, this seems reasonable.

Wait, but in the example (1,1,2), p3 - p2 = 1 -1 =0, p2 - p1 =1 -1=0, but p3 - p1=2-1=1.

Wait, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So p3 - p2 =1, p2 - p1=0.

So minimal number of winning games is ceil(1/2)=1, plus ceil(0/2)=0, so total w=1.

Total games g = (1+1+2)/2=2.

So d = g - w =2 -1=1, which matches the earlier example where there was 1 draw.

But according to the program, it calculates egalites=total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)=4 -2*1 -2*1=4-2-2=0, then 0//2=0, which is incorrect.

So the formula in the program seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to calculate something else.

Let me look back at the program.

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Wait, perhaps it's a miscalculation.

Let me compute it again.

p1=1, p2=1, p3=2

total_points=4

p3 - p2=1

p3 - p1=1

egalites=4 -2*1 -2*1=4-2-2=0

But in reality, there was 1 draw.

So, the formula is incorrect.

Let me try to find a correct formula.

Given that w >= ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

And g = w + d = total_points / 2

So d = g - w

To maximize d, we need to minimize w, which is w = ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

Therefore, d = g - w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - ceil((p3 - p2)/2) - ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

But I need to implement this correctly.

Alternatively, since p1 <= p2 <= p3, I can think in terms of the minimal number of winning games needed to achieve the differences.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, check if total_points is even; if not, return -1.

Then, compute w = ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

Then, d = g - w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

But I need to ensure that d >= 0; if not, it's impossible.

Also, need to ensure that the distribution is possible.

Wait, in the example (1,1,2), w=1 (ceil(1/2)+ceil(0/2)=1+0=1), g=2, so d=1, which matches the earlier reasoning.

In the program, it calculates egalites=total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)=4 -2*1 -2*1=0, then 0//2=0, which is wrong.

So, the formula used in the program is incorrect.

Let me see what the program does for (3,4,5):

p1=3, p2=4, p3=5

total_points=12

p3 - p2=1, p3 - p1=2

egalites=12 -2*1 -2*2=12-2-4=6, then 6//2=3

But according to the output, it's 6, which seems inconsistent with the earlier case.

Wait, in the output, for (3,4,5), it's 6, but according to the program, it would be 3.

But in the example output, it's 6.

So, the program's output is different from the example output for (3,4,5).

Wait, perhaps I need to check the program's logic again.

Wait, in the program, it's:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites // 2

For (3,4,5):

total_points=12

p3 - p2=1

p3 - p1=2

egalites=12 -2*1 -2*2=12-2-4=6

6//2=3

But in the example output, it's 6.

So, the program's output is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what the correct answer should be.

In the example, for (3,4,5), the output is 6.

But according to the program, it calculates 3.

So, either the program is wrong or the example output is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the correct answer for (3,4,5).

Let me try to see how to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Total points: 12, so total games: 6.

To maximize draws, minimize the number of winning games.

Differences:

p3 - p2=1

p2 - p1=1

So, minimal w = ceil(1/2) + ceil(1/2)=1 +1=2

Therefore, d = 6 - 2 =4

But the program outputs 6, and the example output is 6.

So, either the program is wrong or the example output is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the maximum number of draws is when as many games as possible are draws, but still achieving the required differences.

In this case, with p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, total games=6.

If I have 6 draws, that would mean all 6 games are draws, so each player plays some number of draws, but in that case, scores would be even, which is not the case here.

Wait, but in draws, two players get 1 point each.

So, if all 6 games are draws, each player would have a score equal to the number of draws they participated in.

But with three players, if all 6 games are draws, it's not possible because each pair can play multiple games.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose:

- Player A and B play x games, all draws -> A gets x points, B gets x points

- Player A and C play y games, all draws -> A gets y points, C gets y points

- Player B and C play z games, all draws -> B gets z points, C gets z points

So, total points:

p1 = x + y

p2 = x + z

p3 = y + z

Given p1=3, p2=4, p3=5

So:

x + y = 3

x + z = 4

y + z = 5

We can solve these equations:

From first two equations: z = 4 - x, y = 3 - x

Plug into third equation: (3 - x) + (4 - x) = 5 => 7 - 2x =5 => 2x=2 => x=1

Then y=2, z=3

So, x=1, y=2, z=3

Total draws: x + y + z =1 +2 +3=6

Which matches the example output of 6.

But according to my earlier calculation, w should be at least 2, so d=4.

But in this case, all games are draws, which seems possible.

Wait, but in this scenario, all games are draws, and the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption about w was incorrect.

Let me see.

In this case, p3 - p2=1, p2 - p1=1.

But with all draws, the differences should be even, but here they are odd.

Wait, but in this specific distribution, it's possible to have p3 - p2=1.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption that w needs to be at least ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2) is incorrect.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that draws don't affect the differences, but actually, they do, because draws between certain pairs can influence the differences.

Wait, no, draws between two players increase both their scores by 1, so they don't change the difference between their scores.

Wait, actually, draws between two players don't change the difference in their scores.

For example, if two players draw, their score difference remains the same.

Winning games are the ones that change the differences.

So, to achieve a certain difference, I need a certain number of winning games.

Therefore, the minimal number of winning games is the ceiling of the total required difference divided by 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the minimal number of winning games required to achieve the differences.

Given that p3 - p2 =1 and p2 - p1=1, the total difference is 2.

Each winning game can increase a difference by 2.

So, to achieve a total difference of 2, I need at least 1 winning game.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I had w=1, but in reality, in the example, all games can be draws, which seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal number of winning games needed to achieve the differences.

In this case, since p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, total difference is 2.

Each winning game can create a difference of 2.

So, I need at least 1 winning game to create a difference of 2.

But in the example, it's possible with all draws, which suggests that perhaps the differences can be achieved without winning games, depending on how draws are distributed.

Wait, but in the earlier case with p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, total difference is 1, which is odd, but differences are achieved with 1 winning game and 1 draw.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is ceil((p3 - p1)/2), because p3 - p1 is the overall difference between the highest and lowest scores.

In the case of p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, p3 - p1=1, so ceil(1/2)=1 winning game.

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p3 - p1=2, so ceil(2/2)=1 winning game.

But in the example, it's possible with all draws, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p3 - p1=2, which could be achieved with 1 winning game, but in the example, it's possible with all draws.

Wait, but in that specific distribution, with x=1, y=2, z=3 draws, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Maybe the minimal number of winning games is not ceil((p3 - p1)/2), but something else.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is the sum of ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2).

In the case of p1=1, p2=1, p3=2:

ceil((2-1)/2)=1

ceil((1-1)/2)=0

Total w=1

Then d=g - w=2 -1=1, which matches the earlier example.

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

ceil((5-4)/2)=1

ceil((4-3)/2)=1

Total w=2

Then d=g - w=6 -2=4

But according to the example, it's possible to have d=6.

Wait, but in that case, d=6, which is greater than g - w=4, which seems impossible.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula in the program is trying to calculate something else.

Looking back at the program:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites // 2

In the case of (3,4,5):

egalites=12 -2*1 -2*2=6

6//2=3

But according to the earlier calculation, d should be 4, but the program outputs 3.

But in the example, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps the program is wrong.

Let me see another test case.

Take (0,0,0):

total_points=0

p3 - p2=0 -0=0

p3 - p1=0 -0=0

egalites=0 -0 -0=0

0//2=0, which matches the example output of 0.

Another test case: (0,1,1):

total_points=2

p3 - p2=1-1=0

p3 - p1=1-0=1

egalites=2 -0 -2=0

0//2=0

But in the example, it's 1.

So, again, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a better formula.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in the case where all games are draws, the scores would be such that p1 + p2 + p3 = 2 * number of games, and p1, p2, p3 are such that p1 + p2 + p3 is even, and p1 <= p2 <= p3.

But to maximize the number of draws, I need to see how many games can be draws while still achieving the required differences.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the minimal number of winning games is the number needed to achieve the differences, and the rest can be draws.

So, minimal w is the minimal number of winning games needed to achieve the differences.

In that case, w = ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

Then, d = g - w

In the case of (1,1,2):

w =1 +0=1

d=2-1=1, which matches.

In the case of (3,4,5):

w=1 +1=2

d=6-2=4

But according to the example, it's 6, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, in the case of (3,4,5), is it possible to have d=6?

If d=6, then all games are draws, but in that case, p1 + p2 + p3 should be equal to 2*6=12, which matches, but the individual scores should be p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

If all 6 games are draws, then each player's score is equal to the number of draws they participated in.

Let’s say:

- Player A and B draw x times -> A gets x points, B gets x points

- Player A and C draw y times -> A gets y points, C gets y points

- Player B and C draw z times -> B gets z points, C gets z points

With x + y + z =6

And p1= x + y =3

p2= x + z =4

p3= y + z =5

Solving these equations:

From p1= x + y =3

From p2= x + z =4

From p3= y + z =5

Subtract p1 from p2: (x + z) - (x + y) =4 -3 => z - y =1 => z = y +1

Plug into p3: y + z = y + (y +1) =2y +1=5 => 2y=4 => y=2

Then z=3

Then from p1: x + y =3 => x +2=3 => x=1

So, x=1, y=2, z=3

Thus, all 6 games are draws, distributed as above, achieving p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Therefore, d=6 is possible.

But according to my earlier formula, w=2, d=4, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps my formula for w is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is the number needed to achieve the required differences.

In this case, p3 - p2=1, p2 - p1=1

Each winning game can increase a difference by 2.

So, to achieve a total difference of 2, I need at least 1 winning game.

But in reality, in this scenario, it's possible with all draws, which suggests that perhaps the differences can be achieved without any winning games, depending on how draws are distributed.

Wait, but in this case, with all draws, the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws among the pairs.

So, perhaps the minimal number of winning games is zero, and d=6 is possible.

But according to my earlier formula, w=2, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is the sum of ceil((p3 - p2)/2) and ceil((p2 - p1)/2), but in this case, ceil(1/2)+ceil(1/2)=1+1=2, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in reality, it's possible with w=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that draws don't affect the differences.

Wait, actually, draws between two players don't change the difference in their scores.

So, to achieve p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, I need to have winning games that create these differences.

But in the scenario with all draws, the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws.

Wait, in the earlier solution, with x=1, y=2, z=3, p1=x+y=1+2=3, p2=x+z=1+3=4, p3=y+z=2+3=5.

So, the differences are achieved by the distribution of draws.

So, perhaps I don't need any winning games in this case.

Therefore, my earlier assumption that w=ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2) is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to calculate the minimal number of winning games.

Let me think about it differently.

Let’s consider that the minimal number of winning games is the number needed to achieve the required differences, considering that each winning game can increase one difference by 2.

In the case of p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, total difference is 2.

Each winning game can contribute up to 2 to the total difference.

So, minimal w = ceil(total_difference / 2) = ceil(2/2)=1.

But in reality, in the example, it's possible with w=0.

Wait, but in that case, the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that draws can be arranged in such a way that the differences are achieved without any winning games.

So, perhaps the minimal w is zero, and d can be up to the total number of games, if it's possible to achieve the differences through the distribution of draws.

In that case, I need to check if the differences can be achieved solely through draws.

But in draws, the differences remain the same as they were before, since draws don't change the differences.

Wait, actually, draws between certain pairs can influence the differences.

Wait, no, draws between two players increase both their scores by 1, so the difference between them remains the same.

So, draws don't change the differences between the players' scores.

Therefore, to achieve a certain difference, I need a certain number of winning games.

In the earlier case, with p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, differences are p3 - p2=1, p2 - p1=1.

To achieve these differences, I need to have winning games that create these differences.

Each winning game can increase one difference by 2.

So, to achieve a total difference of 2, I need at least 1 winning game.

But in the example, it's possible with all draws, which suggests that perhaps the differences can be achieved through the arrangement of draws.

Wait, but in reality, in that specific arrangement, the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws among the pairs.

So, perhaps my initial approach is flawed.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is the sum of ceil((p3 - p2)/2) and ceil((p2 - p1)/2).

In the case of p1=1, p2=1, p3=2:

ceil(1/2)+ceil(0/2)=1+0=1

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

ceil(1/2)+ceil(1/2)=1+1=2

But in reality, in the second case, it's possible with w=0.

So, this formula is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that if p3 - p2 and p2 - p1 are both even or both odd, then w can be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, in the case of p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, both are odd, and w=1 is sufficient.

But in the earlier calculation, it was w=2, which is incorrect.

I'm getting confused.

Let me look for another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of winning games is the maximum of ceil((p3 - p2)/2) and ceil((p2 - p1)/2).

In the case of p1=1, p2=1, p3=2:

max(ceil(1/2), ceil(0/2))=max(1,0)=1

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

max(ceil(1/2), ceil(1/2))=1

Then, d=g - w=6 -1=5

But in reality, d=6 is possible, so this is still incorrect.

Perhaps I need to set w to the sum of floor((p3 - p2)/2) + floor((p2 - p1)/2).

In the first case: floor(1/2)+floor(0/2)=0+0=0

Then d=g - w=2 -0=2

But in reality, d=1.

So, still incorrect.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different way to approach this.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible are draws, while still achieving the required scores.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

The minimal w is the minimal number of winning games needed to achieve the required differences.

Each winning game can increase one difference by 2.

So, the minimal w is ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

In the case of p1=1, p2=1, p3=2:

ceil(1/2)+ceil(0/2)=1+0=1

Then d=g - w=2 -1=1

Which matches the earlier example.

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

ceil(1/2)+ceil(1/2)=1+1=2

Then d=g - w=6 -2=4

But according to the example, d=6 is possible.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula for minimal w is not correct.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have p1, p2, p3 sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to have certain games where one player wins to achieve the required differences.

Each winning game increases the difference between the winner and the loser by 2.

So, to achieve p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, I need to have winning games that create these differences.

But in the case where p3 - p2=1 and p2 - p1=1, it's impossible to achieve with integer values because each winning game changes the difference by 2, which is greater than the required differences.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with all draws and specific distribution, it's possible to have p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, perhaps the differences can be achieved through the arrangement of draws alone, without any winning games.

Wait, but in reality, in that case, the differences are achieved through the distribution of draws among the pairs.

So, perhaps I need to check if the differences can be achieved solely through draws.

But draws don't change the differences; they keep the differences the same.

Wait, actually, draws between certain pairs can influence the differences.

Wait, no, draws between two players increase both their scores by 1, so the difference between them remains the same.

Therefore, draws don't affect the differences.

So, to achieve a difference of p3 - p2=1, I need to have winning games that create this difference.

But since each winning game changes the difference by 2, to achieve a difference of 1, which is odd, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it's possible with all draws, which suggests that perhaps the differences can be achieved without winning games.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider that in the case where all games are draws, the differences should be zero, but in the example, differences are 1 and 1, yet it's possible.

Wait, no, in the case where all games are draws, the differences can be non-zero, depending on how the draws are distributed among the pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it as a system of equations.

Let’s denote:

- n_AB: number of games between A and B

- n_AC: number of games between A and C

- n_BC: number of games between B and C

Each game can be either a draw or have a winner.

Let’s denote:

- d_AB: number of draws between A and B

- w_AB_a: number of wins for A in AB games

- w_AB_b: number of wins for B in AB games

Similarly for AC and BC.

But this seems too detailed.

Alternatively, let’s consider that in AB games:

- Each draw contributes 1 point to A and 1 to B

- Each win for A contributes 2 to A and 0 to B

- Each win for B contributes 0 to A and 2 to B

Similarly for AC and BC games.

Given that, I can set up equations for p1, p2, p3 in terms of the variables for each type of game.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that p1 = d_AB + d_AC + w_AC*2 + w_BC*0

Wait, more precisely:

p1 = d_AB + d_AC + w_AC*2 + w_BC*0

p2 = d_AB + d_BC + w_BC*2 + w_AB*2

Wait, perhaps I need to define more carefully.

Let me define:

- For AB games:

- d_AB: draws, contributing 1 to A and 1 to B

- w_AB_a: A wins, contributing 2 to A and 0 to B

- w_AB_b: B wins, contributing 0 to A and 2 to B

Similarly for AC and BC.

Then:

p1 = d_AB + d_AC + 2*(w_AC_a + w_AB_a)

p2 = d_AB + d_BC + 2*(w_BC_b + w_AB_b)

p3 = d_AC + d_BC + 2*(w_BC_a + w_AC_c)

Wait, assuming that w_AC_a is A's wins against C, etc.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to find a better way.

Let me look back at the example.

In the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, with all games being draws:

- n_AB draws: a points to A and B

- n_AC draws: c points to A and C

- n_BC draws: b points to B and C

Then:

p1 = n_AB + n_AC =3

p2 = n_AB + n_BC =4

p3 = n_AC + n_BC =5

Solving:

From p1: n_AB + n_AC =3

From p2: n_AB + n_BC =4

From p3: n_AC + n_BC =5

Adding all: 2*(n_AB + n_AC + n_BC) =12 => n_AB + n_AC + n_BC =6

From p1: n_AB + n_AC =3 => n_BC =6 -3=3

From p2: n_AB + n_BC =4 => n_AB =4 -3=1

From p3: n_AC + n_BC =5 => n_AC =5 -3=2

So, n_AB=1, n_AC=2, n_BC=3

Total draws: n_AB + n_AC + n_BC =6

Which matches the example output of 6.

So, in this case, d=6 is possible.

But according to my earlier formula, w=2, d=4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, my earlier formula is wrong.

I need to find a better way to calculate the minimal w.

Let me consider that w is the number of games that are not draws.

Wait, no, w is the number of games with a winner.

Each such game contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Whereas draws contribute 1 point to each player.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that d can be up to the total number of games, but I need to ensure that the differences are achieved.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize d such that p1, p2, p3 can be achieved.

Let me consider that d can be up to the minimal of p1, p2, p3.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that d can be up to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, but adjusted for the differences.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in the case where all games are draws, d = n_AB + n_AC + n_BC, and p1 = n_AB + n_AC, p2 = n_AB + n_BC, p3 = n_AC + n_BC.

This system can be solved to find n_AB, n_AC, n_BC.

If all n_AB, n_AC, n_BC are non-negative integers, then d = n_AB + n_AC + n_BC is possible.

In this case, d is maximized.

So, perhaps the maximum d is equal to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, provided that the system of equations has non-negative integer solutions.

But in reality, d can be less than that, but we want to maximize it.

Wait, actually, in the case where all games are draws, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, which is the total number of games.

But in other cases, if there are winning games, d is less than that.

So, to maximize d, we need to set d as high as possible, which is (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, provided that the system of equations has non-negative integer solutions.

Therefore, the maximum d is (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, if the system has a solution, else -1.

In the earlier example, (3,4,5), d=6 is possible,
