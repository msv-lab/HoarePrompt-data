Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have coins in their wallets and they take turns performing certain actions. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, starting with Alice. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the key points are:

1. Players take turns, starting with Alice.

2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.

3. After choosing, they remove one coin from their current wallet.

4. The player who can't make a move loses.

I need to determine, for given values of a and b, who will win the game if both play optimally.

First, I should think about the base cases.

Consider when a = 1 and b = 1.

- Alice's turn: She can choose not to swap. Then a becomes 0, b remains 1.

- Bob's turn: He must choose not to swap because swapping would mean taking an empty wallet, which is not allowed since he has to remove a coin. So he doesn't swap, removes one coin, a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: Both wallets are empty, so she can't make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

Another case: a = 1, b = 4.

- Alice's turn: She can choose to swap. Then a=4, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He can choose to swap. Then a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: She chooses not to swap. a=0, b=3.

- Bob's turn: He must not swap. a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: She swaps. a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He must not swap. a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Wait, in the example provided, for a=1, b=4, it says Alice wins. But in my simulation, Bob wins. Maybe I did something wrong.

Let me try again.

- Alice starts with a=1, b=4.

- Alice chooses to swap: now a=4, b=1.

- Bob's turn: he can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: she can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: swaps or not.

- This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Perhaps I should look for a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the winner without simulating every move, especially since a and b can be up to 10^9, which would make any simulation too slow.

I recall that in game theory, especially in impartial games, the concept of Nimbers or the XOR of the game states can determine the winner. But I'm not sure if this applies here directly.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory.

This seems like an impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them at each step, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in this game, the moves depend on the current state of a and b, and the choice to swap or not.

I need to find a way to determine the winning strategy based on a and b.

Looking at the example outputs:

- For a=1, b=1: Bob wins.

- a=1, b=4: Alice wins.

- a=5, b=3: Bob wins.

- a=4, b=5: Alice wins.

- a=11, b=9: Bob wins.

- a=83, b=91: Bob wins.

- a=1032, b=9307: Alice wins.

- a=839204, b=7281: Alice wins.

- a=1000000000, b=1000000000: Bob wins.

- a=53110, b=2024: Bob wins.

Looking for a pattern:

Looking at the sums of a and b:

- 1+1=2: Bob wins.

- 1+4=5: Alice wins.

- 5+3=8: Bob wins.

- 4+5=9: Alice wins.

- 11+9=20: Bob wins.

- 83+91=174: Bob wins.

- 1032+9307=10339: Alice wins.

- 839204+7281=846485: Alice wins.

- 1000000000+1000000000=2000000000: Bob wins.

- 53110+2024=55134: Bob wins.

Looking at the sums:

- When the sum is even, Bob wins mostly.

- When the sum is odd, Alice wins.

But wait:

- a=1, b=4: sum=5 (odd), Alice wins.

- a=5, b=3: sum=8 (even), Bob wins.

- a=4, b=5: sum=9 (odd), Alice wins.

- a=11, b=9: sum=20 (even), Bob wins.

- a=83, b=91: sum=174 (even), Bob wins.

- a=1032, b=9307: sum=10339 (odd), Alice wins.

- a=839204, b=7281: sum=846485 (odd), Alice wins.

- a=1000000000, b=1000000000: sum=2000000000 (even), Bob wins.

- a=53110, b=2024: sum=55134 (even), Bob wins.

So, it seems that when the sum is even, Bob wins, and when the sum is odd, Alice wins.

But in the first case, a=1, b=1: sum=2 (even), Bob wins.

a=1, b=4: sum=5 (odd), Alice wins.

a=5, b=3: sum=8 (even), Bob wins.

a=4, b=5: sum=9 (odd), Alice wins.

a=11, b=9: sum=20 (even), Bob wins.

a=83, b=91: sum=174 (even), Bob wins.

a=1032, b=9307: sum=10339 (odd), Alice wins.

a=839204, b=7281: sum=846485 (odd), Alice wins.

a=1000000000, b=1000000000: sum=2000000000 (even), Bob wins.

a=53110, b=2024: sum=55134 (even), Bob wins.

This seems consistent. So, perhaps the winner can be determined solely based on whether the sum of a and b is even or odd.

If sum is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

But in the first test case, a=1, b=1: sum=2 (even), Bob wins.

In the second test case, a=1, b=4: sum=5 (odd), Alice wins.

This matches the pattern.

So, perhaps the program is correct if it outputs 'Bob' when a+b is even, and 'Alice' when a+b is odd.

Looking at the provided program:

def func_1(a, b):

if (a + b) % 2 == 0:

return 'Bob'

else:

return 'Alice'

def func_2():

t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))

results = []

for _ in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())

winner = func_1(a, b)

results.append(winner)

for result in results:

print(result)

This seems to implement exactly that: check if a+b is even, return 'Bob', else 'Alice'.

Given that the examples provided match this logic, it seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1: a=1, b=1 -> sum=2 (even) -> Bob wins. As in the first example.

Edge case 2: a=1, b=2 -> sum=3 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Yes, matches the pattern.

Another edge case: a=2, b=2 -> sum=4 (even) -> Bob wins.

Simulation:

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, matches the pattern.

One more: a=3, b=2 -> sum=5 (odd) -> Alice wins.

Simulation:

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: chooses not to swap. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap. a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Consistent.

It seems that the sum being even or odd determines the winner.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Bob}} \]
