Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board, and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers. For example, if n=12, the original numbers are 1 to 12, and after replacing each with the sum of its digits, they become 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, and their sum is 51.

Okay, so the task is to compute this sum for multiple test cases efficiently, given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, with a tight time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

First, I need to understand what the sum of the digits of a number is. For any integer, the sum of its digits is just adding up each individual digit. For example, 12 has digits 1 and 2, so sum is 3; 15 has 1 and 5, sum is 6; and so on.

Now, since n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this sum for multiple n's without timing out.

One straightforward approach is to precompute the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 2*10^5 and store them in an array. Then, for each test case, I can just sum up the precomputed sums up to n.

Let me think about that. If I create an array A where A[i] is the sum of digits of (i+1), since indexing starts from 0. Then, to get the total sum for n, I can sum A[0] to A[n-1].

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems like they are precomputing the cumulative sum. Let's look at the code.

The code initializes an empty list A and a variable sum set to 0. Then, it loops from 1 to 200000, computes the sum of digits of each number using func_1, adds it to sum, appends sum to A, and repeats.

So, A[n-1] holds the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and prints A[n-1].

That seems correct.

Now, let's verify with the example given. For n=12, the cumulative sum should be 51, as shown in the example.

Let me check if func_1 correctly computes the sum of digits.

Func_1 takes a number, initializes a=0, and in a loop, adds the last digit (num % 10) to a and removes the last digit (num = num // 10), until num becomes 0. This is a standard way to compute the sum of digits.

So, for num=12, sum of digits is 1+2=3, which is correct.

Now, in the loop from 1 to 200000, it computes the sum of digits for each number and keeps adding it to sum, and appends sum to A.

So, A[n-1] should indeed be the total sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

Seems correct.

But, I need to make sure that this approach is efficient enough. Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, precomputing the cumulative sum once and then answering each test case in O(1) time is efficient.

Also, the time limit is tight at 0.5 seconds per test, but since precomputation is done only once, and each test case is just a list lookup, it should be fine.

Let me think about possible optimizations or potential issues.

First, the precomputation loop runs 200,000 times, and each func_1 call involves a loop that runs for the number of digits in the number, which for n=2*10^5 is at most 6 digits.

So, overall, the precomputation is O(2*10^5 * 6) = O(10^6), which is acceptable.

Then, for t=10^4 test cases, each answered in O(1) time, total time should be fine within 0.5 seconds.

Another thing to consider is the memory usage. A list of size 2*10^5 to store integers should be fine.

Now, let's check the example input and output to verify.

Input:

7

12

1

2

3

1434

2024

200000

Output:

51

1

3

6

18465

28170

4600002

Let's verify for n=1:

Sum of digits of 1 is 1, so sum is 1.

For n=2:

Sum of digits of 1 and 2 are 1 and 2, sum is 3.

For n=3:

Sum of digits of 1,2,3 are 1,2,3, sum is 6.

These match the output.

For n=1434, sum is 18465, which seems correct based on the example.

Similarly for n=2024 and n=200000.

So, the logic seems sound.

Is there any edge case that might fail?

Let's think about n=1, which is the smallest n, and it's handled correctly.

n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=3

n=9: sum=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45

n=10: sum=45 + 1=46 (since 10's digits sum to 1)

n=11: sum=46 + 2=48

n=12: sum=48 + 3=51, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Also, for n=200000, the sum is 4600002, which seems plausible.

Now, is there any potential error in the code?

Looking at the code:

A = []

sum = 0

for i in range(1, 200001):

a = func_1(i)

sum = sum + a

A.append(sum)

for t in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):

a = 0

while num != 0:

a = a + num % 10

num = int(num / 10)

return a

Seems straightforward.

One thing to note is that using 'sum' as a variable name is not recommended because it's a built-in function in Python, but in this case, it's just a loop variable, so it should be fine.

Also, in func_1, num = int(num / 10) can be written as num //= 10 for integer division, but it's equivalent.

Another thing is that the precomputation is done outside of any function, which is fine for this context.

Is there any potential integer overflow or performance issue? Given the constraints, integers in Python can handle large values, so no issues there.

Also, since the precomputation is done only once, and then each test case is answered quickly, it should be efficient enough.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
