Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My task is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for "minimum excluded," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array up to that point. For example, MEX of [1,2,3] is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list. MEX of [3,1,0] is 2 because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in p. Also, MEX(p_1 to p_i) is always between 0 and n, inclusive, because it's the smallest non-negative integer not in the first i elements of p.

Given that, a_i can range from -n to n, but in practice, it's constrained by the values of MEX and p_i.

I need to find p such that for each i, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

I need to find a way to reconstruct p from a.

Let me consider the properties of MEX and how it changes as we add elements to the permutation.

Let's think about building the permutation step by step.

Suppose I have the first i elements of p: p_1, p_2, ..., p_i.

The MEX of these elements is the smallest non-negative integer not in this list.

Then a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

I need to find p_i such that this equation holds.

Rearranging, p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

But MEX(p_1 to p_i) depends on the values of p_1 to p_i, which includes p_i itself.

This seems a bit circular. Maybe I need to find a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array a from left to right, keeping track of the MEX as I go.

Wait, but the MEX depends on the permutation p, which is what I'm trying to reconstruct.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate from the end of the permutation to the beginning.

Let's consider the last element, p_n.

At this point, the MEX of p_1 to p_n is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_n.

Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of the entire permutation is n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

Therefore, a_n = MEX(p_1 to p_n) - p_n = n - p_n.

So, p_n = n - a_n.

That's straightforward for the last element.

Now, for p_{n-1}, the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Since p_n is already determined, and p is a permutation, the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} would be the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

But p_n is already known, so if p_n is not in p_1 to p_{n-1}, then MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) would be p_n.

Wait, no. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the list, which could be less than p_n if some smaller numbers are missing.

This seems complicated.

Let me see if there's a better way.

Looking at the example:

In the first case:

a = [1,1,-2,1,2]

p = [0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify:

For i=1:

MEX(p1) = MEX([0]) = 1

a1 = 1 - 0 = 1

For i=2:

MEX(p1,p2) = MEX([0,1]) = 2

a2 = 2 - 1 = 1

For i=3:

MEX(p1,p2,p3) = MEX([0,1,4]) = 2

a3 = 2 - 4 = -2

For i=4:

MEX(p1,p2,p3,p4) = MEX([0,1,4,2]) = 3

a4 = 3 - 2 = 1

For i=5:

MEX(p1 to p5) = MEX([0,1,4,2,3]) = 5

a5 = 5 - 3 = 2

So, the a array matches.

Now, how to reconstruct p from a.

Looking at the last element:

a5 = 5 - 3 = 2

So, p5 = 5 - 2 = 3

Similarly, p4 = MEX(p1 to p4) - a4

But MEX(p1 to p4) is MEX([0,1,4,2]) = 3

So, a4 = 3 - 2 = 1

Therefore, p4 = 3 - 1 = 2

Similarly, p3 = MEX(p1 to p3) - a3

MEX(p1 to p3) = MEX([0,1,4]) = 2

a3 = 2 - 4 = -2

So, p3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

And so on.

Wait, this seems like a pattern.

In general, p_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - a_i

But MEX(p1 to pi) is unknown, but perhaps I can find a way to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the MEX.

Let me consider that.

Starting from the end:

p_n = n - a_n

Because MEX(p1 to pn) = n

Then, for p_{n-1}, MEX(p1 to p_{n-1}) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to p_{n-1}.

But p_n is already known, and since p is a permutation, MEX(p1 to p_{n-1}) is either p_n or some smaller number not in p1 to p_{n-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the numbers used so far.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a set to keep track of the numbers used in p so far.

Start from the end of the permutation.

Set mex to n (since MEX of p1 to pn is n)

Then, p_n = mex - a_n

Add p_n to the used set.

Then, for p_{n-1}:

mex is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to p_{n-1}.

Since p_n is known and not in p1 to p_{n-1}, mex is the smallest number not in p1 to p_{n-1}.

But I can compute it as mex = min([0 to n] - used)

Then, p_{n-1} = mex - a_{n-1}

Add p_{n-1} to used

And so on, iterating backwards.

Wait, but in the first step, p_n = n - a_n

Then, for p_{n-1}, mex = min([0 to n] - used), where used = {p_n}

p_{n-1} = mex - a_{n-1}

Then add p_{n-1} to used

Continue this way.

This seems plausible.

Let me try it with the first example.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Start with i=4 (0-based index), a[4]=2

mex=5 (initially)

p[4]=5 - 2=3

used={3}

i=3, a[3]=1

mex is min([0,1,2,3,4]-{3}) = min([0,1,2,4}) = 0

p[3]=0 - 1=-1

Wait, but in the example, p[3]=2

Hmm, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding.

Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I need to update mex after assigning p[i]

Wait, in the first step, p[4]=5 - 2=3

used={3}

Then, for i=3, a[3]=1

mex is min([0,1,2,3,4]-{3})=0

p[3]=0 - 1=-1

But in the example, p[3]=2

This suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Maybe instead of setting mex to n and then updating, I need to set mex to the smallest unused number at each step.

Wait, perhaps I should think of mex as the current smallest unused number.

Let me try rephrasing.

Initialize a deque or a priority queue with all numbers from 0 to n-1.

Then, iterate from the end to the beginning.

At each step, p[i] = mex - a[i], where mex is the smallest number in the remaining numbers.

But in the first step, p[4]=mex - a[4]= (0) - 2 = -2, which is not matching the example where p[4]=3.

Wait, perhaps mex should be the current smallest unused number.

In the example, p[4]=3, which is consistent with mex=5 -2=3, but mex should be 5 only if all numbers from 0 to 4 are used, but in reality, only p[4] is assigned.

This is confusing.

Let me look at the code provided.

The code does the following:

- Read the number of test cases t

- For each test case:

- Read n

- Read array a of length n

- Initialize result array res of length n with None

- Set mex = n

- Iterate from i = n-1 to 0:

- Set res[i] = mex - a[i]

- If mex > mex - a[i], set mex = mex - a[i]

- Print the result array

So, in the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize res=[None,None,None,None,None], mex=5

i=4, a[4]=2

res[4]=5 - 2=3

mex = max(mex, res[4]) = max(5,3)=5

i=3, a[3]=1

res[3]=5 - 1=4

mex = max(5,4)=5

i=2, a[2]=-2

res[2]=5 - (-2)=7

mex = max(5,7)=7

i=1, a[1]=1

res[1]=7 - 1=6

mex = max(7,6)=7

i=0, a[0]=1

res[0]=7 - 1=6

mex = max(7,6)=7

So, res=[6,6,7,4,3]

But in the example, it should be [0,1,4,2,3]

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the indices.

Wait, in Python, list indices start from 0, but the problem likely considers 1-based indexing for the permutation.

Wait, no, the problem describes a_1 to a_n and p_1 to p_n, but in code, it's 0-based.

Wait, in the code, ar = list of a, and res = [None]*n

Then, for i in range(len(ar)-1, -1, -1):

res[i] = mex - ar[i]

if mex > mex - ar[i]:

mex = mex - ar[i]

So, in the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

i=4, a[4]=2, res[4]=5 - 2=3, mex = max(5,3)=5

i=3, a[3]=1, res[3]=5 -1=4, mex=max(5,4)=5

i=2, a[2]=-2, res[2]=5 - (-2)=7, mex=max(5,7)=7

i=1, a[1]=1, res[1]=7 -1=6, mex=max(7,6)=7

i=0, a[0]=1, res[0]=7 -1=6, mex=max(7,6)=7

So, res=[6,6,7,4,3]

But in the example, output is 0 1 4 2 3

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data."

But in this approach, we're getting res=[6,6,7,4,3], which includes numbers greater than n-1=4, which is invalid for a permutation of 0 to 4.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem mentions that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, and a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i.

Given that, p_i should be between 0 and n-1.

In the code's output, we have numbers like 6 and 7, which are invalid.

Therefore, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem guarantees that at least one valid p exists, but the code might not be correctly generating it.

I need to find a correct approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that at each step i, MEX(p1 to pi) is equal to a_i + p_i.

Since a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i, then MEX(p1 to pi) = a_i + p_i

Also, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

So, for each i, MEX(p1 to pi) = a_i + p_i

Moreover, MEX must be greater than any number in p1 to pi, or equal to 0 if 0 is not present.

Wait, MEX is always >=0, and it's the smallest missing number.

Given that, MEX(p1 to pi) must be >=0 and not present in p1 to pi.

Also, MEX(p1 to pi) must be less than or equal to i, because if all numbers from 0 to i-1 are present in p1 to pi, then MEX would be i.

Wait, no, MEX can be larger than i if some numbers from 0 to i-1 are missing.

Wait, no, in a permutation of 0 to n-1, MEX(p1 to pi) can be any number from 0 to n, depending on the elements in p1 to pi.

Wait, actually, in a permutation of 0 to n-1, MEX(p1 to pi) is the smallest number from 0 to n-1 not in p1 to pi, or n if all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

But in our case, p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, but only the first i elements are considered, which may not include all numbers from 0 to n-1.

So, MEX(p1 to pi) is the smallest number from 0 to n-1 not in p1 to pi, or n.

Given that, MEX(p1 to pi) is in the range [0, n].

Given that, a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i, so p_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - a_i.

But MEX(p1 to pi) depends on p1 to pi, which includes p_i.

This circular dependency is tricky.

I need a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Let me consider processing the array from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the used numbers and the current MEX.

Initialize mex to n, since for the entire permutation, MEX is n.

Then, for each i from n-1 down to 0:

p_i = mex - a_i

Add p_i to the used set

If p_i < mex, then set mex = p_i

Wait, why set mex = p_i if p_i < mex?

Because, if p_i is less than the current mex, then in the first i elements, p_i was not used, so the MEX would be p_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

If p_i is less than mex, then MEX should be p_i, because p_i is now in p1 to pi.

Wait, no, if p_i is less than mex, then p_i is used, so MEX remains the same.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If p_i is less than mex, then p_i is used, and since mex was the smallest unused number before adding p_i, if p_i < mex, then mex should remain the same, because p_i was already considered as used.

If p_i >= mex, then mex should be incremented by 1, because p_i is used, and it's greater than or equal to the current mex.

Wait, perhaps I need to update mex based on whether p_i is less than mex.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that mex is the smallest unused number.

Wait, maybe I need to keep track of the unused numbers.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a set of unused numbers from 0 to n-1.

Initialize mex to 0.

Then, iterate through the permutation:

For each i from 0 to n-1:

p_i = mex - a_i

Remove p_i from the unused set

If p_i == mex, then increment mex until mex is not in the unused set.

This seems similar to how MEX is calculated.

Wait, perhaps I need to maintain a queue or something to keep track of the unused numbers.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving MEX, we can use a priority queue or a set to keep track of the available MEX values.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to be trying to compute p_i as mex - a_i, and then updating mex to be the maximum of mex and p_i.

But in the first test case, this leads to p=[6,6,7,4,3], which is invalid.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I need to find a correct way to compute p from a.

Let me consider that for each i, MEX(p1 to pi) = a_i + p_i.

Also, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

Therefore, a_i + p_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

Let me think about what p_i can be.

Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, p_i is between 0 and n-1.

a_i can be between -n and n, but in practice, a_i + p_i must be a non-negative integer, since MEX is non-negative.

Therefore, a_i + p_i >=0.

Also, a_i + p_i is the MEX of p1 to pi, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

So, for i=1:

MEX(p1) = a1 + p1

Similarly, for i=2:

MEX(p1,p2) = a2 + p2

And so on.

I need to find p such that these conditions hold.

This seems like a system of equations, but it's not straightforward to solve directly.

Maybe I can use the fact that p is a permutation, and each p_i is unique.

Let me consider building p from left to right.

Start with i=1:

p1 is some number from 0 to n-1.

MEX(p1) = a1 + p1

MEX(p1) is the smallest non-negative integer not equal to p1.

So, if p1 = k, then MEX(p1) = 0 if k !=0, else MEX(p1)=1.

Wait, no.

If p1 =0, then MEX(p1)=1

If p1=1, MEX(p1)=0

If p1=2, MEX(p1)=0

Wait, MEX(p1) is 0 if 0 != p1, else 1.

Wait, no.

MEX(p1) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1.

So, if p1=0, MEX(p1)=1

If p1=1, MEX(p1)=0

If p1=2, MEX(p1)=0

So, MEX(p1) = 0 if p1 !=0, else 1

Therefore, a1 + p1 = MEX(p1)

So, a1 + p1 = 0 if p1 !=0, else 1

Therefore, a1 = -p1 if p1 !=0, else 1 - p1

So, for p1 !=0, a1 = -p1

For p1 =0, a1 =1 -0=1

So, if a1 =1, p1 must be 0

If a1 !=1, then p1 = -a1

But p1 must be between 0 and n-1.

This gives us a way to determine p1 based on a1.

Similarly, for i=2:

MEX(p1,p2) = a2 + p2

MEX(p1,p2) is the smallest non-negative integer not in {p1,p2}

So, depending on p1 and p2, MEX(p1,p2) can be determined.

This seems complicated to generalize.

Maybe I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the used numbers and the current MEX.

Let me try that.

Initialize mex to n

Initialize used as an empty set

For i from n-1 down to 0:

p_i = mex - a_i

Add p_i to used

If p_i < mex:

mex = p_i

Wait, similar to what the initial code does, but in the first test case, this leads to invalid numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to set mex to the smallest number not in used.

So, instead of setting mex directly, set mex to the smallest number not in used.

Let me try that.

In the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize used={}

mex=5 (since all numbers from 0 to 4 are possible)

i=4, a[4]=2

p[4]=5 -2=3

used={3}

Now, mex is the smallest number not in used, which is 0

i=3, a[3]=1

p[3]=0 -1=-1

But p_i must be between 0 and 4, so -1 is invalid.

This suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to maintain a list of available numbers and pick the smallest available for mex.

Wait, perhaps I can use a deque or a priority queue to keep track of the available numbers for mex.

Let me try that.

Initialize a list of available numbers: [0,1,2,3,4]

For each i from n-1 down to 0:

p_i = mex - a_i

Remove p_i from the available numbers

mex is the smallest number in the available numbers

But in practice, this might not work because p_i could be outside the range.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose p_i such that it's in the available numbers.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that MEX(p1 to pi) = a_i + p_i

Also, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

So, for each i, a_i + p_i is equal to the smallest missing number in p1 to pi.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of which numbers have been used so far.

Let me try to build p step by step for the first test case.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

I need to find p such that:

For i=1:

MEX(p1) = a1 + p1 =1 + p1

Similarly:

i=2: MEX(p1,p2)=1 + p2

i=3: MEX(p1,p2,p3)=-2 + p3

i=4: MEX(p1,p2,p3,p4)=1 + p4

i=5: MEX(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5)=2 + p5

Now, in the example, p=[0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify:

i=1: MEX([0])=1, a1=1 -0=1

i=2: MEX([0,1])=2, a2=2 -1=1

i=3: MEX([0,1,4])=2, a3=2 -4=-2

i=4: MEX([0,1,4,2])=3, a4=3 -2=1

i=5: MEX([0,1,4,2,3])=5, a5=5 -3=2

So, it matches.

Now, how to reconstruct p from a.

Looking at the last element:

a5=2 = MEX(p1 to p5) - p5 =5 - p5 => p5=5 -2=3

Then, a4=1 = MEX(p1 to p4) - p4

MEX(p1 to p4)=1 + p4

But p1 to p4 are [0,1,4,2], so MEX=3

Therefore, 3 =1 + p4 => p4=2

Similarly, a3=-2 = MEX(p1 to p3) - p3

MEX(p1 to p3)=2 (since [0,1,4]), so 2 = -2 + p3 => p3=4

a2=1 = MEX(p1 to p2) - p2

MEX(p1 to p2)=2 (since [0,1]), so 2=1 + p2 => p2=1

a1=1 = MEX(p1) - p1

MEX(p1)=1, so 1=1 - p1 => p1=0

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3]

This seems to work.

So, the approach is:

Start from the end:

p_n = n - a_n

Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1:

MEX(p1 to pi) = a_i + p_i

But MEX(p1 to pi) is also equal to MEX of the set p1 to pi.

Wait, but I need a way to compute MEX(p1 to pi) without knowing p1 to pi.

Wait, but from the above steps, it seems that MEX(p1 to pi) can be determined based on the values of p_{i+1} to p_n.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the used numbers and the current MEX.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a set used = empty

mex = n

For i from n-1 down to 0:

p_i = mex - a_i

Add p_i to used

If p_i < mex:

mex = p_i

This seems similar to what I tried earlier.

Let me apply this to the first test case.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize used={}, mex=5

i=4, a[4]=2

p[4]=5 -2=3

used={3}

Since 3 <5, set mex=3

i=3, a[3]=1

p[3]=3 -1=2

used={3,2}

2 <3, set mex=2

i=2, a[2]=-2

p[2]=2 - (-2)=4

used={3,2,4}

4 >2, do not change mex

i=1, a[1]=1

p[1]=2 -1=1

used={3,2,4,1}

1 <2, set mex=1

i=0, a[0]=1

p[0]=1 -1=0

used={3,2,4,1,0}

0 <1, set mex=0

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the example.

Great, so this approach works.

Therefore, the initial code I saw is almost correct, but it has a mistake in updating mex.

In the code, it sets res[i] = mex - a[i]

Then, if mex > mex - a[i], set mex = mex - a[i]

But in the correct approach, if p_i < mex, then set mex = p_i

So, in code terms, if res[i] < mex, then mex = res[i]

Wait, in the earlier steps, p_i = mex - a[i]

Then, if p_i < mex, set mex = p_i

So, in code, if res[i] < mex, then mex = res[i]

But in the initial code, it's if mex > mex - a[i], then mex = mex - a[i]

Which is equivalent to if a[i] >0, then mex = mex - a[i]

But in the correct approach, it should be if p_i < mex, then mex = p_i

Which is if res[i] < mex, then mex = res[i]

So, the initial code is incorrect in the condition.

It should be:

res[i] = mex - a[i]

if res[i] < mex:

mex = res[i]

But in the initial code, it's:

if mex > mex - a[i]:

mex = mex - a[i]

Which is not the same.

So, the initial code is incorrect.

The correct code should be:

res[i] = mex - a[i]

if res[i] < mex:

mex = res[i]

Therefore, the initial code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
