Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a 2xN grid filled with 0s and 1s. There's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) and it needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only move one cell to the right or one cell down. For each path it takes, we construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along that path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest such string and the number of paths that produce this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when compared character by character. So, for example, between "010" and "001", "001" is smaller because at the second character, 0 is smaller than 1.

Now, let's think about how the grasshopper can move. From any cell, it can move right or down, except when it's at the rightmost column or bottom row, where only one move is possible.

I need to find the path that gives the smallest possible string and count how many such paths exist.

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

n = 2

s1 = 00

s2 = 00

So the grid is:

0 0

0 0

The possible paths from (1,1) to (2,2) are:

1. Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2): the string is 0 -> 0 -> 0, so "000"

2. Down to (2,1), then right to (2,2): the string is 0 -> 0 -> 0, so "000"

Both paths give the same string "000", which is the smallest possible. The number of such paths is 2.

Another test case:

n = 4

s1 = 1101

s2 = 1100

Grid:

1 1 0 1

1 1 0 0

Possible paths:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: string is 1->1->0->1->0

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: 1->1->0->1->0

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: 1->1->1->0->0

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: 1->1->0->0->0

Among these, "11000" is the smallest lexicographically, and only one path produces it.

So, the strategy should be to choose the path that gives the smallest possible string.

How to find this path?

I need to make sure that at each step, I'm choosing the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

One way to think about it is to always choose the move that gives the smallest current character, considering the future characters as well.

But that seems a bit tricky. Maybe dynamic programming can help here.

Let's define dp[i][j][k], where i is the row, j is the column, and k is something related to the string built so far. But that might be too slow since N can be up to 2e5.

Wait, N is up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So, any solution with higher than O(N) time complexity per test case might be too slow.

I need an efficient way to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it.

Let me consider the properties of the grid and the moves.

The grasshopper starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N).

Each path consists of exactly N + 1 cells: from (1,1) to (1,N), then down to (2,N), or right from (2,1) to (2,N).

Wait, no. Actually, each path has exactly N + 1 moves: N right moves and one down move, in some order.

But, since the grid is only 2 rows, the path can be represented by the position where the down move is made.

For example, in a grid of size 2xN, the grasshopper can choose to make the down move at any column from 1 to N, inclusive.

Wait, actually, it can make the down move at any step, but since it starts at row 1, it must end at row 2, column N.

So, more precisely, the path can be represented by the column where the down move is made.

For example, if it makes the down move at column K, then the path is:

Right to (1,2), ..., right to (1,K), down to (2,K), then right to (2,K+1), ..., right to (2,N).

So, the string constructed would be s1[1] to s1[K], then s2[K] to s2[N].

Wait, columns are from 1 to N, and s1 and s2 are lists of size N.

So, for each K from 1 to N, the path is:

- From (1,1) to (1,K): collect s1[1] to s1[K]

- Then down to (2,K)

- Then right to (2,N): collect s2[K] to s2[N]

So, the string is s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N]

Our task is to choose K such that this string is lexicographically smallest, and count the number of K's that give this string.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing K, because for some K, multiple paths may correspond to the same K.

But in this grid, for a fixed K, there is only one path that corresponds to it.

Wait, no. For a fixed K, there is only one path that corresponds to it, as described above.

So, actually, the number of paths for a given K is 1.

Therefore, to find the smallest string, I need to find the K that gives the smallest s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], and count how many K's give this same string.

Wait, but in the first test case, both K=1 and K=2 give "000", which is the smallest string, so the count is 2.

In the second test case, only K=4 gives "11000", which is the smallest string.

So, I need to iterate over all possible K from 1 to N, construct the string s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], find the smallest such string, and count how many K's give that string.

But N can be up to 2e5, and T can be up to 1e4, with total N over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, iterating over all K for each test case is acceptable, as long as it's O(N) per test case.

But, I need to optimize it.

Let me think about how to find the smallest concatenation of s1[1 to K] and s2[K to N].

Wait, but it's not just s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], it's the concatenation of the characters in order along the path.

Wait, in the path, when K=1, it's s1[1], then down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., (2,N).

So, it's s1[1] + s2[1 to N]

When K=2, it's s1[1], s1[2], down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), ..., (2,N).

So, s1[1], s1[2], s2[2 to N]

Similarly, for K=3, s1[1], s1[2], s1[3], s2[3 to N]

And so on.

So, in general, for K from 1 to N, the string is s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N]

Our task is to find the smallest such string among all K, and count how many K give that string.

Now, to find the smallest string, I can iterate through K from 1 to N, construct s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], and keep track of the smallest one.

But this is O(N^2), which is too slow for N up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

I need to find a way to compare s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] for different K's efficiently.

Let's think about how string comparison works.

To compare two strings, we compare their characters one by one until we find a difference.

The smaller string is the one with the smaller character at the first position where they differ.

So, to find the smallest possible string, I need to minimize the sequence of characters in the concatenation s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N].

I need an efficient way to find the K that gives the smallest such sequence.

One idea is to iterate through K from 1 to N, and for each K, consider the string s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], and keep track of the minimum string found so far and the count of K's that produce it.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compare these strings efficiently, perhaps by comparing prefixes.

Wait, perhaps I can merge s1 and s2 in a smart way.

Wait, another idea: since the path is determined by where the down move is made, and for each K, the string is s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N], I can think of it as a merge of s1 and s2, with a switch from s1 to s2 at position K.

I need to choose K such that this merged string is lexicographically smallest.

I need an efficient way to find the smallest possible merged string.

Let me consider that for K from 1 to N, the string is s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N].

I can think of this as the string that is s1 up to position K, then s2 from K onwards.

I need to find the K that gives the smallest such string.

To do this efficiently, I can find the position where s1 and s2 differ the most in their prefixes.

Wait, maybe I can find the earliest position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose K based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching from s1 to s2 gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and for each K, compare s1[1 to K] + s2[K+1 to N] with the current smallest string.

But I need a smarter way to find the minimum without comparing entire strings each time.

Let me consider that for K from 1 to N, the string is s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N].

I can think of this as the string that is s1 up to K, then s2 from K onwards.

To find the lexicographically smallest such string, I need to choose K such that the sequence of characters in s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is smallest.

I need to find the K that minimizes this sequence.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can find the point where s1 and s2 start differing, and choose the K that leads to the smallest string.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the smallest possible string by choosing the appropriate K.

Wait, perhaps I can use some kind of suffix array or prefix comparison.

Wait, another idea: I can concatenate s1 and s2, and look for the lexicographically smallest substring of length N+1.

But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings s1 and s2 as arrays, and find the point where switching from s1 to s2 gives the smallest possible string.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have s1 and s2.

I need to choose a K such that s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is minimized.

To minimize the string lexicographically, I need to minimize the first character, then the second, and so on.

So, I can start by comparing s1[1] and s2[1].

If s1[1] < s2[1], then I should choose K such that s1[1 to K] is as small as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current smallest string built so far.

Wait, maybe I can use a pointer approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Let's consider that the string is built by taking s1 up to some point and then switching to s2.

I need to find the switch point K that minimizes the string s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N].

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can find the earliest position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose K based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where s1 and s2 differ.

Then, choose K based on which one is smaller at that position.

Wait, let's consider an example.

Take n=4

s1 = 1101

s2 = 1100

At column 1: s1=1, s2=1 (equal)

At column 2: s1=1, s2=1 (equal)

At column 3: s1=0, s2=0 (equal)

At column 4: s1=1, s2=0 (differs)

So, the first difference is at column 4.

Since s2[4]=0 < s1[4]=1, choosing K=4 would give s1[1 to 4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

Wait, but in the example, it's said that "11000" is the smallest, which corresponds to K=4: s1[1 to 4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010, but in the explanation, it's "11000". Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, s1 = 1101, s2 = 1100

So, for K=4: s1[1 to 4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

But in the explanation, it's "11000", which seems incorrect unless there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the string is built by including the down move.

Wait, in the path, when you choose K, you include s1[1 to K], then s2[K to N].

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the down move includes the cell s2[K], and then continue right.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I construct the string.

Wait, perhaps the string includes the cell where the down move is made in s2.

Wait, in the path, when you move down to (2,K), you include s2[K], then continue right to (2,N).

So, for K=1: s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 100 = 1100

For K=2: s1[1]s1[2] + s2[2 to 4] = 11 + 100 = 11100

For K=3: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3] + s2[3 to 4] = 110 + 00 = 11000

For K=4: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3]s1[4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

So, among these, "11000" is smaller than "11010" and "11100".

So, in this case, K=3 gives "11000", which is smaller than K=4's "11010" and K=2's "11100", and K=1's "1100".

Wait, but in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4.

Wait, but according to my calculation, K=3 gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the example.

In the example, it's said that the lexicographically smallest string is "11000" and it's achieved by only one path.

But according to my calculation, K=3 gives "11000", and K=4 gives "11010".

So, perhaps the example has a misprint.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the path construction.

Let me read the problem again.

"The binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So, for n=4, the string should have length 5.

In my calculation:

- K=1: s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1000 = 11000 (length 5)

- K=2: s1[1]s1[2] + s2[2 to 4] = 11 + 100 = 11100 (length 5)

- K=3: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3] + s2[3 to 4] = 110 + 00 = 11000 (length 5)

- K=4: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3]s1[4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010 (length 5)

So, both K=1 and K=3 give "11000", which is smaller than "11010" and "11100".

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the string for K=1.

Wait, for K=1:

- Start at (1,1): 1

- Down to (2,1): 1

- Right to (2,2): 1

- Right to (2,3): 0

- Right to (2,4): 0

So, the string is 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, I had s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1000 = 11000, but actually, s2[1 to 4] is s2[1], s2[2], s2[3], s2[4], which is 1,1,0,0.

But in the path, when you go down to (2,1), you include s2[1], then continue right to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), including s2[2], s2[3], s2[4].

So, the string is s1[1], s2[1], s2[2], s2[3], s2[4] => 1,1,1,0,0 => "11100"

Wait, but earlier I thought it was s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1000 = 11000, but s2[1 to 4] is 1100, not 1000.

Wait, perhaps I misread s2 as 1100.

Wait, in the example:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

So, s2[1 to 4] is 1,1,0,0.

Hence, for K=1: s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1100 = 11100

For K=2: s1[1]s1[2] + s2[2 to 4] = 11 + 100 = 11100

For K=3: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3] + s2[3 to 4] = 110 + 00 = 11000

For K=4: s1[1]s1[2]s1[3]s1[4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

So, indeed, K=3 gives "11000", which is smaller than "11010" and "11100".

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the indexing.

Wait, perhaps the columns are 1-indexed, and s1 and s2 are lists starting from index 1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's a 2xN grid, with rows 1 and 2, and columns 1 to N.

So, for K=3, s1[1 to 3] + s2[3 to 4] = 110 + 00 = 11000

For K=4, s1[1 to 4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

So, indeed, "11000" is smaller than "11010".

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4, but according to this, K=3 gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the example.

In the example, for the second test case:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

And it's said that the smallest string is "11000" and it's achieved by only one path.

But according to my calculation, K=3 gives "11000", and K=4 gives "11010".

So, perhaps the example has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the path for K=3 is different.

Wait, perhaps the path for K=3 is:

Start at (1,1): 1

Right to (1,2): 1

Right to (1,3): 0

Down to (2,3): 0

Right to (2,4): 0

So, the string is 1,1,0,0,0 => "11000"

And for K=4:

Start at (1,1): 1

Right to (1,2): 1

Right to (1,3): 0

Right to (1,4): 1

Down to (2,4): 0

So, the string is 1,1,0,1,0 => "11010"

Hence, "11000" is smaller than "11010".

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4, but according to this, K=3 also gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting K.

Wait, perhaps K is the column where the down move is made.

So, for K=3: down at column 3, so the path is s1[1 to 3] + s2[3 to 4] = 110 + 00 = 11000

For K=4: down at column 4, s1[1 to 4] + s2[4 to 4] = 1101 + 0 = 11010

So, indeed, K=3 gives "11000" and K=4 gives "11010".

But in the example, it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4, but according to this, K=3 gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the example.

Wait, perhaps in the example, the grid is different.

Wait, in the example, n=4, s1=1101, s2=1100, and it's said that only one path gives "11000", which corresponds to K=4.

But according to my calculation, K=3 also gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for K=3:

s1[1 to 3]: 1,1,0

s2[3 to 4]: 0,0

So, "110" + "00" = "11000"

For K=4:

s1[1 to 4]: 1,1,0,1

s2[4 to 4]: 0

So, "1101" + "0" = "11010"

So, indeed, "11000" is smaller than "11010".

But according to the example, only one path gives "11000", which must correspond to K=3, not K=4.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that only K=4 gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the example.

Wait, in the example, it's:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

And it's said that the lexicographically smallest string is "11000" and it's achieved by only one path.

But according to my calculation, K=3 gives "11000", and K=4 gives "11010".

So, perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the path construction.

Wait, perhaps the path for K=3 is:

s1[1], s1[2], s1[3], s2[3], s2[4]

Which is 1,1,0,0,0 => "11000"

And for K=4:

s1[1], s1[2], s1[3], s1[4], s2[4]

Which is 1,1,0,1,0 => "11010"

So, indeed, K=3 gives "11000", which is smaller than "11010".

Hence, in this case, K=3 gives the smallest string, and only one path corresponds to it.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, K=3 and K=1 both give "11000".

Wait, no, K=1 gives s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1100 = "11100", which is larger than "11000".

Hence, only K=3 gives "11000", which is the smallest.

So, in this case, only one path gives "11000".

I must have miscalculated earlier for K=1.

Wait, for K=1:

s1[1] + s2[1 to 4] = 1 + 1100 = "11100"

Which is larger than "11000".

Hence, only K=3 gives "11000".

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, only one path gives the smallest string "11000".

Hence, in the example, it's correct.

Now, back to the general problem.

I need an efficient way to find the smallest possible string among all possible K and count the number of K's that produce it.

Given that N can be up to 2e5 and T up to 1e4 with total N over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an O(N) per test case solution.

One way to approach this is to iterate through K from 1 to N, keep track of the current string, and find the minimum.

But comparing strings directly would be inefficient for large N.

I need a smarter way to compare them.

Let me consider merging s1 and s2 in a way that allows me to find the smallest possible string.

I can think of it as finding the point K where switching from s1 to s2 gives the smallest possible concatenation.

To do this efficiently, I can look for the earliest position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that leads to the smaller character at that position.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the position where s1 and s2 start to differ, and choose K based on that.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize K=1.

Then, compare s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] with s1[1 to K+1] + s2[K+1 to N], and so on.

But this is still O(N), which is acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, keep track of the current string, and find the minimum.

But again, comparing strings directly is too slow.

I need a way to compare them without constructing the entire strings each time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K that minimizes the sequence by comparing s1 and s2 column by column.

Let me try to think of it as merging two strings with a switch at some point.

I need to find the switch point K that results in the smallest possible merged string.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the smallest possible string by choosing to switch at the earliest possible point where it leads to a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the path that takes the smaller value at that position.

If s1[i] < s2[i], then choosing K < i would be better, otherwise K >= i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where s1 and s2 start to differ, and choose K based on that.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize min_string as a very large string.

Initialize count = 0.

For each K from 1 to N:

current_string = s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N]

if current_string < min_string:

min_string = current_string

count = 1

elif current_string == min_string:

count +=1

But this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this in O(N).

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimum of s2 and prefix of s1, and then find the K that minimizes the concatenation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K where s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is minimized.

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and keep track of the current string built so far, updating the minimum string and count accordingly.

But I need to do this efficiently without comparing entire strings each time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K where s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is lexicographically smallest by finding the K where s1 and s2 start to differ, and choosing the K that leads to the smallest possible character in the first differing position.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize min_string as a string larger than any possible string, say '1' * (N+1)

Initialize count = 0

For K from 1 to N:

current_string = s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N]

if current_string < min_string:

min_string = current_string

count = 1

elif current_string == min_string:

count +=1

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and keep track of the current string character by character, updating the minimum prefix found so far.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where s1 and s2 differ, and choose K based on that.

Let me consider that for two K's, K1 and K2, I need to compare s1[1 to K1] + s2[K1 to N] with s1[1 to K2] + s2[K2 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the smallest possible string by choosing to switch from s1 to s2 at the earliest possible point where it leads to a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where s1 and s2 differ, and choose to switch at that point.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize min_string as empty

Initialize K = 0

For i from 1 to N:

if s1[i] < s2[i]:

K = i

min_string = s1[1 to i] + s2[i to N]

break

elif s1[i] > s2[i]:

# s2[i] < s1[i], so switching to s2 at i would give a smaller string

K = i

min_string = s1[1 to i] + s2[i to N]

break

else:

# s1[i] == s2[i], continue

pass

If no difference is found, then any K would give the same string, so choose K=N.

Then, count the number of K's that give this min_string.

Wait, but in the earlier example, s1=1101, s2=1100, they differ at position 4.

So, s1[4]=1, s2[4]=0, so s2[4] < s1[4], so choosing K=4 would give a smaller string.

But in that case, K=3 also gives "11000", which is smaller than "11010".

So, this approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the columns and find the first position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose K based on which one is smaller at that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal K where s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is minimized.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to s2 gives a smaller string.

Wait, maybe I need to look for the minimal prefix where s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is smallest.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two strings, s1 and s2.

I need to choose a K such that the string s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] is minimized.

To minimize this, I need to choose K such that the sequence s1[1 to K] is as small as possible, considering that s2[K to N] will follow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and for each K, compare s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N] with the current min_string.

But again, this is O(N^2).

I need a way to compute this in O(N).

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix of s1 and suffix of s2, and then for each K, concatenate them and find the minimal one.

But that's still O(N).

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s1[1 to K] + s2[K to N].

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through K from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing the smallest available character at each position.

Wait, perhaps I can use a merge-like approach, similar to merging two sorted arrays, but in this case, the arrays are s1 and s2.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and choose to stay in s1 as long as s1 gives smaller characters, and switch to s2 when s2 gives smaller characters.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty list to store the min_string.

Initialize two pointers, one for s1 and one for s2.

Start with s1.

At each step, choose the smallest available character between s1's current position and s2's current position.

If s1's character is smaller, append it to min_string and move to the next column in s1.

If s2's character is smaller, append it to min_string and move
