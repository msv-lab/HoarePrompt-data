Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, and his phone has a certain amount of charge. The phone loses charge over time, and there are costs associated with turning it off and on again. I need to figure out if it's possible for Stepan to send all the messages without the phone running out of charge.

First, let's understand the problem clearly. Stepan has to send messages at moments m1, m2, up to mn, where each mi is less than mi+1. At moment 0, the phone has f units of charge and is turned on. The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it's on. Additionally, turning the phone off and then on again consumes b units of charge each time.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the charge dropping to zero or below at any moment.

Let's think about how to approach this.

I need to manage the phone's charge level over time, considering when to keep the phone on and when to turn it off to save charge.

At any given time, if the phone is on, it's losing charge at a rate of a per unit time. If Stepan turns it off between messages, he can save some charge, but there's a cost b each time he does this.

So, there's a trade-off: keeping the phone on costs charge over time, but turning it off and on again has a fixed cost each time.

I need to find a strategy that minimizes the charge consumption while ensuring that at each message moment, there's enough charge to send the message.

Let me consider the charge consumption between consecutive message moments.

Suppose I have two consecutive messages at moments t1 and t2, with t2 > t1.

If the phone is kept on between t1 and t2, the charge consumed is a * (t2 - t1).

Alternatively, if I turn the phone off immediately after t1 and turn it on at t2, the charge consumed is b.

So, for each interval between messages, I have to choose whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again, based on which option consumes less charge.

Wait, but it's not that simple because the charge also decreases while the phone is on between messages.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with f charge at moment 0.

At moment m1, I need to have enough charge to send the first message.

Between moment 0 and m1, if the phone is on, the charge decreases by a * m1.

If I turn it off at some point and turn it on again at m1, there's a cost b.

I need to decide for each interval between messages whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the charge at each message moment, considering the choices for each interval.

But given the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 per test case and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Looking at the reference solution, it seems to iterate through the list of message moments and for each consecutive pair, subtract the minimum between a*(t2 - t1) and b from the current charge f.

Then, if the final f is greater than 0, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let me see if this makes sense.

So, for each pair of consecutive messages, it calculates the charge consumption as the minimum between keeping the phone on (a * time difference) or turning it off and on again (b).

Then, it subtracts this minimum from the current charge f.

Finally, if f is positive after all these subtractions, it's possible; else, it's not.

This seems plausible, but I need to verify if this captures all scenarios correctly.

Let me consider the first example in the problem:

Test case 1:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m = [3]

According to the reference solution:

There is only one message, so no consecutive pairs.

But according to the problem, messages are sent at moments m1=3.

But in this case, since there are no previous messages, we need to consider the charge from t=0 to t=3.

If the phone is kept on from 0 to 3, charge consumed is a*(3-0)=3, so f becomes 3-3=0.

But the problem states that if charge is <=0, it's impossible to send the message.

So, in this case, f=0 at t=3, which should be considered insufficient.

Hence, "NO" is expected.

But according to the reference solution, since there are no consecutive pairs (n=1), it would directly check if f>0 after no subtractions, which is f=3>0, so it would print "YES", which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output, it's "NO" for this test case.

So, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps for n=1, it considers the interval from t=0 to m1=3.

But in the code, for n=1, the loop "for i in range(1, len(ls))" doesn't run because len(ls)=1.

So, no subtractions are made, and f remains 3.

Then, it checks if f>0 and prints "YES", which is incorrect as per the example.

Hence, the reference solution seems wrong for this test case.

But in the example, it's expected to print "NO".

So, the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check the second test case in the example.

Test case 2:

n=7, f=21, a=1, b=3

m = [4,6,10,13,17,20,26]

According to the reference solution:

It will iterate from i=1 to 6:

i=1: m[1]=6, m[0]=4 -> min(a*(6-4)=2, b=3) = 2 -> f=21-2=19

i=2: m[2]=10, m[1]=6 -> min(a*(10-6)=4, b=3)=3 -> f=19-3=16

i=3: m[3]=13, m[2]=10 -> min(a*(13-10)=3, b=3)=3 -> f=16-3=13

i=4: m[4]=17, m[3]=13 -> min(a*(17-13)=4, b=3)=3 -> f=13-3=10

i=5: m[5]=20, m[4]=17 -> min(a*(20-17)=3, b=3)=3 -> f=10-3=7

i=6: m[6]=26, m[5]=20 -> min(a*(26-20)=6, b=3)=3 -> f=7-3=4

Final f=4 >0, so "YES"

Which matches the example output.

But in the first test case, for n=1, it seems to give "YES" instead of "NO".

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but maybe there's a way to fix it.

Perhaps, in addition to the loop, we need to account for the charge consumption from t=0 to the first message.

In the first test case, n=1, m=[3], so from t=0 to t=3, if the phone is on, charge decreases by a*3=3, so f=3-3=0, which is <=0, cannot send message.

Hence, "NO"

In the reference solution, since n=1, the loop doesn't run, and it directly checks f>0, which is 3>0, so "YES"

Therefore, the reference solution is incorrect because it doesn't account for the charge consumption before the first message.

We need to consider the charge consumption from t=0 to the first message.

Similarly, between messages, and also ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

Hence, the reference solution is incomplete.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
