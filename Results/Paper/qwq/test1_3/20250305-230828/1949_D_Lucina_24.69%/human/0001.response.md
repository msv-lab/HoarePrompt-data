Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n scenarios in a video game, and the player can play them in any order, but each must be played exactly once. When switching from one scenario to another, there's a transition video that's either funny or scary. The key point is that these transition videos are symmetric; the video from scenario A to B is the same as from B to A.

So, I need to assign either 'F' for funny or 'S' for scary to each transition video, except for the diagonal entries where i = j, which are denoted by '.'. Some of these transitions are already decided, and I have to fill in the rest in such a way that, no matter what order the player goes through the scenarios, they never see more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type in a row.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input consists of n+1 lines: the first line has the integer n, and the next n lines each have n characters representing the transition videos. The j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition from scenario i to j. It can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.' if i = j.

Given that it's a symmetric matrix (the transition from i to j is the same as from j to i), I need to ensure that my assignments respect this symmetry.

The problem also states that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided, and I need to assign the remaining '?'s to either 'F' or 'S' such that the condition about not having more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive videos of the same type holds for any permutation of the scenarios.

It's guaranteed that a solution exists, which is reassuring.

Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to realize that the transition videos form a complete graph, where each scenario is a node, and each edge has a label 'F' or 'S'. The player traverses this graph along a Hamiltonian path (since they play each scenario exactly once), and I need to ensure that in any such path, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's doesn't exceed ceil(3n/4).

This sounds tricky because there are n! possible permutations, and checking each one would be computationally infeasible even for small n.

Therefore, there must be a smarter way to assign the labels.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs might help.

In the first sample:

Input:

5

.?F??

.?????

F?.S?

??S.?

?????.

Output:

.FFFF

F.FFF

FF.SF

FFS.F

FFFF.

So, for n=5, ceil(3*5/4)=4. So, in any permutation of the 5 scenarios, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's shouldn't exceed 4.

In this case, since n=5, the maximum number of transitions is 4, so it's impossible to have more than 4 consecutive videos of the same type. Hence, as long as I don't have all 4 transitions being the same type, it's fine. But in this output, all transitions are 'F's except for one 'S'. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

For any permutation of 5 scenarios, there are 4 transitions. In this case, if all 4 transitions are 'F's, it's acceptable because ceil(3*5/4)=4.

Wait, but the condition says "no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type in a row". For n=5, ceil(15/4)=4, so up to 4 'F's in a row are allowed.

In the first sample, it seems that they have up to 4 'F's in a row in some permutations, which is acceptable.

In the second sample, n=12, ceil(36/4)=9, so no more than 9 consecutive 'F's or 'S's in any permutation.

Looking at the output, there are sequences like "SSSSSSSSSFS", which has 9 'S's in a row, which is acceptable since ceil(3*12/4)=9.

So, it seems that the condition allows up to ceil(3n/4) consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

Now, I need to find a way to assign the '?'s such that this condition holds.

But checking all permutations is not feasible. There must be a better way.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph coloring problem, where I need to color the edges of a complete graph with two colors ('F' and 'S') such that any Hamiltonian path has no more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive edges of the same color.

But this seems too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of graph adjacency matrices and properties of permutations.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the transitions as a graph where nodes are scenarios and edges are transition videos. Since the graph is complete, any permutation of scenarios is a Hamiltonian path in this graph.

I need to assign 'F' or 'S' to each edge such that in any Hamiltonian path, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's doesn't exceed ceil(3n/4).

This seems difficult directly, so maybe I need to look for some properties or patterns that ensure this condition.

Let me consider that for any sequence of transitions in a permutation, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's is limited.

Perhaps I can ensure that the graph doesn't contain certain structures that would allow for long sequences of the same type.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the degrees or something related to the number of 'F's and 'S's connected to each scenario.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the already decided 'F's and 'S's and try to assign the '?'s in a way that balances the number of 'F's and 'S's.

But I need to ensure that no matter how the player orders the scenarios, the condition holds.

Another thought: perhaps I can assign the '?'s in a way that the graph doesn't contain long paths or cycles with the same type of edges.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the constraints again.

It's given that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided, and I need to assign the rest.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so I don't need to worry about impossible cases.

I need to output the complete matrix with '.' on the diagonals, and 'F' or 'S' elsewhere, respecting the symmetry.

Now, perhaps I can iterate over all possible assignments of the '?'s and check the condition for each, but this is not practical for n up to 24, as the number of '?'s can be up to floor(n/2), which for n=24 is 12, so 2^12=4096 possibilities. Even then, checking for each permutation is n! operations, which is not feasible.

Hence, I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps there's a way to assign the '?'s such that the graph doesn't contain long monochromatic paths.

In graph theory, a monochromatic path is a path where all edges are the same color.

If I can ensure that the longest monochromatic path in the graph is at most ceil(3n/4), then the condition is satisfied.

Is there a way to bound the length of the longest monochromatic path in a complete graph with edges colored with two colors?

This seems related to Ramsey theory, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some graph properties or the concept of graph diameter.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the diameter of subgraphs induced by 'F' and 'S' edges.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in a complete graph with edges colored 'F' and 'S', the longest monochromatic path is what I need to bound.

I recall that in any 2-edge-coloring of a complete graph, there exists a monochromatic path of length at least floor(2n/3).

But in our case, we need to ensure that the longest monochromatic path doesn't exceed ceil(3n/4).

Given that ceil(3n/4) >= floor(2n/3) for n >= 2, perhaps I can find an assignment where the longest monochromatic path is exactly ceil(3n/4).

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign the '?'s in a way that balances the number of 'F's and 'S's around certain nodes.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the already decided 'F's and 'S's and try to minimize the potential for long sequences.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose n=2.

Then, ceil(3*2/4)=2.

The transition matrix is:

.?

.?

With the diagonal '.'.

I need to assign either 'F' or 'S' to the off-diagonal entries.

Since they are symmetric, both off-diagonal entries must be the same.

So, I can choose, say, 'F'.

Then, for any permutation of the two scenarios, there's only one transition, which is 'F', and 1 < 2, so it's acceptable.

Similarly, for n=3, ceil(9/4)=3.

I need to ensure that in any permutation of the three scenarios, the two transitions don't have more than 3 consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

But with n=3, there are only two transitions, so it's always acceptable.

Wait, ceil(9/4)=3, but with n=3, there are only two transitions in any permutation.

So, it's impossible to have more than two consecutive transitions, which is less than 3.

Hence, for n=3, any assignment is acceptable.

Similarly, for n=4, ceil(12/4)=3.

With n=4, there are three transitions in any permutation.

So, I need to ensure that in any sequence of three transitions, there are no more than three 'F's or 'S's in a row.

But with three transitions, having three 'F's or 'S's is acceptable since ceil(12/4)=3.

Hence, for n=4, any assignment is acceptable.

Wait, but according to the problem, up to floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided.

For n=4, floor(4/2)=2 transitions are already decided.

I need to assign the remaining '?'s in such a way that in any permutation, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's doesn't exceed 3.

But since the maximum number of transitions is 3, which equals ceil(3*4/4)=3, having three 'F's or 'S's in a row is acceptable.

Hence, for n=4, any assignment is acceptable, as long as it respects the symmetry and the pre-assigned 'F's and 'S's.

Similarly, for n=5, ceil(15/4)=4, and there are four transitions, so up to four 'F's or 'S's in a row are acceptable.

Hence, for n up to 5, any assignment respecting the symmetry and pre-assigned values is acceptable.

Wait, but for n=5, if I have four 'F's in a row in some permutation, it's acceptable, but only if no permutation has more than four 'F's or 'S's in a row.

But with n=5, since any permutation has only four transitions, it's impossible to have more than four consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

Hence, for n up to 5, any assignment respecting the symmetry and pre-assigned values is acceptable.

Similarly, for n=6, ceil(18/4)=5.

With n=6, there are five transitions in any permutation.

So, I need to ensure that in any sequence of five transitions, there are no more than five 'F's or 'S's in a row.

But with five transitions, having five 'F's or 'S's in a row is acceptable since ceil(18/4)=5.

Hence, for n=6, any assignment respecting the symmetry and pre-assigned values is acceptable.

Wait, but for n=7, ceil(21/4)=6.

With n=7, there are six transitions in any permutation.

So, up to six 'F's or 'S's in a row are acceptable.

But is there a way to arrange the assignments such that in some permutations, I might have six 'F's in a row, but in others, perhaps more?

Wait, no, the condition is that for every permutation, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's doesn't exceed ceil(3n/4).

For n=7, ceil(21/4)=6, so in any permutation, having up to six 'F's or 'S's in a row is acceptable.

But with n=7, any permutation has six transitions, so the maximum possible consecutive 'F's or 'S's is six.

Hence, for n up to 7, any assignment respecting the symmetry and pre-assigned values is acceptable.

Wait, but for n=8, ceil(24/4)=6.

With n=8, there are seven transitions in any permutation.

So, I need to ensure that in any sequence of seven transitions, there are no more than six 'F's or 'S's in a row.

This means that in some permutations, it's possible to have six 'F's or 'S's in a row, but not seven.

Hence, for n=8, I need to ensure that no permutation has seven consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

But with n=8, ceil(24/4)=6, so the condition allows up to six 'F's or 'S's in a row.

Hence, I need to prevent any sequence of seven transitions from having all seven 'F's or all seven 'S's.

Is there a way to assign the transition videos to achieve this?

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe I need to assign the '?'s in such a way that the graph doesn't contain any Hamiltonian path with more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

But checking for the existence of such a path is NP-hard, so I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can look for a pattern or a property that ensures this condition.

Let me consider that if I can ensure that the graph doesn't contain a Hamiltonian path with more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive 'F's or 'S's, then the condition is satisfied.

But how can I ensure that without checking all permutations?

Maybe I can look for a way to distribute the 'F's and 'S's such that there are enough alternations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix a certain number of 'F's and 'S's in a specific pattern.

Looking back at the problem, it says that it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so I don't need to worry about impossible cases.

Also, at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided, which is up to floor(n/2) 'F's or 'S's pre-assigned.

I need to assign the remaining '?'s appropriately.

Perhaps I can assign the '?'s in a way that the number of 'F's and 'S's is balanced.

Wait, maybe I can assign half of them 'F's and half 'S's, but n is even or odd, so I need to be careful.

But with n up to 24, and floor(n/2) pre-assigned, I need to assign the rest accordingly.

Wait, but the pre-assigned ones could be all 'F's or a mix of 'F's and 'S's.

I need to consider that.

Perhaps I can group the scenarios based on their pre-assigned transition videos.

Wait, maybe I can look at the degrees of 'F's and 'S's for each scenario.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the already decided 'F's and 'S's and try to minimize the potential for long sequences.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

n = int(input())

a = [0] * (n + 1)

b = [0] * (n + 1)

xx = ['']

for i in range(1, n + 1):

x = input()

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if x[j - 1] == 'F':

a[i] += 1

a[j] += 1

elif x[j - 1] == 'S':

b[i] += 1

b[j] += 1

xx.append(x)

sa = []

sb = []

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:

sa.append(i)

if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:

sb.append(i)

if len(sa) >= len(sb):

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:

sa.append(i)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

nx = ''

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':

nx += xx[i][j - 1]

elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:

nx += 'F'

else:

nx += 'S'

print(nx)

else:

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:

sb.append(i)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

nx = ''

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':

nx += xx[i][j - 1]

elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:

nx += 'S'

else:

nx += 'F'

print(nx)

So, the code reads n and the transition matrix, counts the number of 'F's and 'S's for each scenario, categorizes scenarios into sa (those with only 'F's) and sb (those with only 'S's), and then assigns the remaining '?'s based on these categories.

Specifically, if there are more or equal number of sa scenarios than sb scenarios, it assigns 'F' to '?'s connected to scenarios in sa[:n//4], otherwise assigns 'S' to '?'s connected to scenarios in sb[:n//4].

I need to verify if this approach ensures that in any permutation of the scenarios, the number of consecutive 'F's or 'S's doesn't exceed ceil(3n/4).

Looking at the first sample input:

n=5

Input matrix:

.?F??

.?????

F?.S?

??S.?

?????.

After processing, sa would be scenarios with only 'F's but no 'S's. From the input, scenario 1 has one 'F' and one '?', scenario 2 has one '?', scenario 3 has one 'F' and one 'S', scenario 4 has one 'S' and one '?', scenario 5 has all '?'s.

So, sa would be scenarios with 'F's and no 'S's. From the input, only scenario 1 has 'F's and no 'S's (assuming the first row is scenario 1, which has '.' and then '?', 'F', '?', '?', '?').

Wait, actually, in the first row: '.?F??', so j=2 is '?', j=3 is 'F', j=4 is '?', j=5 is '?'.

So, scenario 1 has one 'F' (from j=3), and some '?'s.

Scenario 2: '.?????', so only '?'s.

Scenario 3: 'F?.S?', so 'F' from j=1, '?' from j=2, 'S' from j=4, '?' from j=5.

So, scenario 3 has 'F' and 'S', so not in sa or sb.

Scenario 4: '??S.?', so '?' from j=1, '?' from j=2, 'S' from j=3, '.' from j=4, '?' from j=5.

So, only 'S'.

Scenario 5: '?????.', so only '?'s.

Hence, sa would be scenarios with 'F's and no 'S's. Only scenario 1 has 'F' and no 'S'.

sb would be scenarios with 'S's and no 'F's. Scenario 4 has 'S' and no 'F'.

Hence, sa=[1], sb=[4].

Since len(sa) < len(sb), it will assign the remaining scenarios (2,3,5) to sb.

Then, for assigning '?'s, if i or j is in sb[:n//4], which is sb[:24//4]=sb[:6], but n=5, so sb[:5//4]=sb[:1]= [4], then assign 'S', else assign 'F'.

Hence, for scenarios connected to scenario 4, assign 'S', else assign 'F'.

Looking at the output:

.FFFF

F.FFF

FF.SF

FFS.F

FFFF.

So, for scenario 1: '.FFFF', meaning transitions to 2-'F', 3-'F', 4-'F', 5-'F'.

Scenario 2: 'F.FFF', transitions to 1-'F', 3-'F', 4-'F', 5-'F'.

Scenario 3: 'FF.SF', transitions to 1-'F', 2-'F', 4-'S', 5-'F'.

Scenario 4: 'FFS.F', transitions to 1-'F', 2-'F', 3-'S', 5-'F'.

Scenario 5: 'FFFF.', transitions to 1-'F', 2-'F', 3-'F', 4-'F'.

So, in this assignment, most transitions are 'F's, except for some 'S's.

Now, in any permutation of the 5 scenarios, there are 4 transitions.

Since ceil(15/4)=4, having up to 4 'F's in a row is acceptable.

In this assignment, in many permutations, there are 4 'F's in a row, which is acceptable.

Hence, for n=5, this seems to work.

Looking at the second sample with n=12, the output has sequences like "SSSSSSSSSFS", which has 9 'S's in a row, which is exactly ceil(36/4)=9, which is acceptable.

Hence, it seems that the program is assigning the '?'s in a way that allows up to ceil(3n/4) consecutive 'F's or 'S's in some permutations, which is acceptable.

But I need to ensure that in no permutation there are more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive 'F's or 'S's.

Given that the program allows exactly ceil(3n/4) in some sequences, and since it's the maximum allowed, it seems to be pushing the limit.

But as long as it doesn't exceed, it's fine.

Given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, and this approach seems to be assigning the '?'s in a way that respects the constraints, I would say that the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the transition videos between scenarios in a video game do not contain more than a specified number of consecutive videos of the same type, no matter the order in which the scenarios are played. The solution involves carefully assigning the types of transition videos to meet this condition.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - Read the number of scenarios, `n`.
   - Read the transition matrix, where each character represents the type of transition video ('F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, and '.' for diagonal entries).

2. **Counting Decided Transitions**:
   - For each scenario, count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions.

3. **Categorizing Scenarios**:
   - Identify scenarios that have only 'F' transitions (`sa`) and those that have only 'S' transitions (`sb`).

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - If there are more or equal number of 'F'-only scenarios (`sa`) than 'S'-only scenarios (`sb`), assign 'F' to undecided transitions connected to scenarios in `sa`.
   - Otherwise, assign
