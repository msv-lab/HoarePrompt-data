Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to think about what XOR represents in terms of binary digits. XOR maximizes the number of 1's in the binary representation by comparing bits from two numbers. So, to maximize XOR, I probably need to have as many bits differing between the two numbers as possible.

But how does that relate to the OR operation, which is what I can query? OR combines bits, setting a bit to 1 if it's 1 in either number. So, if I can understand the high-order bits where the numbers differ or agree, that might help in finding the maximum XOR.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and OR:

- XOR: p_i âŠ• p_j

- OR: p_a | p_b and p_c | p_d

I need to relate these somehow to find the pair with maximum XOR.

One approach could be to find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation and see if their XOR is the maximum possible. But I'm not sure if that's always the case.

Wait, in binary numbers, the maximum XOR would be achieved when the numbers differ in the highest possible bit positions.

Maybe I can find the number with the highest leading bit set and pair it with the number that has that bit unset, but maximizes the lower bits' differences.

This seems a bit vague. Let's think differently.

Since I can query comparisons between ORs of pairs, maybe I can use these queries to sort or partially sort the permutation based on their binary representations.

But sorting would take too many queries, and I have a limited number.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation by comparing their ORs.

Wait, but I can't directly ask for the values; I can only compare ORs of pairs.

Let me consider that for any four indices a, b, c, d, I can ask whether (p_a | p_b) <, =, or > (p_c | p_d).

I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the relative values of p_i.

One idea is to fix some indices and compare against others to find the largest and smallest elements.

For example, I can try to find the maximum value in the permutation by comparing ORs that include that maximum value.

Similarly, finding the minimum value might help in determining the pair with maximum XOR.

Let me try to outline a step-by-step approach:

1. Find the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

- To do this, I can iterate through the indices and compare ORs involving a fixed index and the current max index with a new index.

- For example, start with max_index = 0.

- For each i from 0 to n-1:

- Ask ? 0 max_index i i

- If (p_0 | p_max_index) < (p_i | p_i), then p_i > p_max_index, so set max_index = i

- This should help me find the index with the maximum p_i.

2. Once I have the index with the maximum value, I need to find the index with the value that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the highest possible XOR.

- This might be the minimum value, but I'm not sure.

- Alternatively, it could be the value that differs from the maximum value in as many high-order bits as possible.

3. To find such a value, I might need to find the value that has the smallest number of bits in common with the maximum value, especially in the high-order positions.

- This sounds complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any number x, the number that maximizes x XOR y is the number y that has all bits different from x.

- In other words, y = x XOR (2^n - 1), where n is the number of bits.

- But since the numbers are from 0 to n-1, and n can be up to 10^4, which is 14 bits, this might not be directly applicable.

- Also, since it's a permutation, all values are unique.

- So, the pair with maximum XOR would be the two numbers that differ in the highest possible bits.

- To find such a pair, perhaps I can find the smallest and largest numbers in the permutation and see if their XOR is maximum.

- But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Let me take an example:

Suppose n=4, and p = [0,1,2,3]

- p in binary: 000, 001, 010, 011

- Possible XORs:

- 0 XOR 1 = 1

- 0 XOR 2 = 2

- 0 XOR 3 = 3

- 1 XOR 2 = 3

- 1 XOR 3 = 2

- 2 XOR 3 = 1

- So, the maximum XOR is 3, achieved by pairs (0,3), (1,2), etc.

- In this case, choosing the smallest and largest doesn't necessarily give the maximum XOR.

- 0 XOR 3 = 3, which is maximum.

- 1 XOR 2 = 3, also maximum.

- So, in this case, multiple pairs achieve the maximum XOR.

Another example:

n=3, p=[0,1,2]

- p in binary: 00, 01, 10

- Possible XORs:

- 0 XOR 1 = 1

- 0 XOR 2 = 2

- 1 XOR 2 = 3

- So, the maximum XOR is 3, achieved by (1,2).

- Here, choosing the smallest and largest would be 0 and 2, which gives XOR=2, which is not maximum.

- So, in this case, choosing smallest and largest doesn't give the maximum XOR.

Hence, my initial assumption that choosing the smallest and largest values would give the maximum XOR is incorrect.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

XOR maximizes the number of differing bits.

So, to maximize XOR, I need two numbers that differ in as many bits as possible.

In a permutation from 0 to n-1, the numbers cover all possible values in that range.

I need to find two numbers in this range that have the maximum possible XOR.

Wait, but since I don't know the actual values of p_i, I need to find indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximum.

But I can't look up p_i directly; I can only compare ORs of pairs.

So, I need to find a way to identify such a pair using comparisons of ORs.

I need to think about how OR comparisons can give me information about the relative sizes or binary representations of the p_i.

Let me consider that for any two numbers, their OR will have bits set if either number has that bit set.

So, if I have two numbers with high-order bits set, their OR will have those bits set.

By comparing ORs of pairs, I can get information about which pairs have higher or lower OR values.

But I need to relate this back to XOR.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, for n=2, it simply outputs indices 0 and 1, which makes sense because with only two elements, that's the only possible pair.

For n > 2, it first finds the max_index by iterating through the indices and comparing ORs involving the current max_index and a new index.

Specifically, it starts with max_index = 0, and for each i from 0 to n-1, it asks ? 0 max_index 0 i.

If (p_0 | p_max_index) < (p_0 | p_i), then it sets max_index = i.

This seems like a way to find the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, but p_0 | p_max_index vs p_0 | p_i.

If p_i > p_max_index, then p_0 | p_i might not necessarily be greater than p_0 | p_max_index, depending on the bits of p_0.

Hmm, this seems flawed.

Wait, let's think about this.

Suppose p_0 is the maximum value.

Then, p_0 | p_max_index would be p_0, and p_0 | p_i would also be p_0 for any i.

So, the comparison would be equal, and max_index wouldn't change.

Alternatively, if p_0 is not the maximum, then p_i could be larger, but p_0 | p_i might still be equal to p_0 | p_max_index.

This seems like a weak way to find the maximum value.

Maybe I need to adjust this approach.

Let me consider a different way to find the maximum value.

Perhaps I can fix one index and compare the ORs involving that index with different pairs.

Wait, maybe I need to find the maximum value by comparing ORs that include that value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum value by finding the value that, when OR'd with any other value, doesn't decrease.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me try to find the maximum value in the permutation using queries.

One way to find the maximum value is to iterate through all indices and find the one with the highest p_i.

But since I can only compare ORs of pairs, I need to find a way to compare individual p_i values indirectly.

Wait, perhaps I can compare p_i and p_j by comparing (p_a | p_i) and (p_a | p_j) for some fixed a.

If I choose a such that p_a is known or fixed, maybe I can infer the relative values of p_i and p_j.

But in this approach, it's not clear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a way to sort the p_i values using queries.

But sorting would require too many queries, more than 3n.

I need a more efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position of the maximum value by comparing ORs in a smart way.

Let me look back at the reference solution.

It seems that it tries to find the max_index by comparing ? 0 max_index 0 i for each i.

Then, it finds min_indices by comparing ? max_index min_indices[0] max_index i for each i.

Finally, it selects min_index from min_indices by comparing ? min_index min_index min_index i for each i in min_indices.

Then, it outputs ! max_index min_index.

I need to verify if this approach correctly finds a pair with maximum XOR.

Let me try to understand what this is doing.

First, it finds max_index by iterating through i and comparing ? 0 max_index 0 i.

If (p_0 | p_max_index) < (p_0 | p_i), set max_index = i.

This seems like a way to find the maximum p_i, assuming that p_0 is not the maximum.

But as I thought earlier, this might not always work, because p_0 | p_i could be equal to p_0 | p_max_index even if p_i > p_max_index, depending on the bits of p_0.

However, perhaps in the context of the entire permutation being a permutation of 0 to n-1, this approach works.

I need to verify this with some examples.

Let's take n=4, p=[0,3,1,2]

From the example in the problem statement:

- Step 1: Find max_index

- Start with max_index=0

- Compare ? 0 0 0 1: (p0 | p0)=0 | 0=0 vs (p0 | p1)=0 | 3=3 -> "<", set max_index=1

- Compare ? 0 1 0 2: (p0 | p1)=0 | 3=3 vs (p0 | p2)=0 | 1=1 -> ">", no change

- Compare ? 0 1 0 3: (p0 | p1)=0 | 3=3 vs (p0 | p3)=0 | 2=2 -> ">", no change

- So, max_index=1 (p1=3)

- Step 2: Find min_indices by comparing ? 1 min_indices[0]=1 1 i for each i

- Compare ? 1 1 1 0: (p1 | p1)=3 | 3=3 vs (p1 | p0)=3 | 0=3 -> "=", add 0 to min_indices

- Compare ? 1 1 1 2: (p1 | p1)=3 vs (p1 | p2)=3 | 1=3 -> "=", add 2 to min_indices

- Compare ? 1 1 1 3: (p1 | p1)=3 vs (p1 | p3)=3 | 2=3 -> "=", add 3 to min_indices

- So, min_indices=[1,0,2,3]

- Step 3: Find min_index among min_indices by comparing ? min_index min_index min_index i

- Start with min_index=1

- Compare ? 1 1 1 0: (p1 | p1)=3 vs (p1 | p0)=3 -> "=", no change

- Compare ? 1 1 1 2: 3 vs 3 -> "=", no change

- Compare ? 1 1 1 3: 3 vs 3 -> "=", no change

- So, min_index=1

- Output ! 1 1

Wait, but in the example, it outputs ! 3 2.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in the reference solution, after finding max_index and min_indices, it selects min_index as the first element of min_indices, but then it has an additional step to find the correct min_index.

Looking back at the code:

min_indices = [max_index]

for i in range(0, n):

res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)

if res == '<':

min_indices = [i]

elif res == '=':

min_indices.append(i)

Then:

min_index = min_indices[0]

for i in min_indices:

if i == max_index:

continue

res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)

if res == '=':

min_index = i

So, in the example:

min_indices = [1,0,2,3]

Then, min_index = 1

Compare ? 1 1 1 0: (p1 | p1)=3 vs (p1 | p0)=3 -> "=", set min_index=0

Then, compare ? 0 0 0 2: (p0 | p0)=0 vs (p0 | p2)=1 -> "<", no change

Then, compare ? 0 0 0 3: 0 vs 2 -> "<", no change

So, min_index=0

Then, output ! 1 0

But in the example, it outputs ! 3 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution or in my understanding.

Let me try to trace the code with the example.

Given p=[0,3,1,2]

Step 1: Find max_index

- Start with max_index=0

- Compare ? 0 0 0 1: (0|0)=0 < (0|3)=3 -> "<", set max_index=1

- Compare ? 0 1 0 2: (0|1)=1 < (0|1)=1 -> "=", no change

- Compare ? 0 1 0 3: (0|1)=1 < (0|2)=2 -> "<", set max_index=3

So, max_index=3 (p3=2)

Step 2: Find min_indices by comparing ? 3 min_indices[0]=3 3 i for each i

- Compare ? 3 3 3 0: (2|2)=2 vs (2|0)=2 -> "=", add 0 to min_indices

- Compare ? 3 0 3 1: (2|0)=2 vs (2|3)=3 -> "<", set min_indices=[1]

- Compare ? 3 1 3 2: (2|1)=3 vs (2|2)=2 -> ">", no change

So, min_indices=[1]

- Then, min_index=1

- No need to compare further since there's only one in min_indices

- Output ! 3 1

But in the example, it outputs ! 3 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or in my tracing.

Looking back at the problem statement's example:

Input:

2

<

=

>

Output:

? 0 2 3 1

? 1 1 2 3

? 1 2 0 3

! 3 2

! 0 1

Wait, in the example interaction, it outputs ! 3 2 for n=4 and ! 0 1 for n=2.

But according to my tracing, for n=4, it should output ! 3 1, but in the example, it's ! 3 2.

So, perhaps the reference solution is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the reference solution.

Looking back at the code:

def func_3():

n = int(input())

if n == 2:

func_2(0, 1)

return

max_index = 0

for i in range(0, n):

res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)

if res == '<':

max_index = i

min_indices = [max_index]

for i in range(0, n):

res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)

if res == '<':

min_indices = [i]

elif res == '=':

min_indices.append(i)

min_index = min_indices[0]

for i in min_indices:

if i == max_index:

continue

res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)

if res == '=':

min_index = i

func_2(max_index, min_index)

So, in the second loop, it's comparing ? max_index min_indices[0] max_index i

Wait, in the first loop, it's comparing ? 0 max_index 0 i

In the second loop, ? max_index min_indices[0] max_index i

And in the third loop, ? min_index min_index min_index i

Let me try to trace this again for n=4, p=[0,3,1,2]

Step 1: Find max_index

- Start with max_index=0

- Compare ? 0 0 0 1: (0|0)=0 < (0|3)=3 -> "<", set max_index=1

- Compare ? 0 1 0 2: (0|1)=1 < (0|1)=1 -> "=", no change

- Compare ? 0 1 0 3: (0|1)=1 < (0|2)=2 -> "<", set max_index=3

So, max_index=3 (p3=2)

Step 2: Find min_indices by comparing ? 3 min_indices[0]=3 3 i for each i

- min_indices = [3]

- Compare ? 3 3 3 0: (2|2)=2 vs (2|0)=2 -> "=", add 0 to min_indices -> [3,0]

- Compare ? 3 3 3 1: (2|2)=2 vs (2|3)=3 -> "<", set min_indices=[1]

- Compare ? 3 1 3 2: (2|1)=3 vs (2|2)=2 -> ">", no change

So, min_indices=[1]

Step 3: Find min_index among min_indices

- min_index = 1

- For i in min_indices: only 1

- So, no further comparison

- Output ! 3 1

But in the example, it outputs ! 3 2.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the reference solution.

Alternatively, maybe the reference solution is trying to find a pair where one is the maximum and the other is the one that maximizes XOR with the maximum.

In this case, p3=2 and p2=1, and 2 XOR 1 = 3, which is maximum.

But according to my tracing, min_indices should be [1], and it outputs ! 3 1, which would be p3=2 and p1=3, and 2 XOR 3 = 1, which is not maximum.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, p3=2 and p1=3, 2 XOR 3 = 1.

But the maximum XOR is 3, achieved by (2 XOR 1) and (3 XOR 1).

So, the reference solution seems incorrect in this case.

Perhaps the approach is flawed.

I need to think of a different strategy.

Let me consider that for any permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR is achieved by pairing numbers that differ in the highest possible bits.

To find such a pair, I need to identify two numbers with the most significant differing bits.

One way to do this is to find the maximum and minimum values, but as I saw in earlier examples, that doesn't always work.

Another approach is to find the two numbers that have the highest Hamming distance in their binary representations.

But since I can only ask comparisons of ORs, I need to find a way to extract information about the binary representations using OR comparisons.

Wait, perhaps I can determine the highest bit position where the numbers differ.

Starting from the most significant bit, I can try to group numbers based on whether that bit is set or not.

But since I can't directly access the bits, I need to find a way to compare ORs to infer the bit values.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that for any two numbers, their OR will have bits set if either number has that bit set.

So, if I can find the numbers that have the highest bits set, their OR will have those bits set.

By comparing ORs, I can determine which groups of numbers have certain bits set.

This sounds similar to finding the maximum value, but I need to generalize it to find the pair with maximum XOR.

Maybe I can find the number with the highest leading bit set and pair it with the number that has that bit unset.

But again, I need a way to determine which numbers have which bits set using only OR comparisons.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that for any bit position, I can try to find numbers that have that bit set by OR-ing them with a number that has only that bit set.

But since I don't know the bit positions directly, I need another way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through bit positions from high to low and try to partition the numbers based on whether they have that bit set or not.

This sounds like a sorting or grouping based on bits.

But I need to do this indirectly using OR comparisons.

This seems too involved, and I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that the maximum XOR will be equal to the maximum possible value in the permutation, which is n-1, if n-1 and 0 are in the permutation.

Wait, for n=4, n-1=3, and 0 XOR 3 = 3, which is the maximum possible XOR.

Similarly, for n=3, n-1=2, and 2 XOR 1=3, which is the maximum.

Wait, but in binary, 2 is 10 and 1 is 01, XOR is 11 which is 3.

So, perhaps pairing the maximum value with 0 always gives the maximum XOR.

But in the earlier example where n=3, p=[0,1,2], pairing 2 (n-1) with 0 gives XOR=2, but pairing 1 with 2 gives XOR=3, which is higher.

Wait, that contradicts my assumption.

So, pairing n-1 with 0 doesn't always give the maximum XOR.

In that case, perhaps I need to pair the maximum value with the value that has the most bits differing from it.

To find such a value, I need to find the value that, when XORed with the maximum, gives the highest possible value.

This would be the value that differs from the maximum in as many high-order bits as possible.

But without knowing the bit representations, it's hard to determine which value that is.

Wait, perhaps I can find the value that is as small as possible in terms of binary value, and pair it with the maximum.

But in the earlier example, pairing 2 (10) with 0 (00) gives XOR=2, while pairing 2 (10) with 1 (01) gives XOR=3.

So, pairing with 1 gives a higher XOR than pairing with 0.

Hence, perhaps I need to pair the maximum with the value that
