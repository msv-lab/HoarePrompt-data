Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board, and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers.

First, I need to understand what exactly is happening here. For example, if n is 12, the numbers are 1 to 12. Then, each number is replaced by the sum of its digits:

- 1 -> 1

- 2 -> 2

- 3 -> 3

- 4 -> 4

- 5 -> 5

- 6 -> 6

- 7 -> 7

- 8 -> 8

- 9 -> 9

- 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1

- 11 -> 1 + 1 = 2

- 12 -> 1 + 2 = 3

Now, summing these up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3 = 51, which matches the example.

So, the task is to compute this sum for any given n, where n can be up to 200,000, and there can be up to 10,000 test cases.

First thoughts:

- A brute-force approach where, for each n, I iterate from 1 to n, split each number into its digits, sum them, and add to a total sum, would be too slow because n can be up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000. That would be 2 * 10^10 operations, which is way too much.

- So, I need a smarter way to compute this sum quickly.

Looking for a smarter approach:

- I need to find a way to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n efficiently.

- One way to do this is to precompute the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum possible n, which is 2 * 10^5.

- But even better, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to calculate this sum without iterating through each number.

Exploring mathematical formulas:

- I recall that the sum of digits has some patterns, especially in relation to the number of digits and the place values.

- For example, in numbers from 1 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the tens and units places.

- But since n can be up to 200,000, which is up to 6 digits, I need a general formula.

- After some research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula involving floor divisions and remainders, but it's a bit complex.

- Alternatively, I can think of precomputing the sum of digits up to each number and store it in an array, then for each query, I can just retrieve the precomputed sum.

Precomputing the sum:

- Let's define an array pd where pd[i] is the sum of digits from 1 to i.

- Then, pd[n] would be the answer for each test case.

- To compute pd[i] efficiently, I can use the relation: pd[i] = pd[i-1] + sum of digits of i.

- This way, I can compute pd[i] for all i up to 2 * 10^5 in O(log i) per i, which should be acceptable since log i is up to 6 for i up to 200,000.

Implementing the precomputation:

- Initialize pd[0] = 0.

- For each i from 1 to 2*10^5:

- Compute the sum of digits of i.

- pd[i] = pd[i-1] + sum of digits of i.

- This way, pd[n] will hold the sum of digits from 1 to n.

Implementing sum of digits:

- To compute the sum of digits of a number, I can convert it to a string and sum the integer values of each character.

- This is simple and efficient enough for our purposes.

Handling multiple test cases:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, read n and output pd[n].

Efficiency:

- Precomputation: O(max_n * log max_n), which is 2*10^5 * 6 = 1.2*10^6 operations.

- Per test case: O(1), since it's just accessing an array element.

- For t=10^4, the total time should be acceptable, especially since the precomputation is done only once.

Edge cases:

- n=1: sum should be 1.

- n=9: sum should be 45 (1+2+...+9).

- n=10: sum should be 46 (45 + 1).

- n=11: sum should be 47 (46 + 2).

- n=200000: need to ensure no overflow, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.

Memory:

- pd array of size 2*10^5 + 1, which is manageable.

Potential optimizations:

- Since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, and the time limit is only 0.5 seconds, efficiency is crucial.

- Precomputation helps in reducing the time per test case to O(1).

- Ensure that the implementation is as optimized as possible.

Given this approach, I believe the provided program is correct.

Final Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. The challenge lies in handling large values of n (up to 200,000) and multiple test cases (up to 10,000) within a tight time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test.

        pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. The challenge lies in handling large values of n (up to 200,000) and multiple test cases (up to 10,000) within a tight time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test.

## Approach

1. **Precomputation**:
   - We pre
