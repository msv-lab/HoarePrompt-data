Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to print one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so the problem is asking me to check if every possible combination of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet is a subsequence of s. If not, I need to provide one such combination that isn't a subsequence of s.

Let's think about the constraints. n can be from 1 to 26, and k can be from 1 to 26. The string s can be up to 1000 characters, and the total sum of m (the length of s) over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6, which is a million. So, efficiency is key here, especially since t can be up to 10^5.

First, I need a way to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters. Since k can be up to 26 and n up to 26, the number of possible strings can be up to 26^26, which is astronomically large. Clearly, generating all these strings and checking each one if it's a subsequence of s is not feasible due to time constraints.

So, I need a smarter way to approach this problem. I need to find a way to determine if there's at least one string of length n that isn't a subsequence of s, without generating all possible strings.

Let me think about this differently. If s contains all possible subsequences of length n using the first k letters, then for any sequence of n letters from the first k, there should be a way to find those letters in order in s.

One way to approach this is to consider the positions of each letter in s. For each of the first k letters, I can keep a list of their positions in s.

Then, to check if a particular string is a subsequence, I can iterate through the string and try to find positions in s that are in increasing order.

But again, checking each possible string individually is too slow.

I need a way to check if s has all possible combinations of length n.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of distinct subsequences.

The total number of possible strings of length n using k letters is k^n.

If the number of distinct subsequences of length n in s using only the first k letters is equal to k^n, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.

But calculating the number of distinct subsequences of length n in s is still too slow if done naively.

I need a better approach.

Let's consider the positions of each of the k letters in s.

For each letter, I can have a list of its positions in s.

Then, to form a subsequence of length n, I need to choose one position for each letter in the sequence, and ensure that the positions are in increasing order.

But again, iterating over all possible combinations is not feasible.

Maybe I can think about it in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me consider dp[i][j], where i is the current position in s, and j is the current position in the subsequence.

But that seems too slow as well, given the constraints.

I need a more efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph.

Let me treat each of the k letters as nodes, and create a graph where an edge from letter A to letter B exists if in s, there is a position where B comes after A.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a string s, and I want to know if every possible sequence of n letters from the first k letters is present as a subsequence in s.

This is equivalent to saying that for any sequence of n letters from the first k, there exists a way to choose positions in s where these letters appear in the same order.

To check if all possible sequences are present, I can think about the minimal set of sequences that need to be present.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me consider the opposite: how can I find a sequence of n letters that is not a subsequence of s?

If I can find such a sequence, then the answer is NO, and I can print that sequence.

If I can't find any such sequence, then the answer is YES.

So, perhaps I should try to find a sequence that is missing from s.

But again, with k and n up to 26, generating all possible sequences is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to find a missing sequence if it exists.

One idea is to try to construct a sequence that cannot be a subsequence of s.

I can start by choosing a letter that doesn't appear enough times in s.

Wait, no, that might not work, because the sequence depends on the order.

Another idea is to use the fact that if s has all possible subsequences, then for any sequence of n letters, there should be a way to find those letters in order in s.

Perhaps I can find the longest common subsequence or something similar, but that seems too vague.

Let me think about the positions again.

For each letter from the first k letters, I can have a list of its positions in s.

Then, to form a subsequence of length n, I need to pick one position from each letter in the sequence, ensuring that the positions are in increasing order.

Wait, no, in a subsequence, I don't pick one position from each letter; instead, for a specific sequence, I pick positions corresponding to each letter in that sequence, in order.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of sequences needed to cover all possibilities.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible sequences: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

I need to check if all of these are subsequences of "abba".

"aa": positions 1 and 3 (a at position 1 and a at position 3)

"ab": positions 1 and 2 (a at position 1, b at position 2)

"ba": positions 2 and 3 (b at position 2, a at position 3)

"bb": positions 2 and 4 (b at position 2 and b at position 4)

So, all are present.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Possible sequences:

"aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Check if all are subsequences.

"aa": positions? a at position 1, need another a, but only one a is present. So, "aa" is not a subsequence.

Hence, the answer is NO, and "aa" is printed.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Possible sequences: all combinations of a, b, c of length 3, like "aaa", "aab", "abc", etc.

Need to check if all of these are subsequences of "aabbccabab".

But in the output, it's NO, and "ccc" is provided, meaning "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

Indeed, "ccc" is not present as a subsequence because there are only two 'c's in s.

So, the task is to check if all possible sequences of length n using the first k letters are present as subsequences in s, and if not, provide one such sequence that isn't present.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to determine if there's at least one sequence missing.

I need to find a way to identify a missing sequence without generating and checking all possible sequences.

One approach could be to find the minimal sequence that isn't present.

But even that seems too slow for large n and k.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each letter appears in s.

If a particular letter appears fewer times than needed for all sequences, then some sequences are missing.

But I'm not sure how to apply that.

Let me consider that for a sequence of length n, if any letter appears less than ceil(n / count(letter in s)), then some sequences are missing.

But that seems too vague.

Another idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible sequences, then s must contain enough repetitions of each letter to cover all sequences.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider building a sequence step by step.

Start with the first letter; choose the smallest possible letter that can still lead to a valid sequence.

Then, choose the next letter, and so on.

If at any point, I can't choose a letter that follows the previous one, then I've found a missing sequence.

But I need to define this more clearly.

Perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Start with the sequence consisting of the smallest letters.

If "a" appears at least n times, use "a"s.

If not, try sequences that have as many "a"s as possible, then proceed to "b", and so on.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through s and keep track of how many times each letter can still be used for sequences.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each possible sequence of length n using the first k letters, check if it's a subsequence of s.

- If all are present, print YES.

- If not, print NO and provide one missing sequence.

But as I thought earlier, this is too slow for large n and k.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the dual problem: find a sequence of length n that is not a subsequence of s.

If I can efficiently find such a sequence, then I can print NO and that sequence.

Otherwise, print YES.

So, the key is to efficiently find a sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

One way to do this is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

This way, I can ensure that I find a missing sequence without checking all possibilities.

To find the lexicographically smallest missing sequence, I can try to build the sequence step by step, always choosing the smallest possible letter at each step, ensuring that the chosen prefix isn't a subsequence of s.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider building the sequence one letter at a time.

Start with an empty sequence.

At each step, try to append the smallest possible letter that allows the sequence to potentially not be a subsequence of s.

But I need a way to determine if appending a particular letter could lead to a missing sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the positions where each letter appears in s, and for a given prefix of the sequence, find the earliest position in s where that prefix can be matched.

Then, for the next letter, I need to find a position after that matched position.

If I can't find such a position for a particular letter, then that letter can't be used to extend the sequence, and I can consider that sequence as missing.

But this still seems too slow for large n and k.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider precomputing for each letter the positions where it appears in s.

Then, for a given sequence, I can check if there's a way to pick positions in s that are in increasing order corresponding to the letters in the sequence.

But again, checking for all possible sequences is not feasible.

I need a way to identify a missing sequence without checking all possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if any letter appears fewer than n times, then sequences requiring that letter more times than it appears are missing.

But this is too simplistic and doesn't cover all cases.

For example, even if all letters appear at least n times, there might still be sequences that aren't subsequences of s.

So, that approach isn't sufficient.

Let me think about the number of distinct subsequences.

The total number of possible sequences is k^n.

If the number of distinct subsequences of s using only the first k letters is equal to k^n, then the answer is YES.

Otherwise, NO.

But calculating the number of distinct subsequences is still too slow for large n and k.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each position in the sequence (from 1 to n), and for each possible letter at that position, keep track of the earliest position in s where that letter can be chosen to form a valid subsequence up to that point.

- If at any point, for a particular sequence prefix, there's no way to choose the next letter, then that sequence is missing.

But implementing this seems complex and potentially too slow.

I need to find a more efficient way.

Let me consider binary search.

If I can binary search on the sequences, treating them lexicographically, and find a gap where a sequence is missing, then I can print that sequence.

But binary searching over k^n sequences is still too slow for large n and k.

I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph.

Let me create a graph where nodes represent the letters, and edges represent possible transitions from one letter to another in s.

But I'm not sure how that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can build a graph where nodes represent the state of the sequence being built, and edges represent appending a letter to the sequence.

Then, I can perform a BFS or DFS to find a sequence that isn't present.

But this seems too time-consuming for large n and k.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal sequence that isn't present.

I can try to find the lexicographically smallest sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

To do this, I can try to build the sequence step by step, choosing the smallest possible letter at each step, and only moving to the next letter if the current choice leads to a dead end.

This sounds similar to a BFS approach, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Here's an idea:

- Start with an empty sequence.

- At each step, try to append the smallest possible letter to the current prefix and check if that prefix can be a subsequence of s.

- If it can, continue; if not, that sequence is missing, and I can print it.

But I still need a way to efficiently check if a prefix can be a subsequence of s.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each letter the positions where it appears in s, and then for each prefix, keep track of the last position used, and try to find a position for the next letter that is after the last position.

This sounds promising.

Let me formalize this.

For each letter from the first k letters, create a list of positions where it appears in s.

Then, to check if a sequence is a subsequence of s, I can iterate through the sequence and for each letter, find the smallest position in its list that is greater than the position of the previous letter in the sequence.

If I can find such positions for all letters in the sequence, then it's a subsequence; otherwise, it's not.

Now, to find a missing sequence efficiently, I can try to build the sequence step by step, always choosing the smallest possible letter that allows the sequence to potentially not be a subsequence of s.

Here's how I can implement this:

1. Create a list of lists, where each sublist contains the positions of one of the first k letters in s.

2. Initialize a current position pointer to -1.

3. Start building the sequence from the empty prefix.

4. At each step, try to append the smallest letter that hasn't yet been used in the current prefix.

5. For each letter, check if there's a position in its list that is after the last position used in the previous step.

6. If such a position exists, proceed to the next step with that letter added to the prefix.

7. If no such position exists for any letter, then the current prefix cannot be extended, meaning that any sequence starting with this prefix is missing.

8. In that case, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence that starts with this prefix and hasn't been checked yet.

But this still seems too vague and potentially inefficient.

I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider a BFS approach.

- Start with an empty sequence.

- Enqueue the empty sequence.

- While the queue is not empty:

- Dequeue the current prefix.

- For each possible letter from 'a' to the k-th letter:

- Try to append this letter to the current prefix to form a new prefix.

- Check if this new prefix is a subsequence of s.

- If it is, enqueue this new prefix.

- If it's not, then this prefix cannot be extended further, and any sequence starting with this prefix is missing.

- Since we're using BFS and processing prefixes in lexicographical order, the first missing prefix we find will correspond to the lexicographically smallest missing sequence.

This approach seems promising because BFS ensures that we're exploring sequences in order, and as soon as we find a prefix that can't be extended, we can construct the missing sequence from that prefix.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Given that n and k can be up to 26, and t can be up to 10^5, I need to make sure that the per-test-case time is acceptable.

In the BFS approach, in the worst case, I might have to explore all possible sequences, which is k^n, but in practice, I'll find a missing sequence much earlier.

Moreover, I need an efficient way to check if a prefix is a subsequence of s.

To check if a prefix is a subsequence, I can keep track of the last position used for the previous letter and find the next position for the current letter that is after the last position.

This can be done using binary search on the list of positions for each letter.

So, for each letter, I can precompute a list of positions where it appears in s, sorted in ascending order.

Then, to check if a prefix is a subsequence, I can iterate through the prefix, maintaining the last position, and for each letter, use binary search to find the smallest position in its list that is greater than the last position.

If I can find such positions for all letters, the prefix is a subsequence; otherwise, it's not.

Now, implementing the BFS:

- Use a queue to store the current prefixes being explored.

- Start with the empty prefix.

- While the queue is not empty:

- Dequeue the current prefix.

- For each letter from 'a' to the k-th letter:

- Form a new prefix by appending this letter to the current prefix.

- Check if this new prefix is a subsequence of s.

- If it is, enqueue this new prefix.

- If it's not, then this prefix cannot be extended further, so any sequence starting with this prefix is missing.

- Since we're using BFS and processing prefixes in lexicographical order, the first missing prefix we find will correspond to the lexicographically smallest missing sequence.

- Therefore, as soon as we find a prefix that isn't a subsequence, we can construct the missing sequence by extending it to length n with 'a's or any other letters.

But I need to ensure that the sequence is of length n.

Wait, actually, in this approach, when I find a prefix that isn't a subsequence, it means that any sequence starting with this prefix isn't a subsequence.

So, I can take this prefix and extend it to length n by appending 'a's, for example.

But I need to make sure that the entire sequence isn't a subsequence of s.

Wait, no, because if the prefix isn't a subsequence, then no extension of it can be a subsequence.

So, I can safely take the prefix and extend it to length n with any letters, and it will be a missing sequence.

But to make it lexicographically smallest, I should extend it with 'a's.

Therefore, in the BFS approach, as soon as I find a prefix that isn't a subsequence, I can construct the missing sequence by extending it with 'a's to reach length n.

This seems efficient enough.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, k, m.

- Read s.

- Create lists of positions for each of the first k letters.

- Implement the BFS to find the first missing prefix.

- If no missing prefix is found, then all sequences are present, so print YES.

- If a missing prefix is found, print NO and then the missing sequence constructed by extending the prefix with 'a's to reach length n.

But considering the constraints, t can be up to 10^5, and per test case time needs to be efficient.

The main time-consuming part is the BFS, but since n is up to 26, and k is up to 26, the number of nodes in the BFS tree is manageable.

Each node corresponds to a prefix of length up to n, and at each step, we have up to k choices for the next letter.

So, the total number of nodes is up to k^n, but in practice, we'll find a missing prefix much earlier.

Moreover, with careful implementation, we can make this efficient.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

cnt = 0

cur = 0

ans = ''

for ss in s:

cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')

if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:

cur += 1 << cur_ss

if cur == (1 << k) - 1:

cnt += 1

cur = 0

ans += ss

if cnt >= n:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

tmp = ''

for i in range(k):

if cur & 1 << i == 0:

tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)

break

ans += tmp

ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)

print(ans)

So, the code reads t, then for each test case, reads n, k, m, and s.

Then, it initializes cnt to 0, cur to 0, and ans to an empty string.

It iterates through each character in s:

- Converts the character to its corresponding bit in cur.

- If the bit for that character isn't set in cur, sets it.

- If cur becomes all bits set for the first k letters, increments cnt and resets cur to 0, and appends the current character to ans.

After processing s, it checks if cnt >= n. If yes, prints YES; else, prints NO, finds the first letter not present in cur, appends it to ans, and appends 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and prints ans.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

The logic here is trying to count how many times it can collect all k letters in s, but that's not directly related to checking if all possible sequences of length n are present as subsequences.

In the code, cur is used as a bit vector to track which letters have been seen so far. When all k letters are seen, cnt is incremented, and cur is reset.

But this doesn't relate to checking for all possible sequences of length n.

For example, in the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

The code would process s:

- s[0]='a': cur = 1

- s[1]='b': cur = 3 (binary 11), which is equal to (1<<2)-1=3, so cnt=1, cur=0, ans='a'

- s[2]='b': cur=2

- s[3]='a': cur=3, cnt=2, cur=0, ans='ab'

Then, cnt=2 >= n=2, so it prints YES.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Processing s:

- s[0]='a': cur=1

- s[1]='b': cur=3, cnt=1, cur=0, ans='a'

- s[2]='b': cur=2

cnt=1 >= n=2 is False, so prints NO.

Then, finds that cur=2, which has bit 1 not set (assuming k=2), so tmp='a', ans='ab'+'a'+'a'*(2-1-1)='aba'+'a'*0='aba'

But according to the sample output, it should print 'aa'.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Moreover, in the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Processing s:

- s[0]='a': cur=1

- s[1]='a': cur still 1

- s[2]='b': cur=3

- s[3]='b': cur=3

- s[4]='c': cur=7, cnt=1, cur=0, ans='a'

- s[5]='c': cur=4

- s[6]='a': cur=5

- s[7]='b': cur=7, cnt=2, cur=0, ans='aac'

- s[8]='a': cur=1

- s[9]='b': cur=3

cnt=2 >= n=3 is False, so prints NO.

Then, cur=3, which has bit 0 set (a) and bit 1 set (b), so no letter not present in cur, but k=3, so letter 'c' is not present in cur.

So, tmp='c', ans='aac'+'c'+'a'*(3-2-1)='aacca'+'a'*0='aacca'

But according to the sample output, it should print 'ccc'.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
