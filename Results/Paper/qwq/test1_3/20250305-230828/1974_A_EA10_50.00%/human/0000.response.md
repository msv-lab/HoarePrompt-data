Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5x3=15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1 cells and others are 2x2 cells. The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 15 cells. A 1x1 icon takes one cell, and a 2x2 icon takes four cells. Importantly, each cell can be occupied by no more than one icon, which makes sense.

So, for each test case, I'm given the number of 1x1 icons (x) and the number of 2x2 icons (y), and I need to figure out the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to calculate the total number of cells required and then divide by the number of cells per screen to find the number of screens needed. However, it's not that straightforward because of the different sizes of the icons and how they fit into the grid.

For example, in a 5x3 grid, if I place a 2x2 icon, it will cover four cells in a square. But since the grid is 5 rows and 3 columns, I need to consider how many 2x2 icons can fit into this grid without overlapping and without leaving fractional icons.

Let me visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, the grid looks like:

A1 B1 C1

A2 B2 C2

A3 B3 C3

A4 B4 C4

A5 B5 C5

A 2x2 icon can be placed starting at positions A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, C4.

Wait, actually, a 2x2 icon needs two rows and two columns. So, for example, starting at A1 would cover A1, A2, B1, B2.

Similarly, starting at A2 would cover A2, A3, B2, B3.

And so on.

So, in a 5x3 grid, how many 2x2 positions are there?

In rows: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 possible starting positions.

In columns: 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 possible starting positions.

So, total 4 x 2 = 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons.

But actually, looking back at my earlier list, I think I miscounted. Let's see:

Starting at A1: covers A1, A2, B1, B2

Starting at A2: covers A2, A3, B2, B3

Starting at B1: covers B1, B2, C1, C2

Starting at B2: covers B2, B3, C2, C3

Starting at B3: covers B3, B4, C3, C4

Starting at B4: covers B4, B5, C4, C5

Starting at C1: covers C1, C2, but there's no D row, so invalid.

Wait, columns are A, B, C, and rows are 1 through 5.

So, actually, for 2x2 icons, the top-left cell can be at positions:

A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4.

But C1 to C4 can't have 2x2 icons because there's no D row.

Wait, no, the 2x2 icon spans two rows and two columns. So, starting at C1 would cover C1, C2, D1, D2, but there is no D row, so C1 is invalid. Similarly, C2 would cover C2, C3, D2, D3, which is also invalid. Same for C3 and C4.

So, only positions A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4 are valid for 2x2 icons.

So, total 6 positions for 2x2 icons.

Wait, let's recalculate:

In rows: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 positions (rows 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5)

In columns: 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 positions (columns A-B, B-C)

So, total 4 x 2 = 8 positions.

But earlier I listed only 6, perhaps I missed some.

Wait, starting at A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

A2: A2,A3,B2,B3

B1: B1,B2,C1,C2

B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

B3: B3,B4,C3,C4

B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

So, that's 6 positions.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it should be 8.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in columns, it's A-B and B-C.

So, starting at A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

Starting at A2: A2,A3,B2,B3

Starting at B1: B1,B2,C1,C2

Starting at B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

Starting at B3: B3,B4,C3,C4

Starting at B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

So, that's 6 positions.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the column positions.

Actually, in columns, from A to B is one position, B to C is another.

But in rows, from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.

So, starting at A1, A2, A3, A4: but A3 and A4 would go out of bounds because A3 would cover A3,A4,B3,B4, but B3 and B4 are valid.

Wait, no, B row only goes up to B5, so A3 would cover A3,A4,B3,B4, which are all valid.

Similarly, A4 would cover A4,A5,B4,B5.

So, total starting positions for 2x2 icons are A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4.

That's 8 positions.

But earlier I only listed 6. Let me list them again:

A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

A2: A2,A3,B2,B3

A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

A4: A4,A5,B4,B5

B1: B1,B2,C1,C2

B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

B3: B3,B4,C3,C4

B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

So, indeed, 8 positions.

But in the earlier note, it seems only 6 are shown. Maybe there was a mistake there.

Moving on, each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

So, for y 2x2 icons, they take up 4*y cells.

The remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, total cells used by 2x2 icons is 4*y, and the remaining cells are 15 - 4*y, which can be used for 1x1 icons.

But wait, it's not necessarily that we place all 2x2 icons first.

We need to optimize the placement to minimize the number of screens.

So, perhaps it's better to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, since they take more space.

Each screen can hold at most floor(15/4) = 3 2x2 icons, but actually, because of the grid structure, it might be less.

Wait, in the grid, if I place three 2x2 icons, they might overlap.

Wait, no, in the grid, due to the positions, they might not overlap, but we need to see the actual positions.

From earlier, there are 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons.

But not all of them can be placed simultaneously without overlapping.

For example, placing one at A1 and another at A2 would overlap in A2.

Similarly, placing at A1 and B1 would overlap in B1.

So, we need to select positions that don't overlap.

Let me try to find the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 icons.

Looking at the positions:

A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

A2: A2,A3,B2,B3

A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

A4: A4,A5,B4,B5

B1: B1,B2,C1,C2

B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

B3: B3,B4,C3,C4

B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

So, if I place one at A1, I cannot place at A2 or B1 or B2.

Similarly, placing at A3 would conflict with A4 and B3 and B4.

So, perhaps placing at A1 and A3, and B2 and B4.

Wait, A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

Do these overlap? Let's see:

A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

Looking at the cells:

A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,C2,C3,C4,C5

No overlaps in the selected positions.

So, four 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, but earlier I thought only three can be placed.

But according to this, four can be placed.

But in reality, in a 5x3 grid, is that possible?

Let me visualize:

A1 A2 A3 A4 A5

B1 B2 B3 B4 B5

C1 C2 C3 C4 C5

Placing 2x2 at A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

At A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

At B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

At B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

Looking at the cells used:

A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,C2,C3,C4,C5

No overlaps, so four 2x2 icons can be placed on one screen.

But earlier I thought it was only three.

Wait, but in the note, it shows only three 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, in the first note, it shows one screen with one 2x2 icon and three 1x1 icons.

In the third note, it shows two screens, each with four 2x2 icons.

Wait, but in the first note, it's y=1, which is one 2x2 icon, and x=1, which is one 1x1 icon.

In that case, placing one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon on one screen is possible.

Similarly, in the third test case, with x=12 and y=4, it's using two screens.

Given that each screen can hold up to four 2x2 icons, but in this case, with y=4, it's using two screens.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the grid doesn't allow four 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, it seems possible to place four 2x2 icons without overlapping.

But perhaps in reality, it's not possible due to the grid structure.

Wait, looking back, in the positions listed, placing at A1, A3, B2, and B4 doesn't overlap.

So, four 2x2 icons can be placed on one screen.

But in the third test case, with y=4, it's using two screens.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, in the third test case, x=12 and y=4.

Each screen can hold up to four 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

But in this case, with y=4, it's using two screens.

Wait, maybe the calculation is different.

Perhaps the number of screens needed is ceil(y / max_2x2_per_screen), and then check if there's enough space for the 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons together.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to four 2x2 icons, which would take up 4*4=16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, each 2x2 icon takes four cells, but placing multiple 2x2 icons may share cells, but in reality, they can't overlap.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, placing four 2x2 icons without overlapping uses 16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells, which is impossible.

So, there must be an error in the earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps only three 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Let me try placing three 2x2 icons.

For example, place one at A1: A1,A2,B1,B2

Place one at A3: A3,A4,B3,B4

Place one at B2: B2,B3,C2,C3

Now, cells used: A1,A2,A3,A4,B1,B2,B3,B4,C2,C3

Total cells used: 10 cells

Then, I can place more 1x1 icons in the remaining cells: A5,B5,C1,C4,C5

So, five remaining cells for 1x1 icons.

Similarly, if I try to place a fourth 2x2 icon, say at B4: B4,B5,C4,C5

But B4 is already used in the first three icons, so it's overlapping.

Wait, B4 is used in the A3 icon (B3,B4), and in the B2 icon (B3,B4), wait, no, A3 covers B3 and B4, and B2 covers B3 and B4, but in reality, B3 and B4 are already occupied by the first two icons.

So, perhaps only three 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Hence, each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

So, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y / 3).

Then, for each screen, after placing three 2x2 icons, there are 15 - 3*4 = 15 - 12 = 3 cells left for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen, 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons.

But in the first test case, x=1, y=1.

So, y=1, which is less than 3, so one screen is sufficient.

Place one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon, and there are 15 - 4 -1 = 10 cells left empty.

Which matches the first output of 1.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4.

Number of screens needed for y: ceil(4 / 3) = 2 screens.

Then, remaining cells for 1x1 icons: 2 screens * (15 - 3*4) = 2 * 3 = 6 cells.

But x=12, which is more than 6, so we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, perhaps in the third test case, the 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons can fit into two screens.

Let's see:

Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons.

But in this case, with y=4, we need two screens for the 2x2 icons (since ceil(4 / 3) = 2).

Then, in two screens, we can place up to 2 * 3 = 6 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

But we have x=12 1x1 icons, which is more than 6.

So, we need additional screens for the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 1x1 icons.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, ceil(6 / 15) = 1 additional screen.

Hence, total screens needed would be 2 + 1 = 3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe the way icons are placed allows for more efficient use of space.

Alternatively, perhaps the screen can hold more than three 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Wait, earlier I thought only three 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping, but perhaps there's a way to place four.

Wait, but in reality, four 2x2 icons would require 16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells, which is impossible without overlapping.

Hence, it's impossible to place four 2x2 icons on one screen.

Therefore, only three 2x2 icons per screen is possible.

Hence, for y=4, ceil(4 / 3) = 2 screens.

Then, in these two screens, we can place up to 2 * 3 = 6 1x1 icons.

But we have x=12 1x1 icons.

So, remaining 12 - 6 = 6 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, ceil(6 / 15) = 1 additional screen.

Hence, total screens needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, maybe the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons can be used more efficiently.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we place three 2x2 icons on one screen, which uses 12 cells (3*4=12), leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen: 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons.

In the third test case, y=4, which requires two screens (ceil(4 / 3)=2).

In these two screens, we can place up to 2 * 3 = 6 1x1 icons.

But we have x=12 1x1 icons.

So, 12 - 6 = 6 1x1 icons left.

Now, these remaining 6 1x1 icons can be placed on additional screens.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, ceil(6 / 15) = 1 additional screen.

Hence, total screens needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, perhaps there's a better way to arrange the icons.

Wait, maybe not all screens are fully used for 2x2 icons.

Perhaps it's better to maximize the use of 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons per screen.

Let me try to find a better arrangement.

Suppose I place three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons on the first screen, using all 15 cells.

Then, for the second screen, I place one 2x2 icon and nine 1x1 icons, using 4 + 9 = 13 cells.

Total screens used: 2.

This matches the sample output.

So, in this arrangement:

Screen 1: 3 2x2 icons + 3 1x1 icons

Screen 2: 1 2x2 icon + 9 1x1 icons

Total: 4 2x2 icons and 12 1x1 icons, using 2 screens.

So, in this case, it's possible to arrange them in 2 screens.

Hence, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.

Let me think about a general formula.

Let me denote:

- Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons.

- Alternatively, it can hold fewer 2x2 icons and more 1x1 icons, depending on the arrangement.

So, for y 2x2 icons, we need ceil(y / 3) screens.

Then, for x 1x1 icons, we need ceil(x / 15) screens.

But, since some screens can hold both 2x2 and 1x1 icons, we need to optimize the usage.

So, perhaps the total number of screens needed is max(ceil(y / 3), ceil(x / 15)).

But in the third test case, ceil(y / 3) = ceil(4 / 3) = 2, and ceil(x / 15) = ceil(12 / 15) = 1.

So, max(2,1) = 2, which matches the sample output.

But wait, in this arrangement, in two screens, we place 3+1=4 2x2 icons and 3+9=12 1x1 icons.

So, it works.

In another test case, say x=8, y=1.

ceil(y / 3) = 1, ceil(x / 15) = 1, so total screens = 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

ceil(0 / 3) = 0, ceil(15 / 15) = 1, so max(0,1) = 1 screen.

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in programming, ceil(0 / 3) would be 0, but we need at least one screen if there are any icons.

Wait, no, if y=0 and x=0, then no screens are needed.

But in the sample input, when x=0 and y=0, the output is 0.

But in the case when y=0 and x>0, ceil(x / 15) gives the number of screens needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, considering the combined usage.

So, each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons, or fewer 2x2 icons and more 1x1 icons accordingly.

So, for y 2x2 icons, we need s = ceil(y / 3) screens.

Then, these s screens can hold up to 3*s 1x1 icons.

If x <= 3*s, then s screens are sufficient.

Else, we need additional ceil((x - 3*s) / 15) screens.

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - 3*s)/15).

But in the third test case, y=4, s=ceil(4/3)=2, can hold up to 3*2=6 1x1 icons.

But x=12, so 12 - 6 = 6 > 0, so need ceil(6/15)=1 additional screen.

Total screens: 2 + 1 = 3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the screens can hold more 1x1 icons when fewer 2x2 icons are placed.

For example, if a screen has only two 2x2 icons, it can hold 15 - 8 = 7 1x1 icons.

Similarly, if it has one 2x2 icon, it can hold 15 - 4 = 11 1x1 icons.

So, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on screens used for 2x2 icons depends on how many 2x2 icons are placed on those screens.

Hence, the earlier assumption that each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons might not be accurate.

Perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of screens needed based on the total cell requirements.

Each 2x2 icon takes four cells, and each 1x1 icon takes one cell.

So, total cells needed: 4*y + x.

Total cells per screen: 15.

Hence, the minimal number of screens needed is ceil((4*y + x) / 15).

But, this doesn't consider the placement constraints of the icons on the grid.

For example, in the first test case, x=1, y=1, total cells needed: 4*1 + 1 = 5.

ceil(5 / 15) = 1 screen.

Which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4, total cells needed: 4*4 + 12 = 28.

ceil(28 / 15) = 2 screens.

Which matches the sample output.

In another test case, x=8, y=1: 4*1 + 8 = 12, ceil(12 / 15) = 1 screen.

Matches the sample.

x=15, y=0: 0 + 15 = 15, ceil(15 / 15) = 1 screen.

Matches the sample.

x=0, y=0: 0 + 0 = 0, ceil(0 / 15) = 0 screens.

Matches the sample.

x=0, y=9: 4*9 = 36, ceil(36 / 15) = 3 screens.

But in the sample input, y=9, x=0, output is 5 screens.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, in the sample input, the last test case is 0 9, output is 5.

According to ceil((4*9 + 0)/15) = ceil(36 / 15) = ceil(2.4) = 3 screens.

But the sample output is 5 screens.

So, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Hence, the total cell calculation doesn't account for the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons on the grid.

Perhaps because 2x2 icons cannot be placed arbitrarily; they need to be in specific positions without overlapping.

Hence, the earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps a better way is to iterate over the number of screens and check if the icons can be placed.

But that would be too time-consuming for t=10^4 test cases.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me think about maximizing the usage of 2x2 icons per screen.

Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons without overlapping, as previously determined.

Hence, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is at least ceil(y / 3).

Additionally, these screens can hold some 1x1 icons.

Each screen used for 2x2 icons can hold up to 15 - 4*number_of_2x2_icons 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, if it holds k 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 - 4*k 1x1 icons.

Our goal is to minimize the number of screens, so we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., use as many screens as ceil(y / 3), and in each screen, place up to three 2x2 icons and as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining cells.

Hence, the number of screens s = ceil(y / 3).

Then, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens is s * (15 - 4*3) = s * (15 - 12) = s * 3.

If x <= s * 3, then s screens are sufficient.

Else, we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The remaining 1x1 icons are x - s * 3.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

Hence, additional screens needed: ceil((x - s * 3)/15).

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s*3)/15).

In the third test case, y=4, s=ceil(4/3)=2.

Can hold up to 2 * 3 = 6 1x1 icons.

x=12, so 12 - 6 = 6 remaining 1x1 icons.

Additional screens needed: ceil(6/15)=1.

Hence, total screens: 2 + 1 = 3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the remaining 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screens as some 2x2 icons more efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps not all screens are used for three 2x2 icons.

Maybe some screens are used for fewer 2x2 icons and more 1x1 icons.

Let me consider that.

Suppose we have s screens, each holding up to three 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

Total 2x2 icons placed: up to 3*s.

But we need to place exactly y 2x2 icons.

Hence, s >= ceil(y / 3).

Also, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens is s * (15 - 4*min(3, y_per_screen)).

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to iterate over the number of screens and find the minimal s such that:

- We can place y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons on s screens.

- Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, for s screens:

- Maximum number of 2x2 icons: 3*s.

- Maximum number of 1x1 icons: s * (15 - 4*min(3, y_per_screen)).

But y_per_screen can vary.

This seems too involved for an efficient solution.

Perhaps I need to find a formula that directly calculates the minimal s.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1: x=1, y=1 → output=1

Total cells needed: 4*1 + 1=5.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, ceil(5/15)=1 screen.

But as we saw, this doesn't always hold, because in the last test case, x=0, y=9 → output=5.

According to ceil(36/15)=3, but output is 5.

So, perhaps the formula is ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - y)/15).

Wait, no.

Wait, in the last test case, y=9.

ceil(9 / 2)=5.

x=0, so 0 - 9 = -9, ceil(-9/15)=0.

Hence, total screens=5+0=5.

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third test case, y=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2.

x=12 - 4=8, ceil(8 / 15)=1.

Total screens=2+1=3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - 4*y)/15).

In the last test case, ceil(9 / 2)=5.

x - 4*y=0 - 36=-36, ceil(-36/15)=-36/-15=2.4, ceil(2.4)=3.

Total screens=5 + 3=8, which doesn't match the sample output of 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(y / 2) + ceil(x - 4*(y - floor(y / 2)))/15).

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

Wait, earlier I thought it's three, but maybe it's two.

Wait, in the last test case, y=9, output is 5 screens.

If each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, then ceil(9 / 2)=5 screens.

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third test case, y=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2 screens.

Then, for x=12, each screen can hold up to 15 - 4*2=7 1x1 icons.

So, two screens can hold up to 2*7=14 1x1 icons.

Since x=12 <=14, total screens needed is 2.

Which matches the sample output.

In another test case, x=8, y=1.

ceil(1 / 2)=1 screen.

This screen can hold up to 15 - 4*1=11 1x1 icons.

Since x=8 <=11, total screens needed is 1.

Matches the sample.

x=15, y=0.

ceil(0 / 2)=0 screens.

But we need to place 15 1x1 icons, so ceil(15 / 15)=1 screen.

Total screens=1.

Matches the sample.

x=0, y=9.

ceil(9 / 2)=5 screens.

Each screen can hold up to 15 - 4*2=7 1x1 icons.

But x=0, so no need for additional screens.

Total screens=5.

Matches the sample.

Hence, the formula seems to be ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - 4*(y - 2*floor(y / 2)))/15).

Wait, simplifying, it's ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - 4*(y % 2))/15).

In the last test case, y=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5.

x - 4*(9 % 2)=12 - 4*1=8.

ceil(8 / 15)=1.

Total screens=5 +1=6, which doesn't match the sample output of 5.

Wait, perhaps it's just ceil(y / 2) + ceil(x / 15).

In the last test case, ceil(9 / 2)=5 + ceil(0 / 15)=0 → total screens=5.

Matches the sample.

In the third test case, ceil(4 / 2)=2 + ceil(12 / 15)=1 → total screens=2 +1=3.

But in the sample output, it's 2 screens.

So, still not matching.

Hence, perhaps the formula is s = ceil(y / 2), and then check if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into these s screens or need additional screens.

Each screen can hold up to 15 - 4*2=7 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on s screens: s * 7.

If x <= s * 7, then total screens needed is s.

Else, need additional ceil((x - s*7)/15) screens.

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s*7)/15).

In the third test case, s=ceil(4 / 2)=2.

Can hold up to 2*7=14 1x1 icons.

x=12 <=14, so total screens=2.

Matches the sample output.

In the last test case, s=ceil(9 / 2)=5.

Can hold up to 5*7=35 1x1 icons.

x=0 <=35, so total screens=5.

Matches the sample output.

In another test case, x=15, y=0.

s=ceil(0 / 2)=0.

Can hold up to 0*7=0 1x1 icons.

x=15 >0, so need ceil(15 / 15)=1 additional screen.

Total screens=0 +1=1.

Matches the sample.

x=8, y=1.

s=ceil(1 / 2)=1.

Can hold up to 1*7=7 1x1 icons.

x=8 >7, so need ceil((8 -7)/15)=1 additional screen.

Total screens=1 +1=2.

But in the sample output for x=8, y=1, it's 1 screen.

So, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, in this case, s=ceil(y / 2)=1.

Can hold up to 7 1x1 icons.

x=8 >7, so need additional ceil(1 / 15)=1 screen.

Total screens=1 +1=2.

But sample output is 1.

Hence, the formula is still not accurate.

So, perhaps the way to calculate the number of screens is:

s = ceil(y / 2)

Then, remaining 1x1 icons = x - (s * (15 - 8)).

Wait, in each screen with two 2x2 icons, the remaining cells are 15 - 8 =7 for 1x1 icons.

Hence, s screens can hold up to s * 7 1x1 icons.

If x <= s * 7, then total screens = s.

Else, total screens =
