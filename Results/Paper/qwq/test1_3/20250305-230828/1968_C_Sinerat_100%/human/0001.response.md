Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements from a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to do this for multiple test cases, with constraints on the size of n and the values of x_i.

First, I need to understand what it means for x_i to be equal to a_i mod a_{i-1}. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, a_i is some multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i.

Mathematically, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer.

My goal is to find such an array a that satisfies this for all i from 2 to n.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to start from the beginning, set a_1 to some value, and then compute a_2 based on x_2 and a_1, then a_3 based on x_3 and a_2, and so on.

But I need to choose a_1 carefully so that all a_i remain within the limits of 1 to 10^9.

Looking at the example, in the first test case, n=4, x=[2,4,1], and one possible a is [3,5,4,9].

Let's verify:

- a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

- a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 = 4, matches x_3.

- a_4 mod a_3 = 9 mod 4 = 1, matches x_4.

So, it works.

But how to find such an a?

One strategy could be to set a_1 to a value larger than any x_i, so that when computing a_2 = a_1 + x_2, and so on, the modulo operation works out correctly.

Wait, in the first step, a_2 mod a_1 should be x_2.

If a_2 = a_1 + x_2, then a_2 mod a_1 = (a_1 + x_2) mod a_1 = x_2, which is correct.

Then, a_3 = a_2 + x_3, so a_3 mod a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) mod a_2 = x_3, which is also correct.

This seems like a pattern.

So, if I set a_1 to any value greater than x_2, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n, it should satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

Let me check this with the first example.

Set a_1 = 3 (which is greater than x_2=2).

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

Wait, but in the example, a_3 is 4, not 9.

Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't perfect.

Wait, in the example, they have a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2=5, and 4 mod 5 is indeed 4, which matches x_3=4.

Then, a_4 = 9, which is greater than a_3=4, and 9 mod 4 is 1, matching x_4=1.

So, in this case, a_3 is not a_2 + x_3, but rather something else.

So, my initial approach doesn't match the example.

Maybe I need to adjust my strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set a_1 to some value.

Then, a_2 should satisfy a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

Similarly, a_3 mod a_2 = x_3, and so on.

One way to ensure a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i is to set a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k.

To keep the values of a_i within 1 to 10^9, I need to choose k appropriately.

But choosing k for each step might be tricky.

Maybe I can set a_1 to a sufficiently large value, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Let me try this with the first example.

Set a_1 = 3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

But in the example, a_3 is 4, not 9.

So, this doesn't match.

However, in the example, they have a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2=5, but still satisfies a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 = 4, which is x_3.

So, it's possible to have a_i less than a_{i-1}, as long as the modulo condition holds.

In my approach, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i ensures a_i > a_{i-1}, which might not be necessary.

Maybe I need to allow a_i to be less than a_{i-1} in some cases.

But to make it simple, perhaps setting a_1 to a large value and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i works, but in the example, it didn't match.

Wait, in the example, they have a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2 = 5, but still satisfies the condition.

So, maybe there are multiple possible solutions, and I just need to find one that works.

Perhaps setting a_1 to a large value isn't the best approach.

Let me consider another way.

Suppose I set a_1 to x_2 + 1, since a_1 must be greater than x_2 to have a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

Then, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Let's try this with the first example.

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

But in the example, a_3 is 4, not 9.

So, again, it doesn't match.

However, the problem says that any a that satisfies the conditions is acceptable, so [3,5,9] should also be acceptable, but in the example, they have [3,5,4,9].

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, so a should have 4 elements.

In my approach, I have a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=9, but in the example, they have a_4=9.

Wait, no: in the example, a=[3,5,4,9], which matches n=4.

But according to my approach, I would have a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=9, a_4=?.

Wait, I need to set a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But in the example, they have a_4=9.

So, again, it doesn't match, but the example's a_4=9 satisfies 9 mod 4 =1, which is x_4.

So, both a_4=9 and a_4=10 satisfy the condition, since 9 mod 4 =1 and 10 mod 4 =2, but x_4=1, so only 9 works.

Wait, 10 mod 4 is 2, which doesn't match x_4=1.

So, a_4=10 would be incorrect.

Thus, in this case, a_4=9 is correct, but a_4=10 is incorrect.

So, my approach would set a_4=10, which is invalid.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

I need a better way to set a_i.

Let me think again.

I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

This means that a_i is equal to x_i plus some multiple of a_{i-1}.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >=0.

I need to choose k such that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

Also, for the next step, a_{i+1} = m * a_i + x_{i+1}.

To make things simpler, perhaps I can choose the smallest possible a_i, which is a_i = x_i if x_i >= a_{i-1}, or a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}.

Wait, no, if x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i could be x_i, but that would imply that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, which is correct.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i must be at least x_i - a_{i-1} + a_{i-1} = x_i, but since x_i >= a_{i-1}, a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i - a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me look at the second test case.

n=3, x=[1,1].

In the example, a=[2,5,11].

Check:

- 5 mod 2 =1, matches x_2=1.

- 11 mod 5 =1, matches x_3=1.

Another possible a could be [2,3,6], since 3 mod 2=1 and 6 mod 3=0, which doesn't match x_3=1.

So, [2,3,6] is invalid.

But [2,5,11] works.

In this case, a_2 =5 =2*2 +1, which satisfies a_2 mod 2=1.

a_3=11=5*2 +1, which satisfies a_3 mod 5=1.

So, in this case, a_i is set to a_{i-1}*2 +x_i.

That seems to work.

Is this a general strategy?

Set a_i = 2*a_{i-1} + x_i.

Then, a_i mod a_{i-1} = (2*a_{i-1} + x_i) mod a_{i-1} = x_i, since 2*a_{i-1} mod a_{i-1}=0.

This seems to work.

So, I can set a_i = 2*a_{i-1} + x_i for each i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Also, since a_{i-1} >=1, and x_i >=1, a_i will be at least 3, which is within the limit.

But I need to make sure that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, if I set a_i = 2*a_{i-1} + x_i, a_i could grow exponentially, potentially exceeding 10^9.

For example, if a_1=1000, a_2=2*1000 + x_2 (up to 500)=2500, a_3=2*2500 + x_3=5500, and so on.

This could exceed 10^9 for large n.

So, perhaps I need a better way to bound a_i.

Wait, maybe I can set a_1 to a large value, say 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in this case, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and since a_{i-1} is large, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, as long as x_i < a_{i-1}.

Given that a_{i-1} is 10^9 and x_i is up to 500, x_i < a_{i-1} holds.

So, this seems to work.

Set a_1 = 10^9.

Then, for each i from 2 to n, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, since a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and x_i < a_{i-1}.

This should work.

Let me check with the first test case.

Set a_1=1000 (or 10^9, but to match the example, let's set a_1=3).

Wait, in the example, they have a_1=3, which is less than 10^9.

But according to my approach, setting a_1=10^9 should work.

But in the example, they have a_1=3, which also works.

So, perhaps there are multiple possible solutions.

As long as a_{i-1} > x_i, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i works.

In the first test case, a_1=3 > x_2=2, so a_2=3+2=5.

a_2=5 > x_3=4, so a_3=5+4=9.

But in the example, they have a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, but still satisfies a_3 mod a_2 =4 mod 5=4.

So, it's possible to have a_i < a_{i-1}, as long as a_{i-1} divides a_i with remainder x_i.

In this case, a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k.

If k=0, then a_i = x_i, which is allowed if x_i < a_{i-1}.

So, in the example, they chose k=0 for a_3.

Similarly, a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4, and 9 mod 4=1, which matches x_4.

So, in this case, they chose a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, and then a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4.

This seems flexible.

So, to generalize, for each i from 2 to n, set a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is chosen such that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

To make it simple, perhaps set k=0 if x_i < a_{i-1}, otherwise set k=1.

Wait, in the first test case, x_3=4 and a_2=5, so x_3 < a_2, so set a_3 =0*5 +4=4, which matches the example.

Then, x_4=1 and a_3=4, x_4 < a_3, so set a_4=0*4 +1=1, but in the example, a_4=9.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe set k=1 if x_i >= a_{i-1}, but in this case, x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, in the first test case, x_3=4 < a_2=5, so set a_3=0*5 +4=4.

Then, x_4=1 < a_3=4, so set a_4=0*4 +1=1, but in the example, a_4=9.

So, this doesn't match.

Perhaps I need to allow k to be any integer as long as a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

In the example, for a_4, they set a_4=9, which is 2*4 +1=9, so k=2.

This also satisfies a_4 mod a_3 =1.

So, it's valid.

Hence, to make it simple, perhaps set k=0 if x_i < a_{i-1}, else set k=1.

But in the first test case, x_3=4 < a_2=5, so k=0, a_3=0*5 +4=4.

Then, x_4=1 < a_3=4, so k=0, a_4=0*4 +1=1.

But in the example, a_4=9, which is k=2*4 +1=9.

So, their choice of k=2 is also valid.

Hence, multiple solutions exist.

So, in my approach, I can set k=0 whenever x_i < a_{i-1}, which keeps a_i =x_i.

This should work.

But I need to ensure that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

Given that x_i >=1, and a_i >=1, this should hold.

Let me try this approach with the first test case.

Set a_1=3.

Then, x_2=2 < a_1=3, so a_2=0*3 +2=2.

But in the example, a_2=5.

Wait, this doesn't match.

So, perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, in the first step, x_2=2 < a_1=3, so a_2=2.

Then, x_3=4 > a_2=2, which violates the condition x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, x_3=4 > a_2=2, so I need to set k=1, so a_3=1*2 +4=6.

Then, x_4=1 < a_3=6, so a_4=0*6 +1=1.

But in the example, a_3=4 and a_4=9.

So, again, it doesn't match.

But the problem allows any a that satisfies the conditions.

Hence, [3,2,6,1] would satisfy:

- 2 mod 3 =2.

- 6 mod 2=0, but x_3=4, which doesn't match.

Wait, this is not correct.

So, my approach is flawed.

I need another way.

Let me consider starting from a_1 and choosing it such that all a_i are within bounds.

One way is to set a_1 to a value larger than any x_i, say 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Given that x_i <=500, a_i will be at most a_1 + (n-1)*500.

Given n<=500, a_i <=10^9 + 500*500 =10^9 +250,000, which is still within 10^9.

Wait, but 10^9 +250,000 is greater than 10^9.

So, it exceeds the limit.

Hence, this approach is invalid.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider setting a_1 to a value such that a_1 > x_2, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

But as before, this can lead to a_i exceeding 10^9.

Another idea: set a_1 to x_2 +1, then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = x_2 +1 +x_2 =2*x_2 +1.

Then a_3 = a_2 + x_3 =2*x_2 +1 +x_3.

This can still grow large.

Wait, perhaps set a_1 to max(x_2 +1, some small value).

But I need to ensure that a_i <=10^9.

Maybe set a_1 to 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

As long as x_i <=500, a_i =10^9 + sum of x_i, which for n=500 and x_i=500, sum is 250,000, so a_i=10^9 +250,000, which exceeds 10^9.

Hence, this is invalid.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the constraints.

I need to ensure that a_i <=10^9 for all i.

Given that a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, k can be chosen such that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

But choosing k appropriately is tricky.

Let me consider setting a_1 to a value, and then for each subsequent a_i, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, but ensure that a_i <=10^9.

If a_i would exceed 10^9, then set a_i to x_i instead.

Wait, but setting a_i to x_i may not satisfy a_i >=1.

But x_i >=1, so it's fine.

Let me try this with the first test case.

Set a_1=3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 =3+2=5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3=5+4=9.

a_4 = a_3 + x_4=9+1=10.

But x_4=1 < a_3=9, so 10 mod 9=1, which matches.

But 10 >10^9 is not a problem here, but for larger n and x_i, it could be.

Wait, in this case, a_4=10 is fine.

But in general, if a_i exceeds 10^9, set a_i =x_i.

Let me check with a larger n.

Suppose n=500, x_i=500 for all i.

Set a_1=1000.

Then a_2=1000 +500=1500.

a_3=1500 +500=2000.

...

a_{500}= a_{499} +500.

If a_{499}=1000 +499*500=1000 +249,500=250,500.

a_{500}=250,500 +500=251,000, which is less than 10^9.

So, in this case, it's fine.

But if a_{i} would exceed 10^9, set a_i =x_i.

Wait, in this case, it doesn't exceed.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=500, a_1=10^9, x_i=500 for all i.

Then, a_2=10^9 +500=1000000500, which exceeds 10^9.

So, according to my adjusted approach, set a_2=500.

Then a_3=500 +500=1000.

a_4=1000 +500=1500.

...

Continue until a_i <=10^9.

But in this case, a_2=500, a_3=1000, a_4=1500, and so on.

This seems to work.

But I need to ensure that a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

In this case:

a_2=500, a_1=10^9.

a_2 mod a_1 =500 mod 10^9=500, which matches x_2=500.

a_3=1000 mod 500=0, which should match x_3=500.

Wait, but x_3=500, and 1000 mod 500=0, which doesn't match.

Hence, this approach is invalid.

So, I need to adjust.

Perhaps, when setting a_i =x_i, I need to ensure that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, in this case, x_3=500, and a_2=500, so x_3 >= a_2, which violates the condition.

Hence, I need to choose a_i such that a_i >=x_i and a_i mod a_{i-1}=x_i.

So, a_i =k*a_{i-1} +x_i for some integer k >=0.

I need to choose k such that a_i <=10^9.

Given that a_{i-1} >=1, and x_i >=1, I can set k=floor((10^9 -x_i)/a_{i-1}).

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I can set a_1 to a value such that a_1 > max(x_2, x_3, ..., x_n).

Then, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This way, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and since a_{i-1} > x_i, a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

But, if a_1 > max(x_2, x_3, ..., x_n), then a_{i-1} > x_i for all i, so a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i.

But, for n=500 and x_i=500, a_1 needs to be greater than 500.

Then, a_2=a_1 +500, a_3=a_2 +500, and so on.

a_i =a_1 + (i-1)*500.

For i=500, a_{500}=a_1 +499*500=a_1 +249,500.

If a_1=501, then a_{500}=501 +249,500=250,001, which is less than 10^9.

So, this works.

Hence, the approach is:

- Set a_1 to max(x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) +1.

- Then, for each i from 2 to n, set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i.

This ensures that a_{i-1} > x_i, so a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

Also, a_i <= a_1 + (n-1)*500, which for a_1=501 and n=500, is 501 +249,500=250,001, which is less than 10^9.

Hence, this should work.

Let me confirm with the first test case.

Set a_1=max(2,4,1)+1=4+1=5.

Then a_2=5 +2=7.

a_3=7 +4=11.

a_4=11 +1=12.

But in the example, they have a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

So, their a_1=3 < max(x_i)=4, which violates my condition.

But still, it works because they set a_3=4 < a_2=5, and a_4=9 > a_3=4.

Hence, multiple solutions exist.

But to make it simple, I can follow my approach.

Hence, in code, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Read x_2 to x_n.

- Set a_1 = max(x) +1.

- Set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

- Output a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

This should work.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

x = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = [0] * n

a[0] = 1000

for i in range(1, n):

a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

print(*a)

It sets a_1=1000, which may not be greater than max(x), especially if max(x)=1000.

Wait, if max(x)=1000, then setting a_1=1000 doesn't satisfy a_1 > max(x).

Hence, this could be a problem.

For example, if x=[1000,1000], then setting a_1=1000, a_2=1000 +1000=2000.

Then, a_2 mod a_1 =2000 mod 1000=0, which should equal x_2=1000.

But 0 !=1000, so this doesn't work.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
