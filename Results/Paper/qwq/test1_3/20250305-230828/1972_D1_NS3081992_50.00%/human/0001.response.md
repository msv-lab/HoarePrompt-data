Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(a, b) is that number.

The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b). In mathematical terms, that means (a + b) mod (b * gcd(a, b)) = 0.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this condition.

Let me think about the properties of gcd. I know that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b. So, let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a can be expressed as a = d * k, where k is an integer, and b can be expressed as b = d * l, where l is another integer. Also, since d is the greatest common divisor, k and l should be coprime, meaning gcd(k, l) = 1.

So, substituting a and b in terms of d, k, and l, the condition becomes:

(a + b) should be divisible by b * d.

Substituting a = d * k and b = d * l:

(d * k + d * l) should be divisible by (d * l) * d.

Simplify the numerator:

d * (k + l) should be divisible by d^2 * l.

So, d * (k + l) / (d^2 * l) should be an integer.

Simplify by canceling d:

(k + l) / (d * l) should be an integer.

Wait, but d = gcd(a, b), and since a = d * k and b = d * l, and k and l are coprime, d is determined by a and b.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me consider the condition again: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

That is, there exists an integer c such that a + b = c * b * gcd(a, b).

I can rearrange this to a = b * (c * gcd(a, b) - 1).

This seems interesting. It shows that a is a multiple of b times some expression involving c and gcd(a, b).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can look at small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Let's take the first example from the problem: n = 1, m = 1.

So, only possible pair is (1, 1).

Check the condition: a + b = 2, and b * gcd(1, 1) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Is 2 a multiple of 1? Yes, because 2 / 1 = 2, which is an integer.

So, only one valid pair, which matches the sample output.

Second sample: n = 2, m = 3.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).

Let's check each one:

- (1,1): 1+1=2, b*gcd(1,1)=1*1=1, 2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

- (1,2): 1+2=3, b*gcd(1,2)=2*1=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

- (1,3): 1+3=4, b*gcd(1,3)=3*1=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

- (2,1): 2+1=3, b*gcd(2,1)=1*1=1, 3 is a multiple of 1. OK.

- (2,2): 2+2=4, b*gcd(2,2)=2*2=4, 4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

- (2,3): 2+3=5, b*gcd(2,3)=3*1=3, 5 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

So, valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Total of 3, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: n = 3, m = 5.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).

Checking each one:

- (1,1): 1+1=2, 1*1=1, 2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

- (1,2): 1+2=3, 2*1=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

- (1,3): 1+3=4, 3*1=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

- (1,4): 1+4=5, 4*1=4, 5 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

- (1,5): 1+5=6, 5*1=5, 6 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

- (2,1): 2+1=3, 1*1=1, 3 is a multiple of 1. OK.

- (2,2): 2+2=4, 2*2=4, 4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

- (2,3): 2+3=5, 3*1=3, 5 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

- (2,4): 2+4=6, 4*2=8, 6 is not a multiple of 8. Not OK.

- (2,5): 2+5=7, 5*1=5, 7 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

- (3,1): 3+1=4, 1*1=1, 4 is a multiple of 1. OK.

- (3,2): 3+2=5, 2*1=2, 5 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

- (3,3): 3+3=6, 3*3=9, 6 is not a multiple of 9. Not OK.

- (3,4): 3+4=7, 4*1=4, 7 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

- (3,5): 3+5=8, 5*1=5, 8 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

So, valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1). Total of 4, which matches the sample output.

Another sample: n = 10, m = 8.

From the note, there are 14 valid pairs.

I can try to list them to verify, but that might take time. Maybe it's better to look for a pattern or a formula.

Looking back at the condition: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let me try to express this differently.

Let d = gcd(a, b). Then a = d * k and b = d * l, where gcd(k, l) = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * k + d * l = c * (d * l) * d

Simplify:

d * (k + l) = c * d^2 * l

Divide both sides by d (since d >=1):

k + l = c * d * l

Now, since k and l are coprime, and l divides k + l, what can I say about c and d?

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Let me consider fixing b and varying a.

For a fixed b, I need to find a such that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

But gcd(a, b) depends on a, which is what I'm trying to find.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate over possible gcd values.

Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then a is a multiple of d, and b is a multiple of d.

So, a = d * a' and b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * a' + d * b' = c * (d * b') * d

Simplify:

d * (a' + b') = c * d^2 * b'

Divide both sides by d:

a' + b' = c * d * b'

Now, since a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides a' + b', then b' divides a'.

But a' and b' are coprime, so b' must be 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

So, b = d * 1 = d.

And a' + 1 = c * d * 1

So, a' = c * d - 1

Therefore, a = d * (c * d - 1)

So, for each b that is equal to d, and a = d * (c * d - 1), for some integer c, such that a is between 1 and n.

Wait, but b = d, so b divides a.

Wait, b divides a because a = d * (c * d - 1) and b = d.

So, a is a multiple of b.

But in this case, gcd(a, b) = b, since b divides a.

Wait, but earlier I set d = gcd(a, b), and b = d, so gcd(a, b) = b.

That implies that b divides a.

So, perhaps I can consider that b divides a.

Let me assume that b divides a.

Then, gcd(a, b) = b.

So, the condition becomes: a + b should be a multiple of b * b.

That is, a + b ≡ 0 mod b^2.

But a is a multiple of b, so a = k * b for some integer k.

So, a + b = k * b + b = b * (k + 1)

This should be a multiple of b^2.

So, b * (k + 1) ≡ 0 mod b^2

Which implies that k + 1 ≡ 0 mod b

So, k ≡ -1 mod b

Therefore, k = m * b - 1 for some integer m >=1.

Therefore, a = k * b = (m * b - 1) * b = m * b^2 - b

So, a = m * b^2 - b

Now, a needs to be >=1 and <=n.

So, m * b^2 - b >=1 and m * b^2 - b <=n

Solving for m:

m >= (b +1)/ b^2

m <= (n + b)/ b^2

Since m is an integer, m >= ceil((b +1)/ b^2) and m <= floor((n + b)/ b^2)

But b is at least 1, so b^2 >=1, so (b +1)/ b^2 >=1 +1/b^2 >1

So, m >=1

Similarly, m <= floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, and for each m from 1 to floor((n + b)/ b^2), a = m * b^2 - b, and a must be >=1 and <=n.

Wait, but a = m * b^2 - b

Let me check if a is positive:

m * b^2 - b >=1

m >= (b +1)/ b^2

Similarly, m * b^2 - b <=n

m <= (n + b)/ b^2

So, m can take integer values from ceil((b +1)/ b^2) to floor((n + b)/ b^2)

But b >=1, so b^2 >=1, so (b +1)/ b^2 <= b +1

So, m starts from ceil((b +1)/ b^2), which is at least 1.

So, for each b from 1 to m, I can compute the number of m's that satisfy the above inequalities, and for each such m, there is one a corresponding to it.

Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of the number of integers m satisfying ceil((b +1)/ b^2) <= m <= floor((n + b)/ b^2)

This seems manageable.

But I need to compute this efficiently, given that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^6.

Given that there are up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n and m across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, that means on average, n and m are around 2*10^6 / 10^4 = 200 per test case.

But actually, since it's the sum of n and m per test case that matters, and the sum across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough.

Wait, no. The problem says that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2*10^6.

So, the total sum of n across all test cases is <=2*10^6, and similarly for m.

Given that there are up to 10^4 test cases, that means on average, n and m are around 2*10^6 / 10^4 = 200 per test case.

So, I need an algorithm that is linear or linearithmic in n and m.

Now, let's think about how to compute the number of valid pairs efficiently.

From the earlier analysis, for each b from 1 to m, I need to find the number of integers m such that ceil((b +1)/ b^2) <= m <= floor((n + b)/ b^2)

But m is a positive integer, so m >=1.

Also, since b >=1, (b +1)/ b^2 <=2 for b=1, and decreases as b increases.

So, ceil((b +1)/ b^2) is 2 for b=1, and 1 for b>=2.

Wait, let's compute ceil((b +1)/ b^2) for b from 1 to m.

For b=1:

(b +1)/ b^2 = (1 +1)/1 = 2/1 =2, so ceil(2)=2

For b=2:

(2 +1)/4 =3/4=0.75, ceil(0.75)=1

For b=3:

(3 +1)/9=4/9≈0.444, ceil(0.444)=1

And so on.

So, for b=1, m starts from 2, and for b>=2, m starts from 1.

Now, the upper limit is floor((n + b)/ b^2)

For b=1:

floor((n +1)/1)=n +1

For b=2:

floor((n +2)/4)

And so on.

So, for each b from 1 to m, I need to compute the number of integers m such that:

- If b=1, m >=2

- If b >=2, m >=1

- And m <= floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Also, m must be such that a = m * b^2 - b <=n

Wait, a = m * b^2 - b <=n

So, m * b^2 - b <=n

m <= (n + b)/ b^2

Which is already considered in the upper limit.

So, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid m's is:

floor((n + b)/ b^2) - ceil((b +1)/ b^2) +1

But need to adjust for b=1.

Wait, for b=1, ceil((1 +1)/1)=2, so m starts from 2.

floor((n +1)/1)=n +1

So, number of m's is (n +1) -2 +1 =n

But a = m *1^2 -1 =m -1

Need a <=n, so m -1 <=n, m <=n +1

Which is already satisfied since m <= floor((n +1)/1)=n +1

Similarly, for b>=2, ceil((b +1)/ b^2)=1

So, number of m's is floor((n + b)/ b^2) -1 +1 =floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Therefore, total number of pairs is:

For b=1: n

For b>=2: sum over b=2 to m of floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Wait, but for b=1, a = m *1^2 -1 =m -1

And a <=n, m -1 <=n, m <=n +1

But m starts from 2, up to n +1

So, number of m's is n +1 -2 +1 =n

Yes, that matches.

But wait, in the earlier sample input where n=1, m=1

According to this, for b=1, number of m's is n=1

But in reality, a=1, b=1 is valid.

But according to a = m *1^2 -1 =m -1, so m=2 gives a=1

Which is correct.

So, for b=1, number of valid a's is n, but need to ensure that a >=1.

Given that a = m -1, and m >=2, a >=1

So, number of valid a's for b=1 is n

For b>=2, number of valid a's is floor((n + b)/ b^2)

So, total number of valid pairs is n (for b=1) plus sum over b=2 to m of floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Now, in the second sample input: n=2, m=3

For b=1: n=2 valid a's: a=1, a=2

But checking the earlier manual check:

(1,1): OK

(2,1): OK

(1,2): Not OK

(2,2): OK

(3,1): Not OK, because n=2, a=3 is invalid.

Wait, but according to the formula, for b=1, number of a's is n=2, so a=1 and a=2

For b=2: floor((2 +2)/4)=1

a =1*4 -2=2

So, (2,2): OK

For b=3: floor((2 +3)/9)=0

So, no a for b=3

Total pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), which is 3, matching the sample output.

Wait, but earlier manual check showed that (3,1) is invalid because a=3 >n=2, but according to the formula, for b=1, m goes up to n +1=3, but a=m -1=2 when m=3, which is a=2, which is valid.

Wait, a=m *1^2 -1=m -1

So, for m=2, a=1

m=3, a=2

So, only a=1 and a=2 are valid for b=1, which is correct.

So, the formula seems correct.

Similarly, for b=2, floor((2 +2)/4)=1

a=1*4 -2=2, which is valid.

For b=3, floor((2 +3)/9)=0, so no a's.

Total pairs: 2 (from b=1) +1 (from b=2) +0 (from b=3)=3, matching the sample.

Another sample: n=3, m=5

For b=1: n=3 valid a's: a=1, a=2, a=3

For b=2: floor((3 +2)/4)=1

a=1*4 -2=2

So, (2,2): OK

For b=3: floor((3 +3)/9)=0

No a's

For b=4: floor((3 +4)/16)=0

No a's

For b=5: floor((3 +5)/25)=0

No a's

Total pairs: 3 (from b=1) +1 (from b=2) +0 +0 +0=4, matching the sample.

Another sample: n=10, m=8

From the note, there are 14 valid pairs.

According to the formula:

For b=1: n=10, so a=1 to 10, but a=m -1 where m=2 to 11

But m=1 for b=1 starts from m=2, a=1, m=3 a=2, ..., m=11 a=10

But n=10, so a=1 to 10 are all valid.

So, 10 pairs for b=1

For b=2: floor((10 +2)/4)=3

So, m=1 to 3

a=m*4 -2

m=1: a=2

m=2: a=6

m=3: a=10

So, (2,2), (6,2), (10,2)

But need to check if a <=n=10, which they are.

So, 3 pairs for b=2

For b=3: floor((10 +3)/9)=1

a=1*9 -3=6

So, (6,3)

For b=4: floor((10 +4)/16)=1

a=1*16 -4=12, but a=12 >n=10, so invalid

So, no pairs for b=4

For b=5: floor((10 +5)/25)=0

No pairs

For b=6: floor((10 +6)/36)=0

No pairs

For b=7: floor((10 +7)/49)=0

No pairs

For b=8: floor((10 +8)/64)=0

No pairs

Total pairs: 10 (from b=1) +3 (from b=2) +1 (from b=3) +0 +0 +0 +0 +0=14, matching the sample.

Great, so the formula seems correct.

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is n (for b=1) plus the sum over b=2 to m of floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and the sum of n and m across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, I need an implementation that is O(m) per test case, but since m can be up to 2*10^6 and there are up to 10^4 test cases, but the total sum of m across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, it should be acceptable.

But I need to make sure that my implementation is optimized.

So, for each test case, I can iterate b from 2 to m, compute floor((n + b)/ b^2), and sum them up, then add n.

But, for large m, this could be time-consuming.

Is there a way to optimize this further?

Let's consider the function floor((n + b)/ b^2)

Let me denote k = b^2

Then, floor((n + b)/ k) = floor((n + b)/ b^2)

I need to sum this over b from 2 to m.

This looks similar to summing floor((n + b)/ b^2) for b from 2 to m.

I wonder if there is a mathematical formula or a way to group terms to compute this sum more efficiently.

Alternatively, I can iterate b from 2 to m and compute floor((n + b)/ b^2) directly.

But with m up to 2*10^6, this might be too slow.

Wait, but since the sum of m across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, iterating up to m for each test case should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this.

But perhaps I can optimize it further.

Let me consider that for large b, b^2 will be larger than n + b, so floor((n + b)/ b^2) will be 0.

So, I can find the maximum b such that b^2 <= n + b, and only iterate up to that b.

Let's solve b^2 <= n + b

b^2 - b - n <=0

Solve b^2 - b - n =0

b = [1 + sqrt(1 + 4n)] /2

So, the maximum b is floor([1 + sqrt(1 + 4n)] /2)

So, for b from 2 to floor([1 + sqrt(1 + 4n)] /2), compute floor((n + b)/ b^2)

For b > floor([1 + sqrt(1 + 4n)] /2), floor((n + b)/ b^2) =0

Therefore, I can iterate b from 2 to floor([1 + sqrt(1 + 4n)] /2), compute floor((n + b)/ b^2), and sum them up, then add n.

This should reduce the number of iterations significantly for large n and m.

Let me check this for n=10, m=8

Compute floor([1 + sqrt(1 + 4*10)] /2) = floor([1 + sqrt(41)] /2) ≈ floor([1 + 6.403]/2) = floor(7.403/2)=floor(3.7015)=3

So, iterate b from 2 to 3:

b=2: floor((10 +2)/4)=3

b=3: floor((10 +3)/9)=1

Total sum: 3 +1=4

Add n=10, total 14, which matches the earlier calculation.

Another sample: n=1, m=1

floor([1 + sqrt(5)] /2)=floor([1 + 2.236]/2)=floor(3.236/2)=floor(1.618)=1

So, iterate b from 2 to 1, which is nothing.

So, sum is 0

Add n=1, total 1, which matches the sample.

Another sample: n=2, m=3

floor([1 + sqrt(1 +8)] /2
