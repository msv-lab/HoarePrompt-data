Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign appears every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign appears, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on.

First, I need to understand how the signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But according to the problem, they have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs in year x, we start looking for the second sign in year x+1, and it has to be the first occurrence of the second sign after x.

Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Let me think with an example. Take the first example from the input:

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

So, n=6, and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

According to the explanation, the first sign occurs in year 3. Then, starting from year 4, we wait for the second sign, which has a periodicity of 2. So, the second sign occurs in years 2,4,6,8,... But since we start from year 4, the next occurrence is year 4. So, the second sign occurs in year 4.

Now, starting from year 5, we wait for the third sign with a periodicity of 4. The third sign occurs in years 4,8,12,... But since we start from year 5, the next occurrence is year 8.

Wait, but according to the note, it says the third sign occurs in year 8, but starting from year 5. So, that makes sense.

Then, starting from year 9, we wait for the fourth sign with periodicity 5. The fourth sign occurs in years 5,10,15,... Starting from year 9, the next occurrence is year 10.

Then, starting from year 11, we wait for the fifth sign with periodicity 9. The fifth sign occurs in years 9,18,27,... But starting from year 11, the next occurrence is year 18.

Finally, starting from year 19, we wait for the sixth sign with periodicity 18. The sixth sign occurs in years 18,36,54,... Starting from year 19, the next occurrence is year 36.

So, the apocalypse happens in year 36.

Okay, that makes sense. Now, I need to generalize this logic.

So, for each sign, starting from a certain year, we need to find the next occurrence of that sign.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can initialize a variable, say, 'year', to 0.

Then, for each sign from 1 to n:

Find the smallest year >= current year + 1 where the sign occurs.

Wait, but the sign occurs in multiples of a_i.

So, for each sign, I need to find the smallest year that is greater than the current year and is a multiple of a_i.

Then, set the current year to that year.

Finally, the year when the nth sign occurs is the answer.

Let me try this with the first example.

Initialize year = 0

First sign: a1=3

Find the smallest year >= 1 that is a multiple of 3. Which is 3.

Set year = 3

Second sign: a2=2

Find the smallest year >= 4 that is a multiple of 2. Which is 4.

Set year = 4

Third sign: a3=4

Find the smallest year >=5 that is a multiple of 4. Which is 8.

Set year =8

Fourth sign: a4=5

Find the smallest year >=9 that is a multiple of 5. Which is 10.

Set year=10

Fifth sign: a5=9

Find the smallest year >=11 that is a multiple of 9. Which is 18.

Set year=18

Sixth sign: a6=18

Find the smallest year >=19 that is a multiple of 18. Which is 18*2=36.

Set year=36

So, the answer is 36, which matches the example.

Good, so this logic seems correct.

Now, how do I implement this efficiently?

I need to handle multiple test cases, up to t=1000, and n can be up to 100, with a_i up to 1e6.

So, overall, it's manageable in terms of time constraints.

For each test case, I need to read n, then read the list a of n integers.

Then, initialize year=0

Then, iterate through each a_i in a:

Find the smallest year >= current year +1 that is a multiple of a_i.

Set year to that year.

Finally, print year.

Now, how to find the smallest year >= current_year +1 that is a multiple of a_i.

Mathematically, it's the smallest y >= current_year +1 such that y % a_i ==0.

This can be computed as:

y = ((current_year +1 + a_i -1) // a_i) * a_i

This formula effectively rounds up (current_year +1) to the nearest multiple of a_i.

Let me verify this formula with the first example.

For a1=3, current_year=0, y = ((1 + 3 -1)//3)*3 = (3//3)*3=1*3=3. Correct.

For a2=2, current_year=3, y = ((4 +2 -1)//2)*2=(5//2)*2=2*2=4. Correct.

For a3=4, current_year=4, y = ((5 +4 -1)//4)*4=(8//4)*4=2*4=8. Correct.

For a4=5, current_year=8, y = ((9 +5 -1)//5)*5=(13//5)*5=3*5=15. Wait, but according to the note, it should be 10.

Wait, that's not matching. According to the note, it's 10.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Let me think again.

The formula y = ((current_year +1 + a_i -1) // a_i) * a_i should give the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than or equal to current_year +1.

In the last step, for a4=5, current_year=8, y should be 10, but according to the formula:

((8 +1 +5 -1)//5)*5 = (13//5)*5=3*5=15. Wait, that's not 10.

Wait, that's incorrect. 13//5=2, 2*5=10. Wait, no, 13//5=2.6, but in integer division, it's 2. So 2*5=10. Yes, correct.

Wait, in Python, 13//5=2, and 2*5=10. So yes, it's correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

Yes, y=10, which matches the note.

Okay, so the formula is correct.

Proceeding with this formula should work.

Now, I need to implement this for each test case.

Also, need to make sure that the variables are reset for each test case.

Let me look at the code provided.

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

year = 0

for ai in a:

year += year % ai or ai

print(year)

Hmm, this code is trying to compute the year by adding either year % ai or ai to year, whichever is non-zero.

Wait, year += year % ai or ai

This is interesting.

Let's see what this does.

The expression year % ai or ai evaluates to year % ai if year % ai is truthy (i.e., not zero), else ai.

So, if year is a multiple of ai, year % ai is 0, so it adds ai to year.

Else, it adds year % ai to year.

Wait, is that equivalent to the formula I derived earlier?

Let me check with the first example.

Initialize year=0

First ai=3

year % 3 =0, so year += 3 → year=3

Second ai=2

year % 2 =1, so year +=1 → year=4

Third ai=4

year %4=0, so year +=4 → year=8

Fourth ai=5

year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

Wait, but according to the note, it should be year=10 for the fourth sign.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

According to the note, after year=8, for ai=5, it should be year=10, but according to this code, it's year=11.

Wait, but 11 is not a multiple of 5. The next multiple of 5 after 8 is 10, not 15.

So, this code is adding year % ai when it's not zero, which in this case, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11.

But 11 is not a multiple of 5. So, it's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the operator.

year += year % ai or ai

In Python, or returns the first truthy value or the last value. So, year % ai or ai returns year % ai if it's non-zero, else ai.

So, in the case where year % ai ==0, it adds ai to year.

Else, it adds year % ai to year.

Wait, but in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, 8%5=3, so it adds 3 to year, making year=11.

But 11 is not a multiple of 5. According to the problem, it should be 10.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the logic.

Perhaps instead of adding year % ai, I should add ai - year % ai when year % ai !=0.

Wait, let's see.

If year % ai ==0, add ai to year.

Else, add ai - year % ai to year.

So, in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so add 5-3=2 to year, making year=10.

That matches the note.

Similarly, in the first step, year=0, ai=3, year %3=0, so add 3 to year, year=3.

Second step, year=3, ai=2, year %2=1, so add 2-1=1 to year, year=4.

Third step, year=4, ai=4, year %4=0, so add 4 to year, year=8.

Fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so add 5-3=2 to year, year=10.

Fifth step, year=10, ai=9, year %9=1, so add 9-1=8 to year, year=18.

Sixth step, year=18, ai=18, year %18=0, so add 18 to year, year=36.

Yes, this matches the note.

So, the correct logic is:

For each ai:

if year % ai ==0:

year += ai

else:

year += ai - (year % ai)

Now, looking back at the original code:

year += year % ai or ai

This adds year % ai if it's non-zero, else ai.

Which is equivalent to:

if year % ai !=0:

year += year % ai

else:

year += ai

But this is not the same as the correct logic I just derived.

In the correct logic, when year % ai !=0, we should add ai - (year % ai), not year % ai.

So, the original code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, it's producing 36, which is correct.

Wait, let's simulate the original code with the first example.

Initialize year=0

First ai=3

year %3=0, so year +=3 → year=3

Second ai=2

year %2=1, so year +=1 → year=4

Third ai=4

year %4=0, so year +=4 → year=8

Fourth ai=5

year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

Fifth ai=9

year %9=2, so year +=2 → year=13

Sixth ai=18

year %18=13, so year +=13 → year=26

So, according to this code, the output would be 26, which is not matching the sample output of 36.

Wait, but in the sample code, it's producing 36.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Wait, the code is year += year % ai or ai

In Python, or has lower precedence than +=, so it's year += (year % ai or ai)

So, year += (year % ai or ai)

Which means, if year % ai is non-zero, add year % ai, else add ai.

So, in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

But according to the correct logic, it should be year += (5 -3)=2 → year=10

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's producing 36.

Wait, perhaps with the given a=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the code produces 36.

Wait, let's simulate it again.

Initialize year=0

First ai=3

year %3=0, so year +=3 → year=3

Second ai=2

year %2=1, so year +=1 → year=4

Third ai=4

year %4=0, so year +=4 → year=8

Fourth ai=5

year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

Fifth ai=9

year %9=2, so year +=2 → year=13

Sixth ai=18

year %18=13, so year +=13 → year=26

So, according to this code, the output is 26, but the sample output is 36.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, the code is year += year % ai or ai

But in Python, the precedence is year += (year % ai or ai)

So, it's equivalent to year = year + (year % ai or ai)

So, in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

But according to the correct logic, it should be year += (5 -3)=2 → year=10

So, 11 is not a multiple of 5, but 10 is.

Wait, perhaps in the code, it's intended to add ai if year % ai !=0, but that's not what the code does.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the correct logic in code.

The correct logic is:

for ai in a:

if year % ai ==0:

year += ai

else:

year += ai - (year % ai)

This ensures that year is always a multiple of ai after each step.

In the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, 8%5=3, so year += (5-3)=2 → year=10, which is correct.

But the original code is:

for ai in a:

year += year % ai or ai

Which is equivalent to:

for ai in a:

if year % ai !=0:

year += year % ai

else:

year += ai

So, in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3 !=0, so year +=3 → year=11

But 11 is not a multiple of 5, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the original code is incorrect.

But according to the sample input, it's producing the correct output of 36.

Wait, but according to my simulation, it should be 26, not 36.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulation.

Let me simulate again.

Initialize year=0

First ai=3

year %3=0, so year +=3 → year=3

Second ai=2

year %2=1, so year +=1 → year=4

Third ai=4

year %4=0, so year +=4 → year=8

Fourth ai=5

year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

Fifth ai=9

year %9=2, so year +=2 → year=13

Sixth ai=18

year %18=13, so year +=13 → year=26

So, according to this, year=26, but the sample output is 36.

There must be something wrong with my simulation or understanding.

Wait, perhaps the or operator has different precedence.

Wait, let's check the expression year % ai or ai.

In Python, or returns the first truthy value or the last value.

So, year % ai or ai returns year % ai if it's truthy (i.e., non-zero), else ai.

So, in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, which is truthy, so year +=3 → year=11

But according to the correct logic, it should be year += (5 -3)=2 → year=10

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the sample output is 36.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the or operator.

Wait, maybe it's year += (year % ai) or ai

Which means, if year % ai is non-zero, add that value, else add ai.

But in the fourth step, year=8, ai=5, year %5=3, so year +=3 → year=11

But 11 is not a multiple of 5, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but in some test cases, it coincidentally produces the correct output.

For example, in the first test case, it might be producing 36, but in my simulation, it's producing 26.

Maybe I made a mistake in simulation.

Wait, perhaps I need to run the code with the sample input to verify.

But since I can't run the code right now, I need to reason about it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the expression.

Wait, maybe it's year += (year % ai or ai)

But in Python, or has lower precedence than +=, so it's year += (year % ai or ai)

Yes, that's correct.

So, it's equivalent to year += (year % ai if year % ai else ai)

Which is same as:

if year % ai:

year += year % ai

else:

year += ai

But this is not the same as the correct logic.

The correct logic should be:

if year % ai ==0:

year += ai

else:

year += ai - (year % ai)

Which is equivalent to:

year += ai - (year % ai) if year % ai !=0 else ai

So, the original code is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, considering that each sign occurs at specific periodic intervals and must occur sequentially.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years.
   - Signs must occur sequentially, meaning after the ith sign occurs in year `x`, we start looking for the (i+1)th sign in year `x+1`.

2. **Logic**:
   - Start from year 0.
   - For each sign, find the smallest year greater than or equal to the current year +1 that is a multiple of `a_i`.
   - Update the current year to this new year.
   - Repeat this process for all n signs.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula `y = ((current_year + 1 + a_i - 1) // a_i) * a_i` to find the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is greater than or equal to `current_year + 1`.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year = ((year + 1 + ai - 1) // ai) * ai
        print(year)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
  
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, read `n` (number of signs) and the list `a` (periodicities of the signs).
  - Initialize `year` to 0.
  - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, calculate the next occurrence year using the formula `y = ((year + 1 + ai - 1) // ai) * ai` and update `year` to this value.
  
- **Output**:
  - Print the final year for each test case.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the year when all n signs occur sequentially, adhering to their periodicities.
