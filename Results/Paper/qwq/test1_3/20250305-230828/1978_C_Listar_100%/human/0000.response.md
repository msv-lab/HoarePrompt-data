Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find a permutation of length n such that the Manhattan value, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each element and its position, equals a given k. If no such permutation exists, I should output "No"; otherwise, "Yes" and the permutation.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without duplicates. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

The Manhattan value is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between each element and its position index (1-based). So, for [3,1,2], it's |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

My task is, given n and k, to find any permutation where this sum equals k, or determine that no such permutation exists.

Looking at the program provided, it seems to handle multiple test cases. The main function is func_6, which calls func_4 to validate the input and then func_1 to generate the permutation if possible.

Let's break down func_4. It takes n and k, checks if k is odd. If k is odd, it returns (0,0), which seems to indicate that no permutation can have an odd Manhattan value. Then, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given n and checks if k exceeds this maximum. If it does, again, it returns (0,0). Otherwise, it returns n and k.

This suggests that the Manhattan value can never be odd, and there's a specific maximum value it can reach based on n.

For n odd, max_k is (n² - 1)/2, and for n even, it's n²/2.

I need to verify if this is correct.

Let's think about the maximum Manhattan value possible.

In the permutation, each element p_i can differ from i by at most n-1 (for example, when p_i = n and i = 1, |n - 1| = n-1).

But since we're summing over all i, and each p_i is unique, the maximum sum would be achieved when each p_i is as far as possible from i.

For n even, pairing the smallest and largest elements might achieve the maximum sum.

Wait, let's calculate max_k for small n.

For n=1, the only permutation is [1], Manhattan value 0.

For n=2, permutations are [1,2] (0), [2,1] (2).

So max_k=2.

For n=3, [1,2,3] (0), [1,3,2] (2), [2,1,3] (2), [2,3,1] (4), [3,1,2] (4), [3,2,1] (4).

So max_k=4.

For n=4, [1,2,3,4] (0), [1,2,4,3] (2), [1,3,2,4] (2), [1,3,4,2] (4), [1,4,2,3] (4), [1,4,3,2] (4), and so on, up to [4,3,2,1] (6).

Wait, |4-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |1-4| = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8.

Wait, that seems higher than I thought.

Wait, for n=4, maximum is 8.

Similarly, for n=3, maximum is 4.

So, for n=3, max_k=4, which is (9-1)/2=4.

For n=4, max_k=8, which is 16/2=8.

So yes, the formula seems correct.

Now, func_4 also checks if k is odd. It seems that Manhattan values are always even. Is that true?

From the examples:

n=3, possible k: 0,2,4.

n=4, possible k: 0,2,4,6,8.

So yes, all even numbers up to max_k.

Therefore, if k is odd, no permutation can achieve that Manhattan value.

Now, func_1 is where the permutation is generated.

It takes n and k, with k already divided by 2.

It initializes a list l from 1 to n.

It has a loop that iterates from n down to 1 in steps of 2.

Inside the loop, it decreases k by i-1 and modifies the list l accordingly.

If k becomes zero, it returns the current list.

If k is less than i-1, it calls func_2 to swap elements.

Otherwise, it calls func_3 to swap elements.

This seems like some kind of greedy algorithm to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired k.

Func_2 and func_3 are helper functions to swap elements in the list.

Func_5 is used to print "YES" and the permutation.

Func_6 ties everything together: it reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

Looking at the example outputs:

For 3 4: Yes, [3,1,2]

For 4 5: No

For 7 0: Yes, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

For 1 1000000000000: No

For 8 14: Yes, [8,2,3,4,5,6,1,7]

For 112 777: No

For 5 12: Yes, [5,4,3,1,2]

For 5 2: Yes, [2,1,3,4,5]

Seems consistent with the expected outputs.

So, overall, the program seems to correctly handle the cases where k is even and within the possible range, and correctly rejects cases where k is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.

Therefore, I would say the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
