Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. After each game, Eve removes one number from the sequence, and they play again with the remaining numbers, until there are no numbers left.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. I need to figure out, given the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, how many times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

First, I need to understand what the XOR of the sequence means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the number of 1s in the corresponding bits is odd, and 0 otherwise. So, for a sequence of numbers, the XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4, I can look at their binary representations:

- 1 is 01

- 2 is 10

- 3 is 11

- 4 is 100

Wait, but since the numbers can be up to 4, which is 100 in binary, I should consider at least 3 bits for the XOR calculation.

But actually, since the numbers are small, I can compute the XOR directly.

The key here is that Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is zero. Otherwise, Alice wins.

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

I need to find out, for each possible subset of the sequence (by removing one number at a time, then two, and so on), how many times the XOR is zero.

But that sounds complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and I can group the numbers in any way.

Also, XOR has the property that if I have a sequence and I remove a number, the new XOR is the old XOR XOR the removed number.

Wait, that might be useful.

Let's denote S as the XOR of all n numbers. Then, when Eve removes a number x, the new XOR becomes S XOR x.

Then, Bob wins if S XOR x == 0, which means x == S.

So, for the first removal, Bob wins if Eve removes a number that is equal to the XOR of all the numbers.

Similarly, for the next removal, the XOR would be S XOR x XOR y, where y is the next removed number.

Wait, this seems too involved. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let's consider the entire sequence and how the XOR changes as we remove numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Wait, maybe I can think about the counts of each number and how they contribute to the XOR.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, I can consider their binary representations:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (which is 1|2)

- 4: 100

So, in terms of bitwise contribution, 3 is just 1 and 2 combined.

Wait, but 3 is 011, which is 1 (001) OR 2 (010).

Similarly, 4 is 100.

So, the XOR of the sequence can be determined by the parity (even or odd counts) of each bit position.

Let me consider the bits separately.

Each number contributes to certain bit positions:

- 1: bit 0

- 2: bit 1

- 3: bits 0 and 1

- 4: bit 2

So, for bit 0: contributions from 1 and 3.

For bit 1: contributions from 2 and 3.

For bit 2: only from 4.

The XOR of the sequence will have bit i set if the number of 1s in that bit position is odd.

So, for the entire sequence, the XOR is determined by:

- bit 0: (count of 1 + count of 3) mod 2

- bit 1: (count of 2 + count of 3) mod 2

- bit 2: (count of 4) mod 2

Now, Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, we compute the XOR of the remaining numbers and see if it's zero.

I need to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the parity of the counts.

Let me denote:

Let a, b, c, d be the counts of 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Then, the XOR of all numbers is:

bit 0: (a + c) % 2

bit 1: (b + c) % 2

bit 2: d % 2

So, the XOR is:

x = ((a + c) % 2) * 1 + ((b + c) % 2) * 2 + (d % 2) * 4

Now, when Eve removes a number, say she removes a 1, then a decreases by 1, and the new XOR becomes:

bit 0: (a-1 + c) % 2

bit 1: (b + c) % 2

bit 2: d % 2

Similarly, if she removes a 2, b decreases by 1:

bit 0: (a + c) % 2

bit 1: (b-1 + c) % 2

bit 2: d % 2

And so on for 3 and 4.

Bob wins if the new XOR is zero, meaning all bits are zero.

So, for the new XOR to be zero:

(a new + c new) % 2 == 0

(b new + c new) % 2 == 0

(d new) % 2 == 0

Depending on which number is removed, the counts change accordingly.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can give the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

So, for the first test case: 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, 0 fours.

Total numbers: 3.

Eve removes one number, then another, then the last one.

So, sequence length decreases from 3 to 2 to 1 to 0.

Bob can win once.

Similarly, in the second test case: 1 one, 0 twos, 1 three, 2 fours.

Total numbers: 4.

Bob can win once.

In the third test case: 2 ones, 2 twos, 2 threes, 0 fours.

Total numbers: 6.

Bob can win three times.

Wait, in the first test case, with 3 numbers, Bob wins once.

In the second test case, with 4 numbers, Bob wins once.

In the third test case, with 6 numbers, Bob wins three times.

Is there a pattern here? Like, the number of times Bob can win is half the number of numbers, rounded down?

Wait, in the first test case, 3 numbers, Bob wins once.

In the second test case, 4 numbers, Bob wins once.

In the third test case, 6 numbers, Bob wins three times.

In the fourth test case, with counts 3, 3, 2, 0, total 8 numbers, Bob wins three times.

Wait, 8 numbers, half is 4, but Bob wins three times.

Not exactly half.

In the fifth test case, 0 ones, 9 twos, 9 threes, 9 fours, total 27 numbers.

Bob wins 12 times.

12 is roughly half of 27, but 27 divided by 2 is 13.5, so 13 or 14, but it's 12.

So, not exactly half.

Maybe it's floor(n/2)?

In the first test case, floor(3/2) = 1, matches.

Second test case, floor(4/2) = 2, but output is 1.

Third test case, floor(6/2) = 3, matches.

Fourth test case, floor(8/2) = 4, but output is 3.

Fifth test case, floor(27/2) = 13, but output is 12.

So, not exactly floor(n/2).

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of pairs of numbers.

Each pair can be used to make XOR zero.

But in the first test case, with 3 numbers, only one pair can be used to make XOR zero.

Wait, but in the first test case, with numbers 1, 2, 3:

XOR of all three: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which is Bob's win.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers 2 and 3: XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining number 3: XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove 3, sequence is empty, no XOR defined or considered as zero, but according to the problem, the game stops when the sequence is empty.

So, only one win for Bob, when the sequence has all three numbers.

Similarly, in the second test case, with numbers 1,3,4,4.

XOR of all four: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers 3,4,4: XOR is 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, remaining numbers 4,4: XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one 4, remaining one 4: XOR is 4, Alice wins.

Finally, remove the last 4, sequence empty.

So, only one win for Bob.

Similarly, in the third test case, with two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

Total six numbers.

Eve can arrange to have two wins for Bob.

Wait, but the output says three times.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps Eve can arrange to have more Bob wins.

Let me see.

Initial sequence: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

XOR of all six: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (1 XOR 1) XOR (2 XOR 2) XOR (3 XOR 3) = 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining: one 1, two 2's, two 3's.

XOR: 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR (2 XOR 2) XOR (3 XOR 3) = 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 1, remaining: two 2's, two 3's.

XOR: 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (2 XOR 2) XOR (3 XOR 3) = 0 XOR 0 = 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one 2, remaining: one 2, two 3's.

XOR: 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 0 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, remove another 2, remaining: two 3's.

XOR: 3 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Finally, remove one 3, remaining one 3.

XOR: 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last 3, sequence empty.

So, Bob wins three times, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, Bob wins three times.

Which is more than floor(6/2) = 3.

Wait, floor(6/2) is 3, and Bob wins three times.

In the fourth test case, counts are 3,3,2,0, total 8 numbers.

Bob wins three times.

Floor(8/2) is 4, but Bob wins three times.

In the fifth test case, counts are 0,9,9,9, total 27 numbers.

Bob wins 12 times.

Floor(27/2) is 13, but it's 12.

So, perhaps it's floor((n+1)/2), but in the third test case, floor((6+1)/2) = 3, which matches.

In the fourth test case, floor((8+1)/2) = 4, but output is 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of times the XOR is zero, which seems to be related to the parity of the counts.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the XOR of the sequence after each removal and see when it becomes zero.

But that seems too time-consuming.

Maybe there's a smarter way to count the number of subsets whose XOR is zero.

But the problem is not about subsets, it's about sequences where numbers are removed one by one, and at each step, the XOR of the current sequence is checked.

Wait, but in the way the game is played, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers.

So, it's like, starting with the full sequence, then removing one number, then another, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

At each step, Bob wins if the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

I need to maximize the number of times Bob wins, by choosing which number to remove at each step.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, given optimal choices by Eve.

This seems like it can be modeled as choosing a removal order that maximizes the number of times the XOR becomes zero after a removal.

But finding the optimal removal order seems complicated.

Maybe there's a mathematical formula based on the counts of each number.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, the order of removal doesn't affect the XOR of the remaining numbers, only which numbers are remaining.

So, perhaps the problem can be reduced to selecting subsets and checking their XOR.

But the problem is about removing one number at a time, so the order matters in terms of which subset is being considered at each step.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as starting with the full set and removing one element to get subsets of decreasing sizes, and counting how many of those subsets have XOR zero.

But determining which subsets have XOR zero is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be used here, but that seems too involved.

Let me consider smaller cases.

In the first test case: counts are 1,1,1,0, which are one 1, one 2, one 3.

Total numbers: 3.

Subsets:

- All three: XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Any two:

- 1 and 2: XOR is 3, which is not zero.

- 1 and 3: XOR is 2, not zero.

- 2 and 3: XOR is 1, not zero.

- Any one:

- 1: 1 ≠ 0

- 2: 2 ≠ 0

- 3: 3 ≠ 0

- Empty set: XOR is zero, but the problem says that the sequence is empty, so likely not considered.

So, only one win for Bob, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case: 1,0,1,2 → one 1, one 3, two 4's.

Total numbers: 4.

Subsets:

- All four: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 2, not zero.

- Any three:

- 1,3,4: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, not zero.

- 1,4,4: 1 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1, not zero.

- 3,4,4: 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3, not zero.

- Any two:

- 1,3: 1 XOR 3 = 2

- 1,4: 1 XOR 4 = 5

- 1,4: same as above

- 3,4: 3 XOR 4 = 7

- 4,4: 4 XOR 4 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Any one:

- 1: 1

- 3: 3

- 4: 4

- Empty set: not considered.

So, only one win for Bob, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case: 2,2,2,0 → two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

Total numbers: 6.

Subsets:

- All six: as calculated earlier, XOR is zero.

- Any five: removing one number from the full set.

- Removing 1: XOR is XOR of one 1, two 2's, two 3's → 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1 ≠ 0

- Removing 2: XOR is two 1's, one 2, two 3's → 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 0 = 2 ≠ 0

- Removing 3: XOR is two 1's, two 2's, one 3 → 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 0 XOR 3 = 3 ≠ 0

- Any four: some combinations.

- For example, two 1's, two 2's: XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Two 1's, one 2, one 3: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 1 ≠ 0

- One 1, two 2's, one 3: 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 XOR 3 = 2 ≠ 0

- Etc.

- Any three: some combinations.

- For example, one 1, one 2, one 3: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Two 1's, one 3: 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 0 XOR 3 = 3 ≠ 0

- Etc.

- Any two: some combinations.

- For example, one 1 and one 3: 1 XOR 3 = 2 ≠ 0

- Two 1's: 1 XOR 1 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Two 2's: 2 XOR 2 = 0 → Bob wins.

- Etc.

- Any one: 1, 2, or 3, none are zero.

- Empty set: not considered.

So, in this case, Bob can win multiple times: full set (6), four of them (two 1's and two 2's), two of them (two 1's), two of them (two 2's), and perhaps others.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's only 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the problem says that Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers.

So, it's a sequence of removals, and at each step, Bob wins if the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, it's not about all possible subsets, but about the sequence of removals.

This seems more like a dynamic programming problem, where at each step, Eve chooses which number to remove to maximize the number of Bob's wins.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 200 (since p_i <= 200), it's too slow to simulate this process for each test case.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the XOR properties again.

The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the set is linearly dependent over GF(2) in the vector space formed by the bits.

But maybe that's too abstract for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each bit.

Given that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, which correspond to binary 001, 010, 011, and 100 respectively.

So, bit positions are:

- bit0: 1,3

- bit1: 2,3

- bit2: 4

So, the XOR of the sequence is determined by the parity of the counts in each bit position.

XOR bit0 = (a + c) mod 2

XOR bit1 = (b + c) mod 2

XOR bit2 = d mod 2

Bob wins if all these are zero.

So, for Bob to win, we need:

(a + c) mod 2 == 0

(b + c) mod 2 == 0

d mod 2 == 0

Now, when Eve removes a number, she can choose to remove 1,2,3, or 4, which will adjust the counts accordingly.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, so she wants to maximize the number of times the above conditions are satisfied after each removal.

This seems tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the initial counts.

Let me consider that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to try to satisfy these conditions.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the number of times the conditions are satisfied over the course of the game.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the total number of times Bob can win, which is the number of times the XOR is zero as numbers are removed.

This seems related to the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But counting the number of subsets with XOR zero is a well-known problem, but it's exponential in time complexity, which is not feasible here.

Wait, but in this specific case, since the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, maybe there's a formula based on their counts.

Let me consider that.

Let me denote a, b, c, d as the counts of 1,2,3,4 respectively.

Total numbers n = a + b + c + d.

We need to count the number of subsets where:

(a' + c') mod 2 == 0

(b' + c') mod 2 == 0

d' mod 2 == 0

Where a' <= a, b' <= b, c' <= c, d' <= d.

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of pairing numbers to make their XOR zero.

For example, two 1's XOR to zero, two 2's XOR to zero, two 3's XOR to zero, two 4's XOR to zero.

Similarly, 1 and 3 together XOR to 2, which is not zero, unless there's another 2 or 3 to cancel it out.

This seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs that XOR to zero.

But again, it's not directly applicable.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

First test case: 1,1,1,0 → Bob wins once.

Second test case:1,0,1,2 → Bob wins once.

Third test case:2,2,2,0 → Bob wins three times.

Fourth test case:3,3,2,0 → Bob wins three times.

Fifth test case:0,9,9,9 → Bob wins twelve times.

Looking at the third test case: a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

Total n=6.

Bob wins three times.

Similarly, in the fifth test case: a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

Total n=27.

Bob wins twelve times.

I need to find a formula that can compute this efficiently for multiple test cases, each with p_i up to 200.

So, something O(t * p_i) won't work for t=10^4.

I need an O(1) or O(t) solution.

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

Looking at the third test case: a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

Bob wins three times.

Looking at the counts:

- a + c = 4, which is even.

- b + c = 4, which is even.

- d = 0, which is even.

So, the initial XOR is zero, so Bob wins once.

Then, Eve removes one number.

If she removes a 1, then a=1, c=2.

a + c = 3, odd.

b + c = 2 + 2 = 4, even.

d = 0, even.

So, XOR is non-zero.

Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say another 1, a=0, c=2.

a + c = 2, even.

b + c = 2 + 2 = 4, even.

d = 0, even.

Bob wins again.

Then, remove a 2, b=1, c=2.

a + c = 0 + 2 = 2, even.

b + c = 1 + 2 = 3, odd.

d = 0, even.

XOR is non-zero.

Alice wins.

Then, remove another 2, b=0, c=2.

a + c = 0 + 2 = 2, even.

b + c = 0 + 2 = 2, even.

d = 0, even.

Bob wins again.

Then, remove a 3, c=1.

a + c = 0 + 1 = 1, odd.

b + c = 0 + 1 = 1, odd.

d = 0, even.

XOR is non-zero.

Alice wins.

Then, remove another 3, c=0.

a + c = 0 + 0 = 0, even.

b + c = 0 + 0 = 0, even.

d = 0, even.

Bob wins again.

But in the sample output, Bob wins only three times, but according to this, he wins four times.

Wait, perhaps the game stops when the sequence is empty.

In the problem statement, it says that the game continues until the sequence is empty.

But in the sample explanation, it seems that Bob wins only when the sequence has all three numbers, and when two numbers are left (in the first test case).

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the third test case, Bob wins three times, but according to my earlier calculation, he wins four times.

Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the last win when the sequence is empty is not considered.

In the problem statement, it says "the sequence is empty, so the game stops."

So, perhaps Bob only wins when the sequence is non-empty and the XOR is zero.

So, in the third test case, Bob wins when n=6, n=4, and n=2.

So, three times, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the first test case, Bob wins when n=3.

In the second test case, Bob wins when n=2.

In the fourth test case, Bob wins three times.

In the fifth test case, Bob wins twelve times.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob wins is equal to the number of even counts of d, plus the number of times a + c is even and b + c is even.

But I need a general formula.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times d is even, and a + c is even, and b + c is even.

But in the third test case, d=0 (even), a + c=4 (even), b + c=4 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, d=0 (even), a + c=3 (odd), b + c=4 (even) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another, d=0 (even), a + c=2 (even), b + c=2 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove another, d=0 (even), a + c=2 (even), b + c=1 (odd) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another, d=0 (even), a + c=2 (even), b + c=1 (odd) → Alice wins.

Wait, something's wrong in my earlier counting.

Wait, no, in the third step, after removing two numbers, a=0, c=2, b=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=4 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove a 2, b=1, c=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=3 (odd), d=0 (even) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another 2, b=0, c=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=2 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove a 3, c=1, a=0, b=0, d=0.

a + c=1 (odd), b + c=1 (odd), d=0 (even) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another 3, c=0, a=0, b=0, d=0.

a + c=0 (even), b + c=0 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

So, in total, Bob wins four times, but the sample output is three.

Perhaps the empty set is not considered as a win for Bob.

So, perhaps only when the sequence is non-empty and XOR is zero, Bob wins.

So, in the last step, when the sequence is empty, it's not considered.

Hence, Bob wins three times, which matches the sample.

So, the condition is that the sequence is non-empty and XOR is zero.

Now, I need to find a way to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

Let me consider that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero after a removal.

Given that, perhaps Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR becomes zero as often as possible.

But how?

Let me consider that Bob wins when:

(a' + c') mod 2 == 0

(b' + c') mod 2 == 0

(d') mod 2 == 0

Where a', b', c', d' are the counts after some removals.

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step.

She wants to maximize the number of times these conditions are satisfied.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that each time Eve removes a number, she can choose to remove a number that will make the XOR zero for the current sequence.

But she has to do it optimally over all steps.

This seems like a puzzle that requires careful selection at each step.

But for the purpose of this problem, with time constraints, I need a formula or a quick way to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs of numbers plus some adjustments.

For example, in the third test case, a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

Number of pairs: floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0.

floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but the sample output is 1.

So, not matching.

In the second test case, a=1, b=0, c=1, d=2.

floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, a=3, b=3, c=2, d=0.

floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample output.

In the fifth test case, a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the first test case, this approach gives 0, but the sample output is 1.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Wait, in the first test case, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0.

But according to the earlier manual simulation, Bob wins once when all three numbers are present.

But according to this formula, floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which doesn't match the sample output of 1.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Looking back, in the third test case, a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample output of 3.

In the fourth test case, a=3, b=3, c=2, d=0.

floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample output of 3.

In the fifth test case, a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which matches the sample output of 12.

But in the first test case, it doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's an extra condition when a + c and b + c and d are all even.

In the first test case, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0.

a + c = 2, which is even.

b + c = 2, which is even.

d = 0, which is even.

So, initially, Bob wins once.

Then, after removing one number, the conditions are no longer satisfied.

So, perhaps there's an additional +1 if initially a + c is even, b + c is even, and d is even.

In the first test case, a + c = 2 (even), b + c = 2 (even), d = 0 (even), so +1 to the sum of floor divisions.

So, total Bob wins: floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the sample.

In the second test case, a=1, b=0, c=1, d=2.

a + c = 2 (even), b + c = 1 (odd), d = 2 (even).

Since b + c is odd, no extra +1.

So, floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which matches.

In the third test case, a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

a + c = 4 (even), b + c = 4 (even), d = 0 (even), so +1.

floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4, but the sample output is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's a conditional +1 only if a + c is odd, b + c is odd, and d is odd.

Wait, no, in the first test case, a + c is even, b + c is even, d is even, so +1.

In the third test case, a + c is even, b + c is even, d is even, so +1, but sample output is 3, but according to the formula, it's floor sums +1 = 4, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's +1 if a + c is even, b + c is even, and d is even, but only if n is odd.

Wait, in the first test case, n=3 (odd), a + c even, b + c even, d even → +1.

In the third test case, n=6 (even), a + c even, b + c even, d even → no +1.

Then, floor sums would be 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample.

In the fourth test case, a=3, b=3, c=2, d=0.

a + c = 5 (odd), b + c = 5 (odd), d = 0 (even).

So, no +1.

floor sums: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample.

In the fifth test case, a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

a + c = 9 (odd), b + c = 18 (even), d = 9 (odd).

So, no +1.

floor sums: 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which matches the sample.

So, the formula seems to be:

cnt = floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2)

if a + c is even and b + c is even and d is even and n is odd:

cnt +=1

But in the first test case, n=3 (odd), a + c=2 (even), b + c=2 (even), d=0 (even), so cnt +=1.

In the third test case, n=6 (even), a + c=4 (even), b + c=4 (even), d=0 (even), so no +=1.

Wait, but in the third test case, according to this, cnt = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the sample.

Similarly, in the first test case, cnt = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, then +=1, cnt=1, which matches the sample.

Okay, this seems promising.

Let me check another case.

Suppose a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0.

n=0, which is even.

a + c=0 (even), b + c=0 (even), d=0 (even), but n is even, so no +=1.

cnt = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is correct, as there are no numbers to remove.

Another case: a=1, b=1, c=0, d=0.

n=2.

a + c=1 (odd), b + c=1 (odd), d=0 (even).

So, no +=1.

cnt = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Indeed, in this case:

Initial sequence: 1 and 2.

XOR: 1 XOR 2 = 3 ≠ 0.

Remove one number, say 1, remaining 2: 2 ≠ 0.

Remove another number, remaining empty set: not considered.

So, Bob wins zero times, which matches cnt=0.

Another case: a=2, b=2, c=2, d=1.

n=7 (odd).

a + c=4 (even), b + c=4 (even), d=1 (odd).

Since d is odd, no +=1.

cnt = floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(1/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3.

Is this correct?

Initial sequence: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, one 4.

XOR: (a + c)=4 (even), (b + c)=4 (even), d=1 (odd) → XOR is non-zero, so Bob doesn't win.

Then, remove one number.

If Eve removes a 4, d=0 (even), a + c=4 (even), b + c=4 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove another number, say a 1, a=1, c=2, b=2, d=0.

a + c=3 (odd), b + c=4 (even), d=0 (even) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say a 1, a=0, c=2, b=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=4 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove a 2, b=1, c=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=3 (odd), d=0 (even) → Alice wins.

Then, remove another 2, b=0, c=2, d=0.

a + c=2 (even), b + c=2 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

Then, remove a 3, c=1, a=0, b=0, d=0.

a + c=1 (odd), b + c=1 (odd), d=0 (even) → Alice wins.

Finally, remove the last 3, c=0, a=0, b=0, d=0.

a + c=0 (even), b + c=0 (even), d=0 (even) → Bob wins.

So, Bob wins four times, but according to the formula, cnt = 3.

So, perhaps the formula is missing something.

Wait, in this case, n=7 (odd), a + c=4 (even), b + c=4 (even), d=1 (odd).

Since d is odd, no +=1.

cnt = 3, but according to the simulation, Bob wins four times.

Which contradicts the earlier assumption.

So, perhaps the formula is not complete.

I need to think differently.

Maybe the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times d is even, plus some adjustments based on a and b.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that each pair of numbers can be removed to make the XOR zero.

For example, removing two 1's makes a + c even, similarly for b + c and d.

But again, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times d is even, plus the number of times a + c is even and b + c is even.

But I need to account for
