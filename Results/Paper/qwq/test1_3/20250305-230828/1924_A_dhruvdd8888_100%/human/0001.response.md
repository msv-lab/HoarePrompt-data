Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can remove 'e' and 'd' to get "abc".

So, the problem is asking whether every possible combination of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet is present as a subsequence in s. If not, I need to output one such missing combination.

Let's consider the constraints:

- t is the number of test cases, and it can be up to 10^5.

- n can be from 1 to 26.

- k can be from 1 to 26.

- m is the length of the string s, up to 1000 per test case.

- The total sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6.

Given that t can be up to 10^5 and m up to 1000, but the sum of m over all test cases is up to 10^6, which is manageable.

Now, thinking about the approach:

The total number of possible strings of length n using k alphabets is k^n. For n up to 26 and k up to 26, k^n can be quite large, up to 26^26, which is way too big to handle directly. So, I need a smarter way to check if all these possible strings are subsequences of s without generating and checking each one individually.

That means I need an efficient way to verify if s contains every possible subsequence of length n using the first k letters.

One way to approach this is to consider the positions of each character in s. For each character in the first k letters, I can list their positions in s in increasing order.

Then, for any sequence of characters, I can check if there exists a subsequence in s that matches that sequence by iterating through the positions.

But again, checking all k^n sequences is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a better way.

Let's think about it differently. If s contains all possible subsequences of length n using the first k letters, that means that for any sequence of n characters from the first k letters, there exists a way to choose positions in s such that the characters appear in that order.

This seems complicated to check directly.

Maybe I can think about the minimal requirements for s to contain all these subsequences.

One idea is that for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n using k letters, s must have enough variety and ordering to cover all possibilities.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the positions of characters.

Suppose I have a list of positions for each character from 'a' to the k-th letter.

For example, for k=2, letters 'a' and 'b', and s="abba", the positions are:

a: positions 0, 3

b: positions 1, 2

Now, for n=2, possible sequences are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

I need to check if each of these is a subsequence in s.

"aa": positions 0 and 3 (in order)

"ab": positions 0 and 1

"ba": positions 1 and 3

"bb": positions 1 and 2

All of these are present in s, so the answer is YES.

In the second example, with s="abb", positions are:

a: 0

b: 1, 2

Sequences:

"aa": need two 'a's, but only one 'a' in s, so "aa" is not a subsequence.

Hence, answer is NO, and we can output "aa" as one missing sequence.

In the third example, s="aabbccabab", k=3 (a,b,c), n=3.

Possible sequences like "abc", "aab", "bbb", etc., need to be checked if they are subsequences in s.

But checking each individually is not efficient.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the minimal s that can contain all possible subsequences of length n with k letters.

This seems related to de Bruijn sequences, which are used to cover all possible sequences of a certain length with overlaps.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Another approach: consider that for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n with k letters, it must be rich enough in terms of the ordering and repetitions of the letters.

But I need a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider the positions of each character.

If I have the lists of positions for each character, I can think of these lists as increasing sequences.

To check if a particular sequence is a subsequence, I can iterate through the sequence and find positions in s that are in increasing order corresponding to the characters.

But again, checking all possible sequences is not feasible.

I need a way to determine if there's at least one sequence that is missing.

How about finding the minimal s that can contain all possible subsequences.

Alternatively, find if s is sufficient to cover all possible subsequences.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the opposite: find a sequence that is not present in s.

If I can find one such sequence, then the answer is NO, and I can output that sequence.

If I can't find any such sequence, then the answer is YES.

But again, checking all possible sequences is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a smarter way to find a missing sequence if it exists.

Let me think about the positions again.

Suppose I have the lists of positions for each character.

I can think of building a sequence step by step and see if I can find positions in s that allow that sequence.

But I need to do this efficiently.

Maybe I can model this as a graph or use dynamic programming.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the position in s, and j is the position in the sequence we're building.

But n can be up to 26, which is too large for DP with states up to 26.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that to have all possible subsequences of length n, s must contain all possible combinations of characters in some order.

But I need a way to check this without enumerating all possibilities.

Another idea: if s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for any set of n characters, there must be a way to find them in order in s.

But again, this seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build a trie where each path represents a possible sequence.

Then, I can try to match s to this trie and see which sequences are missing.

But building a trie with k^n nodes is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for any sequence of n characters, I can find them in s in that order, not necessarily consecutively.

So, perhaps I can check if s has enough diversity in character ordering.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider smaller values of n and k to get some intuition.

Take n=1, k=1, s="a".

Possible sequence: "a".

Is "a" a subsequence of "a"? Yes.

So, answer is YES.

n=1, k=2, s="ab".

Possible sequences: "a", "b".

Both are present in s.

Answer is YES.

n=2, k=2, s="abba".

Possible sequences: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

All are present as subsequences.

Answer is YES.

n=2, k=2, s="abb".

Possible sequences: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

"aa" is not present, so answer is NO, and output "aa".

n=3, k=3, s="aabbccabab".

Possible sequences: all combinations of a, b, c of length 3, like "aaa", "aab", "abc", etc.

Need to check if all are present in s as subsequences.

This seems complex.

Now, I need an efficient way to determine if there's at least one sequence missing.

If I can find one missing sequence, then I can output NO and that sequence.

If no such sequence exists, then output YES.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to quickly identify a missing sequence without checking all possibilities.

One way is to find the minimal sequence that is missing.

But even that might not be efficient enough.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the number of possible sequences is k^n, and if m < n, it's impossible to have all sequences, since the shortest possible s that can contain all sequences would be longer.

But m can be as small as 1, and n can be up to 26, so m < n is possible.

Wait, no, m can be up to 1000 per test case.

But for n=26, k=26, k^n is extremely large, much larger than m can be.

So, for larger n and k, it's almost impossible for s to contain all sequences, but I still need to handle the general case.

I need a way to efficiently determine if s contains all possible subsequences.

Let me consider the positions of each character.

For each character, I have a list of positions where it appears in s.

To check if a particular sequence is a subsequence, I can iterate through the sequence and find positions in s that are in increasing order corresponding to the characters.

To do this efficiently for all possible sequences, I need a smarter approach.

An idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible subsequences, then for any sequence, there must be a way to choose positions in s that match the sequence order.

But checking this directly is not feasible.

Another idea: find the minimal sequence that is missing.

To do this, I can try to build the lexicographically smallest sequence that is not present in s.

How can I do that?

I can start with the smallest possible sequence, like 'a' repeated n times, and check if it's present.

If it is, move to the next sequence in lexicographical order, and so on.

But this would still require checking up to k^n sequences, which is too much.

I need a smarter way to find a missing sequence without checking each one individually.

Let me think about binary search.

If I can order all possible sequences in lexicographical order and find the first one that is missing, that would be efficient.

But even then, generating the sequences is not feasible for large k and n.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a trie and traverse it while checking against s.

But again, building the trie is not practical.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the first character of the sequence and try to find the remaining n-1 characters in s after the position of the first character.

This seems similar to recursion, but again, not practical for large n.

I need a way to determine if there's at least one sequence missing.

An alternative idea: use the pigeonhole principle or some combinatorial argument to determine if s is long enough to contain all possible sequences.

For example, for n=1, m >=1 and s contains all k letters.

For n=2, m needs to be at least k + something to cover all pairs.

But this is not precise enough.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have lists of positions for each character.

Then, to form a sequence, I need to pick positions in increasing order, one from each character in the sequence.

This is similar to finding the intersection of multiple increasing sequences.

But again, checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need a way to find if there's at least one combination that cannot be formed.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible characters in k, and is long enough, it might contain all sequences.

But determining the minimal length of s required is complex.

Another idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible subsequences, then for any sequence, there must be a way to choose positions in s that match the sequence order.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me consider the number of distinct subsequences of s.

The total number of distinct subsequences of s is 2^m, but that includes all possible subsequences, not just those of length n.

But calculating the number of distinct subsequences of length n is still too slow for large m and n.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that to contain all possible sequences, s must have a certain structure.

Specifically, for k=1, n=1, s must contain 'a'.

For k=1, n=2, s must contain 'aa'.

For k=2, n=1, s must contain both 'a' and 'b'.

For k=2, n=2, s must contain 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb'.

So, in general, s must contain all possible combinations of length n using the first k letters.

I need a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length 1, which are the individual letters, and then for length 2, and so on, up to length n.

But checking this directly is not efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of de Bruijn sequences, which are sequences that contain all possible subsequences of a certain length.

But again, I'm not sure how to apply this here.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length n, then it must also contain all possible sequences of length less than n.

So, maybe I can build up from length 1 to length n.

But this still doesn't give me a direct way to check.

Let me consider the positions of each character.

For each character, I have a list of positions where it appears in s.

To form a sequence, I need to pick positions in increasing order, one from each character in the sequence.

So, for a sequence like "abc", I need a position for 'a', then a position for 'b' that comes after 'a', then a position for 'c' that comes after 'b'.

This seems similar to finding a chain of positions in increasing order.

But checking this for all possible sequences is not feasible.

I need a way to find at least one sequence that cannot be formed.

An idea: find the sequence that requires the maximum number of certain character repetitions that s doesn't provide.

But I'm not sure how to formalize this.

Let me consider that if s doesn't contain enough repetitions of a certain character, then some sequences are impossible.

For example, if n=2 and k=2, and s="ab", then "aa" is missing because there's only one 'a' in s.

So, in this case, s must contain at least n occurrences of each character to cover sequences where a character is repeated n times.

Wait, but that's not sufficient in all cases.

For example, if s="aab", k=2, n=2, it contains "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

Wait, "ba" is present because positions could be 0 and 2, or 1 and 2.

Wait, no, "ba" would be positions 1 and 2 ('a' at 1, 'b' at 2).

So, in this case, all sequences are present.

But if s="abb", as in the second example, "aa" is missing because there's only one 'a'.

So, for sequences with multiple occurrences of the same character, s must contain at least that many occurrences of that character.

But that's only a necessary condition, not sufficient.

Because even if s has enough repetitions, it might not have the right ordering for certain sequences.

Wait, but in the earlier example, s="abba", which has two 'a's and two 'b's, and it contains all sequences of length 2 with k=2.

So, having enough repetitions is necessary but not sufficient.

But if s doesn't have enough repetitions of a character, then sequences with more repetitions of that character are missing.

So, in that case, I can immediately find a missing sequence.

For example, if n=3, k=2, and s has only two 'a's, then any sequence with three 'a's is missing.

So, in general, for each character, if the count in s is less than n, then sequences with more occurrences of that character than available in s are missing.

In such cases, I can output NO and provide a sequence with that character repeated more times than available in s.

But what if s has at least n occurrences of each character?

Then, I need to check if all possible sequences can be formed.

This seems more complex.

In this case, I need to ensure that for any sequence of characters, there exist positions in s that allow that sequence as a subsequence.

This still seems too broad to check directly.

Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that s must be such that for any sequence, the characters appear in that order somewhere in s.

This sounds similar to checking if s is a supersequence for all possible sequences.

But again, this is not practical for large n and k.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences, then s must be rich enough in terms of the ordering and repetitions of characters.

But I need a way to verify this without checking each sequence individually.

An idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible sequences of length n, then for any prefix of length n-1, all possible extensions with the k letters must be present.

This sounds similar to the properties of de Bruijn sequences.

In other words, for any subsequence of length n-1 in s, all possible next characters must be present somewhere in the remaining part of s.

If this is true for all possible subsequences of length n-1, then s contains all possible sequences of length n.

But checking this directly is still too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent sequences of length n-1, and edges represent the possible next characters.

Then, s must cover all possible paths in this graph.

This sounds like a de Bruijn graph.

But building such a graph is not feasible for large n and k.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length n, then for any sequence of length n-1, appending any of the k characters should result in a sequence that is present in s.

This seems similar to the overlap properties in de Bruijn sequences.

But again, I'm not sure how to apply this efficiently.

Let me think about the minimal s that can contain all possible subsequences of length n with k letters.

This minimal s would be a de Bruijn sequence of order n with k letters, which has length k^n.

But in our problem, s can be longer than k^n, and we need to check if it contains all possible subsequences of length n.

But even knowing this, I don't have a direct way to check for the presence of all subsequences.

Let me consider that if s has all possible subsequences, then the number of distinct subsequences of length n should be k^n.

But checking the number of distinct subsequences is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the number of distinct subsequences of s of length n and see if it equals k^n.

If it does, then all possible sequences are present; otherwise, not.

This seems promising.

So, I can compute the number of distinct subsequences of s of length n and compare it to k^n.

If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.

But computing the number of distinct subsequences of s of length n is still time-consuming for large n and m.

I need an efficient way to compute the number of distinct subsequences of s of length n.

One way is to iterate through s and keep track of the unique sequences formed.

But with n up to 26 and m up to 1000 per test case, and t up to 10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider using a set to store the subsequences encountered.

But for n=26 and m=1000, storing subsequences of length 26 would be too slow.

I need a better way.

An alternative idea: use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct subsequences.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the length of the subsequence and j is the current character.

But this seems too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can use bitmasks or some other optimization.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each position in s, I can keep track of the possible sequences that can be formed up to that position.

But again, with n up to 26, this seems infeasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that to contain all possible subsequences of length n, s must have a certain minimal length.

Specifically, the minimal length of s that can contain all possible subsequences of length n is n + (k-1)*n, but I'm not sure about this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that s must contain at least n occurrences of each character to cover sequences where a character is repeated n times.

But as I thought earlier, this is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

So, in addition to having at least n occurrences of each character, there must be enough variety in the ordering.

But I still don't have a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length n, then for any sequence of n-1 characters, all k possible extensions must be present.

This is similar to the properties of de Bruijn sequences.

So, perhaps I can check if for every possible sequence of n-1 characters, all k possible next characters are present in s.

If this is true for all sequences of n-1 characters, then s contains all possible sequences of length n.

Otherwise, there exists at least one sequence that is missing.

This seems like a promising approach.

To implement this, I can:

1. Collect all possible sequences of length n-1 in s.

2. For each such sequence, check if all k possible next characters are present in s following that sequence.

If any sequence of n-1 characters does not have all k possible extensions in s, then I can construct a missing sequence by choosing a character that doesn't follow that sequence.

This way, I can find a missing sequence without checking all k^n possibilities.

This seems efficient enough.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function that checks if for every possible sequence of n-1 characters, all k possible next characters appear after it in s.

If this is true, then s contains all possible sequences of length n.

Otherwise, I can construct a missing sequence by finding a sequence of n-1 characters that is missing at least one possible extension, and then append that missing character to form a sequence of length n that is not present in s.

This seems workable.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to track the possible next characters for every subsequence of length n-1 in s.

Given that n can be up to 26 and m up to 1000, and t up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

One way is to use a rolling hash or a sliding window approach to keep track of the last n-1 characters and the next character.

But handling n up to 26 might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a dictionary where keys are sequences of n-1 characters, and values are sets of next characters that follow those sequences in s.

Then, for each possible sequence of n-1 characters, I can check if the corresponding set has all k possible characters.

If any sequence is missing at least one character, I can construct a missing sequence by appending that missing character to the sequence.

This seems feasible.

Given that k is up to 26 and n is up to 26, the number of possible sequences of n-1 characters is k^{n-1}, which for n=26 and k=26 is still too large to handle directly.

This suggests that this approach is not efficient enough.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that to check if s contains all possible subsequences of length n, it must contain all possible sequences in some order.

But I need a way to verify this without enumerating all possibilities.

Another idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible sequences of length n-1, and for each such sequence, it has all k possible extensions, then s contains all possible sequences of length n.

This is similar to the previous approach but perhaps can be optimized.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the sequences that have been seen.

Define dp[mask][last], where mask represents the characters used so far, and last is the last character in the sequence.

But this seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if s is long enough and has all possible characters in a certain order, it can contain all possible subsequences.

But I need a way to determine if s is sufficiently rich in its subsequences.

Another idea: use the fact that if s contains all possible sequences of length n-1, and each of these sequences can be extended to all possible sequences of length n by appending any of the k characters, then s contains all possible sequences of length n.

But again, this requires tracking all possible sequences of n-1, which is not feasible for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length 1, which are the individual characters, and then for sequences of length 2, and so on, up to n.

But this still doesn't give me a direct way to check.

Wait, perhaps I can use induction.

Assume that s contains all possible sequences of length i, and check if it contains all sequences of length i+1.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if s contains all possible sequences of length n-1, and for each such sequence, there exists at least one next character that allows the sequence to be extended.

But again, this is not sufficient to ensure that all sequences of length n are present.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the positions of characters.

For each character, I have a list of positions where it appears in s.

To form a sequence, I need to pick positions in increasing order, one from each character in the sequence.

So, for a sequence like "abc", I need to pick a position for 'a', then a position for 'b' that comes
