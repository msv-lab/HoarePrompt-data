Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and his phone has initial charge f. The phone loses a units of charge per unit of time it's on, and turning it off and on again costs b units of charge each time. I need to figure out if it's possible for Stepan to send all the messages without the phone running out of charge.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's allowed. The phone starts at moment 0 with charge f, and it's already on. Messages are to be sent at moments m1 to mn, where each mi is less than mi+1, so the moments are in increasing order.

The phone loses charge over time while it's on, and there's an option to turn it off and on again, which costs b units each time this action is performed. Turning it off and on is instantaneous, meaning you can do it at the same moment as sending a message.

The goal is to manage the phone's charge by deciding when to keep it on and when to turn it off and on again, to ensure that at each message moment, there's enough charge to send the message.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the charge consumption between message moments. Between two consecutive messages, the phone is on and losing charge at a rate of a per unit time. So, if there's a time gap between mi and mi+1, the charge decreases by a*(mi+1 - mi).

However, Stepan can choose to turn the phone off at some moments and turn it back on before the next message. Each time he does this, it costs b units of charge.

I need to find a strategy that minimizes the charge consumption or at least ensures that the charge doesn't drop below zero at any message moment.

I recall that in similar problems, it's often optimal to keep the phone on for as long as possible, but in this case, turning it off might save charge if the time gap is large enough.

Wait, actually, turning it off might cost b units, which could be more or less than keeping it on for a certain period.

I need to find a balance: when to keep the phone on and when to turn it off to minimize charge consumption.

Let me consider the charge consumption if the phone is kept on all the time, without turning it off.

In that case, the charge at moment mi would be f - a*mi.

But since messages are sent at increasing moments, and the phone is on the whole time, the charge would be f - a*mn at the last message.

But this might not be optimal, especially if there are large gaps between some messages.

Alternatively, Stepan can choose to turn the phone off between messages, paying b each time he turns it on again.

But turning it off and on has a cost, so he needs to decide when it's worth doing that.

I need to find a way to model this decision.

Let me consider the time intervals between messages.

Suppose I have messages at m1, m2, ..., mn.

The time between m0=0 and m1 is m1 - 0 = m1.

Between m1 and m2 is m2 - m1, and so on.

If Stepan keeps the phone on during a interval, the charge decreases by a*(end - start).

If he turns it off at the end of the interval and turns it on at the next message, it costs b.

So, for each interval, he has to choose: keep it on (lose a*(end - start)) or turn it off and on again (lose b).

He should choose the option that loses less charge for each interval.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because turning it off and on again has a fixed cost b, while keeping it on costs a*(end - start).

So, for each interval, if a*(end - start) > b, then turning it off and on again is better because it costs less charge.

Conversely, if a*(end - start) < b, keeping it on is better.

If a*(end - start) == b, it's indifferent.

So, for each interval, I can calculate a*(end - start) and compare it to b, and choose the minimum between the two.

Then, sum up these minimum values for all intervals, and add the initial charge f.

If the total charge consumed is less than or equal to f, then it's possible to send all messages.

Wait, but I need to ensure that at each message moment, there's enough charge left to send the message.

Is summing up the minimum costs for each interval and comparing it to f sufficient?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have n messages, and I calculate for each interval between messages (including from start to first message) the minimum charge cost between keeping it on or turning it off and on.

Then, the total charge consumed would be the sum of these minimum costs.

If this sum is less than or equal to f, then it should be possible to send all messages.

But I need to make sure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

Wait, actually, the problem says that if the charge level drops to 0 or below, it's impossible to send the message.

So, I need to ensure that at each message moment, the remaining charge is positive.

But in the approach above, I'm just summing up the minimum costs and comparing to f.

Is that sufficient to ensure that at each step, the charge is positive?

Maybe not, because the charge is consumed over time, and turning the phone off and on at certain points affects the charge at specific moments.

Perhaps I need to model the charge over time more carefully.

Let me consider the sequences of actions.

At moment 0, the phone is on with charge f.

At moment m1, Stepan sends the first message.

The charge at m1 would be f - a*m1, assuming the phone was on the whole time.

But he could have turned it off at some point before m1 and turned it on again at m1.

In that case, the charge at m1 would be f - (time it was on * a) - (number of times turned off and on * b).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to model it as a series of choices for each interval between messages.

Let me define the intervals between messages, including the initial interval from 0 to m1.

For each interval, I can choose to keep the phone on during that entire interval, or turn it off at the end and turn it on at the start of the next interval.

For each interval, I can calculate the charge consumption for both options and choose the one that consumes less charge.

Then, sum up all these minimal charge consumptions and check if the total is less than or equal to f.

But I'm not sure if this guarantees that the charge is always positive at message moments.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total charge consumption.

If the sum of all minimal charge consumptions for each interval is less than or equal to f, then it should be possible to send all messages.

Because f is the initial charge, and the sum of charge consumptions is the total charge used.

If total charge used <= f, then it should be possible.

But I need to make sure that at no point does the charge drop below zero before any message is sent.

Is there a possibility that even if the total charge used is less than f, the charge could drop below zero at some intermediate moment?

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=2, f=10, a=1, b=5.

Messages at m1=3, m2=6.

Interval 1: 0 to 3.

Option 1: keep phone on for 3 units, consume 3*1=3.

Option 2: turn off at 0 and on at 3, consume b=5.

So, choose option 1: consume 3.

At m1=3, charge is f - 3 = 7.

Send message, charge remains 7 (assuming sending message doesn't consume charge, only keeping it on does).

Now, interval 2: 3 to 6.

Option 1: keep phone on for 3 units, consume 3*1=3.

Option 2: turn off at 3 and on at 6, consume b=5.

Choose option 1: consume 3.

Total charge consumed: 3 + 3 = 6.

Since f=10, 6 <=10, so it should be possible.

At m2=6, charge is f - 6 =4, which is positive.

Seems fine.

Another example:

n=2, f=5, a=1, b=5.

Messages at m1=3, m2=6.

Interval 1: 0 to 3.

Option 1: consume 3.

Option 2: consume 5.

Choose option 1: consume 3.

At m1=3, charge is 5-3=2.

Send message.

Interval 2: 3 to 6.

Option 1: consume 3.

Option 2: consume 5.

Choose option 1: consume 3.

Total consume: 3+3=6.

But f=5, which is less than 6, so "No".

But wait, total consume is 6, f=5, which is insufficient.

Hence, "No".

Seems correct.

Another example where turning off might be better.

n=2, f=10, a=2, b=1.

Messages at m1=1, m2=2.

Interval 1: 0 to1.

Option 1: consume 2*1=2.

Option 2: consume 1.

Choose option 2: consume 1.

At m1=1, charge is f -1 =9.

Send message.

Interval 2:1 to2.

Option 1: consume 2*1=2.

Option 2: consume1.

Choose option 2: consume1.

Total consume:1+1=2.

f=10, which is more than 2, so "Yes".

But let's see if the charge is always positive.

At m1, charge is 10-1=9, send message.

At m2, charge is 9-1=8, send message.

All positive.

Good.

Another case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5.

Message at m1=3.

Interval 1:0 to3.

Option 1: consume 1*3=3.

Option 2: consume5.

Choose option1: consume3.

At m1=3, charge is 3-3=0.

But the problem says that if charge is <=0, cannot send message.

So, in this case, charge is 0, which is <=0, cannot send message.

Hence, "No".

But according to the approach, total consume is 3 <= f=3, so it would say "Yes", but actually it should be "No".

So, there's a flaw in the approach.

Hence, summing up the minimal charge consumptions and comparing to f is not sufficient because it doesn't account for the charge being zero at the moment of sending a message.

Therefore, I need a different approach.

Let me think differently.

I need to ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

So, perhaps I should calculate the charge at each message moment, considering the charge consumption between messages and the costs of turning the phone off and on.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the charge at each message moment, considering the actions taken between messages.

But dynamic programming with n up to 2e5 is not feasible if it's O(n^2).

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the charge required between messages.

Suppose I have messages at m1, m2, ..., mn.

I need to maintain the phone on at least at the message moments.

Between messages, I can choose to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

I need to minimize the charge consumption.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimal charge needed at each message, considering the charge consumption between messages.

Let me try to model it.

Start with initial charge f at moment 0.

At moment m1, the charge would be f - a*m1 if the phone was on the whole time.

But I can choose to turn it off at some point before m1 and turn it on at m1.

If I turn it off at time t and turn it on at m1, the charge consumed would be a*t + b.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find the minimal charge needed at each message.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the messages and keep track of the remaining charge, choosing at each step whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let's initialize the remaining charge as f.

For each message from 1 to n:

- If it's the first message, the time elapsed since start is m1.

- For subsequent messages, the time elapsed since the previous message is m_i - m_{i-1}.

- For each time interval, decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

- Update the remaining charge accordingly.

- At the message moment, check if the remaining charge is positive.

If at any message moment the remaining charge is <=0, then it's "No".

Otherwise, it's "Yes".

But I need to decide for each interval which option to choose.

To minimize charge consumption, for each interval, choose the option with the least charge consumption.

So, for each interval, compute the charge consumption for both options and choose the minimum.

Then, subtract the total charge consumption from f.

If the remaining charge is positive at each message moment, then "Yes"; else, "No".

Wait, but how do I ensure that the charge is positive at each message moment?

Let me consider cumulative charge consumption up to each message and ensure that after subtracting the charge consumption up to that message, the remaining charge is positive.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the cumulative charge consumption up to each message and ensure that at each message, the remaining charge is positive.

Let me try with the earlier example where n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, m1=3.

Charge consumption for the interval 0 to3:

Option1: a*3=3

Option2: b=5

Choose option1:3

At m1=3, remaining charge: f -3=0

But 0 <=0, cannot send message. Should be "No".

But according to the approach, total consume is 3 <= f=3, so remaining charge is 0, which is not positive. Hence, "No".

Good, it aligns.

Another example: n=2, f=10, a=1, b=3, messages at 4,6,10,13,17,20,26.

For each interval:

0 to4: a*4=4 < b=3? 4>3, so choose b=3

4 to6: a*2=2 < b=3, choose2

6 to10: a*4=4 < b=3, choose3

10 to13: a*3=3 ==b=3, choose either

13 to17: a*4=4 < b=3, choose3

17 to20: a*3=3 ==b=3, choose either

20 to26: a*6=6 < b=3, choose3

Total consume:3+2+3+3+3+3=17

f=10 <17, so "No"

But in the example, it's "Yes". Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in the example, it's test case 2:

7 21 1 3

4 6 10 13 17 20 26

Output: "Yes"

But according to my calculation, total consume is17, f=21 >=17, so should be "Yes".

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had f=10, which is less than17, so "No".

Wait, no, in the example, f=21, which is greater than17, so "Yes".

But according to my approach, it should be "Yes", which matches the example.

Wait, but in my earlier thought process, I had f=10, which is less than17, so "No".

But in the example, f=21 >=17, so "Yes".

Hence, my approach seems consistent with the example.

But earlier, I thought that just summing the minimal charge consumptions and comparing to f might not be sufficient because of the charge being zero at message moments.

But in the first example, with n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, m1=3.

Total minimal consume is3, which is <= f=3, but at m1, charge is0, which is <=0, cannot send message.

Hence, "No".

So, in this case, summing minimal consumptions and comparing to f is not enough; I need to ensure that at each message moment, the remaining charge is positive.

Hence, I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider the cumulative charge consumption up to each message and ensure that after subtracting the charge consumption up to that message, the remaining charge is positive.

Wait, but in the first example, total consume is3, f=3, remaining charge is0, which is not positive.

Hence, "No".

In the second example, total consume is17, f=21, remaining charge is4, which is positive.

Hence, "Yes".

So, perhaps summing the minimal charge consumptions and ensuring that the remaining charge is positive after all consumptions is sufficient.

But in the first example, remaining charge is0, which is not positive, hence "No".

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "if at any point the charge level drops to 0 or below, it's impossible to send the message".

So, I need to ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

Hence, after all charge consumptions, the remaining charge should be positive.

Wait, but in the first example, remaining charge is0, which is not positive, so "No".

In the second example, remaining charge is4, which is positive, so "Yes".

Hence, perhaps summing the minimal charge consumptions and ensuring that f - sum >0 is sufficient.

But in the first example, f - sum =0, which is not positive, so "No".

In the second example, f - sum=4>0, "Yes".

But is this always correct?

Let me consider another example.

n=2, f=5, a=1, b=3, messages at1,2.

Interval 0 to1: a*1=1 < b=3, choose1

Interval1 to2: a*1=1 < b=3, choose1

Total consume:1+1=2 <= f=5, remaining charge=3>0, "Yes"

At m1, charge after consume1:5-1=4>0

At m2, charge after another1:4-1=3>0, "Yes"

Good.

Another example:

n=2, f=3, a=1, b=3, messages at1,2.

Interval 0 to1: a*1=1 < b=3, choose1

Interval1 to2: a*1=1 < b=3, choose1

Total consume:1+1=2 <= f=3, remaining charge=1>0, "Yes"

At m1, charge after1:3-1=2>0

At m2, charge after another1:2-1=1>0, "Yes"

Good.

Another example:

n=1, f=4, a=1, b=5, m1=3.

Interval 0 to3: a*3=3 < b=5, choose3

Remaining charge:4-3=1>0, "Yes"

At m1, charge after3:4-3=1>0, "Yes"

Good.

Another example:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, m1=3.

Interval 0 to3: a*3=3 < b=5, choose3

Remaining charge:3-3=0<=0, "No"

At m1, charge after3:3-3=0<=0, "No"

Good.

Seems consistent.

Hence, perhaps summing the minimal charge consumptions for each interval and ensuring that f - sum >0 is sufficient.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that sending a message consumes some charge, but it's not specified how much.

Wait, actually, it's not specified that sending a message consumes any charge beyond keeping the phone on.

So, the charge consumption is only due to keeping the phone on over time and the cost of turning it off and on.

Hence, the charge at any message moment is f minus the charge consumed up to that moment.

Hence, if f - sum of minimal charge consumptions >0, then "Yes"; else, "No".

But in the first example, f - sum=0, which is not positive, hence "No".

In the second example, f - sum=4>0, "Yes".

Seems correct.

But let's check another example where turning off and on is better.

n=2, f=10, a=2, b=1, messages at1,2.

Interval 0 to1: a*1=2 > b=1, choose b=1

Interval1 to2: a*1=2 > b=1, choose b=1

Total consume:1+1=2 <= f=10, remaining charge=8>0, "Yes"

At m1, charge after1:10-1=9>0

At m2, charge after another1:9-1=8>0, "Yes"

Good.

Another example where turning off is not always better.

n=2, f=5, a=1, b=2, messages at1,3.

Interval 0 to1: a*1=1 < b=2, choose1

Interval1 to3: a*2=2 < b=2, choose2

Total consume:1+2=3 <= f=5, remaining charge=2>0, "Yes"

At m1, charge after1:5-1=4>0

At m2, charge after another2:4-2=2>0, "Yes"

Good.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the approach is to calculate for each interval the minimal charge consumption between keeping the phone on or turning it off and on, sum these minimal consumptions, and check if f - sum >0.

If yes, then "Yes"; else, "No".

But in the first example, f - sum=0, which is not positive, hence "No".

This seems correct.

Hence, I can implement this approach.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

test_cases = int(input())

for i in range(test_cases):

feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

n = feat[0]

f = feat[1]

a = feat[2]

b = feat[-1]

arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

array2 = []

for i in range(0, n):

if i == 0:

if arr[0] < b / a:

array2.append(arr[0] * a)

else:

array2.append(b)

elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:

array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)

else:

array2.append(b)

if sum(array2) < f:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I compared f - sum >0.

But in the code, it's checking sum(array2) < f, which is equivalent to f - sum >0 if f and sum are integers, but actually, it's not exactly the same.

Wait, f - sum >0 is equivalent to f > sum.

But in the code, it's sum(array2) < f, which is f > sum(array2), which is correct.

Hence, it matches.

But in the first example, sum(array2)=3, f=3, so sum <=f, but according to the problem, it should be "No" because charge is zero at the message moment.

But in the code, it's checking sum(array2) < f, which is 3 < 3 is False, so it prints "No", which is correct.

Hence, it seems correct.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I had f - sum <=0 as "No", which aligns with sum >=f as "No".

Hence, sum <f is "Yes", which is what the code does.

Good.

Now, looking at the code, it seems to implement this logic.

But let's verify it step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads the features: n, f, a, b.

Wait, in the code, it reads feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

n = feat[0]

f = feat[1]

a = feat[2]

b = feat[-1]

Assuming that the input has exactly four integers in this line, this should be fine.

Then, it reads the array of message moments: arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

Then, it initializes an empty list array2.

Then, it iterates over the range(0, n):

for i in range(0, n):

if i == 0:

if arr[0] < b / a:

array2.append(arr[0] * a)

else:

array2.append(b)

elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:

array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)

else:

array2.append(b)

So, for each interval:

- For the first interval (i=0), it checks if arr[0] < b/a.

- If yes, it appends arr[0]*a to array2.

- Else, appends b.

- For subsequent intervals (i>=1), it checks if arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b/a.

- If yes, appends (arr[i] - arr[i-1])*a.

- Else, appends b.

Then, it sums array2 and checks if sum(array2) < f.

If yes, prints "Yes"; else, "No".

Now, let's see why it's checking arr[0] < b/a and arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b/a.

This seems to be determining whether it's better to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

Specifically, keeping the phone on for time t costs a*t, while turning it off and on costs b.

So, keeping the phone on is better if a*t < b, which is t < b/a.

Hence, if the time interval is less than b/a, it's better to keep the phone on; else, turn it off and on.

Hence, the code is calculating for each interval:

- If the time interval < b/a, choose to keep the phone on, consume a*t.

- Else, choose to turn it off and on, consume b.

Then, sum these minimal consumptions and check if sum < f.

Which aligns with my earlier reasoning.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But in my earlier thought process, I had a doubt about whether sum <f is sufficient to ensure that at each message moment, the charge is positive.

But from the examples I considered, it seems to hold.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Stepan can send all his messages without his phone running out of charge, given the constraints of charge consumption and the option to turn the phone off and on again at a cost.

### Approach

1. **Understand Charge Consumption**:
   - The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time it is on.
   - Turning the phone off and on again costs `b` units of charge each time.

2. **Decision Making for Each Interval**:
   - For each time interval between messages (or from start to the first message), calculate the charge consumption for two options:
     - Keep the phone on for the entire interval: `a * time_interval`.
     - Turn the phone off and on at the end of the interval: `b`.
   - Choose the option that consumes less charge for each interval.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - Sum the minimal charge consumptions for all intervals.
   - Ensure that this total is less than the initial charge `f` to ensure Stepan can send all messages.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    num_test_cases = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(num_test_cases):
        feat = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        idx += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        array2 = []
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
                else:
                    array2.append(b)
            else:
                time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]
                if time_diff < b / a:
                    array2.append(time_diff * a)
                else:
                    array2.append(b)
        total_consumption = sum(array2)
        if total_consumption < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the array of message moments.

2. **Calculate Minimal Charge Consumption**:
   - For each interval between messages (or from start to the first message):
     - If the interval duration `t` is less than `b / a`, it's cheaper to keep the phone on: consume `a * t`.
     - Otherwise, it's cheaper to turn the phone off and on: consume `b`.
   
3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - Sum the minimal charge consumptions for all intervals.
   - If the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

This approach ensures that Stepan can send all messages without his phone running out of charge by optimally managing the phone's on and off states.
