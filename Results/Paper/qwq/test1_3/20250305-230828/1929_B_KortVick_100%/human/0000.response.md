Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a "diagonal" in this grid. In a square grid, there are diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right and others that run from top-right to bottom-left. For an n x n grid, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2. I think this accounts for all possible diagonals in both directions.

So, the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Let me try to visualize this. Let's take a small grid, say n=3.

For n=3, there are 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals. So, k can be from 1 to 10.

I need to color cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell, and I want to do this with the fewest cells possible.

Let me think about how cells are connected to diagonals. Each cell belongs to exactly one diagonal in each direction.

Wait, no. Each cell is part of two diagonals: one top-left to bottom-right and one top-right to bottom-left, unless it's on the edge.

Actually, in an n x n grid, the number of diagonals from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, 2n - 1 from top-right to bottom-left, totaling 4n - 2 diagonals.

So, to cover k diagonals, I need to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color to achieve this.

Let me consider the example in the problem.

In the first test case, n=3, k=4, and the answer is 2.

So, with 2 colored cells, I can cover at least 4 diagonals.

Looking at the explanation, it seems possible to cover 4 diagonals with 2 cells.

In another case, n=3, k=10, and the answer is 6.

So, to cover all 10 diagonals, I need to color 6 cells.

Wait, but for n=3, the total number of diagonals is 10, and coloring 6 cells is required to cover all of them.

Hmm.

I need to find a general approach for any n and k.

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals I can cover with one cell.

Each cell is part of two diagonals, so coloring one cell covers two diagonals.

But, there might be overlap, as some diagonals share cells.

So, if I color one cell, it covers two diagonals. If I color another cell, it can cover two more diagonals, but perhaps one of them overlaps with the first cell's diagonals.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=3 and k=4, coloring two cells covers four diagonals, presumably without overlapping diagonals.

So, if I can color cells such that each cell covers two new diagonals, then the minimal number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

Wait, but in the third test case, n=3 and k=10, and the answer is 6, which is indeed ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals are 10. Ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6.

So, perhaps ceil(k / 2) is not always correct.

Wait, maybe there's a different relationship.

Let me look at the example outputs:

For n=3, k=4, output=2

n=3, k=3, output=2

n=3, k=10, output=6

n=3, k=9, output=5

n=4, k=7, output=4

n=7, k=11, output=6

n=2, k=3, output=2

Hmm.

Looking at n=3, k=10, output=6

Ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps there's an adjustment needed when k is large.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2) = 5, and output is 5.

For n=4, k=7, ceil(7 / 2) = 4, and output is 4.

For n=7, k=11, ceil(11 / 2) = 6, and output is 6.

For n=2, k=3, ceil(3 / 2) = 2, and output is 2.

Wait, so in some cases, ceil(k / 2) works, but in n=3, k=10, it doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a different formula.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an n x n grid.

Each cell belongs to one diagonal going top-left to bottom-right and one going top-right to bottom-left.

So, each cell covers two diagonals.

But some diagonals are longer than others.

In particular, the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) has n cells, and other diagonals have fewer cells.

But perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

I need to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest cells.

Each cell covers two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

So, the minimal number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But in the n=3, k=10 case, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6.

So, perhaps this approach is insufficient.

Wait, maybe there are dependencies between the diagonals.

Perhaps some diagonals cannot be covered independently.

Let me consider the total number of diagonals, which is 4n - 2.

In the n=3 case, there are 10 diagonals.

But coloring cells to cover diagonals might not always allow covering two new diagonals per cell.

Perhaps when k is large, covering additional diagonals requires more cells.

Wait, maybe there's a threshold when k exceeds a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different formula based on n and k.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it from the perspective of set cover, where each cell is a set covering two diagonals, and I need to cover at least k diagonals.

But that seems too complicated for this problem, especially given the constraints on n and k.

Wait, the constraints are t <= 1000 and n <= 1e8, k <= 4n - 2.

So, an efficient solution is needed, probably O(1) per test case.

Given that, there must be a direct formula to compute the minimal number of cells based on n and k.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

n=3, k=4 -> 2

n=3, k=3 -> 2

n=3, k=10 -> 6

n=3, k=9 -> 5

n=4, k=7 -> 4

n=7, k=11 -> 6

n=2, k=3 -> 2

Looking at n=3, k=10, output=6

Ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6.

Similarly, for n=2, k=3, ceil(3 / 2) = 2, and output is 2.

Wait, n=2, k=3:

For n=2, total diagonals are 4*2 - 2 = 6.

So, k=3, ceil(3 / 2) = 2, and output is 2.

For n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps when k exceeds a certain value related to n, an adjustment is needed.

Let me see: for n=3, total diagonals are 10.

With ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6.

Wait, maybe it's floor((4n - 2) / 2) + (k - (4n - 2)/2), but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but for k >= something, add extra cells.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k / 2), but for k > 2n - 1, add some extra cells.

Wait, for n=3, 2n - 1 = 5.

So, for k > 5, maybe additional cells are needed.

Looking at the sample inputs:

n=3, k=4 -> 2 (ceil(4 / 2) = 2)

n=3, k=3 -> 2 (ceil(3 / 2) = 2)

n=3, k=10 -> 6 (ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6)

n=3, k=9 -> 5 (ceil(9 / 2) = 5)

n=4, k=7 -> 4 (ceil(7 / 2) = 4)

n=7, k=11 -> 6 (ceil(11 / 2) = 6)

n=2, k=3 -> 2 (ceil(3 / 2) = 2)

So, in n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2) = 5, output is 5.

Wait, perhaps when k > 2n -1, which is 5 for n=3, we need to add some extra cells.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1 = 5.

For k <=5, ceil(k / 2) seems to work.

For k >5, ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1)), but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, for n=3, k=6, ceil(6 / 2) = 3, but according to the pattern, for k=6, it should be 3, but in the sample, for k=9 it's 5, which is ceil(9 / 2).

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k / 2), but for k > 2n -1, add (k - (2n -1)) to the ceil(k / 2).

Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but for k >= 3n -2, adjust it.

Wait, for n=3, 3n -2 =7, which is higher than 6, but in the sample, for k=9, which is higher than 6, output is 5.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells without overlapping.

Each cell covers two diagonals, but there might be overlaps.

In the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

So, with c cells, you can cover up to 2c diagonals.

But if k > 2c, you need more cells.

Wait, but in the n=3, k=10 case, 2c =10 would require c=5, but the output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some diagonals are shorter and are covered by fewer cells.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way.

Let me consider the problem as selecting cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

This sounds like a set cover problem, where each cell is a set covering two diagonals.

But set cover is NP-hard, and we need an efficient solution.

So, perhaps there is a mathematical formula or a greedy approach that can be used here.

Let me think about the minimal number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals.

If each cell covers two diagonals, then the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But in the n=3, k=10 case, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an additional constraint based on n.

Looking at n=3, total diagonals=10.

To cover all 10 diagonals, you need to color 6 cells.

So, maybe for covering all diagonals, it's n*(n+1)/2 cells or something similar.

Wait, for n=3, n*(n+1)/2=6, which matches the sample output for k=10.

Similarly, for n=4, to cover all 14 diagonals, perhaps you need 10 cells, but in the sample, for k=7, output is 4.

Wait, n=4, k=7, output=4, which is ceil(7 / 2)=4.

For n=4, k=14, perhaps the output would be 10, matching n*(n+1)/2=10.

So, maybe when k is equal to the total number of diagonals, the minimal number of cells is n*(n+1)/2.

But for k less than that, it's ceil(k / 2), unless ceil(k / 2) is less than the minimal number required.

Wait, in n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but minimal number is 6.

Wait, 6 is greater than 5, so perhaps it's max(ceil(k / 2), some function of n).

Wait, for n=3, the minimal number of cells to cover all diagonals is 6.

Similarly, for n=4, it's 10.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n*(n+1)/2.

But for k less than 4n-2, it's ceil(k / 2), but not less than the minimal number of cells needed to cover those diagonals.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to think about it.

Let me consider that each cell covers two diagonals, but some diagonals are covered by multiple cells.

So, to cover k diagonals, I need to select cells such that their covered diagonals cover at least k unique diagonals.

This sounds like a hitting set problem, where diagonals are sets and cells are elements.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of lines and points.

But I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

n=3, k=4 -> 2

n=3, k=3 ->2

n=3, k=10->6

n=3, k=9 ->5

n=4, k=7 ->4

n=7, k=11->6

n=2, k=3 ->2

Looking at n=3:

For k=4, output=2

For k=3, output=2

For k=9, output=5

For k=10, output=6

So, for k=4 and k=3, output is 2.

For k=9, output is 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

For k=10, output is 6, which is n*(n+1)/2=6.

So, perhaps the formula is:

If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

Else, n*(n+1)/2

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1=5.

For k=4 and k=3 (<=5), ceil(k / 2)

For k=9 and k=10 (>5), it's n*(n+1)/2=6.

But for k=9, which is >5, the output is 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's:

If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

Else, ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But for n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=5+5=10, which is not matching the sample output of 6.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=ceil(5/2)=3, total 8, which is still not 6.

Not matching.

Wait, maybe it's different.

Let me consider that for k <= 2n -1, it's ceil(k / 2)

For k > 2n -1, it's ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cells needed to cover the remaining diagonals after covering 2n -1 diagonals.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that with c cells, I can cover up to 2c diagonals.

But some diagonals may be covered multiple times, so the actual number of unique diagonals covered could be less than 2c.

So, to cover at least k diagonals, I need to have at least c such that the number of unique diagonals covered is at least k.

But determining the exact minimal c seems tricky.

Perhaps in the best case, each additional cell covers two new diagonals, and in the worst case, each additional cell covers only one new diagonal.

So, the minimal c would be ceil((k - c)/1), which seems circular.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the first cell covers two diagonals, the second covers two more, and so on, until we reach a point where additional cells can only cover one new diagonal.

In an n x n grid, the maximum number of unique diagonals that can be covered by c cells is min(2c, 4n -2).

But I need to cover at least k diagonals.

So, I need to find the smallest c such that min(2c, 4n -2) >= k.

Which means:

If 2c >= k, and 2c >= k, then c >= ceil(k / 2)

But also, c cannot exceed the total number of cells needed to cover all diagonals, which is n*(n+1)/2.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is n*(n+1)/2=6.

Similarly, for n=4, k=14, it should be 10.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, k=7, output is 4, which is ceil(7 / 2)=4.

So, perhaps the formula is:

c = ceil(k / 2), but not less than the minimal number of cells required to cover k diagonals.

But in n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but actually, you need 6 cells.

So, perhaps c = max(ceil(k / 2), minimal cells required to cover k diagonals).

But what's the minimal cells required to cover k diagonals?

Wait, perhaps it's min(ceil(k / 2), n*(n+1)/2)

But in n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but output is 6, which is n*(n+1)/2=6.

Wait, perhaps it's max(ceil(k / 2), number of cells needed to cover all diagonals when k=4n-2).

Wait, perhaps when k >= 2n -1 +1, need to adjust.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, n*(n+1)/2

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=9, output is 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5, but according to this, for k >= 2n -1 +1=6, it should be n*(n+1)/2=6, but sample output is 5.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's:

- If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But again, for n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=10, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me consider the total number of diagonals, which is 4n -2.

Each cell covers two diagonals.

But some cells cover the same diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the problem as selecting cells such that the number of unique diagonals they cover is at least k.

This seems similar to the set cover problem, but maybe there's a mathematical way to determine the minimal number of cells needed.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps the formula is:

c = ceil(k / 2), but adjusted when k is greater than a certain threshold.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, and output is 6, which is n*(n+1)/2=6.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, output is 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps when k <= 4n -2, and k <= 2n -1, use ceil(k / 2), else use n*(n+1)/2.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1=5, and 4n -2=10.

So, for k <=5, use ceil(k / 2), for k >5, use n*(n+1)/2=6.

But in the sample input, for k=9, which is >5, output is 5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

This contradicts the earlier assumption.

So, perhaps the condition is when k <= 2n -1, use ceil(k / 2), else use ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But for n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=10, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but adjusted to be at least n*(n+1)/2 when k=4n-2.

In other words:

If k == 4n -2, then c = n*(n+1)/2

Else, c = ceil(k / 2)

Which matches the sample inputs.

For n=3, k=10, which is 4n-2=10, output is 6, which is n*(n+1)/2=6.

For other k, it's ceil(k / 2).

Yes, this seems to fit.

Looking at the sample inputs:

n=3, k=4 -> ceil(4 / 2)=2

n=3, k=3 -> ceil(3 / 2)=2

n=3, k=10 -> n*(n+1)/2=6

n=3, k=9 -> ceil(9 / 2)=5

n=4, k=7 -> ceil(7 / 2)=4

n=7, k=11 -> ceil(11 / 2)=6

n=2, k=3 -> ceil(3 / 2)=2

Yes, this matches all the sample outputs.

So, the formula is:

If k == 4n -2, then c = n*(n+1)/2

Else, c = ceil(k / 2)

This seems to be the correct approach.

Now, in the code provided, it checks if k == 4n -2, then it prints k//2 +1, else ceil(k / 2).

Wait, for k ==4n -2, it prints k//2 +1, which for k=10, n=3, 10//2 +1=6, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for n=4, k=14, 14//2 +1=8, which is n*(n+1)/2=10, which is not matching.

Wait, for n=4, 4*4 -2=14, and n*(n+1)/2=10.

So, 14//2 +1=8, which is not equal to 10.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, n*(n+1)/2 for n=4 is 10, but 14//2 +1=8, which is less than 10.

So, in this case, it should be max(ceil(k / 2), n*(n+1)/2)

Wait, but in the code, it's printing k//2 +1 for k==4n-2, which for n=4, k=14, would be 8, but according to the formula, it should be 10.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the code.

Wait, but in the sample input for n=3, k=10, 10//2 +1=6, which is correct.

For n=4, k=14, 14//2 +1=8, but according to the formula, it should be n*(n+1)/2=10.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k==4n-2 is c=n*(n+1)/2.

So, the code should be:

if k == 4*n -2:

print(n*(n+1)//2)

else:

print(ceil(k / 2))

But in the code, it's:

if 4*n -2 ==k:

print(k//2 +1)

else:

print(ceil(k / 2))

Which for n=3, k=10, k//2 +1=6, which matches n*(n+1)/2=6.

For n=4, k=14, k//2 +1=8, but n*(n+1)/2=10, which doesn't match.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps for k==4n-2, c=k//2 +1 is intended to be equal to n*(n+1)/2.

Let me check:

For n=3, k=10, k//2 +1=5+1=6, and n*(n+1)/2=6.

For n=4, k=14, k//2 +1=7+1=8, but n*(n+1)/2=10.

So, 8 !=10.

Thus, for n=4, k=14, the code would output 8, but according to the formula, it should be 10.

This is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is a different relationship.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, k//2 +1=6.

For n=4, k=14, k//2 +1=8.

But n*(n+1)/2 for n=4 is 10.

So, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe for k==4n-2, c=(k)//2 +1

But for n=4, k=14, (14)//2 +1=8, but according to the pattern, it should be 10.

Wait, perhaps it's c=ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) /2)

For n=4, k=14:

ceil(14 / 2)=7 + ceil((14 -7)/2)=ceil(7/2)=4, total 11, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's c=ceil(k / 2) + max(0, k - (2n -1))

For n=4, k=14:

ceil(14 / 2)=7 + max(0,14 -7)=7, total 14, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for k <= 2n -1, c=ceil(k / 2)

For k > 2n -1, c=ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

But for n=3, k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 -5)=10, which is not matching the sample output of 6.

Wait, perhaps it's c=ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - (2n -1)) /2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=3, total 8, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's c=ceil(k / 2) + floor((k - (2n -1))/2)

For n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2)=5 + floor((10 -5)/2)=2, total 7, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to accept that my approach is incorrect and look for an alternative method.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n*(n+1)/2.

This is because each cell covers two diagonals, but there are overlapping.

In particular, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is the number of cells in one triangular part of the grid.

For example, in n=3, n*(n+1)/2=6, which matches the sample output for k=10.

Similarly, for n=4, it's 10.

So, perhaps for k <=2n -1, c=ceil(k / 2), else c=n*(n+1)/2.

But for n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, and n*(n+1)/2=6, but sample output is 5.

So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

c = max(ceil(k / 2), minimal cells needed to cover k diagonals)

But I need to find what's the minimal cells needed to cover k diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's min(ceil(k / 2), n*(n+1)/2)

But in n=3, k=10, min(ceil(10 / 2)=5,6)=5, but sample output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's max(ceil(k / 2), n*(n+1)/2)

For n=3, k=10, max(5,6)=6, which matches.

For n=3, k=9, max(5,6)=6, but sample output is 5.

So, still not matching.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"tell him the minimal number of cells he needs to color."

Given that, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is indeed ceil(k / 2), except when k equals 4n -2, in which case it's n*(n+1)/2.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, and output is 5.

For n=3, k=10, it's 6.

So, perhaps the formula is:

if k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

elif k <= 4n -2, then ceil(k / 2) + (k - (2n -1))

else, n*(n+1)/2

But this seems too convoluted and doesn't match the sample inputs.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

c = ceil(k / 2), but adjusted to be at least n*(n+1)/2 when k=4n-2.

But in n=3, k=9, ceil(9 / 2)=5, which is less than n*(n+1)/2=6, but according to the sample, it's 5.

So, this doesn't hold.

I'm stuck.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n*(n+1)/2.

But for covering fewer diagonals, it's ceil(k / 2), unless k is close to 4n -2.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the maximum of ceil(k / 2) and the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals.

But I don't know how to calculate the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals directly.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps it's acceptable to use ceil(k / 2), but adjust it when k equals 4n -2 to be n*(n+1)/2.

In the code, it's implemented as:

if 4*n -2 ==k:

print(k//2 +1)

else:

print(ceil(k / 2))

Which for k=10, n=3, k//2 +1=6, which matches.

For k=14, n=4, k//2 +1=8, but according to n*(n+1)/2=10, it's incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe for k==4n-2, it should be n*(n+1)//2, not k//2 +1.

But in n=3, k=10, n*(n+1)//2=6, and k//2 +1=6, coincides.

For n=4, k=14, n*(n+1)//2=10, but k//2 +1=8, which is less than 10.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
