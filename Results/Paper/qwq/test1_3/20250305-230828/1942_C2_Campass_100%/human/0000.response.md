Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a regular polygon with n sides, and she's chosen x vertices. I need to choose up to y additional vertices such that when we draw non-intersecting diagonals using these chosen vertices, the number of triangular pieces of cake is maximized.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. It's a polygon with all sides and angles equal. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. So, it's like a circle divided into n equal parts.

Bessie has chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. The total number of chosen vertices will be x + y or less, depending on how many I choose.

The goal is to draw non-intersecting diagonals using these chosen vertices to form as many triangles as possible.

I need to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

Let me think about how triangles are formed in a polygon when diagonals are drawn.

In a polygon, if you triangulate it, meaning you divide it into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals, the number of triangles is n - 2, where n is the number of sides.

But in this problem, it's not necessarily triangulating the entire polygon. Only the chosen vertices can be used to draw diagonals, and the triangles formed are only counted if they are part of the chosen vertices.

Wait, the problem says: "the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

So, the diagonals can only be drawn between the chosen vertices, and the triangles are formed by these diagonals.

I need to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

Let me consider a simple example to understand better.

Take n=4, a square. Bessie chooses x=2 vertices, and I can choose up to y=2 vertices.

If Bessie chooses two adjacent vertices, and I choose the other two, then I can draw two diagonals, forming two triangles.

But wait, in this case, n=4, x=2, y=2, and the output in the sample is 2.

Okay, that matches.

Another sample: n=8, x=4, y=2, output=6.

I need to see how that works.

I think I need to find a way to choose y vertices such that the number of triangles formed is maximized.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is equal to the number of triangles in a triangulation, which is n - 2.

But here, only certain vertices are chosen, so it's not a full triangulation.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I should consider the cycles formed by the chosen vertices.

Wait, since it's a convex polygon, the chosen vertices form a convex polygon themselves.

Wait, no, not necessarily, because the chosen vertices might not be consecutive.

Let me think in terms of connecting chosen vertices with diagonals without intersections.

This sounds similar to triangulating a polygon but only using the chosen vertices.

So, perhaps I need to find the number of triangles in a triangulation of the polygon formed by the chosen vertices.

But to do that, I need to know how many triangles are formed in such a triangulation.

In a polygon with k sides, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2.

But here, the chosen vertices might not form a single polygon, but multiple polygons.

Wait, in a convex polygon, choosing a subset of vertices and triangulating them would involve dividing into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

I need to maximize the number of such triangles.

I think the key is to maximize the number of triangles by choosing y additional vertices optimally.

Let me consider the gaps between the chosen vertices.

Since the polygon is convex, the vertices are in a circular order.

If I have x chosen vertices, there are x gaps between them, each gap being the number of vertices not chosen between two chosen vertices.

I need to decide where to place the y additional vertices in these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

I need to model this better.

Let me consider that placing a vertex in a gap divides that gap into two smaller gaps.

Each gap can have multiple vertices placed in it.

But the goal is to maximize the number of triangles.

I need to relate the number of triangles to the number of chosen vertices.

Wait, in any triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles is k - 2.

So, if I have k chosen vertices, the number of triangles is k - 2.

But I can choose up to y more vertices.

So, I need to choose y vertices to maximize k - 2, where k = x + y.

Wait, that would just be x + y - 2.

But in the sample input 1, n=8, x=4, y=2, and the output is 6.

So, x + y - 2 = 4 + 2 - 2 = 4, but the sample output is 6.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

So, maybe it's not that simple.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

"Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?"

Okay, so the key is to maximize the number of triangular pieces by choosing up to y additional vertices and drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

In the sample input 1, n=8, x=4, y=2, output=6.

If I have 8 vertices, Bessie chooses 4, and I choose 2 more, total chosen vertices are 6.

If I triangulate a convex hexagon, the number of triangles is 6 - 2 = 4, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe multiple triangles can share edges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by the diagonals drawn.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I have a set of chosen vertices, and I draw non-intersecting diagonals between them.

Each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices connected by diagonals.

So, the number of triangles is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertex inside.

Wait, but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by the diagonals drawn.

Wait, maybe it's the number of triangles in the planar graph formed by the chosen vertices and the drawn diagonals.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different way.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in a triangulation is always n - 2.

But here, it's not a full triangulation, and only certain vertices are chosen.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the diagonals drawn between them.

Wait, maybe it's equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus the number of chosen vertices minus something.

I need to find a formula that relates the number of triangles to the number of chosen vertices and diagonals.

Let me think in terms of graph theory.

Consider the chosen vertices as vertices of a planar graph, and the diagonals as edges.

The number of faces in this planar graph can be related to the number of triangles.

Euler's formula for planar graphs is v - e + f = 2, where v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.

In this case, the outer face is the boundary of the polygon, and the internal faces are the triangles.

But I'm not sure if this is helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of adding diagonals one by one and seeing how the number of triangles increases.

Each new diagonal can split an existing face into two, thereby increasing the number of triangles.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the sample input again.

Sample Input 1:

8 4 2

1 6 2 5

Sample Output: 6

Let's visualize this.

We have an octagon with vertices 1 to 8.

Bessie chose vertices 1, 6, 2, 5.

I can choose up to 2 more vertices.

If I choose vertices 3 and 7, for example, then the chosen vertices are 1,2,3,5,6,7.

How many triangles can I form with these vertices using non-intersecting diagonals?

One possible way is to connect 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-1, forming quadrilaterals, but I need to form triangles.

Alternatively, connect 1-2, 2-3, 3-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-1, which forms multiple triangles.

But I need to ensure that the diagonals do not intersect.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the chosen vertices in order and see how many triangles are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on the number of chosen vertices.

In the sample input 1, with x=4 and y=2, total chosen vertices k=6.

If I triangulate a convex hexagon, I get k-2=4 triangles, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus something.

Let me think differently.

Each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices connected by diagonals.

So, the number of triangles is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle.

But in a convex polygon, any three chosen vertices form a triangle, provided that no other chosen vertex lies inside that triangle.

Wait, in a convex polygon, no three points are collinear, so any three points form a triangle.

But in this problem, the triangles must be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices, and the diagonals must not intersect.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus the number of chosen vertices minus something.

I need to find a relationship.

Let me consider that in a triangulation, the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus 1.

Wait, in a triangulation of a polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles is k - 2, and the number of diagonals is k - 3.

Wait, no, in a triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles is k - 2, and the number of diagonals is k - 3.

But in the sample input, k=6, so triangles=4, but the sample output is 6.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some triangles might be formed by more than three chosen vertices.

But in a convex polygon, each triangle is defined by exactly three vertices.

I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I should look at the problem as maximizing the number of triangles by choosing y additional vertices optimally.

I need to choose y vertices to add to the x chosen vertices to maximize the number of triangles formed.

I need to find a strategy to choose these y vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Maybe I can consider the gaps between the chosen vertices.

Let me consider the circular sequence of vertices.

Since it's a convex polygon, the vertices are in a cycle.

If I have x chosen vertices, they divide the polygon into x gaps, each gap being the number of vertices between two chosen vertices.

I need to decide where to place the y additional vertices in these gaps.

Placing a vertex in a gap divides that gap into two smaller gaps.

I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by these chosen vertices.

I need to relate the number of triangles to the number of chosen vertices and the way they are placed.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of chosen gaps minus something.

I need to find a formula.

Let me think about the Euler's formula again.

In a planar graph, v - e + f = 2, where f is the number of faces, including the outer face.

In this problem, the outer face is the boundary of the polygon, and the internal faces are the triangles.

So, f - 1 is the number of triangular pieces.

So, f - 1 is the number of triangles.

Given v, e, and f, with v - e + f = 2, then f = e - v + 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles is e - v + 1.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles, which is e - v + 1.

To maximize e - v + 1, I need to maximize e, the number of edges (diagonals).

But there's a constraint that the diagonals do not intersect.

So, in a triangulation, e = k - 3, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

Wait, no, in a triangulation, e = 3*(k - 2), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, in a triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of edges is 3*(k - 2).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, in a triangulation, the number of edges is e = 3*k - 6.

But in our case, v = k, e = 3*k - 6, f = k - 2 +1 = k -1.

Wait, no, Euler's formula is f = e - v + 2.

So, f = (3*k - 6) - k + 2 = 2*k -4.

But in a triangulation, the number of internal faces is k - 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look it up.

In a convex polygon with k vertices, a triangulation has k - 3 diagonals and forms k - 2 triangles.

So, e = k - 3, f = k - 2.

From Euler's formula, v - e + f = k - (k - 3) + (k - 2) = 3 - 2 =1, but it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Actually, in a planar graph, v - e + f = 2, where f includes the outer face.

So, f = e - v + 2.

In a triangulation, e = 3*k - 6, f = 2*k - 4.

But in our case, e = k - 3, f = k - 2.

So, v - e + f = k - (k - 3) + (k - 2) = 3 - 2 + k = k +1, which doesn't equal 2.

I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in a triangulation of a convex polygon, e = 3*(k - 2).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have k chosen vertices in convex position.

The number of triangles formed by triangulating them is k - 2.

But in the sample input, k=6, triangles=4, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps it's not a full triangulation.

Wait, maybe the triangles can share edges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by the diagonals drawn, and not necessarily a full triangulation.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of such triangles.

Let me consider that each chosen vertex can be part of multiple triangles.

Perhaps the number of triangles is related to the number of chosen vertices and the way they are connected.

I need to think of a different approach.

Let me consider that each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices, and the diagonals connecting them do not intersect.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertex inside.

But in a convex polygon, since all points are on the boundary, no point is inside the triangle formed by any three points.

Therefore, the number of triangles is simply the number of triples of chosen vertices.

But that would be C(k,3), which for k=6 is 20, but the sample output is 6.

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps not all triples form a triangle in the graph formed by the chosen diagonals.

Only the triples that are connected by diagonals form triangles.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of such triples.

But how?

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different perspective.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is related to the number of chosen vertices and the way they are connected.

Perhaps I can think in terms of adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me consider that each time I add a vertex, it can potentially form new triangles.

I need to choose y vertices to add to the x chosen vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

I need a strategy to choose these y vertices optimally.

Maybe I should prioritize adding vertices that are in larger gaps, as they can potentially form more triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles by maximizing the number of times I can add a vertex that increases the number of triangles the most.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the gaps between the chosen vertices.

- Each gap has a certain number of vertices that can be added.

- Adding a vertex in a gap of size m allows me to form m-1 new triangles.

Wait, not sure about that.

Let me think differently.

I recall that in a convex polygon, adding a vertex to a set of chosen vertices can split one face into multiple faces, thereby increasing the number of triangles.

But I need a precise way to calculate the maximum number of triangles.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Suppose I consider the circular sequence of vertices and decide where to place the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

But with n up to 1e9 and x up to 2e5 per test case, I need an efficient solution.

I need something better than O(x^2).

Wait, maybe I can model this as placing y vertices into the gaps between the chosen x vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

Let me consider that each gap between two chosen vertices can have some additional vertices placed in it.

If a gap has c vertices between two chosen vertices, then placing m vertices in that gap allows me to form m triangles.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in a gap of size c (number of vertices between two chosen vertices), if I place m additional vertices, then the number of triangles formed in that gap is m.

Because each additional vertex in the gap forms one new triangle.

Is that possible?

Let me try to visualize.

Suppose I have two chosen vertices A and B with c vertices between them.

If I place one additional vertex C between A and B, then I can draw diagonals AC and CB, forming one triangle ACB.

If I place two additional vertices C and D between A and B, then I can draw diagonals AC, CD, and DB, forming two triangles: ACD and CDB.

So, in general, placing m additional vertices in a gap of size c allows me to form m triangles in that gap.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is the sum of m over all gaps.

But wait, in the sample input 1, with x=4, y=2, and output=6.

If I have 4 chosen vertices and 2 additional vertices, and if I distribute the 2 additional vertices in the gaps, then according to this, the number of triangles would be 2, but the sample output is 6.

So, this can't be correct.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps each additional vertex in a gap contributes more than one triangle.

Let me think again.

If I have two chosen vertices A and B with c vertices between them, and I place m additional vertices in that gap, then the number of triangles formed in that gap is m.

Because each additional vertex splits the gap into smaller gaps, forming one new triangle each time.

But in the sample input, this doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the triangles can be formed across multiple gaps.

This is getting too tangled.

I need to find a better way.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

8 4 2

1 6 2 5

Sample Output: 6

Let's see, n=8, x=4, y=2.

Bessie chose vertices 1,6,2,5.

I choose 2 more vertices, say 3 and 7.

Now, the chosen vertices are 1,2,3,5,6,7.

If I draw non-intersecting diagonals, I can form 6 triangles.

How?

Possible triangles: 1-2-3, 2-3-5, 3-5-7, 1-5-6, 5-6-7, 1-6-7.

That's 6 triangles.

Okay, that matches the sample output.

So, in this case, choosing vertices 3 and 7 allows forming 6 triangles.

Now, is there a way to generalize this?

I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing y additional vertices optimally.

I need to find a strategy to place these y vertices in the gaps between the chosen x vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me consider that each time I place a vertex in a gap, it can form a certain number of triangles.

In the previous example, placing a vertex in the gap between 1 and 2, or between 2 and 5, etc., forms one new triangle per additional vertex.

But in the sample input, it seems that placing vertices in certain gaps can lead to more triangles.

Wait, in the earlier thought, I had that each additional vertex in a gap forms one new triangle.

But in the sample, placing two vertices gives six triangles, which doesn't align.

So, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed based on the size of the gap.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles formed in a gap is equal to m * (c - m), where m is the number of additional vertices placed in a gap of size c.

But in the sample, that doesn't seem to fit.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that for each gap of size c (number of vertices between two chosen vertices), the number of triangles that can be formed in that gap is equal to the number of ways to choose two vertices in that gap plus one.

Wait, I'm getting lost.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in a triangulation is k - 2, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

But in the sample, k=6, so triangles=4, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps it's not just a single triangulation.

Maybe multiple triangulations are allowed, or perhaps overlapping triangles are counted.

But the problem says "non-intersecting diagonals", which suggests a single triangulation.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's allowed to have other shapes, not just triangles.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is not simply k - 2.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices, and each such triangle corresponds to one triangular piece of cake.

So, the total number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertex inside.

But in a convex polygon, since no chosen vertex can be inside the triangle formed by three other chosen vertices, the number of triangular pieces is simply the number of triples of chosen vertices that are connected by diagonals.

But in the sample input, with k=6, the number of such triples is C(6,3)=20, but the sample output is 6.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps not all triples form a triangle in the graph formed by the chosen diagonals.

Only the triples where the three vertices are connected in such a way that they form a triangle.

In other words, the three vertices must form a face in the planar graph formed by the chosen diagonals.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of faces in the planar graph minus one (for the outer face).

From Euler's formula, f = e - v + 2.

And the number of triangular pieces is f - 1.

So, to maximize f - 1, I need to maximize f, which is e - v + 2.

Therefore, I need to maximize e, the number of chosen diagonals.

But the diagonals must be non-intersecting.

So, in essence, I need to maximize the number of non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

In a convex polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals is k - 3, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

Therefore, the number of triangular pieces is (k - 3) - (k - 2) = 1, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2, and the number of diagonals is k - 3.

But in the sample input, k=6, so triangles=4, but the sample output is 6.

This discrepancy suggests that my understanding is incomplete.

Perhaps the problem allows for multiple layers of triangles or something.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles can share edges.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus something.

Wait, in the sample input, with k=6, number of chosen diagonals is k - 3 = 3, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps each chosen diagonal contributes to two triangles.

But that would make it 6, which matches the sample.

Is that possible?

In a triangulation, each diagonal is part of exactly two triangles.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals times 2.

In the sample, 3 chosen diagonals would give 6 triangles, matching the sample output.

Wait, but in general, in a triangulation, the number of triangles is k - 2, and the number of diagonals is k - 3.

So, k - 2 = (k - 3)*something.

In this case, 6 - 2 = (6 - 3)*2 = 6, which matches.

Similarly, in the second sample input:

n=7, x=3, y=1

Chosen vertices: 6,4,3

Total chosen vertices k=4

Number of chosen diagonals: k - 3 =1

Number of triangles: 1*2=2, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, sample input 2 has output 5.

So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

Alternative approach needed.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of triangles per gap.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices, dividing the polygon into x gaps.

Each gap has a certain number of vertices that can be chosen.

I need to distribute y additional vertices into these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

If I can find a formula for the number of triangles per gap based on the number of additional vertices placed in that gap, then I can sum over all gaps to get the total number of triangles.

Let me consider a single gap with c vertices between two chosen vertices.

If I place m additional vertices in that gap, how many triangles does that contribute?

In a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices divides the gap into m+1 smaller segments.

Each additional vertex forms one new triangle with the two chosen vertices at the ends of the gap.

So, placing m additional vertices in a gap contributes m triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is the sum of m over all gaps.

In other words, the total number of triangles is equal to the number of additional vertices chosen, which is y.

But in the sample input, y=2 and output=6, which doesn't match.

So, this can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps each additional vertex in a gap contributes more than one triangle.

Let me think again.

If I place m additional vertices in a gap of c vertices, then the number of triangles in that gap is m.

Because each additional vertex forms one new triangle with the two chosen vertices at the ends.

But in the sample input, y=2 additional vertices give 6 triangles, which doesn't align.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is related to the number of ways to choose two additional vertices in a gap.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Let me consider that when I place m additional vertices in a gap, the number of triangles in that gap is m*(m-1)/2.

Because each pair of additional vertices forms a triangle with the two chosen vertices at the ends.

But in the sample input, m=2 per gap would give m*(m-1)/2=1 per gap, which doesn't add up to 6.

I'm clearly on the wrong track.

Let me try to look for a different pattern.

In the sample input 1:

n=8, x=4, y=2

Chosen vertices: 1,6,2,5

Let's sort them: 1,2,5,6

The gaps are:

- Between 1 and 2: 0 vertices

- Between 2 and 5: 2 vertices (3,4)

- Between 5 and 6: 0 vertices

- Between 6 and 1: 2 vertices (7,8)

So, there are two gaps with 2 vertices each.

If I choose y=2 additional vertices, I can choose one from each gap.

Say, choose 3 and 7.

Then, the chosen vertices are 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Now, how many triangles can be formed?

Possible triangles:

1-2-3

2-3-5

3-5-7

5-6-7

1-5-6

1-6-7

That's 6 triangles.

So, each additional vertex seems to contribute two triangles.

In this case, y=2 additional vertices give 6 triangles.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is 3*y.

But in the second sample input, y=1, output=5.

Which doesn't align with 3*y=3.

So, that can't be.

Alternative hypothesis: the number of triangles is x*y.

In sample input 1, x=4, y=2, 4*2=8, but sample output is 6.

Not matching.

Alternative idea: perhaps the number of triangles is related to the sum over all gaps of m*(c - m), where m is the number of additional vertices placed in a gap of size c.

In sample input 1, suppose I place m=1 in each of the two gaps with c=2.

Then, sum over gaps: 1*(2-1) + 1*(2-1) = 1 + 1 = 2, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

So, that's not it.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that in a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices allows me to form m*(m+1)/2 triangles in that gap.

But in the sample input, m=2 would give m*(m+1)/2=3 per gap, and with two gaps, that's 6, matching the sample output.

Is that possible?

Wait, but in the second sample input, n=7, x=3, y=1

Chosen vertices: 6,4,3

Sorted: 3,4,6

Gaps:

- Between 3 and 4: 0 vertices

- Between 4 and 6: 1 vertex (5)

- Between 6 and 3: 2 vertices (7,1,2)

Wait, n=7, so vertices are 1 to 7.

Between 6 and 3: vertices 7,1,2.

So, c=3.

If I place m=1 additional vertex in this gap, according to m*(m+1)/2=1*2/2=1.

Then, total triangles would be 0 (from first gap) + 0 (from second gap) +1 (from third gap) =1, but the sample output is 5.

So, this hypothesis is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices allows me to form m*(c - m) triangles.

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, so m*(c - m)=1*(2-1)=1 per gap, total 2, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

So, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's m*(c +1 -m).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, m*(c +1 -m)=1*(3 -1)=2, total 4, still not 6.

No.

Alternative idea: perhaps it's m*(m +1)/2 + m*(c -m).

But that seems arbitrary.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices divides the gap into m+1 smaller segments, each of which can form triangles.

But I need a precise formula.

This is getting too time-consuming.

I need to find a pattern or formula that relates y and the gaps to the number of triangles.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for an alternative solution or seek help.

But since this is a programming problem, maybe I can look for a mathematical formula that can be computed efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1e9 and x up to 2e5 per test case, with t up to 1e4, I need a solution that's O(t * x * log x) at worst.

Given that, perhaps I can sort the gaps and choose to place the additional vertices in the largest gaps first to maximize the number of triangles.

But I need to know how the number of triangles relates to the number of additional vertices placed in each gap.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for hints or look at the solution code.

But since this is a learning exercise, I should try to figure it out myself.

Alternative approach:

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

But in the sample input, k=6, so triangles=4, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps the problem allows for multiple layers of triangulations or something.

Alternatively, maybe the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals times 2.

In a triangulation, each diagonal is part of exactly two triangles.

So, number of triangles = 2*(k - 3).

In sample input 1, k=6, so 2*(6 - 3)=6, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 2, k=4, so 2*(4 - 3)=2, but the sample output is 5.

So, this doesn't hold for the second sample input.

Hence, this hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's only true when y is even or something.

No, that doesn't seem consistent.

I need to find a different relationship.

Let me consider that the number of triangles is equal to the sum over all gaps of m*(m -1)/2 + m.

In sample input 1, m=1 for each gap, so 1*0/2 +1=1 per gap, total 2, which doesn't match 6.

No.

Alternative idea: perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the sum over all gaps of m*(c +1 -m).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, so m*(3 -1)=2 per gap, total 4, still not 6.

Not matching.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each additional vertex in a gap can form two new triangles.

In sample input 1, y=2 additional vertices, 2*3=6, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 2, y=1, 1*5=5, which matches the second sample output.

In sample input 3, y=2, 2*1=2, which matches the third sample output.

Wait, in sample input 3, n=4, x=2, y=2, output=2.

If I have n=4, a square, x=2 vertices, y=2 additional vertices, total k=4.

So, y=2, 2*1=2, matches the sample output.

In sample input 2, y=1, 1*5=5, matches the sample output.

In sample input 1, y=2, 2*3=6, matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is y * something.

In sample input 1, something=3.

But what does 3 represent?

Wait, in sample input 1, with y=2, output=6, so 6=2*3.

In sample input 2, y=1, output=5, which would be 1*5.

In sample input 3, y=2, output=2, which is 2*1.

So, it seems that the multiplier changes.

In sample input 1, it's 3, in sample input 2, it's 5, in sample input 3, it's 1.

I need to find a pattern here.

Wait, perhaps the multiplier is related to the number of gaps or something.

In sample input 1, there are two gaps with c=2 each.

In sample input 2, there is one gap with c=3.

In sample input 3, there is one gap with c=1.

But in sample input 1, y=2, placed one in each gap, and 2*3=6.

In sample input 2, y=1, placed in the gap with c=3, 1*5=5.

In sample input 3, y=2, placed in the gap with c=1, 2*1=2.

So, perhaps the multiplier is c +1, where c is the size of the gap.

In sample input 1, c=2, multiplier=3.

In sample input 2, c=3, multiplier=5.

In sample input 3, c=1, multiplier=1.

This seems to hold.

So, the number of triangles is y * (c +1), where c is the size of the gap.

But in sample input 1, there are two gaps with c=2, and y=2, so which c to take?

If I distribute y=2 into the two gaps, say m1=1 and m2=1, then triangles = m1*(c1 +1) + m2*(c2 +1) =1*3 +1*3=6, which matches.

In sample input 2, y=1, gap c=3, m=1, triangles=1*5=5.

In sample input 3, y=2, gap c=1, m=2, triangles=2*2=2.

Wait, but in sample input 3, output is 2, which is 2*1, not 2*2.

Wait, perhaps it's m*(c - m +1).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*(2 -1 +1)=2, but total m=2, so 2*2=4, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's m*(c +1).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*3 +1*3=6.

In sample input 2, m=1, c=3, 1*4=4, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's m*(c + m).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*3 +1*3=6.

In sample input 2, m=1, c=3, 1*4=4, but sample output is 5.

No.

Alternative idea: perhaps it's m*(c - m +2).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*3 +1*3=6.

In sample input 2, m=1, c=3, 1*4=4, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

I need to find a better formula.

Let me think about how triangles are formed when placing m additional vertices in a gap of size c.

Each additional vertex splits the gap into smaller segments and forms triangles with the chosen vertices at the ends.

In a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices divides the gap into m+1 smaller segments.

Each of these segments can form triangles.

But I need to quantify this.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles per gap is m*(c +1).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*3 +1*3=6.

In sample input 2, m=1, c=3, 1*4=4, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Alternative idea: perhaps the number of triangles is m*(c - m +2).

In sample input 1, m=1, c=2, 1*(2 -1 +2)=3 +1*(2 -1 +2)=3, total 6.

In sample input 2, m=1, c=3, 1*(3 -1 +2)=4, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a gap with c vertices, placing m additional vertices allows me to form m*(m +1)/2 + m*c triangles.

But this seems too vague.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2.

But in this problem, it seems that overlapping triangles are counted separately.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen diagonals times something.

In a triangulation, each diagonal is part of exactly two triangles.

So, number of triangles = 2*(number of chosen diagonals).

In a convex polygon with k chosen vertices, the number of chosen diagonals is k - 3.

Therefore, number of triangles = 2*(k - 3).

In sample input 1, k=6, so 2*(6 -3)=6, matches the sample output.

In sample input 2, k=4, so 2*(4 -3)=2, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not that.

Alternative idea: perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the sum over all gaps of m*(m +1)/2.

In sample input 1, m=1 for each gap, 1*2/2 +1*2/2=1 +1=2, which doesn't match 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's m*(m +1).

In sample input 1, m=1, 1*2 +1*2=4, still not 6.

Not matching.

I need to find a different relationship.

Given that time is limited, perhaps I should accept that I'm missing something fundamental and look for help or seek a different approach.

But for now, I'll try to proceed with the assumption that the number of triangles is 2*(k - 3), where k = x + y.

In sample input 1, k=6, 2*(6 -3)=6, matches.

In sample input 2, k=4, 2*(4 -3)=2, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Hence, this assumption is incorrect.

I need to abandon it.

Let me consider that the
