Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid of squares, each being either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations on the grid where I select two squares of the same color, and then all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners get changed to that color.

The question is, can I make the entire grid have squares of the same color—either all 'W' or all 'B'—by performing any number of these operations?

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. So, it's like filling a rectangle with the color of the two selected squares.

I need to figure out if, starting from any given grid, I can turn all squares into the same color using these operations.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

2 1

W

B

So, a 2x1 grid with the first square 'W' and the second 'B'. Since they're different, and I need to make them the same, can I do that?

Well, I can't select two squares of the same color because there are only two squares, one 'W' and one 'B'. So, I can't perform any operation here. Therefore, it's impossible to make them the same, so the answer should be "NO".

Example 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

This is a 6x6 grid. It's a bit complex, but according to the sample input, the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to make all squares the same color after some operations.

I need to find a general approach that can determine whether it's possible for any given grid.

Another example:

1 1

W

Here, it's a single square, already uniform, so "YES".

2 2

BB

BB

Already all squares are 'B', so "YES".

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Again, already uniform, "YES".

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

So, a 4x2 grid where the first two rows are 'BB' and the last two are 'WW'. The answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Wait, but in this case, the grid is divided into two parts: 'BB' and 'WW'. How can I make them all 'B' or all 'W'?

Let me see: If I select two 'W's, say positions (3,1) and (4,2), then the rectangle between them is positions (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), all set to 'W'. But the 'B's are still there in the first two rows. How can I propagate the 'W's to the 'B's or vice versa?

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the corners of the grid. The top-left and bottom-right corners. In the first example, they are different ('W' and 'B'), and I couldn't perform any operation because there were no two squares of the same color to select.

In the fourth example, all squares are 'B', so it's already uniform.

In the fifth example, it's a 3x4 grid with a checkerboard pattern. But according to the sample input, it's "YES", meaning it's possible to make them uniform. How?

Wait, perhaps there's a way to select two squares of the same color and cover parts of the grid to make them uniform.

Let me look at the program provided and see how it approaches this problem.

The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, which are the number of rows and columns, respectively. Then it reads the grid into a list called `gr`.

Then, it initializes `ans` to 'YES'.

It checks if the top-left corner `gr[0][0]` is different from the bottom-right corner `gr[n-1][m-1]`. If they are different, it sets `impossible` to True.

Then, it checks if all squares in the first row are the same, and all squares in the last row are the same, by iterating through the columns from 0 to m-2. If any adjacent pair in the first row or the last row differs, it sets `impossible` to False.

Similarly, it checks if all squares in the first column are the same, and all squares in the last column are the same, by iterating through the rows from 0 to n-2. If any adjacent pair in the first column or the last column differs, it sets `impossible` to False.

If both these checks pass (i.e., `impossible` remains True), then it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

Finally, it prints `ans`.

Wait, but in the first example, where n=2, m=1, gr=[['W'], ['B']], gr[0][0]='W' and gr[1][0]='B', which are different. So, it sets `impossible` to True.

Then, it checks the first row and the last row. Since m=1, there are no adjacent pairs in the rows, so it doesn't enter the loop, and `impossible` remains True.

Then, it checks the first column and the last column. For the first column, it has 'W' and 'B', which are different, so it sets `impossible` to False.

Therefore, `impossible` becomes False, and `ans` remains 'YES', but according to the sample input, the answer should be "NO".

Wait, that doesn't match. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Let me look again.

In the first row check:

for j in range(m - 1):

if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:

impossible = False

In the first example, m=1, so m-1=0, so the loop doesn't run. So, `impossible` remains True.

Then, it checks the columns:

for i in range(n - 1):

if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:

impossible = False

Here, n=2, m=1, so range(n-1) is range(1), so i=0.

gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', which are different, so it sets `impossible` to False.

Similarly, m-1=0, so gr[i][m-1] is gr[0][0]='W' and gr[1][0]='B', different, so again `impossible` is set to False.

Therefore, `impossible` is False, and since `impossible` is False, it doesn't set `ans` to 'NO', so it prints 'YES', but according to the sample input, it should be "NO".

So, there's a discrepancy here. The program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Let me look again.

The program sets `ans` to 'YES' initially.

If gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1], then it sets `impossible` to True.

Then, it checks if all adjacent pairs in the first and last rows are the same.

If they are not, it sets `impossible` to False.

Similarly, it checks if all adjacent pairs in the first and last columns are the same.

If they are not, it sets `impossible` to False.

If `impossible` remains True after these checks, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

In the first example:

gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', which are different, so `impossible` is True.

Then, m=1, so no loop for rows.

Then, for columns:

gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', different, so `impossible` is set to False.

Therefore, `impossible` is False, so it doesn't set `ans` to 'NO', and prints 'YES', which is incorrect.

So, the program is wrong in this case.

Wait, but maybe I need to understand the logic behind this.

The program seems to be checking if the grid can be made uniform by ensuring that the corners are the same, and if they are different, then it checks if the first and last rows and columns are uniform themselves.

But in the first example, the first and last rows are different, and the first and last columns are different, so it should be 'NO', but the program is printing 'YES'.

So, it's incorrect.

Let me see another example.

Take the second test case:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

According to the sample input, the answer is "YES".

Let's see what the program does.

gr[0][0]='W', gr[5][5]='W', same, so `impossible` is not set to True.

Therefore, `ans` remains 'YES', and it prints 'YES', which is correct.

Another example:

1 1

W

Already uniform, 'YES', correct.

2 2

BB

BB

Already uniform, 'YES', correct.

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

This is a checkerboard pattern. According to the sample input, it's "YES", meaning it's possible to make them uniform.

But how?

Wait, maybe in this case, all 'B's are connected, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Let me consider another test case:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

According to the sample input, it's "YES".

So, the grid is:

Row 1: B B

Row 2: B B

Row 3: W W

Row 4: W W

So, if I select (1,1) and (2,2), both 'B', then the rectangle between them is rows 1-2, columns 1-2, which are already 'B'.

Then, select (3,1) and (4,2), both 'W', then the rectangle between them is rows 3-4, columns 1-2, which are already 'W'.

But I need to make the entire grid 'B' or 'W'.

How can I propagate 'B' to 'W' or vice versa?

Wait, perhaps I can select a 'B' and a 'W' that are the same, but they are different colors.

Wait, no, I can only select two squares of the same color.

So, how can I make the entire grid 'B' or 'W'?

Wait, maybe I need to find a sequence of operations where I can expand the area of one color over the other.

For example, if I have a 'B' and a 'W' adjacent, and I select two 'B's, I can make a larger rectangle of 'B's, and maybe cover some 'W's in the process.

But in this grid, the 'B's and 'W's are separated, so maybe it's impossible.

But according to the sample input, it's "YES", so there must be a way.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input. Let me check again.

Wait, in the sample input, the 4x2 grid with BB BB WW WW is "YES", but in the explanation, it says "NO". Wait, no, looking back, in the sample input, it's "YES", but in the note, it says "NO". Wait, no, in the note, it says:

In the fifth example, it's a 3x4 grid with BWBW, WBWB, BWBW, and the answer is "YES".

Then, the sixth example is 4x2 grid with BB BB WW WW, and the answer is "NO".

Wait, in the problem statement, the output for the 8 test cases is:

NO

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, the 4x2 grid with BB BB WW WW is test case 6, which is "NO".

So, according to the sample input, it's "NO", which matches my intuition that it's impossible to make them uniform.

But earlier, I thought the program was printing "YES" for this case, but according to the sample input, it's "NO".

Wait, let's see what the program does for this case.

n=4, m=2

gr[0][0]='B', gr[3][1]='W', which are different, so `impossible` is set to True.

Then, check first and last rows:

First row: B B

Last row: W W

Check j from 0 to m-2, which is 0 to 1-1=0.

So, j=0:

gr[0][0]='B' == gr[0][1]='B' ? Yes.

gr[3][0]='W' == gr[3][1]='W' ? Yes.

So, `impossible` remains True.

Then, check first and last columns:

i from 0 to n-2, which is 0 to 2.

i=0:

gr[0][0]='B' == gr[1][0]='B' ? Yes.

gr[0][1]='B' == gr[1][1]='B' ? Yes.

i=1:

gr[1][0]='B' == gr[2][0]='B' ? Yes.

gr[1][1]='B' == gr[2][1]='B' ? Yes.

i=2:

gr[2][0]='W' == gr[3][0]='W' ? Yes.

gr[2][1]='W' == gr[3][1]='W' ? Yes.

So, `impossible` remains True.

Therefore, it sets `ans` to 'NO', which is correct.

Wait, but earlier, in the first test case, it was incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, m=1, gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', different.

Then, check first and last rows: m=1, so no loop.

Check first and last columns:

i from 0 to n-2, which is 0 to 0, so i=0.

gr[0][0]='W' == gr[1][0]='B' ? No, so `impossible` set to False.

Therefore, `ans` remains 'YES', which is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, how can I fix this?

I need a better approach to determine if the grid can be made uniform.

Let me think about the problem differently.

I need to make all squares the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B', using operations that allow me to select two squares of the same color and set the entire rectangle between them to that color.

One way to think about this is to consider connected components of the grid where squares of the same color are connected through operations.

If I can connect all 'W's together and all 'B's together in such a way that I can cover the entire grid with one color, then it's possible.

But this seems a bit vague. Let me think more carefully.

Suppose I have two squares of the same color. By selecting them, I can set the entire rectangle between them to that color.

So, if I have two squares of the same color that are on opposite corners of the grid, I can set the entire grid to that color in one operation.

But in the first example, the top-left is 'W' and bottom-right is 'B', and they are different, so I can't directly set the entire grid in one operation.

But maybe there are intermediate operations that allow me to make them the same.

Wait, in the first example, n=2, m=1, with 'W' and 'B'. Since they are different, and there are no other squares, I can't perform any operation, so it's impossible.

In the second example, it's possible, according to the sample input.

Looking back at the program, it seems to check if the first and last rows and columns are uniform, and if not, set `impossible` to False, meaning that it's possible.

But in the first test case, it incorrectly sets `ans` to 'YES'.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the grid as a graph where squares of the same color are nodes, and edges connect squares that can be used together in an operation to set a rectangle to that color.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that if I can find a way to make all squares 'W' or all 'B', I need to see if there's a sequence of operations that allows me to do that.

One key observation is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

But in the first test case, they are different, so I need to check if I can make them the same.

Wait, in the first test case, it's impossible because there are only two squares, and they are different, and I can't perform any operation to change them.

In other cases, if the corners are different, but there are other squares that allow me to perform operations to make them the same, then it's possible.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some grid problems, checking the four corners is important because they can influence the entire grid.

In this problem, if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, then I can select them and set the entire grid to that color.

If they are different, then I need to see if I can make them the same.

But how?

Well, if I can find two squares of the same color such that their rectangle covers both corners, and set the entire grid to that color.

But in the first test case, that's impossible because there are no two squares of the same color.

In other cases, it might be possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists at least one pair of squares of the same color that can cover the entire grid in one operation.

If not, then check if there are sequences of operations that can lead to making the entire grid uniform.

This seems too time-consuming to check for large grids.

Given the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and n*m up to 3*10^5 total, I need an efficient solution.

Looking back at the program, it seems to have a flawed logic.

I need to find a correct condition to determine if it's possible to make the grid uniform.

Let me consider that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, then I can set the entire grid to that color in one operation.

If they are different, then I need to check if I can make the entire grid the color of one of them.

But how?

Wait, perhaps if I can find a path of squares of the same color connecting from the top-left to the bottom-right, then I can make the entire grid that color.

But that doesn't seem right, because the operation allows me to set a rectangle between two squares of the same color, not necessarily connected in a path.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of monochromatic connected components.

If all 'W's form a connected component or all 'B's form a connected component, then I can make the entire grid that color.

But connectivity here is in terms of rectangles that can be set together.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if there exists a square that can be used to set a rectangle covering the entire grid to its color, then it's possible.

But for that, I need to have two squares of the same color such that their rectangle covers the entire grid.

Which means, if there are two squares of the same color where one is in the top-left corner and the other is in the bottom-right corner.

But in the first test case, the top-left and bottom-right are different.

So, in that case, it's impossible.

But in other cases, maybe there are other squares that can be used to achieve this.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists any two squares of the same color such that their rectangle covers the entire grid.

If such a pair exists, then I can set the entire grid to that color in one operation.

If not, then I need to see if I can perform operations to create such a pair.

But checking for such pairs for large grids would be inefficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if the grid is already uniform, then the answer is "YES".

If the grid is not uniform, but there exists at least one color that is present in both the first row and the last row, or in both the first column and the last column, then it might be possible to make the entire grid that color.

Wait, perhaps if a color is present in both the first row and the last row, or in both the first column and the last column, then I can select two squares of that color from the first and last rows or columns to set a large rectangle to that color.

But I need to think more carefully.

Suppose a color is present in both the first and last rows. Then, by selecting two squares of that color, one in the first row and one in the last row, I can set all columns between them to that color.

Similarly, if a color is present in both the first and last columns, selecting two squares of that color, one in the first column and one in the last column, can set all rows between them to that color.

Then, perhaps, if a color is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, I can make the entire grid that color.

Let me test this idea with the first test case:

n=2, m=1

gr=[['W'], ['B']]

Here, the first row is 'W', last row is 'B'. 'W' is only in the first row, 'B' is only in the last row. So, neither 'W' nor 'B' is present in both the first and last rows. So, according to this idea, it's impossible, which matches the correct answer "NO".

In the fourth test case:

2 2

BB

BB

Already uniform, "YES".

In the fifth test case:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

This is a checkerboard pattern. 'B' is in positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2). 'W' is in positions (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3).

Here, 'B' is in the first row and last row, positions (0,0) and (2,0), (2,2). So, 'B' is present in both the first and last rows. Similarly, 'W' is in the first row and last row.

So, I can select, for example, (0,0) and (2,0), both 'B', and set the rectangle between them, which is rows 0-2, columns 0-0, to 'B'. Then, select (0,2) and (2,2), both 'B', and set rows 0-2, columns 2-2 to 'B'. But this doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps I need to select (0,0) and (2,2), both 'B', and set the rectangle between them, which is rows 0-2, columns 0-2 to 'B'. Then, the grid becomes:

Row 0: B B B W

Row 1: B B B W

Row 2: B B B W

Then, select (0,3) and (2,3), both 'W', and set rows 0-2, columns 3-3 to 'W'.

So, the grid is now:

Row 0: B B B W

Row 1: B B B W

Row 2: B B B W

Then, select (0,0) and (2,3), both 'B' (since (2,3) is 'W', but wait, no, (2,3) is 'W', so I can't select (0,0) 'B' and (2,3) 'W' because they are different colors.

Wait, I can only select two squares of the same color.

So, in this case, I can't select (0,0) 'B' and (2,3) 'W'.

So, maybe this approach doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform operations in a sequence to make the entire grid 'B' or 'W'.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I try to make the entire grid 'W'.

To do that, I need to ensure that all 'B's can be changed to 'W' through operations.

Similarly, to make the entire grid 'B', I need to change all 'W's to 'B'.

But how do I change a 'B' to 'W' or vice versa?

Well, by selecting two squares of the same color and setting a rectangle to that color.

So, if I have two 'W's, I can set a rectangle to 'W', which can overwrite 'B's to 'W's.

Similarly, with 'B's.

So, if I want to make the entire grid 'W', I need to ensure that all 'B's are covered by rectangles set to 'W' through operations.

Similarly, for 'B'.

So, perhaps I need to check if I can cover all 'B's with rectangles of 'W's, or all 'W's with rectangles of 'B's.

This sounds like a domination problem.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that if I can select two 'W's that cover all 'B's in their rectangle, then I can set all those 'B's to 'W's in one operation.

Similarly for 'B's.

But covering all 'B's with a single rectangle requires that all 'B's are within the rectangle of some two 'W's.

This might not always be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I need multiple operations to cover all 'B's with 'W's.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to make the entire grid 'W'.

I need to ensure that all 'B's are covered by some operation that sets them to 'W'.

Each operation that selects two 'W's can set a rectangle to 'W', potentially covering some 'B's.

So, I need to cover all 'B's with such rectangles.

This is similar to covering 'B's with 'W' rectangles.

Similarly, to make the entire grid 'B', cover all 'W's with 'B' rectangles.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but with these constraints, there must be a better way.

Let me consider that if I can find a set of 'W's such that their rectangles cover all 'B's, then I can make the grid all 'W's.

Similarly for 'B's.

But finding such a set is complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if there exists a 'W' in the first row and a 'W' in the last row, then I can set all columns between them to 'W' by selecting those two 'W's.

Similarly, if there's a 'W' in the first column and a 'W' in the last column, I can set all rows between them to 'W'.

So, if I have 'W's in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, I can cover large parts of the grid with 'W's.

Similarly for 'B's.

So, perhaps the correct condition is:

If for at least one color, that color is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Let me test this condition with the sample inputs.

First test case:

n=2, m=1

gr=[['W'], ['B']]

'W' is only in the first row, 'B' is only in the last row.

So, neither color is in both the first and last rows.

Hence, impossible, "NO".

Second test case:

n=6, m=6

gr=[

'WWWWBW',

'WBWWWW',

'BBBWWW',

'BWWWBB',

'WWBWBB',

'BBBWBW'

]

In the first row, 'W's and 'B's.

In the last row, 'B's and 'W's.

'W' is in both the first and last rows.

Similarly, 'B' is in both the first and last rows.

So, it's possible to make the entire grid 'W' or 'B'.

Hence, "YES".

Third test case:

n=1, m=1

gr=[['W']]

Already uniform, "YES".

Fourth test case:

n=2, m=2

gr=[

'BB',

'BB'

]

Already uniform, "YES".

Fifth test case:

n=3, m=4

gr=[

'BWBW',

'WBWB',

'BWBW'

]

'W' is in both the first and last rows.

'B' is in both the first and last rows.

Hence, "YES".

Sixth test case:

n=4, m=2

gr=[

'BB',

'BB',

'WW',

'WW'

]

'W' is only in the last two rows, 'B' is only in the first two rows.

Neither 'W' nor 'B' is in both the first and last rows.

Similarly, in columns, 'B' is in the first column, rows 0-1; 'W' in the first column, rows 2-3.

So, neither color is in both the first and last columns.

Hence, "NO".

Seventh test case:

n=4, m=4

gr=[

'WWBW',

'BBWB',

'WWBB',

'BBBB'

]

'W' is in the first row and last row.

'B' is in the first row and last row.

Hence, "YES".

Eighth test case:

n=1, m=5

gr=[['W','B','B','W','B']]

'W' is in the first row.

'B' is in the first row.

But since it's only one row, I need to check if I can make all 'W' or all 'B'.

In this case, 'W's and 'B's are mixed in the first and only row.

But according to the condition, since both colors are in the first row, it should be "YES", but according to the sample input, it's "NO".

Wait, this contradicts my condition.

So, my condition is not fully correct.

In this case, n=1, m=5, with 'W','B','B','W','B'.

According to the sample input, the answer is "NO", but according to my condition, since both 'W' and 'B' are in the first row, it should be "YES".

So, my condition is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for at least one color, that color is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns.

In this case, n=1, m=5.

First row is the only row, so 'W' and 'B' are in the first row.

But m=5, and the first and last columns are 'W' and 'B', respectively.

So, 'W' is in the first column, 'B' is in the last column.

But according to my condition, since 'W' is in the first row and 'B' is in the first row, and 'W' is in the first column and 'B' is in the last column, but no single color is in both the first and last rows or both the first and last columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to check for each color separately.

For 'W':

- Is 'W' in both the first and last rows? No, since n=1.

- Is 'W' in both the first and last columns? First column is 'W', last column is 'B', so 'W' is only in the first column.

For 'B':

- Is 'B' in both the first and last rows? No.

- Is 'B' in both the first and last columns? Last column is 'B', but first column is 'W'.

So, for 'B', it's only in the last column.

Hence, neither 'W' nor 'B' is present in both the first and last rows or both the first and last columns.

Therefore, according to my condition, it should be "NO", which matches the sample input.

So, perhaps my condition needs to be:

If for at least one color, that color is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the fifth test case:

n=3, m=4

gr=[

'BWBW',

'WBWB',

'BWBW'

]

In this grid, 'W' is in the first row and last row.

'B' is in the first row and last row.

So, for both colors, they are in both the first and last rows.

Hence, "YES".

Similarly, in the sixth test case, neither color is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

Seems consistent.

In the eighth test case, neither color is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

So, perhaps this condition is correct.

But earlier, in the first test case, neither color is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

In the second test case, both colors are in both the first and last rows, so "YES".

In the third and fourth test cases, grids are already uniform, so "YES".

In the fifth test case, both colors are in both the first and last rows, so "YES".

In the sixth test case, neither color is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

In the seventh test case, both colors are in both the first and last rows, so "YES".

In the eighth test case, neither color is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

This matches the sample input outputs.

Therefore, the condition seems correct.

But earlier, I thought the program was incorrect for the first test case, but according to this, it should be correct.

Wait, let's see what the program does.

In the first test case:

n=2, m=1

gr=[['W'], ['B']]

gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', different.

So, set `impossible` to True.

Then, m=1, so no loop for rows.

Then, check columns:

i from 0 to n-2, which is 0 to 0, so i=0.

gr[0][0]='W' == gr[1][0]='B'? No, so set `impossible` to False.

Therefore, `impossible` is False, so `ans` remains 'YES', which is incorrect.

But according to my condition, it should be "NO".

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the program.

Let me rephrase the condition.

If gr[0][0] == gr[n-1][m-1], then "YES".

Else, if gr[0][0] is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, then "YES".

Similarly, if gr[n-1][m-1] is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns, then "YES".

Else, "NO".

Wait, but in the first test case, gr[0][0]='W', gr[1][0]='B', different.

'W' is only in the first row, 'B' is only in the last row.

So, according to this, "NO".

In the eighth test case, gr[0][0]='W', gr[0][4]='B', different.

'W' is in the first row, 'B' is in the first row.

But neither 'W' nor 'B' is in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

Wait, but in the fifth test case, gr[0][0]='B', gr[2][3]='W', different.

But 'B' is in both the first and last rows, and 'W' is in both the first and last rows, so "YES".

So, perhaps the condition is:

If gr[0][0] == gr[n-1][m-1], then "YES".

Else, check if there exists at least one color that is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns.

If yes, then "YES", else "NO".

In the first test case, gr[0][0] != gr[1][0], and neither 'W' nor 'B' is present in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

In the eighth test case, gr[0][0] != gr[0][4], and neither 'W' nor 'B' is present in both the first and last rows or columns, so "NO".

In the fifth test case, gr[0][0] != gr[2][3], but both 'B' and 'W' are present in both the first and last rows, so "YES".

Therefore, this condition seems correct.

So, perhaps the program needs to be adjusted to correctly implement this condition.

Looking back at the program:

It checks if gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1], then sets `impossible` to True.

Then, it checks if all squares in the first and last rows are the same, and if all squares in the first and last columns are the same.

If they are, then it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

Wait, that doesn't match my condition.

I think the program has a flaw in its logic.

It should be:

If gr[0][0] == gr[n-1][m-1], then "YES".

Else, check if there exists at least one color that is present in both the first and last rows, or in both the first and last columns.

If yes, then "YES", else "NO".

So, perhaps I need to implement this logic correctly.

Let me try to write pseudocode for this.

for each test case:

read n, m

read grid

if grid[0][0] == grid[n-1][m-1]:

print "YES"

else:

# check if any color is present in both first and last rows

color1 = grid[0][0]

color2 = grid[n-1][m-1]

if (color1 in grid[0] and color1 in grid[n-1]) or (color2 in grid[0] and color2 in grid[n-1]):

print "YES"

elif (color1 in [grid[i][0] for i in range(n)] and color1 in [grid[i][m-1] for i in range(n)]) or (color2 in [grid[i][0] for i in range(n)] and color2 in [grid[i][m-1] for i in range(n)]):

print "YES"

else:

print "NO"

This seems correct.

Let me test this with the first test case:

n=2, m=1

grid=[['W'], ['B']]

grid[0][0]='W', grid[1][0]='B', different.

Check if 'W' is in grid[0] and grid[1]: 'W' is in grid[0], but not in grid[1].

'W' is in grid[0][0] and grid[1][0]? No, grid[1][0]='B'.

Similarly, 'B' is in grid[1] but not in grid[0].

So, "NO".

Second test case:

n=6, m=6

grid with mixed colors, but 'W' and 'B' are in both first and last rows, so "YES".

Third and fourth test cases: already uniform, "YES".

Fifth test case: 'B' and 'W' are in both first and last rows, "YES".

Sixth test case: 'B' is only in first two rows, 'W' only in last two rows, neither in both first and last rows or columns, "NO".

Seventh test case: 'W' and 'B' are in both first and last rows, "YES".

Eighth test case: 'W' and 'B' are in the first row, but neither is in both first and last rows or columns (since n=1), "NO".

So, this matches the sample inputs.

Therefore, this is the correct condition.

Now, looking back at the original program, it seems to have a different logic.

It checks if gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1], then it checks if the first and last rows are uniform, and if the first and last columns are uniform.

If they are uniform, then it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

But according to my condition, if gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1], then I need to check if any color is present in both the first and last rows or both the first and last columns.

So, the original program's logic is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
