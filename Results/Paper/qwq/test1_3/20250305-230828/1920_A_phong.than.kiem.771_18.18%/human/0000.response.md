Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, there's a number n indicating the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and x is the value associated with that constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range of k based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers within that range that are excluded by the constraints of type 3.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among these constraints because k needs to satisfy all of them. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among these because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them.

Once I have the lower bound (lb) and the upper bound (ub), the possible values of k are from lb to ub, inclusive.

Then, for constraints of type 3 (k != x), I need to exclude these x values from the range lb to ub.

So, the total number of possible k values would be the count of integers from lb to ub, minus the count of x values from type 3 constraints that fall within this range.

Let me try to formalize this.

1. Find the lower bound (lb): the maximum x from all constraints where a=1.

2. Find the upper bound (ub): the minimum x from all constraints where a=2.

3. Collect all x values from constraints where a=3.

4. The total number of possible k is the number of integers from lb to ub, inclusive, minus the number of x values from step 3 that are within this range.

But I need to handle cases where lb > ub, which means no possible k satisfies all constraints, so the answer is 0.

Also, I need to make sure that the constraints of type 3 are only excluded if they are within the range [lb, ub].

Given that, let's look at the example provided.

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Example Output:

7

800000000

Let's take the first test case:

n=4

Constraints:

1 3 → k >= 3

2 10 → k <= 10

3 1 → k != 1

3 5 → k != 5

So, lb = max of all a=1 constraints, which is max(3) = 3

ub = min of all a=2 constraints, which is min(10) = 10

Possible k: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But exclude k=5, since k !=5

So, k=3,4,6,7,8,9,10 → 7 values, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=2

Constraints:

1 5 → k >=5

2 4 → k <=4

So, lb = max(5) =5

ub = min(4)=4

Since lb > ub, no possible k, so 0.

Third test case:

n=10

Constraints:

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

First, find lb and ub.

a=1 constraints: x=2,7,3 → max(2,7,3)=7

a=2 constraints: x=100,98 → min(100,98)=98

So, lb=7, ub=98

Possible k: 7 to 98 inclusive

Now, exclude k=6,7,100,44,99

But k=6 is already outside the range, so only exclude k=7,44,99

But 99 is outside the range, so only exclude k=7 and k=44

Number of k in range: 98 -7 +1 = 92

Minus excluded: 2

So, 92 -2 =90, which matches the sample output.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program starts with reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the constraints.

It seems to correctly identify the lower bound (start) and upper bound (end), and collects the x values from type 3 constraints in the list num.

Then, it calculates count_num, which is the number of type 3 x values that are within the range [start, end].

Finally, it computes end - start +1 - count_num if end >= start, else 0.

This seems correct.

But wait, in the first test case, start=3, end=10, num=[1,5]

count_num should be 1 (only 5 is within [3,10], 1 is less than 3), and end - start +1 =8, so 8 -1=7, which matches.

In the second test case, start=5, end=4, so 0.

In the third test case, start=7, end=98, num=[6,7,100,44,99], count_num=2 (7 and 44), 98-7+1=92, 92-2=90.

Seems correct.

Let me check another test case.

Fourth test case:

n=6

Constraints:

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

So, a=1 constraints: x=5,9 → lb=max(5,9)=9

a=2 constraints: x=10,2 → ub=min(10,2)=2

Since lb=9 > ub=2, no possible k, so 0.

Fifth test case:

n=5

Constraints:

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

lb=max(1)=1

ub=min(2)=2

Possible k:1,2

Exclude k=1,2,3

So, exclude k=1 and k=2, nothing left, so 0.

Sixth test case:

n=6

Constraints:

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

lb=max(10000,100000000)=100000000

ub=min(900000000,900000001)=900000000

Possible k:100000000 to 900000000

Exclude k=500000000,10000,900000001

Only k=500000000 is within the range, so count_num=1

Total k:900000000 -100000000 +1=800000001

Minus 1:800000000

Which matches the sample output.

So, the program seems to correctly implement the logic.

One thing to note is that in func_7(), end is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is a float. However, all operations are with integers, so it's better to initialize end as an integer, i.e., 1000000000.

But in Python, when subtracting integers from a float, it will work, but it's better to keep it consistent.

Also, the condition if end - start +1 >= count_num is not necessary, because even if end - start +1 < count_num, the result would still be correct as end - start +1 - count_num could be negative, but since we have the condition that if start > end, return 0, which already covers the case where the range is invalid.

Wait, no. If start <= end, and count_num is the number of exclusions within the range, then end - start +1 - count_num could be negative if count_num is larger than the range size, but in reality, count_num cannot be larger than the range size because it's the number of x values within the range.

So, end - start +1 is the total possible k, and count_num is the number to exclude, so the result should be non-negative.

Hence, the condition if end - start +1 >= count_num else 0 is redundant and can be removed.

But in the code, it's present, though it's not harmful because end - start +1 - count_num will be non-negative.

Overall, the logic seems correct, and it matches the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
