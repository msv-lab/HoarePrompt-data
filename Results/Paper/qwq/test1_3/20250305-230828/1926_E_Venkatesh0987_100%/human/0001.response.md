Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The order is based on laying down odd-numbered cards first, then cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

First, I need to understand the pattern here. Let's take the example given with n=7.

The cards are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

According to the process:

- First, lay down all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest: 1,3,5,7.

- Next, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3).

- Then, cards that are three times an odd number: well, 3*1=3, but 3 is already laid down in the first step. 3*3=9, but 9 is greater than 7, so no more cards here.

- Next, cards that are four times an odd number: 4*1=4, which is not yet laid down, so 4.

- And that's all, since all cards are now laid down.

So the order is: 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, the problem is to find the k-th card in this sequence for given n and k.

Given that n can be up to 10^9 and t (number of test cases) can be up to 5*10^4, we need an efficient way to compute this without simulating the entire process for large n.

Let's try to find a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the position of the k-th card.

First observation: The cards are grouped by their "level", where level i consists of cards that are 2^{i-1} times an odd number.

For example:

- Level 1: 1*2^{0}=1, 3*2^{0}=3, 5*2^{0}=5, 7*2^{0}=7

- Level 2: 1*2^{1}=2, 3*2^{1}=6

- Level 3: 1*2^{2}=4

And so on.

Each level corresponds to multiplying odd numbers by increasing powers of 2.

So, to find the k-th card, we need to iterate through these levels, determining how many cards are in each level, and find out in which level the k-th card lies.

Let's formalize this.

Letâ€™s define:

- Let m be the number of odd numbers up to n. m = (n + 1) // 2

- The first m cards are the odd numbers.

- Then, the next m//2 cards are the numbers that are 2 times an odd number.

- Then, the next m//4 cards are the numbers that are 4 times an odd number.

- And so on, until we have covered all n cards.

Wait, but in the example with n=7:

- m = 4 (1,3,5,7)

- m//2 = 2 (2,6)

- m//4 = 1 (4)

- Total: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, which matches.

So, in general, the number of cards at each level is m // (2^{i-1}), where i starts from 1.

But we need to make sure that the cards do not exceed n.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar, but I need to verify.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 0

i = 0

d = n

h = n

p = 1

g = 0

if k > (n + 1) // 2:

while s < k and d > 0:

s += (d + 1) // 2

d -= (d + 1) // 2

i += 1

while p <= i - 1:

g += (h + 1) // 2

h -= (h + 1) // 2

p += 1

f = k - g

y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)

print(y)

else:

print(2 * k - 1)

So, it seems to handle two cases:

1. If k <= (n + 1)//2, it directly prints 2*k - 1, which are the odd numbers.

2. If k > (n + 1)//2, it enters the loop to calculate the k-th card in the subsequent levels.

Let's see if this makes sense.

In the first case, when k <= m (m = (n + 1)//2), it's within the first group of odd numbers, so it's just the k-th odd number, which is 2*k - 1. That seems correct.

In the second case, when k > m, we need to find the (k - m)-th card in the remaining cards, which are the cards that are 2 times an odd number, then 4 times an odd number, and so on.

The code seems to be trying to find in which level the k-th card lies and then compute its value.

Let's see how it does that.

It initializes s = 0, i = 0, d = n, h = n, p = 1, g = 0.

Then, if k > m, it enters the while loop:

while s < k and d > 0:

s += (d + 1) // 2

d -= (d + 1) // 2

i += 1

This loop seems to be accumulating the number of cards in each level until s >= k.

Each level adds (d + 1) // 2 cards, where d is decreasing by (d + 1) // 2 in each iteration.

This seems to be correctly calculating the number of cards in each level.

Then, it has another loop:

while p <= i - 1:

g += (h + 1) // 2

h -= (h + 1) // 2

p += 1

This loop seems to be calculating the total number of cards in the levels before the current level.

Finally, f = k - g, which is the position within the current level.

Then, y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1), which seems to be computing the value of the f-th card in the i-th level.

Let's verify this with an example.

Take n=7, k=5.

m = (7 + 1)//2 = 4.

Since k=5 > 4, enter the loop.

Initialize s=0, i=0, d=7, h=7, p=1, g=0.

First loop iteration:

s += (7 + 1)//2 = 4, s=4

d -= 4, d=3

i=1

4 < 5, so continue.

Second iteration:

s += (3 + 1)//2 = 2, s=6

d -= 2, d=1

i=2

6 >= 5, stop.

Then, p <= i - 1 => p <= 1.

while p <= 1:

g += (7 + 1)//2 = 4

h -= 4, h=3

p=2

Now, g=4.

f = k - g = 5 - 4 = 1

y = 2 ** (2 - 1) * (2 * 1 - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2

Which matches the example, since the 5th card is 2.

Another example: n=7, k=6.

m=4, k=6 > 4.

s=0, i=0, d=7, h=7, p=1, g=0

First iteration:

s += 4, s=4

d -= 4, d=3

i=1

4 < 6, continue.

Second iteration:

s += 2, s=6

d -= 2, d=1

i=2

6 >=6, stop.

Then, p <= 1:

g += 4

h -=4, h=3

p=2

f = 6 - 4 = 2

y = 2 **1 * (2*2 -1) = 2 * 3 = 6

Which matches the example, as the 6th card is 6.

One more: n=7, k=7.

m=4, k=7 >4.

s=0, i=0, d=7, h=7, p=1, g=0

First iteration:

s +=4, s=4

d -=4, d=3

i=1

4 <7, continue.

Second iteration:

s +=2, s=6

d -=2, d=1

i=2

6 <7, continue.

Third iteration:

s +=1, s=7

d -=1, d=0

i=3

7 >=7, stop.

Then, p <=2:

First iteration:

g +=4

h -=4, h=3

p=2

Second iteration:

g +=3//2=1

h -=1, h=2

p=3

So g=4+1=5

f =7-5=2

y=2**(3-1)*(2*2 -1)=4*3=12, but n=7, so this seems incorrect.

Wait, in the example, the 7th card is 4.

But according to this, y=12, which is greater than n=7.

So, perhaps there's an error here.

Wait, perhaps we need to ensure that y <=n.

But in the code, there's no such check.

Wait, in the example with n=7, k=7, the output should be 4, but according to this, y=12, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let's recalculate.

s=0, i=0, d=7, h=7, p=1, g=0

First iteration:

s += (7 +1)//2 =4, s=4

d -=4, d=3

i=1

4 <7, continue.

Second iteration:

s += (3 +1)//2=2, s=6

d -=2, d=1

i=2

6 <7, continue.

Third iteration:

s += (1 +1)//2=1, s=7

d -=1, d=0

i=3

7 >=7, stop.

Then, p <=2:

First iteration:

g += (7 +1)//2=4

h -=4, h=3

p=2

Second iteration:

g += (3 +1)//2=2

h -=2, h=1

p=3

So g=4+2=6

f =7-6=1

y=2**(3-1)*(2*1 -1)=4*1=4

Which matches the example, as the 7th card is 4.

So, it seems correct in this case. I must have miscalculated earlier.

Let's look at another example.

Take n=1, k=1.

m=(1+1)//2=1

k=1 <=1, so print 2*1 -1=1, which is correct.

Another example: n=34, k=14.

m=(34+1)//2=17

k=14 <=17, so print 2*14 -1=27, but according to the output, it's 27, which seems correct.

Wait, but according to the note, for n=7, k=7, it's 4, which matches.

For n=1, k=1, it's 1.

For n=34, k=14, it's 27.

Wait, but according to the code, if k <= m, print 2*k -1, else do the calculation.

But in the example, for n=7, k=5, it's 2, which is correct, as per the calculation.

Seems like the code is working correctly.

Another way to think about it is to consider the levels as multiples of powers of 2 times odd numbers.

Each level corresponds to a power of 2.

The first level is 2^0 times odd numbers, which are the odd numbers themselves.

The second level is 2^1 times odd numbers.

The third level is 2^2 times odd numbers.

And so on.

Each level has half as many elements as the previous level, approximately.

In the code, it's accumulating the number of cards in each level until it reaches or exceeds k.

Then, it calculates how many cards are in the previous levels and subtracts that from k to find the position within the current level.

Finally, it computes the value of the card at that position in the level.

This seems to be a correct approach.

Given that, and the examples matching, I can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{see explanation for the program}} \]

**Correctness: True**
