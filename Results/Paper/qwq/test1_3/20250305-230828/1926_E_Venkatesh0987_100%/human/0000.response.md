Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The rules are:

1. First, lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest.

3. Then, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

And I need to find out what the k-th card is in this sequence.

Okay, let's try to understand this with the example given. For n=7 and k from 1 to 7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4. Let's see why:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice an odd number: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

- Three times an odd number: none, since 3*1=3 is already in the odd numbers, and 3*3=9 is greater than 7.

- Four times an odd number: 4 (which is 4*1)

- And so on.

So, the sequence is first all odds, then all numbers that are twice an odd number, then all numbers that are three times an odd number, and so forth, until all cards are laid down.

Now, the problem is to find the k-th card in this sequence for given n and k, and I have to handle multiple test cases, with n and k up to 1e9.

First, I need to find a way to generate or identify the position of the k-th card without necessarily generating the entire sequence, because n can be up to 1e9, which is too large to handle in that way.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the k-th card.

Let's think about how the numbers are grouped:

- Group 1: numbers that are 1 times an odd number: 1,3,5,7,...

- Group 2: numbers that are 2 times an odd number: 2,6,10,14,...

- Group 3: numbers that are 3 times an odd number: 3,9,15,21,...

- Group 4: numbers that are 4 times an odd number: 4,12,20,28,...

- And so on.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says "all cards that are twice an odd number", "all cards that are three times an odd number", etc. So, it seems like each group is defined by multiples of odd numbers.

But looking closer, group 1 is odd numbers, group 2 is twice odd numbers, group 3 is three times odd numbers, etc.

So, in general, group m consists of numbers that are m times an odd number, where m starts from 1.

Now, the way the cards are laid down is by first group 1, then group 2, then group 3, and so on.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to go through these groups in order until I reach the k-th card.

But with n up to 1e9 and t up to 5e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to find out how many cards are in each group.

For group m, the numbers are m * (2 * t + 1), where t is 0,1,2,3,... and m*(2*t + 1) <= n.

So, for each m, the number of cards in group m is floor((n / m + 1) / 2).

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that each number can be expressed as m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of the number.

For example:

- 1: 1*1

- 2: 1*2 (but 2 is even, so perhaps not)

Wait, actually, every number can be expressed as m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of the number, and m is a power of 2.

But in this problem, it seems that m can be any positive integer, not just powers of 2.

Wait, no, in the problem, it's about m times an odd number, where m starts from 1.

So, for m=1, o=odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,...

For m=2, o=odd numbers: 2*1=2, 2*3=6, 2*5=10,...

For m=3, o=odd numbers: 3*1=3, 3*3=9, 3*5=15,...

And so on.

But in this grouping, some numbers may appear in multiple groups.

Wait, but the problem says "once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again."

So, each number should appear only once in the sequence.

Therefore, there must be a unique way to express each number as m * o, where o is an odd number, and m is a positive integer.

Wait, actually, m can be any positive integer, and o is an odd positive integer.

But in that case, each number has a unique representation because any integer can be expressed as m * o, where m is the largest power of 2 dividing the number, and o is the odd part.

Wait, but in this problem, m is not necessarily a power of 2.

Wait, but in the grouping, it seems that m is the "level" or "group number", and o is always an odd number.

So, group 1: m=1, o=1,3,5,7,...

Group 2: m=2, o=1,3,5,7,...

Group 3: m=3, o=1,3,5,7,...

And so on.

So, in general, group m consists of numbers m*(2*t +1) for t=0,1,2,...

Now, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through these groups in order, accumulating the counts, until I reach the group that contains the k-th card, and then find the exact number in that group.

Given that n and k can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let's try to find a pattern or formula.

First, for a given m, the numbers in group m are m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., up to the largest odd o such that m*o <= n.

The number of elements in group m is the number of odd o where m*o <= n, which is floor((n / m + 1) / 2).

Wait, let's verify this.

For example, with n=7 and m=1:

floor((7/1 +1)/2) = floor(8/2) = 4, which matches 1,3,5,7.

For m=2:

floor((7/2 +1)/2) = floor(4.5 +1)/2 = floor(5.5/2) = floor(2.75) = 2, which matches 2,6.

For m=3:

floor((7/3 +1)/2) = floor(2.333 +1)/2 = floor(3.333/2) = floor(1.666) =1, but in the earlier explanation, for m=3, there are no cards because 3 is already in group 1. Wait, there is confusion here.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Each number has a unique representation as m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of the number, and m is the highest power of 2 that divides the number.

But in this problem, it seems that m is just any positive integer, not necessarily a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the highest odd divisor.

Let me define for each number x, o is the largest odd divisor of x, and m = x / o.

Then, x is placed in group m.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through m from 1 upwards, and for each m, count how many numbers have that m, i.e., how many x in 1 to n have their largest odd divisor o such that x = m * o.

Which is the same as counting the number of odd o where m * o <= n.

Which is floor((n / m + 1) / 2), as I thought earlier.

But in the example with n=7, for m=3, floor((7/3 +1)/2) =1, but in reality, for m=3, x=3 and x=9, but n=7, so only x=3 is allowed, but 3 is already in group 1, so it shouldn't be counted again.

Wait, that's the confusion. Each number is only placed once, in the first group it qualifies for, which is group m where m is the smallest integer such that m * o =x.

Wait, perhaps m should be the smallest integer such that m * o =x, where o is odd.

Wait, no, in the problem, it's grouped by m in increasing order, and within each m, the numbers are ordered by their value.

But to avoid counting numbers multiple times, I need to ensure that for each x, it's only counted in one group, specifically the group where m is the highest possible power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, no, the problem seems to be grouping by m in sequence, and for each m, taking all x that are m times an odd number, without considering if they have been taken before.

But the problem says "once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again."

So, perhaps, for each m, we take the x that are m times an odd number, but only if they haven't been taken in a previous group.

So, in the first group (m=1), we take all odd numbers.

In the second group (m=2), we take all even numbers that are twice an odd number, but only those that haven't been taken in m=1.

Similarly, for m=3, we take numbers that are three times an odd number, but only if they haven't been taken in previous groups.

And so on.

Wait, but in the example with n=7, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, group 1: 1,3,5,7

Group 2: 2,6

Group 3: none

Group 4:4

So, in this case, for m=3, there is x=3, but 3 is already in group 1, so it's not taken again.

Similarly, x=9 is greater than n=7.

So, for m=2, x=2 and x=6 are taken.

For m=4, x=4 is taken.

So, the general rule is that for each m, in order, take the numbers that are m times an odd number, but only if they haven't been taken in previous groups.

So, to implement this efficiently, I need a way to iterate through m from 1 upwards, for each m, find how many numbers are in group m (i.e., m times an odd number, not already taken in previous groups), and keep a cumulative count until I reach or surpass k.

Then, in the group where the cumulative count surpasses k, I need to find the (k - previous cumulative count)-th number in that group.

Given that n and k can be up to 1e9, and t up to 5e4, I need an efficient way to do this, probably in O(1) or O(log n) per test case.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula.

First, for a given m, the numbers in group m are m * o, where o is odd and m * o <=n.

But, only those m * o where m is the smallest possible m for that x.

Wait, no, in the problem, it's grouped by m in order, and within each m, the numbers are ordered by their value.

But to avoid recounting numbers, I need to ensure that for each x, it's only assigned to the smallest possible m where m * o =x, o is odd.

So, for x, m is the smallest m such that x is m times an odd number.

But m is the smallest m where m divides x and x/m is odd.

Wait, m should be the largest power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, no, in the problem, m can be any positive integer, not necessarily a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps m is the largest odd divisor of x.

Wait, no, m is defined as the multiple, so m is such that x = m * o, where o is odd.

So, m is x / o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x.

So, m is the highest power of 2 that divides x.

Wait, yes, in mathematics, every integer x can be uniquely expressed as x = m * o, where m is a power of 2 and o is odd.

So, m is the highest power of 2 that divides x.

So, in the problem, the groups are ordered by m, starting from m=1 (which is 2^0), then m=2 (2^1), m=3 (which is odd, but in this context, m can be any positive integer), wait, but according to the mathematical decomposition, m should be a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider m as the power of 2 part of x.

So, for x, let m be the highest power of 2 that divides x, and o be the odd part.

Then, the group m corresponds to m=1 (o is odd), m=2 (2*o, o odd), m=4 (4*o, o odd), etc.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's m=1 (o odd), m=2 (2*o odd), m=3 (3*o odd), m=4 (4*o odd), etc., not necessarily m being a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is grouping by m, where m is the largest power of 2 that divides x.

But in the example, for m=3, it's not considered, which doesn't align with m being powers of 2.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the groups are ordered by m in increasing order, and for each m, take the numbers that are m times an odd number, excluding those that have already been taken in previous groups.

So, to implement this, perhaps I can iterate m from 1 to n, in increasing order, and for each m, count how many numbers x = m * o, where o is odd, and x <=n, and o is not divisible by any smaller m's.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the sequence of m's, and for each m, determine the count of numbers in that group.

Then, to find the k-th number, I can accumulate these counts until I reach or surpass k.

Once I find the group m where the cumulative count surpasses k, I can then find the (k - previous cumulative count)-th number in that group.

The challenge is to compute the count for each group efficiently.

Given that n and k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the count for group m in O(1) time, or at least in a way that allows me to find the correct m for k in logarithmic time.

Let me try to compute the count for group m.

For a given m, the count of numbers x = m * o, where o is odd and x <=n, and o is not divisible by any smaller m's.

Wait, but in the problem, it's laid down in order of m increasing, and within each m, the numbers are in increasing order.

Also, once a number is laid down, it's not used again.

So, for m=1, we take all odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,...

For m=2, we take all numbers that are 2 times an odd number, but only those not already taken in m=1.

Similarly, for m=3, 3 times an odd number, excluding those already taken in m=1 and m=2.

And so on.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the largest m for which x = m * o, o odd.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find a better way.

An alternative approach is to realize that each number x has a unique factorization into m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x, and m is the highest power of 2 that divides x.

But in the problem, it seems that m can be any positive integer, not just powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider m as the smallest integer such that x = m * o, o odd.

But that would be m = x / o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x.

Wait, perhaps m should be the largest m such that x = m * o, o odd.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Let me try to look at the binary representation or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate m from 1 to n, and for each m, compute the number of x = m * o, o odd, o >=1, x <=n.

But I need to ensure that for each x, it's only counted in the smallest possible m.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate m from 1 to n, and for each m, compute the number of o such that o is odd, m * o <=n, and o is not divisible by any smaller m's.

But this seems too slow for n up to 1e9.

Wait, maybe I can find a way to compute the cumulative count up to m, and then perform a binary search over m to find the minimal m where the cumulative count >=k.

Then, within that m, find the (k - previous cumulative count)-th number in that group.

This seems promising.

So, first, I need a way to compute, for a given m, the number of x that are m times an odd number, and haven't been taken in previous groups.

But, to make it efficient, perhaps I can find a formula for the cumulative count up to m.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be used, but that might be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the numbers are divided into disjoint groups based on m, and the count for each m is floor((n / m +1)/2).

Wait, let's verify this with n=7.

For m=1: floor((7/1 +1)/2) = floor(8/2)=4 (1,3,5,7)

For m=2: floor((7/2 +1)/2)=floor(4.5 +1)/2=floor(5.5/2)=floor(2.75)=2 (2,6)

For m=3: floor((7/3 +1)/2)=floor(2.333 +1)/2=floor(3.333/2)=floor(1.666)=1 (3, but 3 is already in m=1)

For m=4: floor((7/4 +1)/2)=floor(1.75 +1)/2=floor(2.75/2)=floor(1.375)=1 (4)

For m=5: floor((7/5 +1)/2)=floor(1.4 +1)/2=floor(2.4/2)=floor(1.2)=1 (5, but 5 is already in m=1)

And so on.

But in reality, for m=3 and m=5, the numbers are already taken in m=1, so their counts should be zero.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to account for numbers already taken in previous groups.

So, for each m, the count should be floor((n / m +1)/2), but subtract the counts of numbers that have already been taken in smaller m's.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total count up to m by summing floor((n / i +1)/2) for i from 1 to m, but adjusting for overlaps.

But this seems too slow for n and m up to 1e9.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate m in multiples of 2, since m corresponds to powers of 2 in the factorization.

Wait, but in the problem, m can be any positive integer, not just powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each x, its position is determined by the value of m = x / o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x.

So, m is x divided by its largest odd divisor, which is equal to the highest power of 2 that divides x.

So, m is 2^k, where k is the exponent of 2 in x.

So, m is a power of 2.

Wait, but in the problem, m can be any positive integer, not just powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, m is intended to be any positive integer, not just powers of 2, but in reality, for x to be m times an odd number, m must be a power of 2 for the groups to be non-overlapping.

Wait, but in the example, for n=7, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, group 1: 1,3,5,7 (m=1)

Group 2: 2,6 (m=2)

Group 4:4 (m=4)

There is no m=3 because 3 is already in group 1.

Similarly, m=3 is skipped because there are no numbers in n=7 that are 3 times an odd number and not already taken.

Wait, x=3*1=3 is already in group 1, x=3*3=9 >7, so no numbers for m=3.

Similarly, m=5: x=5*1=5 is already in group 1, m=6: x=6*1=6 is already in group 2, and so on.

So, in this case, only m=1,2,4 are used.

So, perhaps m should only be powers of 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, m can be any positive integer.

But in practice, to avoid overlapping groups, m should be powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider m as powers of 2.

Let me check the sequence again.

Group 1 (m=1): 1,3,5,7

Group 2 (m=2): 2,6

Group 4 (m=4):4

So, m=1,2,4, which are powers of 2.

Similarly, for n=8, it would be:

Group 1:1,3,5,7

Group 2:2,6

Group 4:4

Group 8:8

So, m=1,2,4,8.

So, perhaps m is powers of 2, and within each m, x = m * o, where o is odd and x <=n.

So, in this case, m iterates over powers of 2.

That makes sense, because each number x can be uniquely expressed as x = m * o, where m is the highest power of 2 dividing x, and o is odd.

So, in this problem, m is indeed a power of 2, and the groups are ordered by increasing m.

So, m=1 (2^0), m=2 (2^1), m=4 (2^2), m=8 (2^3), and so on.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through m=1,2,4,8,... and for each m, count how many x = m * o, where o is odd and x <=n.

And then find in which m the k-th card lies.

Given that, I can compute the count for each m as floor((n / m +1)/2).

Wait, for m=1: floor((7/1 +1)/2)=4 (1,3,5,7)

m=2: floor((7/2 +1)/2)=floor(4.5 +1)/2=floor(5.5/2)=floor(2.75)=2 (2,6)

m=4: floor((7/4 +1)/2)=floor(1.75 +1)/2=floor(2.75/2)=floor(1.375)=1 (4)

m=8: floor((7/8 +1)/2)=floor(0.875 +1)/2=floor(1.875/2)=floor(0.9375)=0

So, total cards:

Group 1:4

Group 2:2

Group 4:1

Group 8:0

Total:7, which matches n=7.

So, the formula floor((n / m +1)/2) gives the correct count for each m.

So, in general, for m=2^p, p=0,1,2,3,..., the count is floor((n / m +1)/2).

So, to find the k-th card, I can iterate p from 0 upwards, computing m=2^p, and the count for that m, and keep a cumulative sum until the cumulative sum >=k.

Then, in that group, find the (k - previous cumulative sum)-th number.

Given that m is a power of 2,
