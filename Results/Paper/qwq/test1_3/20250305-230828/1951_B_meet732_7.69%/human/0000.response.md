Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the first two cows, and then the winner keeps competing with the next cow in line. The higher-rated cow always wins. I own one of these cows, cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins it gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position just once.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. It's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one. But in this case, it's not a standard bracket; it's more like a chain where the winner of the previous match plays the next cow in line.

Let me think about the initial setup. The cows are in positions 1 to n, and I need to consider swapping my cow k with another position to maximize its wins.

I should consider where my cow is positioned and who it has to beat to keep winning. Since higher-rated cows always win, I need to make sure that my cow faces weaker opponents as much as possible, or at least delay facing stronger cows.

Let me consider the example given in the problem:

First test case:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

If I don't swap, the matches would be:

- Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10) → cow 1 wins

- Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14) → cow 3 wins

So, cow 1 wins only once.

In the explanation, it says that doing nothing is optimal, resulting in 1 win.

Second test case:

n = 6, k = 5

ratings = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

If I swap cow 5 (12) with cow 3 (727), then:

New order: [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

- Match 1: cow 1 (7) vs cow 2 (2) → cow 1 wins

- Match 2: cow 1 (7) vs cow 3 (12) → cow 3 wins

- Match 3: cow 3 (12) vs cow 4 (10) → cow 3 wins

- Match 4: cow 3 (12) vs cow 5 (727) → cow 5 wins

So, cow 3 (which is my cow after swap) wins 2 matches.

Third test case:

n = 2, k = 2

ratings = [1000000000, 1]

If I don't swap, matches are:

- Match 1: cow 1 (1000000000) vs cow 2 (1) → cow 1 wins

So, cow 2 wins 0 matches.

Even if I swap, since cow 2 is weaker, it would still lose to cow 1.

So, maximum wins are 0.

From these examples, I can see that swapping can potentially increase the number of wins for my cow, but I need to choose the right position to swap to.

Now, I need to find a general strategy to determine the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve, either by swapping with another position or by staying in its original position.

Let me think about the tournament structure. It's a sequence of matches where the winner of the previous match plays the next cow in line.

So, the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2.

Then, the winner of match 1 plays cow 3 in match 2.

Then, the winner of match 2 plays cow 4 in match 3.

And so on, until all cows have been included in the matches.

Each time, my cow can win a match as long as it has a higher rating than the opponent.

But since other cows have unique ratings, and higher-rated cows always win, the key is to position my cow in a way that it faces weaker opponents as much as possible.

I need to consider where to place my cow to maximize the number of wins before it loses to a stronger cow.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position i, then it will have to win all the matches against the cows before it, i.e., cows from position 1 to i-1, and then continue winning as long as it keeps beating the next cows.

Wait, no. The tournament structure is such that the winner of the previous match plays the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position i, then it will play against the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match i-2, and so on.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe I should think recursively or iteratively simulate the tournament based on positions.

But that might not be efficient, especially since n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4, with the total sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^5.

So, I need an O(n) solution per test case, or at least O(n) in total over all test cases.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I don't swap my cow; what is the number of wins it would achieve?

Then, consider the option of swapping my cow with another position and see if that increases the number of wins.

I need to find the best possible position to swap my cow to, to maximize its wins.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider swapping my cow with a specific cow and see the impact on the number of wins.

Wait, but I can swap with any position, not necessarily with a specific cow.

Wait, actually, in the problem, it says I can swap the position of my cow with another cow only once, or choose to do nothing.

So, I can choose to swap my cow with any other position, meaning I can place my cow anywhere in the sequence.

I need to choose the position for my cow that maximizes the number of wins.

So, I need to choose a position i for my cow, and then simulate the tournament to see how many wins it gets.

Then, select the position i that gives the maximum number of wins.

But simulating the tournament for each possible position would be too slow, since n can be up to 10^5.

So, I need a smarter way to calculate the number of wins for my cow in any position without simulating the entire tournament.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where each match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

So, it's like a single eliminiation tournament where the winner progresses to the next round.

In this structure, the number of wins a cow can achieve depends on how many cows with lower ratings it can consecutively defeat.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, my cow can keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the next cow it faces.

So, if I place my cow at position i, it will face the winner of the previous match (which is the winner of match i-2, since match i-1 is between the winner of match i-2 and cow i).

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I should think in terms of the path my cow takes through the tournament.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of intervals or something.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that my cow needs to be placed in a position where all the previous cows have lower ratings than it, so it can win all those matches, and then see how far it can go against the subsequent cows.

But I need a better structure to model this.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the cows are being matched in a specific order, and the winner progresses.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of cows my cow can defeat before losing to a stronger cow.

I think I need to find the longest sequence of cows before my cow's position that have lower ratings than my cow, and also consider the cows after its position that it can defeat.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if I place my cow at position i, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it that it can defeat, plus one (for defeating the previous winner), until it loses.

This is still unclear.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that, given a position i, calculates how many wins my cow would achieve if placed at position i.

But again, this might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the tournament in terms of a tournament tree, but given the specific matching order, it's not a standard tournament tree.

Let me consider the initial position.

If I don't swap, my cow is at position k.

I can simulate the tournament to see how many wins it gets.

Similarly, if I swap with position i, my cow is at position i, and I can simulate the tournament again.

But again, simulating for each possible i is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner is the cow with the highest rating, since higher-rated cows always win.

But winning the tournament is not my goal; I just want my cow to win as many matches as possible.

So, even if my cow doesn't win the entire tournament, it can still win multiple matches before losing.

I need to maximize that number.

Let me consider that my cow can keep winning as long as it keeps facing cows with lower ratings.

So, if I place my cow somewhere, it will keep winning against the cows that come after it, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, no. Because the tournament structure is such that it's not just about the cows after it, but also about the winner of previous matches.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for patterns or properties that can help me calculate the number of wins without simulating each match.

Let me consider that in the tournament, each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position i, then it will first play against the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match i-2.

But I need to find a way to calculate how many wins it can achieve from position i.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it, and the number that are after it.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the two cows that have higher ratings than my cow.

Because my cow can keep winning until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I can find the positions of the two cows with higher ratings than my cow, then I can determine the interval in which placing my cow would allow it to win a certain number of matches.

Wait, that seems promising.

Let me consider that there are other cows with higher ratings than my cow.

My cow will lose as soon as it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I can place my cow between two cows with higher ratings, then it can win all the matches against the cows between those two higher-rated cows.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the two cows with higher ratings than my cow, one on each side, and place my cow between them to maximize the number of wins.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me sort the cows based on their ratings and find the positions of the cows with higher ratings than my cow.

Given that all ratings are unique, there are exactly (number of cows with higher ratings) that can defeat my cow.

So, if I can place my cow such that it faces the weakest possible opponents first, it can win more matches before facing a stronger cow.

Wait, perhaps I should find the two cows with higher ratings than my cow, and place my cow in a position where it can win all the matches against the cows between those two higher-rated cows.

Wait, maybe I should look at the positions of the cows with higher ratings than my cow.

Let me denote:

- My cow has rating x.

- There are m cows with ratings higher than x.

- Let's say their positions are p1, p2, ..., pm, sorted in increasing order.

Now, if I place my cow between p1 and p2, or between p2 and p3, etc., I can determine how many wins it would get in each interval.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider that my cow can win all the matches against the cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings, plus the number of cows after it with lower ratings that it can defeat before facing a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the nearest higher-rated cow to the left and to the right.

Yes, that sounds promising.

Let me think in terms of the nearest higher-rated cow to the left and to the right of position i.

If I place my cow at position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows between the nearest higher-rated cow to the left and the nearest higher-rated cow to the right, minus one (since one position is occupied by my cow).

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

Define, for each position i:

- Left[i]: the position of the nearest cow to the left of i with a higher rating than my cow.

- Right[i]: the position of the nearest cow to the right of i with a higher rating than my cow.

Then, if I place my cow at position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to (i - Left[i] - 1) + (Right[i] - i - 1).

Wait, no.

Actually, it's more about the number of cows it can defeat before facing a higher-rated cow.

So, if I place my cow at position i, it will first play against the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match i-2.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider the tournament in terms of a binary tree, where each match is a node, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say at position j.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner w1

- Match 2: w1 vs cow 3 → winner w2

- ...

- Match j-1: w_{j-2} vs cow j-1 → winner w_{j-1}

- Match j: w_{j-1} vs cow j (my cow) → winner wj

- ...

And so on.

I need to track how many matches my cow wins.

But this seems too involved to do for every possible j.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that my cow can keep winning as long as it keeps facing cows with lower ratings.

So, if I place my cow at position i, it will keep winning against the cows from position i-1 (the winner of match i-2), provided that its rating is higher.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum number of consecutive cows with lower ratings before and after my cow's position.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the examples to see if I can find a pattern.

First test case:

n=6, k=1

ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

If not swapping, cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10) → wins, then vs cow 3 (14) → loses. So, 1 win.

If swapping cow 1 with cow 3:

ratings=[14,10,12,11,8,3]

Match 1: 14 vs 10 → 14 wins

Match 2: 14 vs 12 → 14 wins

Match 3: 14 vs 11 → 14 wins

Match 4: 14 vs 8 → 14 wins

Match 5: 14 vs 3 → 14 wins

So, cow 3 (original rating 14) wins 5 matches.

But in the explanation, they swapped cow 5 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 727), which seems different.

Wait, in the first test case, k=1, and in the second, k=5.

I need to make sure I understand which cow is being considered.

Wait, in the first test case, k=1, which is cow 1 with rating 12.

In the second test case, k=5, which is cow 5 with rating 12.

In the second test case, they swapped cow 5 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 727), resulting in [7,2,12,10,727,13].

Then, the matches are:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 12 wins

Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 727 wins

Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 wins

So, cow 3 (now with rating 12) wins 2 matches.

Wait, but in this case, cow 3 wins 2 matches, but in the explanation, it says cow 5 (original rating 12) wins 2 matches.

Wait, no, in the swap, cow 5 and cow 3 are swapped, so cow 5 is now at position 3 with rating 12, and cow 3 is at position 5 with rating 727.

Wait, no, in the explanation, it says:

"In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3."

So, swapping cow 5 to position 3, meaning cow 5 (rating 12) is now at position 3, and whatever was at position 3 (rating 727) is now at position 5.

So, the array becomes [7,2,12,10,727,13].

Then, the matches are:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 12 wins

Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 727 wins

Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 wins

So, cow 5 (now at position 3 with rating 12) wins 2 matches.

Similarly, in the first test case, k=1, and swapping doesn't help, so it's better to not swap.

In the third test case, n=2, k=2, ratings=[1000000000,1].

If I don't swap, cow 1 (1000000000) vs cow 2 (1) → cow 1 wins.

So, cow 2 wins 0 matches.

If I swap cow 2 with cow 1, then cow 2 is at position 1 with rating 1, and cow 1 is at position 2 with rating 1000000000.

Then, match 1: cow 1 (1) vs cow 2 (1000000000) → cow 2 wins.

So, cow 2 wins 1 match.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the input, it's:

3

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

6 5

7 2 727 10 12 13

2 2

1000000000 1

And the output is:

1

2

0

So, in the third test case, output is 0.

But according to my reasoning above, if I swap cow 2 with cow 1, cow 2 (rating 1) vs cow 1 (rating 1000000000) → cow 2 loses.

Wait, no, cow 2 (rating 1) vs cow 1 (rating 1000000000) → cow 1 wins.

So, cow 2 wins 0 matches.

If I don't swap, cow 1 vs cow 2 → cow 1 wins, so cow 2 wins 0 matches.

So, either way, cow 2 wins 0 matches.

Hence, the output is 0.

Ok, that makes sense.

So, in this case, swapping doesn't help.

Back to the general problem.

I need to find the best position to place my cow to maximize its wins.

I need to find a way to calculate, for each possible position, how many wins my cow would achieve if placed there.

But since n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, with total n across all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it (in the tournament sequence) that have lower ratings than it.

Because it will keep winning against those cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, it's not just about the cows before it; it's about the winner of previous matches.

This is tricky.

Let me try to model the tournament.

Let's say we have cows in positions 1 to n.

Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner w1

Match 2: w1 vs cow 3 → winner w2

...

Match i: w_{i-1} vs cow {i+1} → winner w_i

...

Until all cows have been included.

So, if my cow is at position j, then it will play against w_{j-1}, which is the winner of match j-1.

If my cow's rating is higher than w_{j-1}, it wins and becomes w_j, and proceeds to play against cow j+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of consecutive cows after it (including itself) that it can defeat.

Wait, no.

Actually, it's more about how many consecutive cows before it (up to j-1) it can defeat, considering the winner of the previous matches.

This is getting too tangled.

Maybe I need to consider that the winner of the tournament is the cow with the highest rating, and my cow can win matches up to the point it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings, plus the number of cows after it with lower ratings, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of consecutive cows with lower ratings that my cow can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position i, I need to look at the cows from position 1 to i-1 and see how many of them have lower ratings than my cow.

Similarly, look at the cows from position i+1 to n and see how many of them have lower ratings than my cow, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, it's not just about the cows before or after; it's about the winner of the previous matches.

This is still confusing.

Let me try to think in terms of the two nearest cows with higher ratings, one to the left and one to the right.

Define, for each position i:

- Left[i]: the position of the nearest cow to the left of i with a higher rating than my cow.

- Right[i]: the position of the nearest cow to the right of i with a higher rating than my cow.

Then, if I place my cow at position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to (i - Left[i] - 1) + (Right[i] - i - 1), but only if Left[i] < i < Right[i].

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows between Left[i] and Right[i], excluding the positions of the higher-rated cows.

But I'm not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say at position j.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before j that have lower ratings than my cow, plus the number of cows after j that have lower ratings than my cow, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, my cow at position j will first play against the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match j-2.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that I don't have a clear approach yet and look for hints or consider discussing with peers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence, plus the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it in the sequence, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate for each position, the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings to the right.

Similarly, calculate the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings to the left.

Then, for each position, if I place my cow there, the number of wins would be the sum of the left and right lower-rated cows.

But I need to consider that in the tournament structure, it's not just about the number of lower-rated cows around it; it's about the sequence of matches.

This is still not accurate.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position i, it will first play against the winner of match i-2.

So, I need to know who that winner is.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position, who the winner would be if the tournament started from that position.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too involved.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence.

Because it will keep winning against those cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But in reality, it's not just about the cows before it; it's about the winner of the previous matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are to the left of it, plus one for each win.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say at position j.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence up to j-1, plus the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate for each position j, the number of cows with lower ratings to the left, and the number of cows with lower ratings to the right, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Then, the total wins would be the sum of these two.

This seems plausible.

So, for each position j, define:

- Left[j]: number of cows with lower ratings to the left of j, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

- Right[j]: number of cows with lower ratings to the right of j, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

Then, the number of wins if I place my cow at position j is Left[j] + Right[j].

I need to maximize this over all possible j.

So, I need to compute Left[j] and Right[j] for all j, considering only the cows with ratings higher than my cow.

Wait, more precisely:

- For each position j, find the number of consecutive cows to the left with lower ratings than my cow, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

- Similarly, find the number of consecutive cows to the right with lower ratings than my cow, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

Then, the total wins at position j would be Left[j] + Right[j].

So, for each position j, I need to calculate:

- Left[j]: number of cows to the left of j with lower ratings than my cow, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

- Right[j]: number of cows to the right of j with lower ratings than my cow, up to the nearest cow with a higher rating.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum over all j of (Left[j] + Right[j]).

This seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but with the total sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

So, for each test case, I can iterate through the list and compute Left[j] and Right[j] for each j.

But I need to do this efficiently.

I can use a stack to compute the nearest higher-rated cow to the left and to the right for each position.

First, for Left[j]:

- For each position j, find the nearest position i < j where a[i] > my cow's rating x.

- Then, Left[j] = j - i - 1.

Similarly, for Right[j]:

- Find the nearest position k > j where a[k] > x.

- Then, Right[j] = k - j - 1.

Then, the total wins at position j would be Left[j] + Right[j].

I need to find the maximum over all j of (Left[j] + Right[j]).

Additionally, I need to consider that if I place my cow at position j, the actual number of wins would be the number of cows before j that have lower ratings than my cow, up to the nearest higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust Left[j] to be the number of cows before j with lower ratings, not just the distance to the nearest higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me compute for each position j:

- Left[j]: number of consecutive cows to the left of j with lower ratings than my cow.

- Right[j]: number of consecutive cows to the right of j with lower ratings than my cow, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Then, the total wins at position j would be Left[j] + Right[j].

To compute Left[j]:

- For each j, count the number of consecutive cows to the left that have lower ratings than x.

Similarly, for Right[j]:

- For each j, count the number of consecutive cows to the right that have lower ratings than x, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

This can be done using a stack to keep track of the nearest higher-rated cow to the left and to the right.

First, find the nearest higher-rated cow to the left for each position.

Similarly, find the nearest higher-rated cow to the right for each position.

Then, for each position j, compute Left[j] = j - L[j] - 1, where L[j] is the position of the nearest higher-rated cow to the left.

Similarly, Right[j] = R[j] - j - 1, where R[j] is the position of the nearest higher-rated cow to the right.

Then, the total wins at position j would be Left[j] + Right[j].

Finally, the answer would be the maximum over all j of (Left[j] + Right[j]).

Wait, but in reality, it's not just about the distance; it's about the number of cows with lower ratings.

So, I need to ensure that the cows between L[j] and j have lower ratings than x.

Similarly, the cows between j and R[j] have lower ratings than x.

Given that, Left[j] should be the number of cows between L[j] and j with lower ratings than x.

But since we're only considering cows with lower ratings than x, I need to make sure that all cows between L[j] and j have lower ratings than x.

Wait, actually, since L[j] is the nearest higher-rated cow to the left, all cows between L[j] and j have lower ratings than x.

Similarly, all cows between j and R[j] have lower ratings than x.

So, Left[j] = j - L[j] - 1

Right[j] = R[j] - j - 1

Then, total wins at position j is Left[j] + Right[j]

So, the maximum over all j of (Left[j] + Right[j]) is the answer.

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=6, k=1, ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

my cow has rating x=12

Find nearest higher-rated cow to the left:

For j=0 (cow 12), no higher-rated cow to the left, so L[0]=-1

For j=1 (cow 10), higher-rated cow to the left is cow 12 at position 0, so L[1]=0

For j=2 (cow 14), higher-rated cow to the left is cow 12 at position 0, so L[2]=0

For j=3 (cow 11), higher-rated cow to the left is cow 12 at position 0, so L[3]=0

For j=4 (cow 8), higher-rated cow to the left is cow 12 at position 0, so L[4]=0

For j=5 (cow 3), higher-rated cow to the left is cow 12 at position 0, so L[5]=0

Then, Left[j] = j - L[j] -1

So, Left[0] = 0 - (-1) -1 = 0

Left[1] =1 -0 -1=0

Left[2]=2-0-1=1

Left[3]=3-0-1=2

Left[4]=4-0-1=3

Left[5]=5-0-1=4

Similarly, find nearest higher-rated cow to the right:

For j=0 (cow 12), higher-rated cow to the right is cow 14 at position 2, so R[0]=2

For j=1 (cow 10), higher-rated cow to the right is cow 14 at position 2, so R[1]=2

For j=2 (cow 14), no higher-rated cow to the right, so R[2]=6 (or n=6)

For j=3 (cow 11), higher-rated cow to the right is cow 14 at position 2, but wait, cow 14 is to the left of cow 11. However, since we're looking for higher-rated cows to the right, and cow 14 is to the left, perhaps R[3]=6, since there are no higher-rated cows to the right.

Wait, but cow 14 is at position 2, which is to the left of position 3, so R[3]=6

Similarly, R[4]=6

R[5]=6

Then, Right[j] = R[j] - j -1

So, Right[0]=2-0-1=1

Right[1]=2-1-1=0

Right[2]=6-2-1=3

Right[3]=6-3-1=2

Right[4]=6-4-1=1

Right[5]=6-5-1=0

Then, total wins at each position j:

j=0: 0 +1=1

j=1:0+0=0

j=2:1+3=4

j=3:2+2=4

j=4:3+1=4

j=5:4+0=4

So, the maximum is 4.

But in the first test case, the answer is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case, if I place my cow at position 0, it wins 1 match (against cow 1), then loses to cow 2.

So, wins=1.

If I place my cow at position 1, it wins 0 matches (loses to cow 0).

If I place my cow at position 2, it wins against cow 0 and cow 1, then loses to cow 3.

So, wins=2.

Wait, but according to my calculation, total wins at position 2 is Left[2]+Right[2]=1+3=4, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of wins is not simply Left[j] + Right[j], but something else.

Let me think again.

If I place my cow at position j, it will first play against the winner of match j-2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cows before j that have lower ratings than my cow, which would be Left[j].

Then, in the tournament, it would have to defeat those cows to reach position j.

Wait, but the tournament structure is such that the winner of match j-2 plays against cow j.

So, if my cow is at position j, it will play against the winner of match j-2.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to ensure that the winner of match j-2 has a lower rating than my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a position j where all the cows before j that are in the path to j have lower ratings than my cow.

This is getting too complicated.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the length of the longest sequence of cows before it that it can defeat, plus the length of the longest sequence of cows after it that it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, for each position j, it's the number of consecutive cows to the left with lower ratings, plus the number of consecutive cows to the right with lower ratings, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

This seems similar to what I had before.

But in the first test case, according to this, placing my cow at position 2 would give Left[2]=1 (cow 1 with rating 10) + Right[2]=3 (cows 3,4,5 with ratings 11,8,3), total 4, but in reality, it would win 2 matches.

So, my calculation is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate Left[j] and Right[j].

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in the tournament structure, my cow can only win against the cows that are in its path, considering the winner of previous matches.

This is too involved.

Let me consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence.

So, if I place my cow at position j, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before j with lower ratings than x.

But in reality, it's more complicated due to the tournament structure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are to the left of it, plus the number of cows with lower ratings to the right, but only if those cows are not separated by a higher-rated cow.

This is still not precise.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function wins(j):

- If j ==0, wins(j) = 0 (no cows before)

- Else:

- If a[j] > winner of match j-2:

- wins(j) = 1 + wins(j-1)

- Else:

- wins(j) = 0

Wait, this seems incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow at position j is equal to the number of cows before j that have lower ratings than x, plus the number of cows after j that have lower ratings than x, but only if those cows are in the path of my cow.

But again, the tournament structure makes it complex.

I need to accept that my initial approach is flawed and look for a different way.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than x that are before it in the sequence.

Because it has to defeat those cows in order to proceed in the tournament.

Additionally, it can keep winning against the cows after it, as long as they have lower ratings than x.

So, perhaps the total wins is equal to the number of cows before j with lower ratings than x, plus the number of cows after j with lower ratings than x, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Wait, this sounds familiar.

So, perhaps I can calculate for each position j:

- Left[j]: number of cows before j with lower ratings than x.

- Right[j]: number of consecutive cows after j with lower ratings than x, up to the first cow with a higher rating.

Then, the total wins at position j is Left[j] + Right[j].

Then, the answer is the maximum over all j of (Left[j] + Right[j]).

In the first test case:

n=6, k=1, x=12

a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Compute Left[j]:

For j=0: Left[0]=0 (no cows before)

j=1: a[0]=12 > x=12? No, a[0]=12 == x=12, but since all ratings are distinct, this can't happen. So, a[0] < x? No, a[0]=12 >= x=12. Wait, but x=12, so a[0]=12 is not lower than x.

So, Left[1]=0

j=2: a[0]=12 >= x=12, a[1]=10 < x=12 → Left[2]=1

j=3: a[0]=12 >= x=12, a[1]=10 < x=12, a[2]=14 >= x=12 → Left[3]=1

j=4: a[0]=12 >= x=12, a[1]=10 < x=12, a[2]=14 >= x=12, a[3]=11 < x=12 → Left[4]=1

j=5: a[0]=12 >= x=12, a[1]=10 < x=12, a[2]=14 >= x=12, a[3]=11 < x=12, a[4]=8 < x=12 → Left[5]=3

Compute Right[j]:

For j=0: find number of consecutive cows after j=0 with a[i] < x=12, up to first a[i] >= x=12.

a[1]=10 <12, a[2]=14 >=12 → Right[0]=1

j=1: a[2]=14 >=12 → Right[1]=0

j=2: a[3]=11 <12, a[4]=8 <12, a
