Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a "diagonal" in this grid. In a square grid, diagonals can be either main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) or anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left). For an n x n grid, there are a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. I think this includes both main and anti-diagonals.

Let me try to visualize this. For a 3x3 grid:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

The main diagonals would be:

- [1]

- [2,5]

- [3]

- [4,5]

- [7,8,9]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, in a 3x3 grid, there are diagonals like:

- Main diagonals: from top-left to bottom-right.

- Anti-diagonals: from top-right to bottom-left.

So for main diagonals:

- Diagonal with just cell (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2) and (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (3,3)

Wait, no. Actually, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonals are:

- From (1,1) to (3,3): cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- From (1,2) to (3,2): but that's not a diagonal, that's a column.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.

In an n x n grid, the number of diagonals is 4n - 2. This includes both main and anti-diagonals.

Actually, in a square grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1, but some of them overlap in the center. So total unique diagonals would be 4n - 2.

But perhaps in this problem, they are considering both main and anti-diagonals separately.

Wait, maybe I should look at the example provided.

In the first test case, n=3 and k=4, and the answer is 2. In the third test case, n=3 and k=10, answer is 6.

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals are 4*3 - 2 = 10. So, for k=10, he needs to cover all diagonals.

In the first test case, k=4, and he can do it with 2 cells.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to minimize the number of colored cells, so I need to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each cell.

Each cell can be part of multiple diagonals. For example, the center cell in a 3x3 grid is part of four diagonals: two main and two anti-diagonals.

So, to cover the maximum number of diagonals with minimal cells, I should choose cells that are part of the most diagonals.

In general, cells on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are part of more diagonals.

Wait, actually, cells on the main diagonal are part of both a main diagonal and an anti-diagonal.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

For a cell at position (i,j), it is part of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, unless it's on the main or anti-diagonal, in which case it's part of multiple diagonals.

Wait, no. Each cell is part of exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, but in the context of this problem, maybe diagonals are defined differently.

Looking back at the problem, it says "Note that the square grid of size n x n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals."

So, presumably, there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, making 4n - 2 in total.

But actually, in a square grid, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 2, including both main and anti-diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider covering these diagonals separately.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how many diagonals pass through each cell, and choose cells that cover the most uncovered diagonals.

But that seems too time-consuming for large n, as n can be up to 10^8.

Given that n can be up to 10^8, and t up to 1000, the solution needs to be very efficient, probably O(1) per test case.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=4, it prints 2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, it prints 5, but in the example, it's 6. Wait, maybe I need to verify this.

Wait, in the example, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6, but according to this code, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but in the example, it's 6. So perhaps this code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=10, which is all diagonals, and the output is 6, but according to this code, it would be 5. So maybe the code is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an n x n grid, and I need to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest colored cells.

Each cell covers exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, no. Each cell is part of exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

But in the context of this problem, maybe diagonals are defined differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers all possible diagonals, not just the main and anti-diagonals.

In a grid, a diagonal can be any line of cells that are adjacent and form a 45-degree angle.

So, for an n x n grid, the number of such diagonals is 4n - 2.

I need to cover at least k of these diagonals with the fewest colored cells.

I need to find the minimal number of cells that cover at least k diagonals.

This seems like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but given the large constraints, there must be a smarter way.

Perhaps there's a formula based on n and k.

Looking back at the code, it seems to have a formula based on n and k.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, it outputs 5, but the expected output is 6. So perhaps it's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to derive the correct formula.

First, understand how many diagonals there are in total: 4n - 2.

Then, each cell covers a certain number of diagonals.

But since each cell is part of exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), except for cells on the main or anti-diagonal, which are part of multiple diagonals.

Wait, actually, every cell is part of exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, no. In a grid, each cell is part of exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell covers two diagonals.

But the main diagonal cells are part of both main and anti-diagonals, but in general, each cell is part of two diagonals.

So, if I color a cell, I cover two diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the example, for k=10 and n=3, ceil(10/2)=5, but the expected output is 6.

So, that suggests that some diagonals are overlapping in such a way that coloring a cell only covers one new diagonal.

Wait, perhaps not all diagonals are independent.

In other words, some diagonals share cells, so coloring a cell might only cover one new diagonal if it's already part of a covered diagonal.

This complicates things.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by each cell.

But given the time constraints, there must be a simpler formula.

Looking back at the code, it has a condition:

if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

Wait, for n=3 and k=10:

2 * (3 + (3 - 2)) = 2*(3+1)=8.

Since k=10 > 8, it would go to the else clause and print(10//2 +1)=6.

Which matches the example output of 6.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3 and k=4:

4 <= 8, so ceil(4/2)=2, which matches the example output of 2.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9:

9 <=8? No, so print(9//2 +1)=5, which matches the example output of 5.

For n=4 and k=7:

2*(4 + (4-2))=2*(4+2)=12.

7<=12, so ceil(7/2)=4, which matches the example output of 4.

For n=7 and k=11:

2*(7 + (7-2))=2*(7+5)=24.

11<=24, so ceil(11/2)=6, matches the example output of 6.

For n=2 and k=3:

2*(2 + (2-2))=2*(2+0)=4.

3<=4, so ceil(3/2)=2, matches the example output of 2.

So, based on the examples, the code seems correct.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought that for k=10 and n=3, it should be ceil(10/2)=5, but according to the code and the example, it's 6.

Wait, but according to the code, for k=10 and n=3:

k=10 > 2*(3 + (3-2))=8, so print(10//2 +1)=6, which matches the example.

So, perhaps the formula is:

if k <= 2*(n + (n - 2)):

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = floor(k / 2) + 1

But in the code, it's written as k // 2 +1, which in Python, for integers, is floor division.

So, it's min_cells = floor(k / 2) +1 if k > 2*(n + n -2)), else ceil(k / 2)

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, it's 6, which is floor(10/2)+1=6.

For n=3 and k=9, it's floor(9/2)+1=5.

For n=4 and k=7, ceil(7/2)=4.

Wait, but in the code, it's written as math.ceil(k / 2), but in Python, for integers, k / 2 is float, and math.ceil() rounds up to the next integer.

Similarly, k // 2 is floor division.

So, the code is:

if k <= 2*(n + n -2):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 +1)

But in the example, for n=3 and k=4:

2*(3 +1)=8, 4<=8, so ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10:

10>8, so 10//2 +1=6.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9:

9>8, so 9//2 +1=5.

For n=4 and k=7:

2*(4 +2)=12, 7<=12, so ceil(7/2)=4.

For n=7 and k=11:

2*(7 +5)=24, 11<=24, so ceil(11/2)=6.

For n=2 and k=3:

2*(2 +0)=4, 3<=4, so ceil(3/2)=2.

So, it seems consistent with the examples.

But why is the threshold 2*(n + n -2)?

I need to understand the logic behind this formula.

Perhaps, for some values of n, the way diagonals overlap changes, and this formula accounts for that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me consider that each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

So, in the optimal case, each colored cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, you'd need ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in some cases, you might need to cover more because some diagonals only add one new diagonal when a cell is colored.

I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is based on the number of diagonals that must be covered beyond a certain point, requiring an extra cell.

But I'm not sure about the exact logic.

Given that the code matches the example outputs, it seems correct.

Therefore, I'll conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
