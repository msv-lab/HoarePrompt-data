Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output:

2

So, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I have to choose two numbers, take the smaller one, and that's my score. So, if I pick 2 and 3, min(2,3)=2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

Output:

2

Here, n=2, so I have to perform two moves. I need to pair the numbers in a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

One way to pair them is (1,1) and (2,1). For the first pair, min(1,1)=1, and for the second pair, min(2,1)=1, total score=2.

Is there a better way? Let's see. Another pairing could be (1,2) and (1,1). Then, min(1,2)=1 and min(1,1)=1, total score still 2.

So, in this case, no matter how I pair them, I get the same score. But I need to confirm if there's a way to get a higher score.

Looking at the note, it says that 2 is the maximum achievable score for this test case.

Alright, now another test case:

Input:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

3

Here, n=3, so I have to perform three moves. Pairing them as (1,1), (1,1), and (1,1), each time min is 1, so total score is 3.

Since all numbers are the same, this makes sense.

From these examples, it seems that to maximize the score, I should pair the smallest numbers together.

Wait a minute, in the second test case, pairing (1,1) and (2,1) gives score 2, which is the same as pairing (1,2) and (1,1). But according to the note, 2 is the maximum possible.

Is there a better way? Let's think differently. Suppose I pair (1,2) and (1,1). Score is 1 + 1 = 2.

Alternatively, if I pair (1,1) and (1,2). Still, min(1,1)=1 and min(1,2)=1, total 2.

So, no, 2 is indeed the maximum.

Another thought: maybe sorting the array and pairing the smallest numbers together maximizes the score.

Wait, in the second test case, sorted array is [1,1,1,2].

If I pair them as (1,1) and (1,2), score is 1 + 1 = 2.

Is there any other way? If I pair (1,1) and (1,2), still 2.

Alternatively, if I pair (1,2) and (1,1), again 2.

Seems like 2 is the best possible.

Another perspective: I need to maximize the sum of mins of pairs.

This sounds similar to some pairing strategies in programming problems.

Let me consider sorting the array in non-decreasing order.

So, for n pairs, I can pair the smallest numbers together.

Wait, but in the second test case, that's what happened, and it gave the maximum score.

In the third test case, all numbers are 1, so pairing any way gives the same score.

Another test case: suppose n=2, and array is [1,2,3,4].

Sorted array: [1,2,3,4].

If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), score is 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternatively, pair (1,3) and (2,4), score is 1 + 2 = 3.

Or pair (1,4) and (2,3), score is 1 + 2 = 3.

So, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives the highest score of 4.

So, in this case, pairing the smallest numbers together gives a higher score.

Another test case: n=3, array [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Sorted array: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Pairing (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), score 1+3+5=9.

Alternatively, pairing (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), score 1+2+5=8.

Or pairing (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), score 1+2+3=6.

So, again, pairing the smallest numbers together gives the highest score.

This seems consistent.

So, the strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the smallest numbers together.

Wait, but in the second test case, pairing the smallest numbers together gives the maximum score.

Similarly, in other test cases, it does.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, consider that for any two pairs (a,b) and (c,d), if a <= b and c <= d, then min(a,b) + min(c,d) is maximized when a and c are as large as possible.

Wait, but in sorting, we are pairing the smallest with the next smallest, which might not seem intuitive.

Wait, in the sorted array, pairing the first two, then the next two, and so on, gives the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., elements.

Wait, in zero-indexed terms, it's sum of a[0], a[2], ..., a[2n-2].

Is this always optimal?

From the examples above, it seems to be.

Let me try to think of a counterexample where this strategy doesn't give the maximum score.

Suppose n=2, array [1,1,2,3].

Sorted array: [1,1,2,3].

Pairing (1,1) and (2,3), score is 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (1,3), score is 1 + 1 = 2.

So, pairing the smallest together gives a higher score.

Another example: n=3, array [1,2,2,3,3,4].

Sorted array: [1,2,2,3,3,4].

Pairing (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), score 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Alternatively, pairing (1,3), (2,2), (3,4), score 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Or pairing (1,2), (3,4), (2,3), score 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

So, in this case, the sorted pairing gives the maximum.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the smallest numbers together, i.e., the first two, then the next two, and so on, summing up the first, third, fifth, etc., elements.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

score = 0

for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):

score += l[i]

print(score)

This seems to implement exactly the strategy I just thought of.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads 2n integers, sorts them, and then sums up every second element starting from the first.

Which, as per my reasoning, should give the maximum score.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
