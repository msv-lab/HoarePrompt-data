Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square made up of '1's. I need to figure out which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (where k > 1), and each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, where i is the row number.

- The central '1's are aligned in one column, meaning it's a centered triangle.

- It can be upside down, but not rotated by 90 degrees, so it's still symmetric along a vertical axis.

So, for example, if k=3, the triangle would look like:

Row 1: 1 '1'

Row 2: 3 '1's

Row 3: 5 '1's

Or upside down:

Row 1: 5 '1's

Row 2: 3 '1's

Row 3: 1 '1'

And for a square:

- It's k rows (k > 1), each with k '1's, and they are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

- So, the square is aligned to the left edge, with each row having the same number of '1's starting from the same column.

Given that, I need to look at the grid and determine if the '1's form a square or a triangle.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

k = []

for _ in range(int(input())):

b = input()

if '1' in b:

k.append(b.count('1'))

if k[0] == k[1]:

print('SQUARE')

else:

print('TRIANGLE')

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, then n lines of the grid.

It only considers rows that contain '1's and counts the number of '1's in those rows, storing them in list k.

Then, it checks if the first two elements of k are equal:

- If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'

- If not, it prints 'TRIANGLE'

Wait a minute, is this sufficient?

Let me think about the properties of the shapes.

For a square:

- All rows of the square have the same number of '1's (k).

- These rows are consecutive.

- They are aligned on the left edge, meaning the '1's start from the same column in each row.

For a triangle:

- The number of '1's increases or decreases by 2 each row, depending on whether it's upright or upside down.

- The central '1's are aligned in one column.

Given that, in the program, it's assuming that if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, it's a square, else, it's a triangle.

Is this always true?

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

Input:

3

000

011

011

Output:

SQUARE

In this case, the '1's form a 2x2 square starting from the second column.

Rows with '1's:

Row 2: '011' -> 2 '1's

Row 3: '011' -> 2 '1's

So, k = [2, 2]

Since k[0] == k[1], it's a square. Correct.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0000

0000

0100

1110

Output:

TRIANGLE

Here, the '1's form a triangle:

Row 3: '0100' -> 1 '1'

Row 4: '1110' -> 3 '1's

So, k = [1, 3]

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle. Correct.

Example 3:

Input:

2

11

11

Output:

SQUARE

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: '11' -> 2 '1's

Row 2: '11' -> 2 '1's

k = [2, 2]

It's a square. Correct.

Example 4:

Input:

5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: '00111' -> 3 '1's

Row 2: '00010' -> 1 '1'

k = [3, 1]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle. Correct.

Example 5:

Input:

10

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

1111111110

0111111100

0011111000

0001110000

0000100000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Rows with '1's:

Row 6: '1111111110' -> 9 '1's

Row 7: '0111111100' -> 7 '1's

Row 8: '0011111000' -> 5 '1's

Row 9: '0001110000' -> 3 '1's

Row 10: '0000100000' -> 1 '1'

k = [9,7,5,3,1]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle. Correct.

Example 6:

Input:

3

111

111

111

Output:

SQUARE

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: '111' -> 3 '1's

Row 2: '111' -> 3 '1's

Row 3: '111' -> 1 '1's

k = [3,3,3]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square. Correct.

Wait, but in this case, it's a square of size 3x3.

Yes, correct.

But let's consider a case where the first two rows have the same number of '1's, but subsequent rows have different counts.

For example:

Input:

4

0000

0110

0110

0110

Output:

SQUARE

Because the '1's form a square:

Row 2: '0110' -> 2 '1's

Row 3: '0110' -> 2 '1's

Row 4: '0110' -> 2 '1's

k = [2,2,2]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square.

Another example:

Input:

3

000

011

111

Output:

TRIANGLE

Rows with '1's:

Row 2: '011' -> 2 '1's

Row 3: '111' -> 3 '1's

k = [2,3]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

But according to the problem, it should be a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid.

Also, the size is greater than 1.

Given that, the program seems to be relying on the fact that for a square, all rows of the shape have the same number of '1's, while for a triangle, the number of '1's changes in a specific pattern.

But in the program, it only checks the first two rows with '1's.

Is this sufficient?

In the examples provided, it seems to work.

But let's think about a potential edge case.

Suppose we have:

Input:

3

110

110

110

Output:

SQUARE

Because it's a 3x2 square.

Wait, but according to the problem, the grid is n x n, and the square is k x k, with k > 1.

In this case, n=3, and the square is 3x2, but wait, squares are supposed to be k x k, square shapes.

Wait, but in this input, it's 3 rows with 2 '1's each, starting from the first column.

Wait, but according to the problem, squares are k consecutive rows, each with k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

Wait, in this case, k=2, but n=3.

Wait, but in the problem, squares are k '1's in each row, starting from the same column.

In this case, it's 3 rows with 2 '1's each, starting from column 1.

So, it's a rectangle, but according to the problem, squares are k '1's per row, in k consecutive rows, starting from the same column.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1', which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid."

So, in this case, each row has 2 '1's starting from column 1, which is aligned to the left edge.

So, according to the problem, this should be considered a square.

Hence, the program would correctly identify it as a square since k[0] == k[1] == 2.

Another potential edge case:

Input:

2

11

10

Output:

TRIANGLE

Because k=2, row 1: 2 '1's, row 2: 1 '1'

So, k = [2,1]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

Which makes sense, as it could be an upside-down triangle.

Another case:

Input:

3

011

010

010

Output:

TRIANGLE

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: '011' -> 2 '1's

Row 2: '010' -> 1 '1'

Row 3: '010' -> 1 '1'

k = [2,1,1]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

Which is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, the shape must be either a triangle or a square, and it's guaranteed that there's exactly one shape consisting of all '1's.

So, in this case, it's a triangle with k=2.

Wait, but in this grid:

Row 1: '011' -> positions 2 and 3

Row 2: '010' -> position 2

Row 3: '010' -> position 2

This looks like an upside-down triangle with k=2.

Yes, it matches the triangle definition.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it as a triangle.

Another potential edge case:

Input:

4

0000

0000

0000

0000

But this should not happen, because it's guaranteed that there is at least one '1' in the grid, since the shape size is greater than 1.

Wait, the problem says "the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'", but it's guaranteed that there is at least one shape with more than one '1'.

So, empty grids shouldn't be present.

Another case:

Input:

3

111

111

111

Output:

SQUARE

Because it's a 3x3 square.

k = [3,3,3]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square.

Correct.

Another case:

Input:

4

0110

0110

0110

0110

Output:

SQUARE

k = [2,2,2,2]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square.

Correct.

Another case:

Input:

4

0000

0110

1110

1110

Output:

TRIANGLE

k = [2,3,3]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

But wait, is this a triangle or a square?

Rows with '1's:

Row 2: '0110' -> 2 '1's

Row 3: '1110' -> 3 '1's

Row 4: '1110' -> 3 '1's

This seems like a triangle with k=3, rows 3 and 4 have 3 '1's, and row 2 has 2 '1's.

But according to the program, since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle.

Which seems correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, the shape must consist of all '1's in the grid.

So, in this case, is it a valid triangle?

Looking back at the problem, it says the triangle is k consecutive rows with 2*i -1 '1's, or upside down.

But in this case, rows 3 and 4 have 3 '1's, and row 2 has 2 '1's.

Does this form a valid triangle?

If it's an upside-down triangle with k=3, rows would have 3, then 2, then 1 '1's.

But here, rows 3 and 4 both have 3 '1's, which doesn't match the triangle pattern.

Wait, perhaps this is not a valid triangle.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the size is greater than 1.

So, in this case, perhaps it's neither, but according to the guarantee, it must be one or the other.

Wait, but in the program, it only checks the first two rows with '1's.

If k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle, else it's a square.

In this case, k=[2,3,3], k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

But is this always correct?

Wait, maybe not.

Let's consider another case.

Input:

3

110

110

110

Output:

SQUARE

k = [2,2,2]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square.

Which is correct.

Another case:

Input:

4

0000

0000

1111

1111

Output:

SQUARE

k = [4,4]

k[0] == k[1], so it's a square.

Correct.

Another case:

Input:

4

0000

0000

1110

1100

Output:

TRIANGLE

k = [3,2]

k[0] != k[1], so it's a triangle.

Which seems correct, as it could be an upside-down triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, triangles are k consecutive rows with 2*i -1 '1's, centered in one column.

In this case, rows 3 and 4 have 3 and 2 '1's respectively, which doesn't match the triangle pattern.

Wait, maybe it's not a valid triangle.

But according to the problem guarantee, it should be one or the other.

Wait, perhaps I need to trust the problem's guarantee that it's either one triangle or one square, and the program is designed based on that.

So, perhaps the program is relying on the guarantee that if k[0] == k[1], it's a square, else it's a triangle.

Given that, and looking at all the examples provided, it seems to work.

Hence, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

## Explanation

- **Reading Input:**
  - We first read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the grid size `n` and the grid rows.

- **Collecting '1's Counts:**
  - We iterate through each row of the grid and count the number of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1'. These counts are stored in the list `k`.

- **Determining Shape:**
  - We check if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal:
    - If equal, it indicates a square, so we print "SQUARE".
    - If not equal, it indicates a triangle, so we print "TRI
