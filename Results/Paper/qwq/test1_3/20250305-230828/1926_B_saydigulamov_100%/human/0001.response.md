Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square drawn with '1's. I need to determine which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (where k > 1), and each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, where i is the row number.

- The central '1's are aligned in one column, meaning it's a centered triangle.

- It can be upside down, but not rotated by 90 degrees, so it's still symmetric along a vertical axis.

For a square:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), and each row has k '1's.

- These '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge, meaning it's aligned to the left or right, but probably left based on the examples.

Given that the grid is square, n by n, and n can be from 2 to 10, it's manageable in terms of size.

The input consists of multiple test cases, up to 100, each with a grid size n and then n lines of n characters, each being '0' or '1'.

The output should be "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case, indicating which shape is drawn.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to try to solve this by counting the number of '1's in each row that contains '1's and then comparing the counts.

Let me analyze the function step by step.

1. `a = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

- It initializes an empty list `k`.

- It reads `n`, the size of the grid.

- It then reads `n` lines, each representing a row of the grid.

- For each row, if it contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

- After processing all rows, it checks if the first two rows that contain '1's have the same number of '1's.

- If they do, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, "TRIANGLE".

Wait a minute, this seems too simplistic. Just comparing the first two rows' '1' counts to decide between square and triangle might not be sufficient.

Let me think about the properties of the shapes:

For a square:

- Every row in the shape has exactly k '1's, and these are aligned in the same columns.

- The number of rows is equal to the number of '1's per row (k).

For a triangle:

- The number of '1's increases or decreases by 2 each row, depending on whether it's upright or upside down.

- The total number of rows can vary, but for k rows, the first row has 1 '1', the second has 3 '1's, and so on, up to the k-th row having 2*k - 1 '1's.

Given that, in a square, all rows have the same number of '1's, whereas in a triangle, the number of '1's per row changes.

So, if I find that all rows have the same number of '1's, it's likely a square.

But, in the provided code, it only checks the first two rows that contain '1's. If they have the same number of '1's, it concludes it's a square; otherwise, a triangle.

This might work in some cases but not all.

Consider a square:

- All rows have the same number of '1's.

- So, if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, it's probably a square.

But, consider a triangle:

- In an upright triangle, the number of '1's increases by 2 each row.

- In an upside-down triangle, it decreases by 2 each row.

So, in a triangle, the number of '1's in consecutive rows differs by 2.

Therefore, if the first two rows have different counts, it might be a triangle.

But, what if the square has only two rows, and both have the same number of '1's?

- It would correctly identify it as a square.

What if the triangle has only two rows, with counts 1 and 3?

- The first two rows have different counts, so it would identify it as a triangle.

Seems okay for small k.

But consider a square with more than two rows, say k=3:

- All three rows have 3 '1's.

- So, first two rows have the same count, correctly identifying it as a square.

Similarly, a triangle with k=3:

- Rows have 1, 3, 5 '1's.

- First two rows have 1 and 3, which are different, so it identifies it as a triangle.

Seems correct.

But wait, what if there's a square with k=2:

- Both rows have 2 '1's.

- So, first two rows have the same count, correctly "SQUARE".

And a triangle with k=2:

- Rows have 1 and 3 '1's.

- First two rows have different counts, correctly "TRIANGLE".

Seems fine.

But let's think about irregular shapes.

The problem says that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and that shape contains all the '1's in the grid.

Also, the shape size is greater than 1.

Given that, I can assume that the '1's form a perfect square or triangle, without any extra '1's elsewhere.

But, what if the triangle is not aligned properly?

Wait, the problem says that for a triangle, the central '1's are aligned in one column, so it's symmetric around a vertical axis.

Similarly, the square is aligned to the left or right, but probably left based on the description.

Given that, perhaps just checking the first two rows' '1' counts is enough.

But, I'm still a bit skeptical.

Let me consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=2, square with k=2.

Grid:

11

11

This should be a square.

The code would see two rows with 2 '1's each, so "SQUARE".

Edge case 2: n=2, triangle with k=2.

Grid:

01

11

This should be a triangle.

The code would see two rows with 1 and 2 '1's, so different, "TRIANGLE".

Seems correct.

Edge case 3: n=3, square with k=3.

111

111

111

All rows have 3 '1's, so "SQUARE".

Edge case 4: n=3, triangle with k=3.

001

011

111

Rows have 1, 2, 3 '1's, so first two rows have 1 and 2, different, "TRIANGLE".

Correct.

Another consideration: empty rows.

If the shape is a small square in a larger grid, there might be empty rows.

But the code only considers rows that contain '1's, so it should be fine.

Also, the problem guarantees that there is exactly one shape (either square or triangle) and it includes all '1's, with size greater than 1.

So, no need to worry about multiple shapes or single '1's.

Given that, the code seems to work correctly for the examples provided in the problem.

Looking back at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Reads n lines, but only considers rows with at least one '1'.

- Counts the number of '1's in those rows and stores in list k.

- If the first two elements of k are equal, it's a square; else, a triangle.

This seems to capture the difference between squares and triangles, as squares have uniform '1' counts per row, while triangles have varying counts.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
