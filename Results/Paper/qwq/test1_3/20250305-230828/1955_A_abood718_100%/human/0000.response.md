Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of burles Maxim needs to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which tells me how many scenarios I need to handle. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the regular price per yogurt, and b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

My task is to output the minimum cost for each test case, one per line.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9. Buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 9 burles, which is less than buying them individually for 10 burles (5 each). Hence, the minimum cost is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9. If I buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and one individual yogurt (5), the total is 14 burles. There's no better option, so 14 is the minimum.

Third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11. Here, buying two yogurts with the promotion costs 11, and one individually costs 5, totaling 16. But apparently, it's better to buy three yogurts in a different way, costing 15 burles. Wait, but the promotion is only for two yogurts, so how can buying three yogurts cost 15? Maybe buying one promotion (2 yogurts for 11) and one individual yogurt (5) totals 16, but the output is 15. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the interpretation.

Wait, the note says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." So, it seems there's an implicit assumption that buying three yogurts can be done in a way that's cheaper than the sum of individual and promotional prices. But according to the problem statement, the only promotions available are buying two yogurts for b burles, and individual yogurts at a burles each. There's no mention of a promotion for three yogurts, so perhaps the output is based on combining individual and promotional purchases.

Wait, but in the third test case, buying two yogurts with the promotion (11 burles) and one individually (5 burles) would total 16 burles, but the output is 15. So, maybe in some cases, it's better to not use the promotion. Let's check.

If a=5 and b=11, then buying two yogurts with the promotion costs 11, which is more than buying them individually (10 burles). So, in this case, it's better to buy them individually unless there's a better combo.

Wait, but for n=3, buying three individually would cost 15 burles (5*3=15), which is less than buying two with promotion (11) and one individually (5), which totals 16. So, indeed, it's better to buy all three individually, costing 15 burles, which matches the output.

Ah, I see. So, sometimes, even if there's a promotion for two yogurts, it's better to buy them individually if the promotion price is higher than buying them separately.

Similarly, for the fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11. Buying two promotions would cost 22 burles (11*2), but buying four individually would cost 20 burles (5*4=20), which is less. But the output is 20, which suggests that buying all yogurts individually is cheaper than using the promotion.

Wait, but in the note, it says "In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for 5 burles." So, total cost is 20 burles, which is less than buying two promotions (22 burles).

Therefore, the strategy should be to compare the cost of buying yogurts using promotions versus buying them individually and choose the cheaper option.

Let me try to generalize this.

First, I need to consider how many pairs of yogurts I can buy using the promotion. Since each promotion allows buying two yogurts for b burles, for n yogurts, I can buy floor(n/2) promotions and then buy the remaining yogurts individually.

But, I also need to consider whether buying yogurts individually is cheaper than using the promotion.

So, for each pair of yogurts, I can choose to buy them using the promotion for b burles or buy them individually for 2*a burles. I should choose the cheaper option for each pair.

If b < 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy the pair using the promotion.

If b >= 2*a, then it's better to buy them individually.

But, if n is odd, there will be one yogurt left to buy individually.

So, the total cost would be:

- For even n:

- If b < 2*a, total cost is (n/2) * b

- Else, total cost is n * a

- For odd n:

- If b < 2*a, total cost is (floor(n/2) * b) + a

- Else, total cost is n * a

Wait, but in the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11:

- floor(3/2) = 1 promotion (11 burles) + 1 individual (5 burles) = 16 burles

- Or, buy all three individually: 3*5=15 burles

So, in this case, buying all individually is cheaper than using one promotion and buying one individually.

Hence, my previous strategy needs adjustment.

I need to consider that even if b < 2*a, it might still be cheaper to buy individually.

Wait, no, if b < 2*a, then for each pair, it's cheaper to buy using the promotion.

But, if n is odd, I have to buy one individually.

So, in the third test case, b=11 and 2*a=10, so 11 > 10, meaning it's cheaper to buy individually.

Hence, in this case, I should buy all yogurts individually, totaling 15 burles, which matches the output.

So, to generalize:

- If b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion, and buy the remaining yogurt(s) individually.

- If b >= 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11:

- b=11, 2*a=10, so b > 2*a, so buy all individually: 4*5=20 burles.

- But using two promotions would cost 22 burles, which is more.

Hence, the strategy is:

- If b < 2*a, prefer promotions for pairs, and buy remaining individually.

- If b >= 2*a, buy all individually.

But, in the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11:

- b=11, 2*a=10, so b > 2*a, so buy all individually: 15 burles.

- Using one promotion and one individual: 11+5=16, which is more.

Hence, the general formula is:

- If b < 2*a:

- Total cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

- Else:

- Total cost = n * a

This seems to match all the test cases.

Let me verify with the first test case:

n=2, a=5, b=9

- b < 2*a (9 < 10), so total cost = (2//2)*9 + 0*a = 9, which matches the output.

Second test case:

n=3, a=5, b=9

- b < 2*a (9 < 10), so total cost = (3//2)*9 + (3%2)*5 = 1*9 + 1*5 = 14, matches the output.

Third test case:

n=3, a=5, b=11

- b >= 2*a (11 >= 10), so total cost = 3*5 = 15, matches the output.

Fourth test case:

n=4, a=5, b=11

- b >= 2*a (11 >= 10), so total cost = 4*5 = 20, matches the output.

Great, this seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

Wait, the variable names are A, B, C, which correspond to n, a, b in the problem statement.

So, in the code:

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

Comparing this with my derived formula:

- If b < 2*a, total cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

- Else, total cost = n * a

Wait, the code does:

- If B * 2 < C: print(A * B)

- Else if A % 2 == 0: print(int(A * C / 2))

- Else: X = A // 2; print(X * C + B)

So, in the first condition, it's checking if b < 2*a, and if so, it prints A * B, which is n * a, meaning buying all individually.

Wait, but according to my formula, if b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible using promotion and remaining individually.

But in the code, it's just printing A * B, which is buying all individually.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, no, in my earlier reasoning, when b < 2*a, it's better to buy pairs using promotion and remaining individually.

But in the code, it's doing the opposite: if b * 2 < C, then buy all individually.

Wait, no, the condition is if B * 2 < C, which is if 2*a < b, then print A * B, which is n * a.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I had if b < 2*a, then buy pairs using promotion.

Wait, there's a confusion in variable names.

In the problem statement:

n is the number of yogurts, a is the price per yogurt, b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

In the code:

A corresponds to n, B to a, C to b.

So, the condition is if B * 2 < C, which is if 2*a < b, then buy all individually (A * B).

Else, if A is even, buy all using promotions (A * C / 2).

Else, buy floor(A / 2) promotions and one individually (X * C + B).

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, if b < 2*a, buy as many pairs as possible using promotion and remaining individually.

But in the code, it's if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Wait, there's an inequality sign difference.

Wait, in the code, it's if B * 2 < C, which is if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Else, if A is even, buy all using promotions (A * C / 2), which is (A / 2) * b.

Else, buy (A // 2) promotions and one individual yogurt (X * C + B), which is (A // 2)*b + a.

So, in the code:

- If 2*a < b, buy all individually.

- Else, if n is even, buy all using promotions.

- Else, buy floor(n/2) promotions and one individual.

Comparing this with my earlier reasoning:

- If b < 2*a, buy as many pairs as possible using promotion and remaining individually.

- Else, buy all individually.

Wait, there's an inconsistency in the conditions.

In the code, it's checking if 2*a < b, which is the opposite of b < 2*a.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me double-check with the example test cases.

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9

- 2*a = 10, which is greater than b=9, so according to my formula, buy using promotion: (2//2)*9 + 0*5 = 9

- According to the code:

- 2*5 = 10 < 9? No, 10 is not less than 9, so it's False.

- Then, n=2 is even, so print(int(2*9/2)) = int(9) = 9, which matches.

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9

- 2*a = 10 < b=9? No, 10 is not less than 9.

- n is odd, so X=3//2=1, print(1*9 + 5) = 9 + 5 = 14, which matches.

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

- 2*a=10 < b=11? Yes, 10 < 11.

- So, according to the code, print A*B = 3*5=15, which matches the output.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if b < 2*a, buy as many pairs as possible using promotion and remaining individually.

But in this case, b=11 and 2*a=10, so b > 2*a, which is not the case here.

Wait, in the third test case, b=11 and 2*a=10, so b > 2*a.

Wait, in the code, the condition is if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

In this case, 2*a=10 < b=11, so buy all individually, which is 3*5=15, matches the output.

In my earlier reasoning, if b >= 2*a, buy all individually.

So, in this case, b=11 >= 2*a=10, so buy all individually: 15 burles.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a mistake, but actually, it's correct.

Let me re-express my earlier reasoning to align with the code.

- If 2*a < b, then buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them using the promotion.

- Hence, in this case, it's better to buy all yogurts individually.

- Else, if b <= 2*a, then buying pairs using the promotion is cheaper or equal in cost to buying them individually.

- So, if n is even, buy all using promotions.

- If n is odd, buy floor(n/2) promotions and one individual yogurt.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if B*2 < C, which is if 2*a < b.

- If yes, then print A*B, which is buying all individually.

- Else, if A is even, print(int(A*C/2)), which is buying all using promotions.

- Else, print(X*C + B), which is buying floor(A/2) promotions and one individual yogurt.

This matches the corrected reasoning above.

Hence, the code is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly n yogurts given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts.

## Approach
1. **Input Parsing:** 
    - Read the number of test cases, t.
    - For each test case, read the values of n (number of yogurts), a (regular price per yogurt), and b (promotional price for two yogurts).

2. **Decision Making:**
    - If the cost of two yogurts individually (2*a) is less than the promotional price (b), it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
    - Otherwise, maximize the use of the promotional price for pairs of yogurts and buy any remaining yogurt individually.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
    - If 2*a < b, the total cost is simply n*a.
    - If b <= 2*a, calculate the cost based on whether n is even or odd:
        - If n is even, buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotional price.
        - If n is odd, buy as many pairs as possible using the promotional price and buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

func()
```

## Explanation
- **Step-by-step Execution:**
  - For each test case, determine the relationship between 2*a and b.
  - If 2*a < b, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
  - If b <= 2*a, prefer buying yogurts in pairs using the promotional price.
  - For odd counts of yogurts, after buying as many pairs as possible, buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The solution efficiently handles multiple test cases and makes decisions based on simple arithmetic comparisons, ensuring it runs quickly even for the upper limits of input constraints.
