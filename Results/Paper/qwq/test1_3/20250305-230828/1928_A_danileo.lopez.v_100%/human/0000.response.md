Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this process.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of the sides. So, if he cuts horizontally, he's dividing the height, and if he cuts vertically, he's dividing the width.

Let's think about the possible cuts:

1. **Horizontal cut:** He cuts the height 'a' into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a. The two rectangles after the cut would be a1 x b and a2 x b.

2. **Vertical cut:** He cuts the width 'b' into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b. The two rectangles after the cut would be a x b1 and a x b2.

Now, from these two pieces, he can rearrange them to form a new rectangle. He can rotate the pieces as he wishes, but the goal is to form a rectangle that is different from the original one (not considering rotations).

I need to determine, for given a and b, whether it's possible to perform such a cut and rearrangement to get a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original one.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

**Example 1:**

Input: 1 1

Output: No

Explanation: The rectangle is 1x1. You can't cut it into two smaller rectangles, so you can't form any new rectangle.

**Example 2:**

Input: 2 1

Output: No

Explanation: The rectangle is 2x1. If you cut it horizontally, you get two 1x1 rectangles. From these, you can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

If you cut it vertically, you get two 2x0.5 rectangles, but since we're dealing with integer sides, vertical cut isn't possible here.

**Example 3:**

Input: 2 6

Output: Yes

Explanation: Cutting horizontally into two 1x6 rectangles. From these, you can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

**Example 4:**

Input: 3 2

Output: Yes

Explanation: Cutting horizontally into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since we need integer sides, maybe cutting vertically? Wait, 3x2 can be cut vertically into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 or 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Wait, but the problem states that rectangles must have integer sides, so any cut must result in integer dimensions.

Wait, in the second example, 2x1, cutting horizontally gives two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which are considered the same as the original.

In the third example, 2x6, cutting horizontally gives two 1x6 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

So, seems like when you can cut the rectangle in such a way that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a different rectangle, the answer is "Yes".

I need to generalize this.

Let me think about the conditions under which this is possible.

First, for the cut to be possible, the side you're cutting must be even, because you need to divide it into two integer parts.

Wait, not necessarily. If you have a side of length 3, you can cut it into 1 and 2, both integers. But in the problem, it seems that only cuts resulting in integer-sided rectangles are allowed.

Wait, reading the problem again: "cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides". So, the cuts must result in rectangles with integer dimensions.

Therefore, you can cut a side of length 'a' into two integers a1 and a2 such that a1 + a2 = a, similarly for 'b'.

Now, after cutting, you have two rectangles, say R1 and R2. You can rotate and move these rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle's area is the same as the original one, since you're using the same pieces.

So, the area of the new rectangle is a*b.

Now, the question is whether you can form a rectangle with dimensions different from a and b, up to rotation.

In other words, can you form a rectangle with dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is not the same as (a, b) up to rotation.

Wait, but there might be more constraints because you have two pieces, each of which is a sub-rectangle of the original, and you can rotate them.

Let me think differently.

Suppose you have the original rectangle of size a x b.

You cut it into two rectangles, say R1 and R2.

Then, you arrange R1 and R2 to form a new rectangle of size c x d, where c*d = a*b.

You can rotate R1 and R2 as needed.

The question is whether (c, d) is different from (a, b) up to rotation.

I need to find out if there exists such a arrangement.

Let me consider the possible ways to arrange two rectangles into a new rectangle.

Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally.

Option 2: Place them side by side vertically.

Option 3: Place one above the other.

Wait, but since I can rotate them, I need to consider all possible rotations of the pieces.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or a mathematical condition that allows me to determine if such a rearrangement is possible.

Looking back at the examples:

- 1x1: Can't be cut, so "No".

- 2x1: Can be cut horizontally into two 1x1, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original, so "No".

- 2x6: Cut horizontally into two 1x6, which can be arranged into 4x3, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

- 3x2: Cut vertically into two 3x1, which can be arranged into 1x6 or 6x1, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

- 2x2: Cut horizontally into two 1x2, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from 2x2, so "Yes".

- 2x4: Cut horizontally into two 1x4, which can be arranged into 2x4 or 4x2, which is the same as the original, so "No"? Wait, but the example output is "Yes", so I must be missing something.

Wait, let's look at the input again.

Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Wait, for 2x4, the output is "Yes", but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "No". So, I must be wrong.

Let me think again.

For 2x4:

- Cut horizontally into two 1x4, which can be arranged into 2x4 or 4x2, which is the same as the original.

- Cut vertically into two 2x2, which can be arranged into 4x2 or 2x4, which is the same as the original.

Wait, is there another way to arrange two 1x4 rectangles to form a different rectangle?

If I take two 1x4 rectangles and place them side by side horizontally, I get a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from 2x4.

Wait, that would be 1x8 or 8x1, which is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, my earlier assumption was wrong.

Similarly, for 6x3:

- Cut horizontally into two 3x3, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, which is the same as the original.

- Cut vertically into two 6x1 and 6x2, but 6x1 and 6x2 are not the same as the original.

Wait, but the output is "No", so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, from two pieces, you need to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

In the case of 6x3:

- Cut vertically into two 6x1 and 6x2.

- Arranging these two pieces to form a new rectangle.

- You can place the 6x1 and 6x2 side by side horizontally to get a 6x3, which is the same as the original.

- Or place them vertically to get a 7x1, but that's not a rectangle because 7x1 is different from 6x3.

Wait, but 7x1 is different from 6x3, but in the example, the output is "No", so perhaps this doesn't count.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the new rectangle has both sides greater than 1.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that.

I need to revisit my approach.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles, say R1 and R2, and I need to arrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rotations don't make a difference.

So, the key is to see if there's any way to arrange R1 and R2 into a rectangle that isn't the same as the original one.

I need a general condition for this.

Let me think about the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a*b.

The area of the new rectangle must also be a*b.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is not the same as (a, b) up to rotation.

But I need to ensure that such a c and d can be formed by arranging R1 and R2.

Moreover, R1 and R2 can be rotated, so their dimensions can be flipped.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a mathematical relationship between a and b that allows such a rearrangement.

Looking back at the examples:

- For 1x1: Can't be cut, so "No".

- For 2x1: Can be cut horizontally into two 1x1, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original, so "No".

- For 2x6: Can be cut horizontally into two 1x6, which can be arranged into 4x3, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

- For 3x2: Can be cut vertically into two 3x1, which can be arranged into 1x6 or 6x1, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

- For 2x2: Can be cut horizontally into two 1x2, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from 2x2, so "Yes".

- For 2x4: Can be cut horizontally into two 1x4, which can be arranged into 1x8 or 8x1, which is different from 2x4, so "Yes".

- For 6x3: Can be cut vertically into two 6x1 and 6x2, which can be arranged into 6x3 (same as original) or 7x1 (different), but perhaps 7x1 isn't considered a valid formation.

Wait, but in the example, the output for 6x3 is "No", even though 7x1 is different.

Hmm.

Maybe the condition is that you can't form a rectangle that isn't the same as the original, considering only rectangles with both dimensions greater than 1.

But 7x1 might not be considered a valid formation, perhaps because one side is 1.

Wait, but in previous cases, 1x8 was allowed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If a and b have a common divisor greater than 1, maybe that allows for a rearrangement.

Wait, in the example:

- 2x6: GCD(2,6)=2, "Yes"

- 3x2: GCD(3,2)=1, "Yes"

- 2x2: GCD(2,2)=2, "Yes"

- 2x4: GCD(2,4)=2, "Yes"

- 6x3: GCD(6,3)=3, "No"

Wait, but 6x3 is "No", even though GCD is 3.

So, GCD might not be the direct factor.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is even.

Looking at the inputs:

- 1x1: Both odd, "No"

- 2x1: One even, "No"

- 2x6: Both even, "Yes"

- 3x2: One even, "Yes"

- 2x2: Both even, "Yes"

- 2x4: Both even, "Yes"

- 6x3: One even, "No"

Hmm, seems like when at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for some cases like 2x1.

Wait, 2x1 is "No" even though a is even.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if both a and b are even, or if one of them is even and greater than 2.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 is even, but it's "No".

In 2x2, a=2 and b=2, both even, "Yes".

In 2x4, both even, "Yes".

In 6x3, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, but output is "No".

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and greater than 2.

In 2x1, a=2 is even and greater than 1, but output is "No".

Wait, 2 is greater than 1, but in this case, it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even and the other is greater than 1.

In 2x1: a=2 is even, b=1 is not greater than 1, "No"

In 2x2: a=2 even, b=2 greater than 1, "Yes"

In 2x4: a=2 even, b=4 greater than 1, "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 greater than 1, but output is "No"

Hmm, doesn't hold for 6x3.

Wait, maybe there's another condition.

Let me think about the possibility of forming a new rectangle.

Suppose I have a rectangle a x b.

I can cut it into two smaller rectangles, and then arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The key is that the new rectangle should have different dimensions from the original, up to rotation.

I need to see if there's any way to cut and rearrange the pieces to achieve that.

Perhaps I should consider the aspect ratio or something related to the proportions.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a and b share a common factor other than 1.

Wait, but in 3x2, GCD is 1, and it's "Yes", so that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both powers of the same number.

But that doesn't seem to fit the examples.

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

If both a and b are odd, then any cut will result in at least one piece having a fractional side, but since we need integer sides, cutting isn't possible, so "No".

If one of a or b is even, then you can make a cut.

But in the example, 2x1 is even in one side, but output is "No".

Wait, maybe it's about whether after cutting, the pieces can be arranged into a rectangle that isn't the same as the original.

In 2x1, cutting horizontally gives two 1x1, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original, so "No".

In 2x2, cutting horizontally gives two 1x2, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from 2x2, so "Yes".

In 2x4, cutting horizontally gives two 1x4, which can be arranged into 1x8 or 8x1, different from 2x4, so "Yes".

In 6x3, cutting horizontally gives two 3x3, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, which is the same as the original, so "No".

Wait, so perhaps the condition is that after cutting, the pieces can be arranged into a rectangle that isn't the same as the original.

In 6x3, cutting horizontally gives two 3x3, which can only form 3x6 or 6x3, which is the same as the original, so "No".

But if you cut vertically, you can cut into two 6x1 and 6x2.

Arranging these can form a 6x3 (same as original) or a 7x1, which is different, but perhaps 7x1 isn't considered a valid formation.

Wait, but in the problem, 1x7 should be considered different from 6x3.

But in the example, the output is "No", so maybe the condition is that you must be able to form a rectangle that is different from the original and has both sides greater than 1.

In that case, 7x1 doesn't qualify because one side is 1.

Similarly, in 2x1, you can form 1x2, but that's the same as the original.

So, perhaps the condition is that you can form a rectangle that is different from the original and both sides are greater than 1.

In 2x4, you can form 1x8, but that has one side as 1, so "No".

Wait, but the example output is "Yes", so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that you can form any rectangle different from the original, even if one side is 1.

But in the example, 6x3 allows forming 7x1, which is different, but the output is "No".

I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I should consider the ratio of a and b.

If a and b are both even, or if one is even and the other is a multiple of the half of the even side, or something like that.

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me think about the number of ways to arrange the two pieces.

Each piece can be rotated, so each piece has two possible orientations: original or rotated.

Therefore, there are four possible combinations of orientations for the two pieces.

You can place them side by side horizontally, side by side vertically, or in other configurations.

But I need a general condition.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other side is greater than 1.

But in 2x1, a=2 is divisible by 2, but b=1 is not greater than 1, so "No".

In 2x2, a=2 divisible by 2, and b=2 greater than 1, so "Yes".

In 2x4, a=2 divisible by 2, and b=4 greater than 1, so "Yes".

In 6x3, a=6 divisible by 2, and b=3 greater than 1, but output is "No".

Hmm, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 4.

In 2x4, a=2 not divisible by 4, b=4 divisible by 4, "Yes".

In 6x3, a=6 not divisible by 4, b=3 not divisible by 4, "No".

But in 2x2, a=2 not divisible by 4, b=2 not divisible by 4, but output is "Yes".

This isn't consistent.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two pieces must have a common side length to be arranged into a new rectangle.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the two pieces must be such that they can form a rectangle with different dimensions.

Wait, but the area is the same; it's about the arrangement.

Maybe I should think in terms of tiling.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and the other side is not a multiple of a certain factor.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90 degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, I need to consider rectangles up to rotation.

Given that, I need to see if, after cutting and rearranging, I can get a rectangle that isn't the same as the original, considering rotations.

In other words, if the original rectangle is a x b, and after rearrangement, I get c x d, and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a), then "Yes"; else, "No".

I need to find a condition based on a and b that allows this.

Looking at the examples again:

- 1x1: Can't be cut, "No"

- 2x1: Can be cut into two 1x1, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original, "No"

- 2x6: Can be cut into two 1x6, which can be arranged into 4x3, which is different from 2x6, "Yes"

- 3x2: Can be cut into two 3x1, which can be arranged into 1x6 or 6x1, different from 3x2, "Yes"

- 2x2: Can be cut into two 1x2, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, different from 2x2, "Yes"

- 2x4: Can be cut into two 1x4, which can be arranged into 1x8 or 8x1, different from 2x4, "Yes"

- 6x3: Can be cut into two 6x1 and 6x2, which can be arranged into 6x3 (same as original) or 7x1 (different), but output is "No"

Wait, in 6x3, cutting vertically into 6x1 and 6x2, arranging them horizontally gives a 6x3 (same as original), and arranging them vertically gives a 7x1, which is different.

But in the example, the output is "No", so perhaps forming a 7x1 isn't considered a different rectangle in this context.

Maybe because one side is 1, it's not considered different?

Wait, but in other cases, like 2x4, forming 1x8 is considered different, but in 6x3, forming 7x1 isn't.

Confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the new rectangle has the same set of divisors as the original.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a rectangle a x b.

I can cut it into two smaller rectangles in two ways: cut parallel to a or cut parallel to b.

Then, I can arrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The key is to see if this new rectangle can have different dimensions from the original, up to rotation.

I need to see if there's any way to do this.

Let me consider that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have dimensions that are a combination of the pieces.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the least common multiple or something similar.

But that might not help directly.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle has an aspect ratio that can be achieved in another way after cutting and rearranging, then "Yes"; else, "No".

But I need a concrete condition.

Looking back at the inputs and outputs:

- 1x1: "No"

- 2x1: "No"

- 2x6: "Yes"

- 3x2: "Yes"

- 2x2: "Yes"

- 2x4: "Yes"

- 6x3: "No"

I need to find a pattern.

Looking at a and b:

- If both a and b are odd, "No"

- If one of a or b is even, check something else.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 is even, but output is "No"

In 2x2, a=2 even, output "Yes"

In 2x4, a=2 even, output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 even, output "No"

So, being even isn't sufficient.

Maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 4.

In 2x1, a=2 not divisible by 4, "No"

In 2x2, a=2 not divisible by 4, "Yes"

In 2x4, a=2 not divisible by 4, "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 not divisible by 4, "No"

Still doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is a multiple of the other.

In 2x1, 2 is a multiple of 1, "No"

In 2x2, 2 is a multiple of 2, "Yes"

In 2x4, 4 is a multiple of 2, "Yes"

In 6x3, 6 is a multiple of 3, "No"

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 is a multiple of b=1, output "No"

In 2x2, a=2 is a multiple of b=2, output "Yes"

In 2x4, a=2 is a multiple of b=4? No, 4 is a multiple of 2.

Wait
