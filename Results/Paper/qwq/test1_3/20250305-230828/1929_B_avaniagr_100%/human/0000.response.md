Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the same for anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. But actually, I think that's double-counting because each diagonal is unique, but in the problem, it's stated that there are 4n - 2 diagonals in total.

Wait, no, the problem says "4n - 2 diagonals," which includes both main and anti-diagonals. So, I need to consider both types.

My task is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to think about how to cover these diagonals with the fewest cells possible.

Let's consider some small values of n to get an intuition.

Take n = 2:

- Grid has 2 rows and 2 columns.

- Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

- Main diagonals: 3 (two diagonals per main and anti)

Wait, for n=2, the main diagonals are:

- One from (1,1) to (2,2)

- One from (1,2)

- One from (2,1)

Similarly, anti-diagonals:

- One from (1,2) to (2,1)

- One from (1,1)

- One from (2,2)

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Actually, for an n x n grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the same for anti-diagonals, but some diagonals are shared.

Wait, maybe I should look for a general formula.

But the problem seems to consider all possible diagonals, both main and anti-diagonals, totaling 4n - 2.

Given that, I need to cover at least k of these diagonals with the fewest cells.

I need to find a way to select cells such that they intersect with these diagonals.

One approach is to consider that each cell belongs to exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell can cover two diagonals: one main and one anti.

If I color a cell, I cover two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two diagonals.

Therefore, if k is less than or equal to twice the number of cells, I can cover k diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells.

But wait, is this always possible?

Let's see.

If k is small, say k=1 or k=2, then coloring one cell can cover two diagonals, which would satisfy k=1 or k=2.

But if k is larger, say k=3, then I might need two cells to cover four diagonals, which covers k=3.

Wait, in the example given, for n=3 and k=4, the output is 2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but in the example, it's 6. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, for n=3, 4n-2=10 diagonals.

If k=10, meaning we need to cover all 10 diagonals.

In the example, it's 6 cells.

But ceil(10/2)=5, but the example uses 6 cells.

Hmm, so maybe my initial approach is incomplete.

Perhaps there are dependencies or overlaps that I'm not considering.

Let's think differently.

Suppose I have to cover all diagonals, meaning k=4n-2.

In this case, I need to cover all main and anti-diagonals.

To cover all main diagonals, I need to cover each main diagonal with at least one colored cell.

Similarly for anti-diagonals.

But since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, there might be overlaps in coverage.

I need to find the minimal set of cells that cover the required number of diagonals.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of main and anti-diagonals separately.

Letâ€™s denote:

- m = number of main diagonals = 2n - 1

- a = number of anti-diagonals = 2n - 1

Total diagonals = m + a - n = 4n - 2 - n = 3n - 2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, in a square grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1.

But they intersect, and some diagonals are shared.

Wait, actually, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 2.

So, m + a = 4n - 2.

Ok, so no overlap in counting.

So, total diagonals = 4n - 2.

Now, I need to cover at least k of these diagonals.

If I color a cell, I cover two diagonals: one main and one anti.

So, in general, each cell covers two diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I would need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the example, for n=3 and k=10, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but the output is 6.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there are constraints where certain diagonals cannot be covered simultaneously by a single cell.

Alternatively, there might be a dependency where some diagonals can only be covered by specific cells.

Let me think about n=3.

For n=3, there are 3 rows and 3 columns.

Main diagonals:

- Diagonal 1: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonal 2: (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal 3: (2,1), (3,2)

Anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal 5: (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal 6: (2,3), (3,2)

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Actually, for n=3:

- Main diagonals:

- From top-left to bottom-right:

- Diagonal with one cell: (1,1)

- Diagonal with two cells: (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal with three cells: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal with two cells: (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonal with one cell: (3,3)

Wait, no, actually, the main diagonals are:

- For i-j = constant.

- Anti-diagonals are for i+j = constant.

For n=3:

- Main diagonals:

- i-j = -2: (1,3)

- i-j = -1: (1,2), (2,3)

- i-j = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- i-j = 1: (2,1), (3,2)

- i-j = 2: (3,1)

So, five main diagonals.

Similarly, anti-diagonals:

- i+j = 2: (1,1)

- i+j = 3: (1,2), (2,1)

- i+j = 4: (2,2), (3,1), (1,3)

- i+j = 5: (2,3), (3,2)

- i+j = 6: (3,3)

Again, five anti-diagonals.

Total diagonals: 10, which matches 4*3 - 2 = 10.

Now, to cover k=10 diagonals, which is all of them.

In the example, it says that 6 cells are needed.

But according to my earlier logic, ceil(10/2)=5 cells should be enough.

But apparently, it's not sufficient in this case.

So, perhaps there are dependencies where certain diagonals can't be covered simultaneously by some cells.

Let me think about it differently.

If I want to cover all diagonals, I need to ensure that every diagonal has at least one colored cell.

In other words, I need to select a set of cells such that every diagonal has at least one cell from this set.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard.

But since n can be up to 1e8, and t=1000, I need an efficient solution, probably O(1) per test case.

So, there must be a smarter way to calculate this.

Let's consider that each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I select a cell, I cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

If I select another cell, I cover two more diagonals, unless there is an overlap.

In the case where k is small, selecting cells that cover new diagonals is efficient.

But as k increases, I might need to cover diagonals that are already covered by previous cells.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of cells such that the union of their covered diagonals is at least k.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider extreme cases.

Case 1: k=1.

I need to cover at least one diagonal.

Coloring any single cell will cover two diagonals, which is more than enough.

So, minimum cells needed is 1.

But according to the formula in the code, if k <= 4n - 4, then ceil(k / 2).

For n=3, 4*3 -4=8.

If k=1 <=8, then ceil(1/2)=1, which matches.

Case 2: k=4n-2, which is the maximum k.

For n=3, k=10.

According to the code, if k==4n-3 or k==4n-2, it handles them separately.

Wait, for k=10, which is 4*3 -2=10, the code prints 2*n, which is 6.

Which matches the example.

So, perhaps there is a pattern here.

Let me see for other values.

Take n=4, k=7.

According to the code, since k=7 <= 4*4 -4=12, ceil(7/2)=4, which matches the example.

Another example: n=7, k=11.

According to the code, since 11 <=4*7 -4=24, ceil(11/2)=6, which matches the example.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3, k=4, output=2, which is ceil(4/2)=2.

Seems consistent.

But earlier I thought that for k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but the example shows 6.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps when k is large, specifically when k >= 4n - 3 or k ==4n -2, there is a different formula.

Looking at the code:

- If k <=4n -4, then ceil(k /2)

- Else if k ==4n -3, print 2n -1

- Else if k==4n -2, print 2n

So, for n=3, 4n -4=8, 4n -3=9, 4n -2=10.

If k=10, it prints 2*3=6.

But according to ceil(10/2)=5, it's higher than that.

So, perhaps for k up to 4n -4, ceil(k /2) is sufficient.

But for k >=4n -3, a different formula applies.

I need to understand why.

Let me think about the grid and diagonals.

In a grid, some diagonals share cells.

Specifically, the main diagonal (i==j) and the anti-diagonal (i+j=n+1) might intersect.

Wait, for n=3, the main diagonal is (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).

The anti-diagonal is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1).

So, they intersect at (2,2).

So, there is overlap.

This might cause issues when trying to cover all diagonals.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by cells without overlapping.

If I select a cell, I cover two diagonals.

If I select another cell that doesn't share any diagonals with the first cell, then I cover four diagonals total.

But as I select more cells, there will be overlaps, meaning that some diagonals are covered multiple times.

In the case where k is large, I might need to cover almost all diagonals, which would require covering almost all main and anti-diagonals.

In such cases, the minimal number of cells needed might be higher than just ceil(k /2).

Hence, perhaps for k up to 4n -4, ceil(k /2) is sufficient.

But for k >=4n -3, a different formula is needed.

Looking back at the code, for k==4n -3, it prints 2n -1, and for k==4n -2, it prints 2n.

I need to verify if this makes sense.

Let me check for n=3, k=9.

According to the code, since k=9 ==4*3 -3=9, it prints 2*3 -1=5.

But in the example, for k=10, it's 6.

Wait, in the example, for k=9, it's 5, and for k=10, it's 6.

So, seems consistent.

Another test case: n=4, k=7.

According to the code, since 7 <=4*4 -4=12, ceil(7/2)=4.

Which matches the example.

So, perhaps this formula works.

But I need to understand why.

Let me think about the minimal number of cells needed to cover a certain number of diagonals.

If I select a cell, it covers two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

Hence, for k diagonals, I need at least ceil(k /2) cells.

But in reality, there might be overlaps, so sometimes I need more cells.

Specifically, when k is close to the total number of diagonals, the overlaps become more significant, and I need more cells to cover the remaining diagonals.

Hence, for k up to 4n -4, ceil(k /2) is sufficient.

But for k ==4n -3 or k==4n -2, I need more cells.

Looking at n=3:

- Total diagonals:10

- For k=9, need 5 cells

- For k=10, need 6 cells

Similarly, for n=4:

- Total diagonals:4*4 -2=14

- For k=13, need 7 cells (2*4 -1=7)

- For k=14, need 8 cells (2*4=8)

So, the formula seems consistent.

Hence, the given code seems to correctly handle different cases.

Therefore, I would say that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
