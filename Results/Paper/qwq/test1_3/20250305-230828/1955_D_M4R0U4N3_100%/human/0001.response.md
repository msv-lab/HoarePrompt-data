Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But actually, it's a bit more specific because it says "match the elements of array b." So, perhaps it means that at least k elements in the subsegment of a are equal to k elements in b, considering the frequency of each number.

Wait, no. The problem says that the elements of c (the subsegment of a) can be rearranged such that at least k of them match the elements of b. This sounds like checking if there are at least k elements in common between the subsegment of a and b, considering the frequency of each element.

Let me look at the example to clarify:

In the first test case, n=7, m=4, k=2, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4]. We need to consider all subsegments of a of length 4 and check if, after rearranging, at least 2 elements match b.

Let's look at the subsegments:

- [4,1,2,3]: After rearranging, we can have [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least 2 match.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: After rearranging, [2,3,4,5] can be compared to b=[1,2,3,4], so elements 2,3,4 match, which is more than 2.

- [3,4,5,6]: Elements 4 and 6; 4 is in b, so at least 2 (but only one matches here, wait, b has 4, but 6 is not in b. So, only one matches. Wait, but the output says 4, so it's considered good. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps "match" means exactly equal in value, regardless of frequency. So, in [3,4,5,6], only 4 matches with b, which is less than k=2, so it should not be counted. But the output is 4, which suggests it is counted. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "match" considers the frequency. Let's see: b has one 4, and the subsegment has one 4, so it matches one 4. Similarly, in [2,3,4,5], it has one 2, one 3, one 4, and one 5. b has one of each: 1,2,3,4. So, matching elements are 2,3,4, which are three, which is >=2, so it's good.

But [3,4,5,6] has only one matching element (4), which is less than k=2, so it should not be counted. But the output is 4, which suggests all four subsegments are counted as good. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let's list all subsegments of length m=4:

1. [4,1,2,3]: matches 1,2,3,4 -> all four match, which is >=2

2. [1,2,3,4]: matches 1,2,3,4 -> all four match, which is >=2

3. [2,3,4,5]: matches 2,3,4 -> three match, which is >=2

4. [3,4,5,6]: matches 4 -> one match, which is <2

So, only the first three should be good, but the output is 4. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, n=7, m=4, so subsegments are:

- a[1:4]: [4,1,2,3]

- a[2:5]: [1,2,3,4]

- a[3:6]: [2,3,4,5]

- a[4:7]: [3,4,5,6]

So, four subsegments, and according to the output, all four are good in this test case. But according to my earlier analysis, the last one should not be good because it has only one matching element (4), which is less than k=2. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps "match" means exactly equal after rearrangement. So, if we can rearrange the subsegment to match b, then it's good. In that case, for [3,4,5,6], we can rearrange to [4,3,6,5], and compare it to b=[1,2,3,4], and see that 4 and 3 match, which is >=2. So, it is good.

Ah, I see. So, "match" means that after rearranging, at least k positions have the same value as in b.

So, in [3,4,5,6], we can rearrange to [4,3,5,6], and compare to b=[1,2,3,4], and see that positions where they match are:

- Position 1: 4 == 1? No

- Position 2: 3 == 2? No

- Position 3: 5 == 3? No

- Position 4: 6 == 4? No

So, no positions match. But according to the earlier logic, it should be considered good, but actually, in this arrangement, none match. Maybe I need to find a different rearrangement.

Let's try [3,4,5,6] vs [1,2,3,4]:

- Arrange [3,4,5,6] as [3,4,5,6]

- Compare to [1,2,3,4]:

- Position 1: 3 == 1? No

- Position 2: 4 == 2? No

- Position 3: 5 == 3? No

- Position 4: 6 == 4? No

No matches.

Another arrangement: [3,4,6,5] vs [1,2,3,4]:

- Position 1: 3 == 1? No

- Position 2: 4 == 2? No

- Position 3: 6 == 3? No

- Position 4: 5 == 4? No

Still no matches.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's read it again.

"Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about the values, not their positions. So, if in c, after rearranging, at least k elements are equal to the elements in b at the corresponding positions.

Wait, no, it says "at least k of them match the elements of array b." It doesn't specify positions. So, perhaps it means that at least k elements in c are present in b, regardless of positions.

But looking back at the example, it seems that it's considering the number of matching values, not their positions.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, after rearranging c, at least k elements in c match the elements in b at the same positions.

Wait, perhaps it's about permutations. So, you rearrange c to maximize the number of matches with b, and if this number is at least k, then it's good.

This is similar to finding the number of positions where c and b are equal, after optimally arranging c.

In the first test case, for subsegment [3,4,5,6], we can arrange it as [4,3,6,5], and compare to b=[1,2,3,4]:

- Position 1: 4 == 1? No

- Position 2: 3 == 2? No

- Position 3: 6 == 3? No

- Position 4: 5 == 4? No

No matches.

Alternatively, arrange [3,4,5,6] as [3,4,5,6] compared to [1,2,3,4]:

- Position 1: 3 == 1? No

- Position 2: 4 == 2? No

- Position 3: 5 == 3? No

- Position 4: 6 == 4? No

Still no matches.

So, in this case, there are no positions where c matches b, regardless of arrangement. So, it should not be considered good if k=2.

But according to the output, it is considered good. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe "match" means that the elements are equal, regardless of positions. So, if in c, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions.

So, in [3,4,5,6], elements 3,4 are present in b, which is >=2, so it's good.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "match the elements of array b," which could be interpreted as having at least k elements in c that are also in b.

If that's the case, then for [3,4,5,6], elements 3 and 4 are in b, so it's good.

Similarly, in [2,3,4,5], elements 2,3,4 are in b, which is >=2.

In [1,2,3,4], all elements are in b, which is >=2.

In [4,1,2,3], elements 1,2,3,4 are in b, which is >=2.

So, all four subsegments are good, which matches the output of 4 for the first test case.

Okay, so perhaps "match the elements of array b" means that at least k elements in c are present in b, regardless of their positions.

That seems to be the case.

So, the problem reduces to, for each subsegment c of a of length m, check if at least k elements in c are also present in b.

If that's the case, then it's a matter of sliding a window of size m over a, and for each window, count how many elements are in b, and check if this count is >=k.

But, wait, that seems too straightforward, and the problem might be more complex, given the need for rearrangement.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it mentions rearrangement, so perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps it's about the frequency of elements.

That is, considering the frequency of each element in b, and ensuring that c has at least the required frequency for each element to have at least k matches.

But in the example, b has all unique elements, so it's hard to tell.

Let me consider another example where b has duplicates.

Suppose b = [1,2,2,4], and k=3.

Then, for c = [2,2,4,5], after rearranging, we can have [2,2,4,5] vs b=[1,2,2,4], which has matches at positions where c and b have the same elements:

- Position 1: 2 == 1? No

- Position 2: 2 == 2? Yes

- Position 3: 4 == 2? No

- Position 4: 5 == 4? No

Only one match.

But if we rearrange c to [2,2,5,4] vs b=[1,2,2,4]:

- Position 1: 2 == 1? No

- Position 2: 2 == 2? Yes

- Position 3: 5 == 2? No

- Position 4: 4 == 4? Yes

Now, two matches.

So, by rearranging, we can maximize the number of matches.

In this case, we can have two matches, which is >=k=3 if k=2, but not if k=3.

So, in this case, it would be good only if k=2, but not if k=3.

Hence, we need to consider the maximum number of matches possible by rearranging c to align as many elements as possible with b.

So, to compute this efficiently, we need a way to滑动窗口遍历a的子段，计算每个子段与b的最大匹配数，然后检查是否大于等于k。

But this seems computationally expensive if done naively.

We need an efficient way to compute, for each subsegment c of a of length m, the maximum number of matches with b after rearrangement.

One way to think about this is to consider the frequency of each element in c and in b, and find the minimum between the frequencies for each element, then sum these minima to get the total number of matches.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, for each subsegment c of a of length m, compute the frequency of each element in c, compute the frequency of each element in b, then for each element, take the minimum of the frequencies in c and b, and sum these minima. If this sum is >=k, then the subsegment is good.

Yes, that seems correct.

In the earlier example where b=[1,2,3,4], and c=[3,4,5,6], the frequency intersection is 1 (for 3) + 1 (for 4) + 0 + 0 = 2, which is >=2, so it's good.

But wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought only one element matched, but actually, it's two.

Wait, in c=[3,4,5,6], the frequency of 3 in c is 1, in b is 1, so min is 1.

Similarly, frequency of 4 in c is 1, in b is 1, min is 1.

Frequency of 5 in c is 1, in b is 0, min is 0.

Frequency of 6 in c is 1, in b is 0, min is 0.

So, total matches are 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2, which is >=2, so it's good.

Hence, the output is 4 for the first test case.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=7, m=4, k=3, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

We need to check each subsegment of length 4:

1. [4,1,2,3]: frequency intersection with b is min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good

2. [1,2,3,4]: same as above, 4 >=3, good

3. [2,3,4,5]: min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+1+0=3 >=3, good

4. [3,4,5,6]: min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+0+0=2 <3, not good

So, total good subsegments: 3, which matches the output.

In the third test case, n=7, m=4, k=4, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

Check subsegments:

1. [4,1,2,3]: frequency intersection =1+1+1+1=4 >=4, good

2. [1,2,3,4]: same as above, 4 >=4, good

3. [2,3,4,5]: 1+1+1+0=3 <4, not good

4. [3,4,5,6]:1+1+0+0=2 <4, not good

So, total good subsegments:2, matches the output.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <=2e5, same for m.

So, we need an efficient way to compute the frequency intersection for each subsegment.

A straightforward way is to use a sliding window approach, where we maintain a frequency array for the current window of size m in a, and compare it with the frequency array of b.

Since the elements can be up to 1e6, we need a way to handle frequencies efficiently.

But using a frequency array of size 1e6 for each test case might be too slow, as t can be up to 1e4, although the sum of n and m is limited to 2e5.

Wait, but t is up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is <=2e5, same for m.

So, overall time complexity should be O(2e5), which is acceptable.

Let's think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read array a of size n

- Read array b of size m

- Precompute frequency array for b

- Initialize a frequency array for the first window of size m in a

- Compute the intersection sum for the first window

- If sum >=k, increment answer

- Then, slide the window one by one, updating the frequency array and the sum accordingly

- For each slide, adjust the frequency of the element that is removed and the element that is added

- Update the intersection sum

- If sum >=k, increment answer

- Finally, output the answer for each test case

This seems efficient.

Now, to handle the frequency intersection sum efficiently, we can keep track of the minimum of frequencies for each element in a and b.

But since we are sliding the window, we can maintain a count of how many times each element in b is present in the current window.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to keep track of the number of matches.

Initialize a match count for the first window, then, for each slide, update the match count based on the element that is removed and the element that is added.

This can be done by keeping a frequency array for the window, and for each element in b, check how many matches are there in the window.

But again, with elements up to 1e6, we need an efficient way to handle this.

An optimized approach is to use a sliding window with a frequency array for the window, and keep track of the number of matches.

Initialize the frequency array for the first window, compute the sum of min(freq_a[e], freq_b[e]) for all e in b.

Wait, but freq_b[e] is usually 1 if b has unique elements, but b can have duplicates.

Wait, b can have duplicates, so freq_b[e] can be greater than 1.

So, for each element e in b, freq_b[e] is the number of times e appears in b.

Then, for the window in a, freq_a[e] is the number of times e appears in the window.

The number of matches for element e is min(freq_a[e], freq_b[e]).

Then, the total matches is the sum over all e of min(freq_a[e], freq_b[e]).

We need this sum to be >=k.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we can use a frequency array for the window, and a separate array for freq_b.

Initialize freq_b by counting the frequency of each element in b.

Then, for the first window, count freq_a for the first m elements in a.

Compute the sum of min(freq_a[e], freq_b[e]) for all e.

If sum >=k, increment answer.

Then, for each subsequent window, slide the window by one:

- Remove the element that is no longer in the window: decrement freq_a[a[i-1]]

- Add the new element to the window: increment freq_a[a[i+m-1]]

- Update the sum accordingly:

- If freq_a[a[i-1]] < freq_b[a[i-1]], then sum -= min(freq_a[a[i-1]] + 1, freq_b[a[i-1]]) - min(freq_a[a[i-1]], freq_b[a[i-1]])

- If freq_a[a[i-1]] >= freq_b[a[i-1]], then sum -= freq_b[a[i-1]]

- Similarly, for the added element a[i+m-1]:

- If freq_a[a[i+m-1]] < freq_b[a[i+m-1]], then sum += min(freq_a[a[i+m-1]], freq_b[a[i+m-1]])

- Else, sum += freq_b[a[i+m-1]]

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps it's easier to precompute freq_b, and then use a sliding window with freq_a, and keep track of the current sum of matches.

Initialize freq_b with the frequency of each element in b.

Initialize freq_a with the frequency of each element in the first window of a.

Compute the initial sum as sum(min(freq_a[e], freq_b[e]) for all e in b).

Then, for each slide:

- Remove a[i-1]: decrement freq_a[a[i-1]], and update the sum if freq_a[a[i-1]] < freq_b[a[i-1]]

- Add a[i+m-1]: increment freq_a[a[i+m-1]], and update the sum if freq_a[a[i+m-1]] <= freq_b[a[i+m-1]]

This way, we can efficiently maintain the sum of matches as we slide the window.

Now, considering that elements can be up to 1e6, we need a way to handle frequency counts efficiently.

To optimize, we can use a fixed-size frequency array with size max_a + 1, where max_a is the maximum possible value in a, which is 1e6.

But this might be memory-intensive if we do this for each test case.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is <=2e5, and m <=n, so it's manageable.

Alternatively, we can reset the frequency array for each test case.

But in the code provided, it seems to use a single frequency array for all test cases, which might lead to errors if not reset properly.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

max_val = 1000000

cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):

cnt_b[b[i]] += 1

b_values = set(b)

ans = 0

curr = 0

for i in range(m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

for i in range(n - m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] += 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:

curr -= 1

if a[i + m] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

print(ans)

for i in b_values:

cnt_b[i] = 0

It seems to be implementing the sliding window approach.

It initializes cnt_b with the frequency of each element in b.

Then, for the first window of size m in a, it decrements cnt
