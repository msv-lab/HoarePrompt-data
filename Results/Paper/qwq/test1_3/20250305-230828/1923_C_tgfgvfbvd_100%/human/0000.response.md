Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array `c` of length `n`, and each element is positive. Then, there are `q` queries, each asking whether a subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" based on the definition provided.

First, I need to understand what makes an array "good." According to the problem, an array `a` of length `m` is good if there exists another integer array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.

3. Every element in `b` is positive.

So, for each query, I need to check if the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` meets these conditions.

Let me try to rephrase this in my own words. Given a subarray, I need to find another array `b` with the same sum, where none of the elements in `b` match the corresponding elements in the subarray, and all elements in `b` are positive.

I need to figure out a way to determine if such a `b` exists for a given subarray.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

Take the subarray [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]. According to the sample input, the entire array from 1 to 5 is "YES", meaning it's good.

So, for [1,2,1,4,5], there should exist a array `b` with positive integers, where sum of `b` equals sum of `a`, and `b_i != a_i` for all `i`.

Let me try to construct such a `b`. For example, `b` could be [2,1,2,3,6]. Sum is the same, and none of the elements are equal to `a`.

Another example: subarray [4], which is just one element. The sample output is "NO", which makes sense because you can't have `b_1 > 0` and `b_1 != 4` while keeping the sum equal.

Wait, no. If the subarray has only one element, say [4], then `b` must be some positive integer not equal to 4, but the sum must be equal to 4. So, if `b` is, say, 5, then sum is 5, which is not equal to 4. If `b` is 3, sum is 3, which is not equal to 4. So, it's impossible. Hence, "NO".

So, for single-element subarrays, it's always "NO" because you can't change the value while keeping the sum the same.

Now, for subarrays with more than one element, it seems possible under certain conditions.

Let me think about the conditions under which a subarray is good.

Suppose the subarray has length `m`. We need to find an array `b` of length `m` such that:

- Sum of `b` equals sum of `a`.

- `b_i != a_i` for all `i`.

- `b_i > 0` for all `i`.

One approach is to try to adjust the elements of `a` to create `b`, ensuring that `b_i != a_i` and `b_i > 0`.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- For each element in `a`, we try to set `b_i` to some value not equal to `a_i`, but positive, and adjust the sum accordingly.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a better way.

Another way is to consider that since `b_i > 0`, the minimal sum of `b` is `m` (since each `b_i` is at least 1). Also, since `b_i != a_i`, we have some constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of adjusting each `a_i` by some value, ensuring that the total sum remains the same.

Let me consider that for each `i`, `b_i = a_i + d_i`, where `d_i != 0` and `b_i > 0`.

So, `sum(d_i) = 0`, and `d_i != 0` for all `i`.

Moreover, `b_i = a_i + d_i > 0`, which implies `d_i > -a_i`.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a simpler condition.

Let me look at the sample input and output to see if I can find a pattern.

Sample Input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Sample Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, the entire array [1,2,1,4,5] is good, single element [4] is not, [1,4] is good, and [1,2,1] is not.

Wait, [1,2,1] from positions 3 to 4 is [1,4], which is good, and [1,2,1] from positions 1 to 3 is not good.

Wait, positions 3 to 4 are [1,4], and positions 1 to 3 are [1,2,1].

Wait, no. Positions 1 to 3 are [1,2,1], and positions 3 to 4 are [1,4].

According to the sample, [1,4] is good, but [1,2,1] is not.

Wait, but in the explanation, [1,2,1,4,5] is good, and [1,4] is good, but [1,2,1] is not good.

So, I need to find a pattern here.

Let me consider the sum and the number of elements.

For [1,2,1,4,5], sum is 13, and m=5.

For [1,4], sum is 5, m=2.

For [1,2,1], sum is 4, m=3.

Wait, I need to see if there's a relationship between the sum and the number of elements.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the sum being greater than the number of elements.

But in the sample, [1,4] has sum 5 and m=2, which is sum > m.

[1,2,1] has sum 4 and m=3, sum < m, and it's "NO".

Wait, but [1,2,1,4,5] has sum 13 and m=5, sum > m.

[4] has sum 4 and m=1, sum == m, "NO".

So, perhaps if sum > m, it's "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but [1,2,1] has sum 4 > 3, but it's "NO". Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's sum > m and minimal element >1.

Wait, in [1,2,1], minimal elements are 1, so can't decrease them.

Wait, perhaps if all elements are 1, and sum = m, it's "NO".

But in [1,2,1], sum =4 > m=3, but it's "NO".

Wait, perhaps it's sum > m and number of elements with a_i >1 is at least 2.

Wait, in [1,2,1], there is one element >1, which is 2.

In [1,4], there is one element >1, which is 4.

Wait, but [1,4] is "YES", [1,2,1] is "NO".

Hmm, maybe it's sum > m and at least two elements with a_i >1.

In [1,4], sum=5 > m=2, and two elements >1.

Wait, no, only one element >1, which is 4.

Wait, perhaps sum > m and sum - m >= number of elements with a_i >1.

Wait, in [1,4], sum=5, m=2, sum - m =3, number of a_i >1 is 1 (only 4).

3 >=1, so "YES".

In [1,2,1], sum=4, m=3, sum - m=1, number of a_i >1 is 1 (only 2).

1 >=1, but it's "NO" in the sample.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps sum - m >= number of elements with a_i ==1.

In [1,4], sum - m =3, number of a_i ==1 is1 (the first 1).

3 >=1, so "YES".

In [1,2,1], sum - m=1, number of a_i ==1 is2.

1 >=2? No, so "NO".

In [1,2,1,4,5], sum - m=13-5=8, number of a_i ==1 is2.

8 >=2, so "YES".

In [4], sum - m=4-1=0, number of a_i ==1 is0.

0 >=0, but it's "NO".

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum - m >= number of a_i ==1 and m >1.

In [1,4], 3 >=1 and m=2>1, so "YES".

In [1,2,1], 1 >=2 but 1 <2, so "NO".

In [4], m=1, so "NO".

In [1,2,1,4,5], 8 >=2 and m=5>1, so "YES".

This seems to match the sample.

So, the condition is:

If m >1 and sum - m >= number of a_i ==1, then "YES", else "NO".

Let me verify this with another example.

Suppose subarray is [2,2], sum=4, m=2, sum - m=2, number of a_i ==1 is0.

2 >=0, so "YES".

Possible b: [3,1], which satisfies all conditions.

Another example: [1,1,1,1], sum=4, m=4, sum - m=0, number of a_i ==1 is4.

0 >=4? No, so "NO".

Another example: [1,1,2], sum=4, m=3, sum - m=1, number of a_i ==1 is2.

1 >=2? No, so "NO".

Another example: [1,3,1], sum=5, m=3, sum - m=2, number of a_i ==1 is2.

2 >=2, so "YES".

Possible b: [2,2,1], which satisfies all conditions.

Seems correct.

So, in code, for each query, I need to compute:

- m = r_i - l_i +1

- sum of subarray from l_i to r_i

- count of a_i ==1 in the subarray

Then, if m >1 and (sum - m) >= count of a_i ==1, then "YES", else "NO".

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic.

The program reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and q

- Read array l of length n

- Initialize prefix sum array p with 0

- Initialize array c with 0

- Iterate through l:

- If x ==1, increment j

- i += x

- Append i to p

- Append j to c

Then, for each query:

- Read a and b (1-based indices)

- Compute i = c[b] - c[a-1] (number of 1's in the subarray)

- Compute s = p[b] - p[a-1] (sum of the subarray)

- If b - a +1 >1 and s - (b - a +1) >= i, then "YES", else "NO"

Comparing this to my derived condition:

- m = b - a +1

- sum = s

- count of a_i ==1 is i

Condition: if m >1 and s - m >= i, then "YES", else "NO"

Which matches the code's condition.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good or not.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}
