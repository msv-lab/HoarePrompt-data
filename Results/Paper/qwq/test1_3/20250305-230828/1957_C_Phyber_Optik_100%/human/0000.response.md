Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics. I start by placing a white rook on the board, and then the computer places a black rook in a mirrored position, which is (c, r) if I placed mine at (r, c). But if r equals c, the computer skips its turn because it can't mirror the move. After k initial moves, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible when the game continues until no more moves can be made.

The problem guarantees that the initial k moves and the computer's mirrored moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other. So, I don't have to worry about those initial moves conflicting.

My task is to calculate the number of possible final configurations from the state after these initial moves, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

4 1

1 2

8 1

7 6

1000 4

4 4

952 343

222 333

90 91

Output:

3

331

671968183

In the first test case, n=4 and k=1, with my move at (1,2). The computer mirrors it to (2,1). From there, there are 3 possible final configurations.

I need to find a general way to calculate this for any n and k, given the constraints.

Let me try to model this.

First, since rooks can't share rows or columns, this is similar to placing non-attacking rooks on the chessboard.

In standard non-attacking rook placements, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard is given by the number of permutations of n elements taken k at a time, which is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.

But in this problem, there are additional constraints due to the mirroring action of the computer.

Let me think about the mirroring aspect.

When I place a rook at (r, c), the computer places one at (c, r), unless r = c, in which case it skips.

Given that, if I place a rook at (1,2), the computer places one at (2,1). Then in my next move, I can place a rook at (3,4), computer places at (4,3), and so on.

Or, if I place at (3,3), the computer skips, and I have to place another rook, but I need to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.

Wait, but the problem says that the computer mirrors the moves, but if r = c, it can't mirror and skips its turn.

But in the example, with n=4 and k=1, my move at (1,2), computer at (2,1), and then I have to continue placing rooks until no more moves are possible.

From that state, there are three possible final configurations.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to be calculating something based on dynamic programming.

Let me look at the code.

It sets dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, and then for i from 3 to n, dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]) % 1000000007.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and k, collects k moves, determines some invalid positions, and prints dp[n - len(invalid)] or 1 if that's zero.

Wait, invalid is a set that adds r and c for each of the k moves.

So, for each move I make at (r,c), it adds r and c to invalid.

Then, n - len(invalid) is something like the remaining rows or columns or something.

But I need to verify if this is the correct approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Given that rooks can't share rows or columns, placing a rook at (r,c) removes row r and column c from further placements.

Similarly, the computer's move at (c,r) removes row c and column r.

So, after k moves, some rows and columns are already occupied.

I need to find out how many ways to place the remaining rooks until no more moves are possible.

Let me define:

Let used_rows be the set of rows that have a rook placed in them (either white or black).

Similarly, used_cols be the set of columns that have a rook placed in them.

Initially, for each of my k moves at (r,c), the computer places at (c,r), so both rows r and c are used, and columns r and c are used.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I place at (r,c), it affects row r and column c.

Computer places at (c,r), which affects row c and column r.

So, row r and row c are both used, and column r and column c are both used.

Wait, but actually, a row is used if any rook is placed in that row, regardless of color.

Similarly for columns.

So, after my move at (r,c), row r and column c are used.

Computer's move at (c,r) uses row c and column r.

So, overall, rows r and c are used, and columns r and c are used.

Wait, but in standard non-attacking rook placements, a row can have at most one rook, and a column can have at most one rook.

Given that, if a row is used, it can't have any more rooks.

Similarly for columns.

So, in this problem, placing a rook at (r,c) uses row r and column c.

Computer's move at (c,r) uses row c and column r.

So, after both moves, rows r and c are used, and columns r and c are used.

Therefore, the remaining board is (n - used_rows) x (n - used_cols), but since used_rows and used_cols are the same in this case, it's (n - num_used_rows) x (n - num_used_cols).

Wait, but used_rows and used_cols might not be exactly the same, depending on the moves.

Wait, in this problem, since placing a rook at (r,c) uses row r and column c, and computer's move at (c,r) uses row c and column r, then yes, used_rows and used_cols are the same.

Because for each pair (r,c), rows r and c are used, and columns r and c are used.

Wait, let's think about it.

Let me define used_rows as the set of all rows that have at least one rook in them.

Similarly, used_cols as the set of all columns that have at least one rook in them.

Now, each move I make at (r,c) places a rook in row r and column c.

Computer's move at (c,r) places a rook in row c and column r.

So, used_rows = set of all r and c from all moves.

Similarly, used_cols = set of all r and c from all moves.

Wait, no.

Wait, for my move at (r,c), row r and column c are used.

Computer's move at (c,r), row c and column r are used.

So, used_rows includes r and c, and used_cols includes c and r.

So, used_rows and used_cols are actually the same sets.

Therefore, the number of used_rows equals the number of used_cols.

Let me denote m = len(used_rows) = len(used_cols).

So, after k moves, m = len(used_rows) = len(used_cols).

Each of my moves contributes two new rows and two new columns, but there might be overlaps if r == c.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each move (r,c), used_rows adds r and c, and used_cols adds r and c.

But if r == c, then only one new row and one new column is added.

Wait, no, if r == c, then used_rows adds r, and used_cols adds r.

So, m increases by 1.

If r != c, then m increases by 2.

Wait, unless there are overlaps with previous moves.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the bipartite graph where one partition is the rows, and the other is the columns, and edges represent possible rook placements.

But maybe that's too complicated.

Let me consider that after k moves, with m = len(used_rows) = len(used_cols), the remaining board is (n - m) x (n - m).

On this remaining board, I need to continue placing rooks alternately, with me placing white rooks and the computer placing black rooks, mirroring my moves.

Wait, but in the remaining board, the same rules apply: I place a rook, computer mirrors it, and so on.

Given that, I need to find out how many possible ways to fully place rooks on this remaining board until no more moves are possible.

Let me consider that the remaining board is like a new game with size (n - m).

But with the mirroring rule, it's not exactly the same as a new game.

Wait, perhaps it is.

Because in the remaining board, when I place a rook at (r', c'), the computer places at (c', r'), and so on.

So, it's similar to starting a new game on a (n - m) x (n - m) board.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider that the used_rows and used_cols are removed, and the remaining board is a subgrid where neither rows nor columns have any used ones.

So, it's like a new chessboard of size (n - m) x (n - m).

Now, in this new chessboard, we need to place rooks alternately, with me placing white rooks and the computer placing black rooks by mirroring my moves.

Wait, but in this new board, since it's a fresh board, no rooks are placed yet.

So, the number of possible final configurations should be equal to the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks in this remaining board, considering the mirroring rule.

Wait, but in standard non-attacking rook placements, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.

But here, the placement is constrained by the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps not, because the mirroring is just a response to my move, and we're alternating turns.

Wait, but in the end, we're counting the number of possible final configurations, which is the number of ways to fully place rooks until no more moves are possible.

Given that, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining board, considering the mirroring rule.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of ways to pair rows and columns in the remaining board.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the code.

The code computes dp[n - len(invalid)], where invalid is the set of all r and c from the k moves.

So, n - len(invalid) is like the size of the remaining board.

Wait, but len(invalid) is the number of unique rows and columns that have been used.

But since used_rows and used_cols are the same, len(invalid) is m, the number of used rows or columns.

So, n - m is the size of the remaining board.

Then, dp[n - m] is precomputed using some recurrence.

In the code, dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2], modulo 10^9 + 7.

With dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

Let me see what this recurrence represents.

Let me consider small values of n - m.

For n - m = 1: dp[1] = 1

For n - m = 2: dp[2] = 3

For n - m = 3: dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*2*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

For n - m = 4: dp[4] = dp[3] + 2*3*dp[2] = 7 + 6*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

But in the first test case, n=4 and k=1 with my move at (1,2), computer at (2,1). So, m = len(used_rows) = len({1,2}) = 2.

So, n - m = 2, and dp[2] = 3, which matches the first test case.

Wait, but in the first test case, there are 3 possible final configurations.

So, dp[2] = 3 is correct.

Another test case: n=8, k=1, my move at (7,6), computer at (6,7). m = len({7,6}) = 2, n - m = 6, dp[6] should be equal to 331, as per the output.

Let me check if the recurrence gives dp[6] = 331.

Given dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

dp[3] = 3 + 2*2*1 = 3 + 4 = 7

dp[4] = 7 + 2*3*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

dp[5] = 25 + 2*4*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

dp[6] = 81 + 2*5*25 = 81 + 250 = 331

Yes, dp[6] = 331, which matches the second test case.

Similarly, for n=1000 and k=4 with certain moves, m would be len(invalid), and n - m = some value, and dp[n - m] gives 671968183.

So, the code seems to be correctly implementing this dp array.

But I need to understand why this recurrence relation is appropriate for the problem.

Let me try to model the remaining board of size s = n - m.

On this s x s board, there are no rooks placed yet.

Me and the computer take turns placing rooks, with me starting, and the computer mirroring my moves.

But if I place a rook on the diagonal (r=c), the computer skips.

I need to find the number of possible final configurations from this state.

Let me consider that in each turn, I place a rook, and the computer mirrors it, unless I place on the diagonal.

Wait, but on the remaining board, the positions are unconstrained except for the mirroring rule.

Let me think about pairing rows and columns.

Each time I place a rook at (r,c), the computer places at (c,r), provided r != c.

If r == c, computer skips.

So, in the remaining s x s board, the number of possible final configurations is equal to the number of ways to pair rows and columns, considering the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of symmetric rook placements.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in the remaining board, I can choose to place rooks in pairs: (r,c) and (c,r), unless r == c, in which case only one rook is placed.

So, the number of possible final configurations is equal to the number of symmetric rook placements, considering the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of symmetric matrices with certain properties.

But I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that in the remaining s x s board, I can choose to place rooks in pairs: my move at (r,c) and computer's move at (c,r), unless r == c.

So, the number of possible final configurations is equal to the number of ways to pair rows and columns, with some adjustments for the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of possible pairings in a set, where each pair is ordered.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look back at the dp recurrence: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]

This looks similar to recurrence relations for counting derangements or pairings.

Wait, perhaps it's counting the number of ways to pair rows and columns, where each pair consists of two positions: (r,c) and (c,r), unless r == c.

In that case, placing a rook on the diagonal at (r,r) is a single move, with no mirror.

So, for s x s board:

- If I place a rook on the diagonal at (r,r), then the computer skips, and I have to place another rook.

- If I place a rook off the diagonal at (r,c), then the computer places at (c,r).

So, the total number of final configurations is equal to the number of ways to pair the off-diagonal positions plus the ways to place single rooks on the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting perfect matchings in a graph, but with some differences due to the mirroring rule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to counting the number of symmetric rook placements, where the placement is symmetric with respect to the diagonal.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the remaining s x s board, the number of final configurations is equal to the number of ways to pair the off-diagonal positions and place single rooks on the diagonal positions.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of fixed-point-free involutions plus the involutions with fixed points.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me try to find a combinatorial interpretation of the dp recurrence.

Given dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

dp[3] = 7

dp[4] = 25

Wait, dp[4] = 25?

Wait, earlier calculation:

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

dp[3] = 3 + 4 = 7

dp[4] = 7 + 18 = 25

dp[5] = 25 + 56 = 81

dp[6] = 81 + 250 = 331

As per the code.

But in the second test case, n=8, k=1, m=2, s=6, dp[6]=331, which matches.

So, the recurrence seems to be working.

But I need to understand why this recurrence is correct for the problem.

Let me consider that dp[s] represents the number of possible final configurations on an s x s board with no initial rooks.

Then, dp[s] = dp[s - 1] + 2 * (s - 1) * dp[s - 2]

I need to interpret this.

Perhaps, considering whether to place a rook on the diagonal or not.

If I place a rook on the diagonal at position (s,s), then the computer skips, and I have to continue placing rooks on the remaining (s - 1) x (s - 1) board, which gives dp[s - 1].

Alternatively, if I place a rook off the diagonal, at (r,c), with r < c, then the computer places at (c,r), effectively removing row r and c, and column r and c, which reduces the board to (s - 2) x (s - 2), and there are (s - 1) choices for r and c since r != c.

Wait, more carefully:

If I place a rook at (r,c) with r < c, then the computer places at (c,r), removing rows r and c, and columns r and c, leaving an (s - 2) x (s - 2) board.

The number of ways to choose such a pair (r,c) with r < c is C(s, 2), which is s(s - 1)/2.

But in the recurrence, it's 2 * (s - 1) * dp[s - 2], which is s(s - 1) * dp[s - 2].

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, 2 * (s - 1) * dp[s - 2] is 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2].

But if I consider that for each pair (r,c) with r < c, there are two ways: me placing at (r,c) and computer at (c,r), or me placing at (c,r) and computer at (r,c), but since the mirroring is deterministic, maybe it's only one way.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that dp[s] counts the number of ways to pair rows and columns, with some adjustments for the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of possible pairings in a set, where each pair consists of two distinct elements, and there are also single elements.

But I need to relate it back to the recurrence.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[s] represents the number of possible ways to place non-attacking rooks on an s x s board, with the mirroring rule.

Wait, but in standard non-attacking rook placements, the number of ways to place k rooks is P(s, k), and the total number of ways to place any number of non-attacking rooks is the sum over k of P(s, k), which is (1 + s)(1 + s - 1)...(1 + 1) = (s + 1)! / s! = s + 1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, the total number of ways to place any number of non-attacking rooks on an s x s board is sum_{k=0}^s P(s, k) = sum_{k=0}^s s! / (s - k)!.

But that's not immediately helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in this problem, the placements are paired due to the mirroring.

So, perhaps each pair of rooks (r,c) and (c,r) is considered as a single entity.

Then, the number of such pairs is C(s, 2), and the number of single rooks on the diagonal is s.

Then, the total number of final configurations could be related to the number of ways to choose these pairs and singles without conflict.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that in the remaining s x s board, I can choose to place:

- A pair of rooks at (r,c) and (c,r), where r < c, or

- A single rook on the diagonal at (r,r).

Each pair removes rows r and c and columns r and c.

Each single rook on the diagonal removes row r and column r.

So, the placement can be seen as choosing a set of pairs and singles such that no rows or columns are reused.

This is similar to choosing a matching in a graph where vertices are rows (or columns), and edges represent possible pairings or singles.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of possible matchings in a complete graph with s vertices, where edges represent pairings of rows and columns, and self-loops represent single rooks on the diagonal.

In that case, dp[s] would be the number of possible matchings in K_s, where each matching consists of pairs and singles.

Wait, in graph theory, the number of matchings in a complete graph is related to the telephone numbers or the number of ways to partition the set into subsets of size at most 2.

But in this problem, it's not exactly the same because of the mirroring constraint.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to counting the number of symmetric rook placements.

But I need to think in terms of the recurrence provided.

Given dp[s] = dp[s - 1] + 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2]

Let me interpret this.

The dp[s - 1] term could correspond to placing a single rook on the diagonal at (s,s), which removes row s and column s, reducing the board to (s - 1) x (s - 1).

Then, the 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2] term could correspond to placing a pair of rooks at (r,s) and (s,r), for r from 1 to s - 1, which removes rows r and s, and columns r and s, reducing the board to (s - 2) x (s - 2).

Wait, but in this case, for each r from 1 to s - 1, placing (r,s) and (s,r), there are (s - 1) such pairs, and each reduces the board to (s - 2) x (s - 2), and there are dp[s - 2] ways to continue from there.

So, the total for these pairs would be (s - 1) dp[s - 2].

But in the recurrence, it's 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2].

Where does the factor of 2 come from?

Wait, perhaps because for each r < s, I can choose to place (r,s) and (s,r), and also (s,r) and (r,s), but since the mirroring is deterministic, maybe it's only one way.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of 2 comes from considering both (r,s) and (s,r) as separate choices, but since the computer mirrors, it's only one choice.

I'm getting confused again.

Let me consider that for each r from 1 to s - 1, placing (r,s) forces the computer to place (s,r), and this is considered as one move, reducing the board to (s - 2) x (s - 2).

Similarly, placing (s,r) forces the computer to place (r,s), which is the same as the previous case.

So, perhaps for each r < s, there are two ways: me placing (r,s) or me placing (s,r), each leading to the same pair being placed, and reducing the board to (s - 2) x (s - 2).

Hence, there are 2(s - 1) such choices, each contributing dp[s - 2] ways.

Therefore, dp[s] = dp[s - 1] + 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2]

Where dp[s - 1] corresponds to placing a single rook on the diagonal at (s,s), and 2(s - 1) dp[s - 2] corresponds to placing pairs (r,s) and (s,r) for r from 1 to s - 1, with two choices for each pair.

This seems consistent with the recurrence.

So, the code is correctly computing dp[s], where s = n - m, with m = len(invalid), which is the number of used rows or columns from the initial k moves.

Then, for each test case, it computes s = n - len(invalid), and outputs dp[s], or 1 if s <= 0.

Wait, but in the code, it's max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]).

So, if s <= 0, it outputs 1, otherwise dp[s].

This makes sense because if s <= 0, meaning that all rows and columns are used, there's only one configuration: no more rooks can be placed.

Otherwise, it's dp[s].

Given that, and the recurrence seems to be correctly modeling the problem, I can conclude that the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible on a chessboard after placing rooks with specific constraints. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of configurations.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks share the same row or column).
   - The computer mirrors the player's moves.
   - We need to find the number of possible final configurations after continuing the game from a given state.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Placing a rook at `(r, c)` removes row `r` and column `c` from further placements.
   - The computer mirrors the move by placing a rook at `(c, r)`, removing row `c` and column `r`.
   - If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Solution:**
   - We precompute the number of configurations for boards of size up to `3 * 10^5` using a DP array.
   - The DP array is defined such that `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations for an `i x i` board.
   - The DP recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]
     \]
   - This accounts for placing a rook on the diagonal and placing paired rooks off the diagonal.

4. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, determine the size of the remaining board after accounting for the initial moves.
   - Use the precomputed DP array to fetch the number of configurations for the remaining board.

## Solution Code

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]

def compute_dp(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007

def main():
    compute_dp(300000)
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        invalid = set()
        for _ in range(k):
            r, c = map(int, input().split())
            invalid.add(r)
            invalid.add(c)
        s = n - len(invalid)
        print(max(1, dp[s]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Dynamic Programming Computation:**
  - We initialize `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
  - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, we compute `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation.
  
- **Processing Test Cases:**
  - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
  - Collect the positions of the initial `k` moves and compute the set of invalid rows and columns.
  - Calculate the size `s` of the remaining board (`s = n - len(invalid)`).
  - Output the precomputed `dp[s]` value, ensuring to handle the case where `s <= 0` by outputting 1.

This approach ensures efficient computation within the constraints, leveraging precomputation and dynamic programming to handle large inputs effectively.
