Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game called "Permutation game" involving Bodya and Sasha. They have a permutation and an array, and they play this game for k turns. Each turn, they can choose to stay in their current position or move to a new position based on the permutation. Their score increases by the value of the array at their current position each turn. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores after k turns.

First, I need to understand the input and what's being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get the values n, k, P_B, and P_S, which are the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. Then, there's the permutation p and the array a.

I need to figure out, for each test case, who wins the game: Bodya or Sasha, or if it's a draw. They both play optimally to maximize their scores.

Okay, so the key here is to model the game and find out the maximum score each player can achieve given their moves over k turns.

Let's think about how the game progresses. Each turn, both players simultaneously decide to stay or move to their new position based on the permutation. They collect the value of a[x] where x is their current position.

Since they make moves simultaneously, their decisions don't affect each other directly in terms of positions, but their scores are independent.

So, for each player, I can model their path separately.

Given that, I need to find, for each player, the maximum score they can achieve in k turns, starting from their initial position.

The problem reduces to, for each player, finding the optimal sequence of stays and moves to maximize their total score over k turns.

Now, considering that the permutation defines a structure where each position points to another unique position (since it's a permutation), the movement can form cycles.

Meaning, if a player keeps moving according to the permutation, they will eventually cycle back to a position they've been to before.

This cyclicity is important because it means that after some turns, the player's position starts repeating in a cycle.

Given that, I can model the positions each player visits over time.

But since k can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum score without simulating each turn.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible score for each player in O(n) time or O(n log n) time, considering that n can be up to 2e5 and t can be up to 1e4.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, which is manageable.

So, I need an approach that, for each player, computes their maximum possible score in k turns efficiently.

Let me think about one player first. Let's say Bodya.

He starts at position P_B. Each turn, he can choose to stay or move to p[P_B].

His score increases by a[P_B] each turn.

I need to maximize his total score over k turns.

Similarly for Sasha.

Since they make moves independently, I can treat them separately.

So, the problem boils down to, for each player, finding the maximum possible sum of a[x] over k turns, where x is the player's position each turn, and x can either stay or move to p[x] each turn.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me think about it in terms of DP.

Let’s define dp[i] as the maximum score achievable in i turns.

But since n and k can be large, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where each position is a node, and there's an edge from x to p[x].

Since it's a permutation, this graph will consist of disjoint cycles.

Moreover, in a permutation, every node has exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge, so it's a collection of cycles and trees.

Wait, no, in a permutation, it's a collection of cycles only, because every node has exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge.

So, the permutation forms one or more disjoint cycles.

Given that, I can decompose the permutation into its cycles.

Then, for each player, starting from their initial position, they can choose to stay or move along the cycle.

I need to find the optimal sequence of stays and moves for each player.

But since the cycles are independent, I can handle each cycle separately.

Wait, but actually, since each player moves based on their own choices, and their movements don't affect each other, I can treat each player's path independently.

So, for each player, I need to find the maximum sum of a[x] over k turns, where x can either stay or move to p[x] each turn.

This seems similar to choosing, at each turn, whether to stay or move to the next position in the cycle.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

This sounds like a problem where I need to find the best sequence of stays and moves.

But since k can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming with some optimization.

Let me consider one player.

Let's say the player is at position x.

Each turn, he can choose to stay at x and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]].

Wait, no. Actually, the movement happens after collecting the score.

So, each turn:

1. Collect a[x].

2. Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, the position for the next turn is either x or p[x].

Given that, the player can choose each turn whether to stay or move to p[x].

This seems like a binary choice each turn: stay or move.

But since k can be up to 1e9, I need a smarter way than simulating each turn.

Let me think about the structure of the permutation.

As I thought earlier, the permutation forms cycles.

So, if I can identify the cycle that the player is in, I can model their movement within that cycle.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose the player starts at position x0.

Each turn, they can choose to stay at x0 or move to x1 = p[x0].

If they stay, their position remains x0; if they move, their position becomes x1.

Then, in the next turn, if they stay at x0, they collect a[x0] again; if they move from x0 to x1, they collect a[x1], and so on.

So, effectively, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

This seems complex to model directly.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving.

So, in the sequence of k turns, the player can decide to stay at position x for some turns, then move to p[x], stay there for some turns, and so on.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over these k turns.

This sounds like choosing a sequence of positions where each position can be repeated any number of times, but the movement is constrained by staying or moving to p[x].

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one to itself (stay) and one to p[x] (move).

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum path in this graph with exactly k steps, starting from the initial position.

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the cycle structure more carefully.

Since the permutation forms cycles, and the player can choose to stay or move along the cycle, I can think about the cycle they are in and the possible positions they can be in after k turns.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as moving along the cycle with a choice to stay put for any number of turns.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose the player is in a cycle of length m: x0 -> x1 -> ... -> x_{m-1} -> x0.

At each turn, the player can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the cycle.

So, in terms of the cycle, the player can choose to advance 0 or 1 step in the cycle each turn.

Given that, the player's position after k turns can be modeled as being at a position that is some number of steps ahead in the cycle, considering the stays and moves.

But I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over these k turns.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of dynamic programming over the cycle.

Let me define dp[i][j], where i is the turn number, and j is the current position in the cycle.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay or move forward each turn.

So, in k turns, the player can be at any position in the cycle, having stayed there for some turns.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of steps taken along the cycle.

Let’s say the player starts at position x0.

In k turns, the player can have moved forward c steps in the cycle, where 0 <= c <= k.

Then, the player would have stayed at various positions for some turns.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose the player decides to move forward s times and stay k - s times.

Then, the total steps advanced in the cycle would be s modulo m, since the cycle repeats every m steps.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Maybe I need to consider the contributions from staying at each position.

Let’s think about it this way: the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

So, the total score is the sum of a[x] over the positions x where the player chooses to stay.

But since the player can choose to stay multiple turns at the same position, the score from that position is a[x] multiplied by the number of turns spent there.

Wait, no. According to the problem, each turn, the player collects a[x] at the current position and then chooses to stay or move.

So, for each turn, the player collects a[x], and then decides whether to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in k turns, the player can choose to stay at x for t turns, collecting t * a[x], and then move to p[x], and so on.

But this seems tricky to model directly.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the positions are connected via the permutation.

I need a better way to model this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible contribution from each position in the cycle.

Wait, maybe I can find, for each position in the cycle, the maximum possible score if the player chooses to stay there for some turns.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

In the first sample input:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3] (0-based: [3,0,1,2])

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, Bodya starts at position 2 (1-based, 0-based index 1), which has a[1]=5.

Sasha starts at position 1 (0-based index 0), which has a[0]=7.

In the first turn:

- Bodya can stay at 2 and collect 5, or move to p[2]=1 (0-based p[1]=0), which is position 1.

- Sasha can stay at 1 and collect 7, or move to p[1]=0, which is position 4 (but n=4, so position 4 doesn't exist; wait, p[1]=0, which is position 1.

Wait, p is 1-based in the input, but in the code, it's adjusted to 0-based.

Wait, in the code, p[i] is adjusted to 0-based.

So, p = [3,0,1,2]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, Bodya starts at position 3 (0-based index 2, since P_B=3 1-based), a[2]=5.

Sasha starts at position 1 (0-based index 0), a[0]=7.

First turn:

- Bodya: stay at 2 (collect 5) or move to p[2]=1 (collect 2).

- Sasha: stay at 1 (collect 7) or move to p[1]=0 (collect 7 again, since p[1]=0, which is position 1).

Wait, p[1]=0, which is position 1 (0-based).

Wait, but in the explanation, it says:

Turn | Bodya's position | Bodya's score | Bodya's move | Sasha's position | Sasha's score | Sasha's move

First | 3 | 0 + 5 = 5 | stays | 2 | 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p[2]=1

Second | 3 | 5 + 5 = 10 | stays | 1 | 2 + 7 = 9 | stays

So, in 0-based indices:

- Bodya starts at 2 (position 3), a[2]=5

- Sasha starts at 0 (position 1), a[0]=7

First turn:

- Bodya stays at 2, collects 5

- Sasha moves to p[0]=3, which is position 4, but n=4, so perhaps position 4 doesn't exist? Wait, n=4, positions 0 to 3.

Wait, p[0]=3, which is position 4 in 1-based indexing.

But in 0-based, p[0]=3 corresponds to position 4 in 1-based.

But n=4, so positions 0 to 3.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in indexing.

Wait, in the problem statement, p is 1-based, but in the code, it's adjusted to 0-based.

In the sample input:

p = [4,1,2,3]

But n=4, so p[4] would be position 4, but in 0-based, p[3]=3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the sample.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says:

- Bodya starts at position 3 (1-based, 0-based index 2), a[2]=5

- Sasha starts at position 2 (1-based, 0-based index 1), a[1]=2

Wait, in the input, P_B=3, P_S=2, which are 1-based positions.

So, 1-based position 3 is 0-based position 2.

1-based position 2 is 0-based position 1.

p = [4,1,2,3] (1-based), so in 0-based: [3,0,1,2]

a = [7,2,5,6] (0-based)

So, Bodya starts at position 2 (0-based), a[2]=5

Sasha starts at position 1 (0-based), a[1]=2

In the first turn:

- Bodya can stay at 2 and collect 5, or move to p[2]=1 (0-based p[2]=1, which is position 1)

- Sasha can stay at 1 and collect 2, or move to p[1]=0 (which is position 1 again, since p[1]=0)

Wait, p[1]=0, which is position 1 in 1-based.

Wait, but in the explanation, Sasha moves to p[2]=1, but in the input, P_S=2, which is position 1 (0-based index 1).

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the sample input.

Wait, in the first test case:

4 2 3 2

p = 4 1 2 3

a = 7 2 5 6

So, n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2 (1-based)

p in 0-based: [3,0,1,2]

a in 0-based: [7,2,5,6]

Bodya starts at position 2 (0-based), a[2]=5

Sasha starts at position 1 (0-based), a[1]=2

In the first turn:

- Bodya can stay at 2 and collect 5, or move to p[2]=1, collect a[1]=2

- Sasha can stay at 1 and collect 2, or move to p[1]=0, collect a[0]=7

In the explanation, Bodya stays at 2 (collects 5), Sasha moves to p[2]=1 (which is position 2 in 1-based, but in 0-based p[1]=0, which is position 1).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, p[1]=0 in 0-based, which is position 1 in 1-based.

Wait, perhaps I need to stick to 0-based indexing to avoid confusion.

Let me re-express the sample input in 0-based indexing:

n=4, k=2, P_B=2 (0-based), P_S=1 (0-based)

p = [3,0,1,2]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, Bodya starts at position 2, a[2]=5

Sasha starts at position 1, a[1]=2

First turn:

- Bodya: stay at 2, collect 5; or move to p[2]=1, collect a[1]=2

- Sasha: stay at 1, collect 2; or move to p[1]=0, collect a[0]=7

In the explanation, Bodya stays at 2 (collects 5), Sasha moves to p[1]=0 (position 1 in 1-based, but in 0-based, position 0, which is position 1 in 1-based? Wait, positions are 0-based in code, 1-based in input.

Wait, perhaps I need to consistently use 0-based indexing.

Given that, p[1]=0 means Sasha moves to position 0, which has a[0]=7.

Second turn:

- Bodya: stay at 2, collect 5; or move to p[2]=1, collect a[1]=2

- Sasha: stay at 0, collect a[0]=7; or move to p[0]=3, collect a[3]=6

In the explanation, Bodya stays at 2 (collects 5), Sasha stays at 0 (collects 7)

Total scores:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9

Hence, Bodya wins.

So, in this case, Bodya chooses to stay put both turns, collecting 5 each turn, total 10.

Sasha chooses to move to position 0 in the first turn (collecting 7), and then stays at position 0 in the second turn (collecting another 7), but in the explanation, it's shown as moving to p[2]=1 in the first turn and then staying at 1 in the second turn.

Wait, there might be a confusion in the explanation.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

First turn:

- Bodya stays at 3, collects 5

- Sasha moves from 2 to 1, collects 2

Wait, in 0-based:

- Bodya stays at 2, collects 5

- Sasha moves from 1 to p[1]=0, collects a[0]=7

But in the explanation, it says Sasha moves from 2 to 1, collects 2.

Wait, perhaps the explanation has a mistake, or I'm misinterpreting the positions.

This confusion is not helping. I need to find a general approach without getting stuck on the sample.

Let me try to think differently.

Each player can choose, at each turn, to stay at their current position or move to p[x].

So, for each player, their position at turn t depends on their decision at turn t-1.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current position and the number of turns taken.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if a player chooses to stay at a position for multiple turns, they collect a[x] for each of those turns.

If they choose to move, they transition to p[x] and can then choose to stay or move again.

I need to maximize the sum over k turns.

This seems like finding the maximum possible sum of a[x] over a path of length k, where at each step, you can choose to stay or move to p[x].

This is similar to a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one to itself (stay) and one to p[x] (move).

Given that, the graph for each player is a tree, specifically a tree with cycles, but in this case, since p is a permutation, it's a collection of disjoint cycles.

Given that, I can consider each cycle separately.

For a single cycle, say of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing how many times to stay at each position in the cycle over k turns.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can be at any position in the cycle at any time, but their movement is constrained by staying or moving to the next position in the cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can model the player's position after t turns as being at a certain step in the cycle, considering the number of moves they've chosen to make.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the fact that the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

So, in k turns, the player can choose to stay at position x for t turns, collect t * a[x], and then move to p[x], and so on.

This seems similar to partitioning k turns into segments where the player stays at a particular position for some turns before moving to the next position.

Given that, the maximum sum would be achieved by staying as much as possible at the positions with the highest a[x].

But since the player has to move according to the permutation, they can't choose arbitrary positions; they have to follow the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each cycle, the maximum possible sum by choosing how many turns to stay at each position in the cycle.

But this still seems too slow for large k.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, repeating choices every m steps would cycle back.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute the maximum sum efficiently.

Perhaps I can find the maximum sum per cycle and then scale it up for k turns.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the positions are connected in a cycle.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the fact that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move.

So, for each turn, the player has two choices: stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Wait, no. They collect a[x] first, then choose to stay or move.

So, in turn t:

1. Collect a[x_t]

2. Choose to stay at x_t or move to p[x_t], which determines x_{t+1}

I need to maximize the sum of a[x_t] for t from 1 to k.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem where dp[t][x] is the maximum sum after t turns, ending at position x.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each player, the movement forms a cycle, and within that cycle, the player can choose to stay or move along the cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each position in the cycle, the maximum sum if the player stays there for some turns before moving.

But I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

So, the player can choose to stay at position x for t turns, collect t * a[x], then move to p[x], stay there for s turns, collect s * a[p[x]], and so on.

Given that, the total number of turns is k.

I need to maximize the sum of t * a[x] + s * a[p[x]] + ...

This seems like maximizing the sum of a[x] weighted by the number of turns spent at each position, with the constraint that the total turns are k.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a sequence of positions where the player stays for some turns before moving.

But again, with k up to 1e9, I need something faster.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the positions are connected in a cycle.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by staying as much as possible at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

But there might be multiple cycles, and the player can only move along their own cycle.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each cycle, the position with the highest a[x], and then have the player stay there for as many turns as possible.

But what if there are multiple positions with high a[x] in the cycle?

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but moving incurs a cost in terms of not collecting a[x] for the turns spent moving.

Wait, no, actually, moving is a choice that affects the position for the next turn.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the sequence of positions is constrained by the cycle.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the fact that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, and I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each position in the cycle, the maximum contribution if the player chooses to stay there for some turns.

But I need a way to model this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum a[x] in the cycle and find how many turns the player can spend there.

But again, this seems too simplistic.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at the position with the highest a[x] for as many turns as possible.

Then, for the remaining turns, they can move to other positions.

But this might not always be optimal, especially if there are multiple high a[x] positions.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the positions in the cycle by a[x] in descending order and have the player stay at the highest a[x] for as many turns as possible.

But I need to consider the movement constraints.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix a cycle and consider that the player can choose to stay or move along the cycle.

Then, the player's path can be represented as a sequence of positions where they choose to stay or move.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a linear sequence where the player can choose to stay or move to the next position.

But in a cycle, the sequence wraps around.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

Given that, perhaps I can model the maximum sum as the sum of a[x] multiplied by the number of turns spent at x, for all x in the cycle, with the total turns equal to k.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible a[x] in the cycle and have the player stay there for all k turns.

But that's only possible if the player can stay there indefinitely, which they can, because they can choose to stay at any position.

Wait, but in a cycle, if the player chooses to stay at a position, they can stay there for any number of turns before moving.

So, in theory, the player can choose to stay at the position with the highest a[x] for as many turns as they want.

Given that, the maximum sum would be k multiplied by the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

But is that correct?

Wait, no. Because in some cycles, the player might have to move to other positions where a[x] is higher.

Wait, no, they can choose to stay at the position with the highest a[x] forever.

Wait, but in the sample input, that's not what happened.

In the first sample input, Bodya stays at position 2 (a[2]=5), collecting 5 each turn, while Sasha moves to position 1 (a[1]=2) and then stays at position 1 (a[1]=2), collecting 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, a[1]=2, but in the explanation, Sasha moves to position 1 and collects 7.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the indexing.

Wait, in the input, p = [4,1,2,3], which in 0-based is [3,0,1,2], and a = [7,2,5,6].

So, position 0: a[0]=7

position 1: a[1]=2

position 2: a[2]=5

position 3: a[3]=6

So, Sasha starts at position 1 (a[1]=2), moves to position 0 (a[0]=7), and stays there, collecting 7 + 7 = 14.

But in the explanation, it's shown as collecting 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, perhaps the explanation is wrong, or I'm misinterpreting something.

Given that confusion, perhaps the correct approach is that the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns, collecting a[x] each turn they stay there.

Given that, the maximum sum would be achieved by staying at the position with the maximum a[x] for all k turns.

Hence, the maximum sum is k * max(a[x] for x in the cycle).

Given that, for each player, I can find the cycle they are in, find the maximum a[x] in that cycle, and set their score to k * max(a[x]).

Then, compare the two scores to determine the winner.

This seems straightforward and efficient.

Let me verify this with the sample input.

In the first test case:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3 (0-based 2), P_S=2 (0-based 1)

p = [3,0,1,2]

a = [7,2,5,6]

Cycle containing position 2: 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 2 (cycle length 4)

Maximum a[x] in the cycle: max(a[2]=5, a[1]=2, a[0]=7, a[3]=6) = 7

So, Bodya's maximum sum: 2 * 7 = 14

Similarly, Sasha starts at position 1, which is in the same cycle, so his maximum sum is also 2 * 7 = 14

But in the explanation, Bodya's score is 10 and Sasha's is 9, leading to Bodya winning.

This contradicts my current approach.

Hence, my approach must be wrong.

So, perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the player can only stay at a position if they choose to stay; they can't skip positions in the cycle by staying.

Wait, no, they can stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the movement more carefully.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move to p[x].

So, their position in turn t depends on their decision in turn t-1.

Hence, dp[t][x] = max(dp[t-1][x] + a[x], dp[t-1][prev[x]] + a[x]), where prev[x] is the position before x in the cycle.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but they have to follow the cycle when they choose to move.

Given that, perhaps I need to model the cycle and find the optimal distribution of turns among the positions in the cycle.

But I need a better way.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the sequence of positions is constrained by the cycle.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a cycle and compute, for each position in the cycle, the maximum sum if the player starts at that position and has k turns.

Then, I can use this to compute the maximum sum for each player.

But I still need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a Markov chain, where at each step, the player can choose to stay or move.

But I don't have the tools to handle that efficiently for k up to 1e9.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

Hence, the maximum sum would be the sum of a[x] multiplied by the number of turns spent at x, with the constraint that the total turns are k.

Given that, perhaps I can find the positions in the cycle sorted by a[x] in descending order and have the player spend as many turns as possible at the highest a[x], then the next highest, and so on, until k turns are exhausted.

But I need to consider the cycle structure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset of positions in the cycle and assigning turns to them, respecting the cycle structure.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but they have to move along the cycle when they choose to move.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by spending as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[x], but considering the cycle structure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle and have the player stay there for as many turns as possible, moving only when necessary.

But in the sample input, that doesn't seem to be the case, as Bodya stayed at position 2 (a[2]=5), which is not the maximum in the cycle (a[0]=7).

Hence, my initial approach is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay or move each turn, and I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one to itself (stay) and one to p[x] (move).

Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum path in this graph with exactly k steps, starting from the initial position.

Given that, perhaps I can use matrix exponentiation to compute the maximum sum efficiently.

But I need to define the transition matrix appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a weighted graph and use dynamic programming with matrix exponentiation.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me define, for each position x, dp[x][t] as the maximum sum after t turns, ending at position x.

Then, dp[x][t] = max(dp[x][t-1] + a[x], dp[prev[x]][t-1] + a[x])

Where prev[x] is the position before x in the cycle.

But this seems too slow for large k.

Wait, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence and use matrix exponentiation.

But I need to define the transitions properly.

Given that, perhaps for each cycle, I can represent the transitions as a matrix and raise it to the power of k to find the maximum sum.

But I need to figure out how to set up the matrix.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay or move, and I can represent the choices as a sequence of stays and moves.

Given that, perhaps I can find the optimal number of stays at each position.

But again, this seems too slow.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the positions are connected in a cycle.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by spending as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[x], but considering the cycle structure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the cycle, finding the maximum a[x], and then have the player stay there for as many turns as possible.

But in the sample input, that doesn't match the explanation.

Hence, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose the player is in a cycle, and they can choose to stay or move each turn.

Then, the player can choose to traverse the cycle at their own pace, spending any number of turns at each position before moving on.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by spending as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[x], but considering that moving incurs a cost in terms of not collecting a[x].

Wait, no, moving is just a choice that determines the next position, but the collection happens before moving.

Hence, moving doesn't directly affect the collection; it's just about choosing where to collect.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is indeed k times the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

But in the sample input, that's not what happened.

In the sample input, Bodya collected 10, which is 2*5, but according to this approach, it should be 2*7=14.

But according to the explanation, Bodya stayed at position 2 (a[2]=5), collecting 5 each turn, for a total of 10.

But according to my approach, he could have achieved 14 by staying at position 0 (a[0]=7).

But in the cycle, to reach position 0, he needs to move from position 2 to position 1 to position 0.

But in k=2 turns, he might not be able to reach position 0 and stay there for both turns.

Wait, perhaps that's the issue.

In k=2 turns, maybe he can't reach the position with a[x]=7 and stay there for both turns.

Hence, my initial approach is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to consider the number of moves required to reach the position with the maximum a[x].

In the sample input, from position 2, Bodya can move to position 1 (a[1]=2), then to position 0 (a[0]=7), but in k=2 turns, he can only reach position 0 in one move, and then stay there for the second turn.

Hence, his possible sequences are:

- Stay at 2 for both turns: collect 5 + 5 = 10

- Move to 1 in the first turn, collect a[1]=2, then stay at 1 in the second turn, collect a[1]=2: total 4

- Move to 1 in the first turn, collect a[1]=2, then move to 0 in the second turn, collect a[0]=7: total 9

- Stay at 2 in the first turn, collect 5, then move to 1 in the second turn, collect a[1]=2: total 7

- Stay at 2 in the first turn, collect 5, then move to 1 in the second turn, collect a[1]=2: total 7

- Move to 1 in the first turn, collect a[1]=2, then move to 0 in the second turn, collect a[0]=7: total 9

- Move to 1 in the first turn, collect a[1]=2, then move to 0 in the second turn, collect a[0]=7: total 9

- Move to 1 in the first turn, collect a[1]=2, then move to 0 in the second turn, collect a[0]=7: total 9

Among these, the maximum is 10, which is staying at 2 for both turns.

Hence, in this case, staying at the initial position yields a higher sum than trying to reach a position with a higher a[x].

Hence, my initial approach is incorrect.

Therefore, I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that for each player, I can simulate their movement over k turns, choosing to stay or move in a way that maximizes their sum.

But with k up to 1e9, simulation is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns before moving.

Hence, the player can choose to cycle through the positions in any order, spending any number of turns at each position.

Given that, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by spending turns at positions in a way that maximizes the total sum.

Wait, but this is too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a cycle and find the position with the highest a[x].

Then, the player can choose to reach that position and stay there for as many turns as possible.

But in some cases, like the sample input, reaching that position might not be feasible within k turns.

Hence, perhaps I need to compute the maximum sum by considering the time it takes to reach the position with the highest a[x] and then staying there for the remaining turns.

But this might not always be optimal, as there could be positions with high a[x] that are closer to the starting position.

Given that, perhaps I need to compute, for each position in the cycle, the maximum sum if the player chooses to stay at that position for some turns and move elsewhere for the remaining turns.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that in a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but the sequence is constrained by the cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a linear path where the player can choose to stay or move, and then handle the cycle by considering the periodicity.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length m, the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, but their choices are interdependent due to the cycle structure.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each player, their movement forms a cycle, and within that cycle, they can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

Hence, for each cycle, I can precompute the maximum sum achievable in k turns.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a linear programming problem, where the player can allocate
