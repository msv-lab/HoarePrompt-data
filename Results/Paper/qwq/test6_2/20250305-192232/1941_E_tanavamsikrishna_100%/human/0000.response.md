Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bernard has to cross a river on a ferry, and he's always late. Rudolf wants to help by building bridges across the river to make the crossing faster. The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns, and each cell has a depth value a_{i,j}. The depths on the first and last columns are always 0, which represent the river banks.

Rudolf can build a bridge on any row, and to build a bridge, he needs to install supports in certain cells. The rules are:

1. A support must be installed in the first cell of the row (column 1).

2. A support must be installed in the last cell of the row (column m).

3. The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d, where distance is defined as |j1 - j2| - 1.

The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

Moreover, Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows and minimize the total cost of installing supports for all these bridges.

Given multiple test cases, I need to output the minimum total cost for each test case.

First, I need to understand how to minimize the cost for a single bridge on a row. Then, since bridges are built on consecutive rows, I need to find a sequence of k consecutive rows where the sum of the individual bridge costs is minimized.

Let's focus on a single row first. Given a row with m columns, where a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0, I need to place supports such that:

- Supports are placed at column 1 and column m.

- Any two adjacent supports are at most d columns apart.

The cost is the sum of (a_{i,j} + 1) for each support j placed.

I need an efficient way to find the minimum cost for each row.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. I can define dp[j] as the minimum cost to build the bridge up to column j, given the constraints.

The base cases are:

- dp[0] = 0 (no cost before the first column)

- dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1 = 1 (since a_{i,1} = 0)

Then, for each j from 2 to m, dp[j] can be calculated by considering all possible previous support columns k, where j - k - 1 <= d (i.e., the distance between k and j is at most d).

So, dp[j] = min over k (dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1), where k < j and j - k - 1 <= d.

But this approach would be O(m^2) per row, which is too slow because m can be up to 2*10^5.

I need a faster way to compute dp[j].

I recall that when the transition depends on a range of previous states, a sliding window minimum can be used, often implemented with a deque or a heap.

Let me think about using a sliding window minimum for this dp.

Define the recurrence:

dp[j] = min over k in [j - d - 1, j - 1] (dp[k]) + a_{i,j} + 1

Wait, no. The distance between k and j is |j - k| - 1 <= d, so k must be in [j - d - 1, j - 1].

But indices are from 1 to m, and j - k - 1 <= d implies k >= j - d - 1.

But since k must be less than j, and k >= j - d - 1, and k >=1.

So, for each j, the possible k are from max(1, j - d - 1) to j - 1.

I need to find the minimum dp[k] in this range [max(1, j - d - 1), j - 1], and then dp[j] = min_dp_k + a_{i,j} + 1.

To compute this efficiently, I can maintain a sliding window of size d+1, but since the window is for k in [j - d - 1, j - 1], which is a window of size d or d+1.

But maintaining a sliding window minimum can be done using a deque.

I'll review the sliding window minimum technique.

Maintain a deque that stores indices of dp elements in increasing order of their values.

For each j from 1 to m:

- Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are less than j - d - 1.

- Remove indices from the back of the deque if dp[j - 1] is less than dp[back].

- Add j - 1 to the back of the deque.

- dp[j] = dp[front] + a_{i,j} + 1

Wait, I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me think again.

I'll initialize dp[1] = 1 (since a_{i,1} = 0).

Then, for j from 2 to m:

- Keep a window of k from j - d - 1 to j - 1.

- Find the minimum dp[k] in this window.

- dp[j] = min_dp_k + a_{i,j} + 1

To implement this efficiently, I can use a deque to maintain the indices in the window in increasing order of their dp values.

Here's how:

- Initialize an empty deque.

- For each j from 1 to m:

- While the deque is not empty and the front index is less than j - d - 1, remove it.

- If j > 1, dp[j] = dp[deque[0]] + a_{i,j} + 1

- While the deque is not empty and dp[j - 1] <= dp[deque[-1]], remove the last index.

- Append j - 1 to the deque.

Wait, I need to make sure that the deque only contains indices within the current window.

Also, for j = 1, dp[1] = 1.

For j = 2 to m:

- Remove indices from the front if they are less than j - d - 1.

- dp[j] = dp[deque[0]] + a_{i,j} + 1

- Remove indices from the back if dp[j - 1] <= dp[deque[-1]]

- Append j - 1 to the deque.

Yes, this should work.

This way, dp[j] is computed using the minimum dp[k] in the window [j - d - 1, j - 1].

After processing all rows, I can compute the total cost for each sequence of k consecutive rows and find the minimum among them.

Now, considering that n and m can be up to 100 and 2*10^5 respectively, and t up to 10^3, but with the constraint that n*m <= 2*10^5 per test case, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient.

The sliding window minimum approach for each row is O(m), and since n can be up to 100, and t up to 10^3, but with n*m <= 2*10^5 per test case, it should be acceptable.

Now, in the code provided, there's a function func_1 that seems to implement this sliding window minimum approach for a single row.

Let me look at func_1:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Wait, this seems to be using a heap to maintain the minimum over the window, but it's not exactly matching my earlier deque-based approach.

Let me see.

It sets row[0] = 1, which is correct.

Then, for i in range(1, d), it sets row[i] = row[i] + 2.

Wait, why row[i] = row[i] + 2?

Wait, in my earlier approach, for j from 2 to m, dp[j] = min_dp_k + a_{i,j} + 1.

But in this code, it's directly modifying row[i].

Wait, perhaps row represents dp.

Let me rename it for clarity.

Let's assume dp = row.

So dp[0] = 1.

Then, for i in range(1, d):

dp[i] = dp[i] + 2.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, dp[1] = 1, and dp[j] = min_dp_k + a_{i,j} + 1 for j >=2.

I think there might be some confusion in indexing.

In the problem, columns are from 1 to m, but in the code, it's using 0-based indexing.

So, dp[0] corresponds to column 1.

dp[1] corresponds to column 2, and so on.

Wait, in the problem, row indices are i from 1 to n, and column indices j from 1 to m.

In the code, row[0] corresponds to j=1, row[1] to j=2, ..., row[m-1] to j=m.

So, dp[j-1] = cost up to column j.

Wait, but in the code, it's modifying row[i] directly.

Wait, perhaps row represents dp.

Let me see.

row[0] = 1, which is dp[1] = 1.

Then, for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, dp[2] = dp[k] + a_{i,2} + 1, where k can be 1.

But a_{i,1} = 0, so dp[2] = dp[1] + a_{i,2} + 1 = 1 + a_{i,2} + 1 = a_{i,2} + 2.

Similarly, dp[3] = min over k in [2 - d -1, 2], which is [1,2], dp[k] + a_{i,3} +1.

But in the code, it's setting row[i] = row[i] + 2 for i in range(1,d).

This seems specific and might not be general.

I think there might be a mistake here.

Let me consider a small example.

Take n=1, m=4, k=1, d=1.

Row: [0,1,2,0]

According to the problem, supports must be at column 1 and 4.

The possible supports are:

- Only at 1 and 4: distance between 1 and 4 is 4-1-1=2 > d=1, so invalid.

- At 1, 3, and 4: distance between 1 and 3 is 1, between 3 and 4 is 0, both <=1.

Cost: (0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.

- At 1, 2, and 4: distance between 1 and 2 is 0, between 2 and 4 is 1, both <=1.

Cost: (0+1) + (1+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So minimum cost is 4.

Now, according to the code:

row = [0,1,2,0]

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1,1): # d=1, so range is empty

pass

min_heap = [(e,i) for i,e in enumerate(row[:1])] = [(1,0)]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(1,4):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (1 + 2) = i - 3:

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i],i))

For i=1:

e = (1,0), which 0 <= 1 - 3 = -2 is False, so no popping.

row[1] = 1 + 1 +1 = 3

heappush min_heap (1,0) and (3,1)

For i=2:

e = (1,0), 0 <= 2-3=-1, which is True, so pop (1,0)

now min_heap is empty

e = heappop(min_heap), which is empty, so error.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the heap correctly.

Let me try again.

For i=1:

min_heap = [(1,0)]

e = heappop(min_heap): (1,0)

1 <= 1 - 3 = -2? No, so put it back.

row[1] = 1 + 1 +1 = 3

heappush min_heap (1,0) and (3,1)

min_heap = [(1,0), (3,1)]

For i=2:

min_heap = [(1,0),(3,1)]

e = heappop(min_heap): (1,0)

1 <= 2 - 3 = -1? No, so put it back.

row[2] = 1 + 2 +1 = 4

heappush min_heap (1,0) and (4,2)

min_heap = [(1,0), (3,1), (4,2)]

For i=3:

min_heap = [(1,0),(3,1),(4,2)]

e = heappop(min_heap): (1,0)

1 <= 3 - 3 = 0? No, so put it back.

row[3] = 1 + 0 +1 = 2

heappush min_heap (1,0) and (2,3)

min_heap = [(1,0),(2,3),(3,1),(4,2)]

Finally, return row[-1] = 2

But according to the earlier calculation, the minimum cost should be 4.

So there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the heap condition.

Let me check the condition in the while loop.

In the code:

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

Wait, i - (d + 2) = i - 3 for d=1.

In my earlier step, for i=1, e[1]=0 <= 1 - 3 = -2? No.

For i=2, e[1]=0 <= 2 - 3 = -1? No.

For i=3, e[1]=0 <= 3 - 3 =0? No.

So in all cases, e is put back into the heap.

Thus, row[3] = e[0] + row[3] +1 = 1 + 0 +1 =2

But the correct cost should be 4.

So the code is incorrect.

I think the condition in the while loop is wrong.

I need to ensure that I'm only considering k such that j - k -1 <=d, i.e., k >= j - d -1.

In the heap, I need to remove elements whose indices are less than j - d -1.

Wait, in the code, it's e[1] <= i - (d + 2), which is j - d -1? Wait, j = i+1, since 0-based indexing.

Wait, I need to map indices correctly.

Let me try to fix the condition.

I think it should be while e[1] < j - d -1, i.e., e[1] < i - d.

Because j = i +1, so j - d -1 = i - d.

So, while e[1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

Then, row[i] = e[0] + row[i] +1

And heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

Let me adjust the code accordingly.

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Wait, in the original code, it was using heappop in the while loop, which is not necessary.

I should just check the front of the heap without popping it, unless it's outside the window.

In the standard sliding window minimum implementation, we only pop from the heap if the index is outside the window.

So, corrected func_1 would be:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Now, let's test this with the earlier example.

n=1, m=4, k=1, d=1

row = [0,1,2,0]

func_1(row,1):

row[0] =1

for i in range(1,1): # nothing

min_heap = [(0,0)]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(1,4):

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i -1:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i],i))

For i=1:

min_heap[0] = (0,0), which 0 < 1 -1=0? No.

row[1] = 0 +1 +1 =2

heappush (2,1)

min_heap = [(0,0),(2,1)]

For i=2:

min_heap[0] = (0,0), which 0 < 2 -1=1? Yes, pop (0,0)

now min_heap = [(2,1)]

row[2] = 2 +2 +1 =5

heappush (5,2)

min_heap = [(2,1),(5,2)]

For i=3:

min_heap[0] = (2,1), which 1 < 3 -1=2? No.

row[3] =2 +0 +1=3

heappush (3,3)

min_heap = [(2,1),(3,3),(5,2)]

Return row[-1] =3

But earlier, the correct cost was 4.

Wait, perhaps there's still a mistake.

Wait, in the example, the minimum cost is 4, but according to this, it's 3.

So, the code is still incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the initialization or the recurrence.

Let me double-check the recurrence.

dp[j] = min over k in [j - d -1, j -1] dp[k] + a_{i,j} +1

In code, for i from d to m-1:

dp[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

where min_heap contains dp[k] for k in [i -d, i-1]

Wait, but in the example, for i=3 (j=4):

min_heap[0][0] =2 (from i=1, dp[1]=1, but it was popped because 0 < 2)

Wait, let's see step by step.

Initialize dp[0] =1

For i=1:

min_heap = [(0,0)]

Check if 0 <1-1=0: No

dp[1] =0 +1 +1=2

heappush (2,1)

For i=2:

min_heap = [(0,0),(2,1)]

Check if 0 <2-1=1: Yes, pop (0,0)

Now min_heap = [(2,1)]

dp[2] =2 +2 +1=5

heappush (5,2)

For i=3:

min_heap = [(2,1),(5,2)]

Check if 1 <3-1=2: No

dp[3] =2 +0 +1=3

heappush (3,3)

So, dp[3]=3, but correct cost is 4.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence is wrong.

Wait, in the earlier manual calculation, the correct cost is 4, achieved by placing supports at columns 1,2,4.

According to dp[j], dp[4] should include the cost up to column 4.

Wait, in the code, row[-1] corresponds to dp[m-1], which is column m.

So, dp[m-1] should include the cost up to column m, which includes the support at column m.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence is missing something.

Wait, in the manual calculation, dp[j] should include the cost of the support at column j.

So, dp[j] = min over k in [j - d -1, j -1] (dp[k] + a_{i,j} +1)

But in the example, dp[3] = min(dp[2] + a_{i,4} +1, dp[1] + a_{i,4} +1)

dp[2] =5, dp[1]=2, a_{i,4}=0

So dp[3] = min(5 +0 +1, 2 +0 +1) = min(6,3)=3

But the correct cost is 4.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence is incorrect.

I think the issue is that the support at column m must be included, but the recurrence might not be accounting for it properly.

Wait, in the manual calculation, to achieve cost 4, supports are placed at 1,2,4.

dp[4] = dp[2] + a_{i,4} +1 =5 +0 +1=6, which is higher than dp[1] + a_{i,4} +1=2 +0 +1=3, but 3 is less than 4, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence needs to enforce that the last support is at column m.

Wait, no, the last support must be at column m, but the previous supports can be placed optimally.

I think I need to adjust the recurrence.

Let me consider that the support at column m is mandatory, and the previous supports must satisfy the distance constraint up to column m.

Maybe I need to ensure that the last support is at column m, and the previous supports are placed such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

I need to make sure that the path of supports from column 1 to column m adheres to the distance constraint.

Perhaps the standard sliding window minimum approach needs to be adjusted to ensure that the last support is at column m.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that dp[j] represents the minimum cost to build the bridge up to and including column j, with supports placed according to the rules.

In that case, dp[j] = min over k in [j - d -1, j -1] dp[k] + a_{i,j} +1, with dp[1] = a_{i,1} +1 =1.

In the example:

dp[1] =1

dp[2] = min(dp[1]) + a_{i,2} +1 =1 +1 +1=3

dp[3] = min(dp[2]) + a_{i,3} +1 =3 +2 +1=6

dp[4] = min(dp[3], dp[2], dp[1}) + a_{i,4} +1 = min(6,3,2) +0 +1=2 +1=3

But the correct cost is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the last support is at column m, and that the previous support is within d columns.

In the manual calculation, to have the last support at column 4, the previous support must be at least column 3 (since d=1, distance <=1).

So, dp[4] should be min(dp[3] + a_{i,4} +1, dp[2] + a_{i,4} +1), but only considering k where j - k -1 <=d.

So, for j=4, k can be 3 or 2.

dp[4] = min(dp[3] + a_{i,4} +1, dp[2} + a_{i,4} +1) = min(6 +0 +1, 3 +0 +1)= min(7,4)=4

But according to the code, it's coming out as 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's implementation.

Wait, in the code, for i in range(d, len(row)):

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i -d:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i],i))

In the example, d=1, m=4.

For i=2 (j=3):

min_heap = [(0,0),(2,1)]

Check if 0 <2 -1=1: Yes, pop (0,0)

Now min_heap = [(2,1)]

row[2] =2 +2 +1=5

heappush (5,2)

For i=3 (j=4):

min_heap = [(2,1),(5,2)]

Check if 1 <3 -1=2: Yes, pop (2,1)

Now min_heap = [(5,2)]

row[3] =5 +0 +1=6

heappush (6,3)

So, dp[4]=6, but according to manual calculation, dp[4] should be 4.

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the manual calculation, dp[4] = min(dp[3] + a_{i,4} +1, dp[2} + a_{i,4} +1) = min(5 +0 +1, 3 +0 +1)= min(6,4)=4

But in the code, dp[3]=6.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence needs to consider that a_{i,j} +1 is only added once for each support.

Wait, no, a_{i,j} +1 is the cost of installing a support at j.

But in the dp[j], it's including the cost of the support at j.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should only include the cost of the support at j if it's placed, but considering the constraints.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to model it differently.

Let me consider that dp[j] is the minimum cost to build the bridge up to and including column j, with supports placed according to the rules.

Then, dp[j] = min over k in [j - d -1, j -1] dp[k] + a_{i,j} +1

But in the example, this is not giving the correct result.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the support at column m is included in the cost.

Wait, maybe I need to set dp[m] = dp[k] + a_{i,m} +1, where k is the last support before m, within d distance.

But in the earlier manual calculation, dp[4] should be 4, but according to the code, it's 6.

I think there's an error in the recurrence or the implementation.

Let me look for another approach.

I found that using a deque can correctly maintain the sliding window minimum.

Let me try implementing it with a deque.

def func_1(row, d: int):

dq = deque()

m = len(row)

dp = [float('inf')] * m

dp[0] = 1

dq.append(0)

for j in range(1, m):

while dq and dq[0] < j - d:

dq.popleft()

if dq:

dp[j] = dp[dq[0]] + row[j] +1

else:

dp[j] = float('inf')

while dq and dp[j] <= dp[dq[-1]]:

dq.pop()

dq.append(j)

return dp[-1]

Now, let's test this with the example.

n=1, m=4, k=1, d=1

row = [0,1,2,0]

func_1(row,1):

dq = deque()

dp = [inf]*4

dp[0]=1

dq.append(0)

For j=1:

dq[0]=0 <1-1=0? No

dp[1] = dp[0] +1 +1=1 +1 +1=3

while dq and dp[1] <= dp[dq[-1]]: dq[-1]=0, dp[1]=3 <= dp[0]=1? No

append 1 to dq

dq=[0,1]

For j=2:

dq[0]=0 <2-1=1? Yes, pop 0

dq=[1]

dp[2] = dp[1] +2 +1=3 +2 +1=6

while dq and dp[2] <= dp[dq[-1]]: dq[-1]=1, dp[2]=6 <= dp[1]=3? No

append 2 to dq

dq=[1,2]

For j=3:

dq[0]=1 <3-1=2? No

dp[3] = dp[1] +0 +1=3 +0 +1=4

while dq and dp[3] <= dp[dq[-1]]: dq[-1]=2, dp[3]=4 <= dp[2]=6? Yes, pop 2

dq=[1]

append 3 to dq

dq=[1,3]

Return dp[3]=4, which matches the correct cost.

Great, this seems correct.

So, the earlier heap-based approach had a flaw, but the deque-based approach gives the correct result.

Therefore, I need to adjust func_1 to use the deque method.

Now, in the provided code, it's using a heap, which is not giving the correct result, as shown in the example.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
