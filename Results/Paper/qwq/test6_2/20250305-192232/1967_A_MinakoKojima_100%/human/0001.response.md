Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have some cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards of each type i. I can buy k new cards, and each new card can be any integer from 1 to n. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any subarray of length n, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, my goal is to arrange all my cards (original plus bought ones) in such a way that the number of these special subarrays is maximized.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of permutations in subarrays of length n.

I recall that in array problems, especially those involving subarrays of a fixed length, sliding window techniques are often useful.

So, perhaps I can use a sliding window of size n and count how many times the window contains a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

But wait, the problem asks for the maximum number of such subarrays, and I can arrange the cards in any order. So, I have flexibility in arranging them to maximize these permutations.

First, I need to understand what arrangement would maximize the number of these permutations.

Let's consider a perfect scenario where the entire array is arranged in a way that every subarray of length n is a permutation.

Is that possible? Only if I have enough cards of each type.

Wait, if I have at least n cards in total, it's possible to have at least one permutation. But to have multiple permutations in contiguous subarrays, I need to ensure that overlapping sections also form permutations.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider smaller examples to get an intuition.

Take n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]

From the example, t=2, and for this case, the output is 15.

Wait, the first test case in the example is:

1 10

1

Output: 11

Which makes sense because with n=1, any single card is a permutation, and with k=10, you can have 11 cards in total, each being 1, so 11 subarrays of length 1, each being [1], which is a permutation.

Okay, that makes sense.

Second test case:

2 4

8 4

Output: 15

According to the note, one can arrange the cards to have 15 subarrays that are permutations of [1,2].

I need to think about how to maximize such permutations.

I think the key is to interleave the cards in such a way that as many n-length windows as possible contain exactly one of each number from 1 to n.

One way to maximize this is to create a sequence that repeats a pattern which ensures that every n-length window is a permutation.

For example, for n=2, arranging them as 1,2,1,2,1,2,... would ensure that every two consecutive elements are [1,2], which is a permutation.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging them as 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,... would ensure that every three consecutive elements are [1,2,3], a permutation.

But, depending on the initial counts a_i, I might need to adjust.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], meaning I have 8 cards of 1 and 4 cards of 2, and I can buy 4 more cards, which can be any type.

So total cards I can have are:

Type 1: up to 8 + 4 =12

Type 2: up to 4 +4=8

But in the optimal arrangement, as described in the note, they used 12 cards of type 1 and 4 of type 2, but in their example, they have more type 2 cards.

Wait, in the note, they have 16 cards arranged as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which makes 15 subarrays of length 2, each being [1,2], which is a permutation.

But in this case, they have a_i=[8,4], and k=4, so they can buy 4 more cards. They chose to buy 4 type 2 cards, making a total of 8 type 1 and 8 type 2 cards, arranged alternately.

Wait, but in the note, they said they bought 0 cards of type 1 and 4 of type 2, making it 8 type 1 and 8 type 2, arranged as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which gives 15 subarrays of [1,2], each a permutation.

But according to their note, they have 16 cards: 8 type 1 and 8 type 2.

Wait, but a_i=[8,4], and k=4, so they can buy up to 4 cards, any type.

So, they bought 4 type 2 cards, making it 8 type 1 and 8 type 2.

Then, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which is 16 cards.

Wait, but a_i=[8,4], and k=4, so total cards are 8+4+4=16.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this arrangement, every two consecutive cards form a permutation of [1,2], and there are 15 such subarrays.

They claim this is the maximum.

Okay, so in general, to maximize the number of n-length permutations, I should aim to create as many n-length windows as possible that are permutations.

One way to do this is to arrange the cards in a repeating sequence of [1,2,3,...,n], as long as possible, given the constraints of the number of cards I have.

But I need to handle cases where the counts of certain types are limited.

So, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of [1,2,3,...,n] I can form, and then handle any remaining cards.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as trying to create as many complete permutations as possible, and then see how to arrange the remaining cards to get additional permutations.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider the minimal number of cards needed to form one permutation: it's n cards, one of each type.

To form another permutation, if I overlap with the previous one, I need to ensure that the overlapping part still allows for distinct elements in the new window.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

I recall that in some problems, the number of permutations in sliding windows can be calculated by maintaining a frequency map and checking if all frequencies are exactly one within the window.

But that's for counting, not for maximizing by arranging.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can repeat the sequence [1,2,3,...,n], end to end, as many times as the limiting factor allows.

The limiting factor would be the type with the smallest number of available cards, considering I can buy additional cards.

Wait, but I can buy up to k cards, any type.

So, I need to strategically buy cards to maximize the number of complete [1,2,3,...,n] blocks.

Let me think in terms of the minimal number of cards required to form m complete permutations.

Each complete permutation requires one of each type.

So, to form m complete permutations, I need at least m cards of each type.

Given that I have a_i initial cards of each type, and I can buy up to k additional cards, I need to maximize m such that for each type i, a_i + bought_i >= m, and sum(bought_i) <= k.

This sounds like an optimization problem.

I need to maximize m, subject to a_i + bought_i >= m for all i, and sum(bought_i) <= k.

This can be formulated as finding the maximum m such that sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <= k.

This is similar to a standard optimization problem where we can use binary search to find the maximum m that satisfies the condition.

Once I have m, the number of complete [1,2,3,...,n] blocks I can form is m.

Then, I need to arrange these blocks in a way that maximizes the number of permutations in contiguous subarrays.

If I arrange them as [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], then every n consecutive cards form a permutation, giving me m permutations.

But actually, in this arrangement, there are m overlapping windows, each shifted by one position.

Wait, no.

In a sliding window of size n over the sequence [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], each window would be a permutation, but only if the sequence is arranged in a way that each window has distinct elements.

Wait, if I arrange the sequence as [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], then every window of size n within each block is a permutation, but windows that span across blocks may not be permutations.

Wait, let's see:

For example, n=3, sequence [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...]

Then, windows [1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [1,2,3], etc.

Each of these is a permutation.

So, in this arrangement, for m blocks, I have m permutations from each block, and potentially more from overlapping across blocks.

Wait, but in this specific arrangement, [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...], every window of size n is a permutation, as long as the sequence is periodic with period n.

So, in this case, the number of permutations is total_length - n + 1, where total_length is m * n.

So, total permutations = m * n - n + 1.

Wait, no.

For a sequence of length l, the number of contiguous subarrays of length n is l - n + 1.

So, if total length is m * n, then number of permutations is m * n - n + 1.

But in this arrangement, each window of size n is a permutation, so the number of permutations is indeed m * n - n + 1.

But I need to maximize this.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better arrangement that allows for more permutations.

Is it possible to arrange the cards such that more overlapping windows are permutations?

I'm not sure.

In the previous arrangement, every window is a permutation, so it seems optimal.

But maybe with a different arrangement, I can have more such windows.

Wait, perhaps not.

So, perhaps the maximum number of permutations is m * n - n + 1, where m is the maximum number of complete [1,2,3,...,n] blocks I can form.

But I need to verify this.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], so total cards are 11, and number of subarrays of length 1 is 11, each being [1], which is a permutation. So, it matches m * n - n + 1 = 11 *1 -1 +1=11.

In the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], m=8 (since a1=8, a2=4, and buying 4 of type 2 makes a2=8), so total length is 16, number of permutations is 16-2+1=15, which matches the example.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8], after buying, say, 2 of type 2, making a=[6,3,8], then m=3 (limited by type 2), total length=9, number of permutations=9-3+1=7, but the output is 15. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the third test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

After buying 4 of type 2, a becomes [6,5,8]

Then m=5 (since a2=5 is the limiting factor), total length=15, number of permutations=15-3+1=13, but the output is 15.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Hmm.

Perhaps there is a better way to arrange the cards to get more permutations.

Let me think differently.

Maybe interleave the blocks in a smarter way to get more permutations.

Wait, but in the arrangement [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...], every window of size n is a permutation, so I don't see how to get more than m * n - n +1 permutations.

But in the third test case, with m=5, n=3, total length=15, number of permutations should be 13, but the output is 15.

So, perhaps I'm miscalculating m.

Wait, in the third test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

To maximize m, I need m such that m <= a1=6, m <= a2=1, m <= a3=8, and sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <=k.

Wait, m <=1 because a2=1.

But I can buy up to k=4 of type 2.

So, if I buy 4 of type 2, then a2=5.

Then m can be up to 5, since a1=6, a2=5, a3=8, all >=5.

So, m=5, total length=15, number of permutations=15-3+1=13, but the output is 15.

So, my calculation is wrong.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some extra cards that can form additional permutations.

Wait, in the arrangement [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], with m=5, total length=15.

The number of permutations is 15-3+1=13.

But the output is 15, which is higher.

So, perhaps there is a better arrangement.

Wait, maybe I can arrange the cards in a way that some overlapping windows also form permutations.

Is there a way to arrange them to get more than m * n - n +1 permutations?

Let me try to think of an arrangement.

Suppose I arrange them as [1,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,2,...]

Wait, but in this case, some windows may repeat permutations or have duplicates.

I'm not sure if I can get more than m * n - n +1 permutations.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation of m.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to maximize m such that for each i, a_i + bought_i >= m, and sum(bought_i) <=k.

This is similar to finding the maximum m where sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <=k.

This can be done using binary search.

Once I have m, then the number of permutations is (total_length - n +1), where total_length = m * n + remaining_cards.

But in the standard arrangement, total_length = m * n, and number of permutations = m * n - n +1.

But in the third test case, this gives 15 -3 +1=13, but the output is 15.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in understanding the arrangement.

Wait, maybe the number of permutations is simply m * (n -1 +1) = m *n.

Wait, for n=1, m=11, 11*1=11, matches.

For n=2, m=8, 8*2=16, but the output is 15.

Wait, 8*2 -2 +1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 5*3 -3 +1=13, but output is 15.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the number of permutations is (total_length - n +1), where total_length = m *n + r, with r <n.

Then, number of permutations = m * (n -1) + (r).

But in the third test case, m=5, n=3, r=0, so 5*2 +0=10, which still doesn't match 15.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the number of permutations is m * (n -1 +1) = m *n.

Wait, but for n=1, m=11, 11*1=11.

For n=2, m=8, 8*2=16, but output is 15.

For n=3, m=5, 5*3=15, matches the output.

Wait, but for n=2, m=8, 8*2=16, but output is 15.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's m *n - something.

For n=2, m=8, 16-1=15.

For n=3, m=5, 15, matches.

For n=1, m=11, 11, matches.

So, it seems that the number of permutations is m *n - (m -1).

Wait, for n=2, m=8, 16 -7=9, not matching.

Wait, no.

Wait, m *n - (m -1) = m*(n -1) +1.

For n=2, m=8, 8 +1=9, not matching.

Hmm.

I need to find a general formula for the number of permutations.

Wait, perhaps the number of permutations is m * (n -1) +1.

For n=2, m=8, 16 -2 +1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15 -3 +1=13, but output is 15.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m * (n -1) + min(m, remaining).

I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the entire array as consisting of m complete blocks of [1,2,3,...,n], plus some remaining cards.

In the standard arrangement, arranging them as [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], the number of permutations is m * (n -1) +1.

But in the third test case, this gives 5*2 +1=11, which doesn't match the output 15.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the number of permutations is m *n - (n -1).

For n=2, m=8, 16 -1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15 -2=13, but output is 15. Doesn't match.

Wait, no.

Perhaps it's m *n - (m -1).

For n=2, m=8, 16 -7=9, not matching.

Hmm.

I need to find another way.

Let me think about the total possible permutations.

In any arrangement, the maximum number of permutations is total_length - n +1.

I need to maximize this value, given that I can arrange the cards in any order.

But I need to ensure that as many windows as possible are permutations.

The best way to maximize the number of permutations is to arrange the cards in a way that every possible window of size n is a permutation.

This is achievable if I can form a sequence where every n consecutive cards are permutations.

This is possible if I can form a sequence that is a concatenation of [1,2,3,...,n], repeated as much as possible.

In this case, the number of permutations is m *n - (n -1), where m is the number of complete blocks.

Wait, for n=2, m=8, 16 -1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15 -2=13, but output is 15. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m *n - (n -1) * (m -1).

For n=2, m=8, 16 -1*7=9, not matching.

Hmm.

I need to find the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps it's m *n - (n -1) * (m -1).

For n=2, m=8, 16 -1*7=9, not matching.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's m * (n -1) +1.

For n=2, m=8, 16 -2 +1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15 -3 +1=13, but output is 15. Doesn't match.

Wait, but in the third test case, with m=5, n=3, total length=15, number of permutations=15-3+1=13, but output is 15.

So, perhaps there is an error in my understanding.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some overlapping permutations.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m *n - (n -1).

For n=2, m=8, 16 -1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15 -2=13, but output is 15. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps for n>=2, it's m *n - (n -1), but for the third test case, it's 15, which is m *n - (n -1)=15-2=13, doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the way m is calculated.

Let me try to compute m for the third test case.

n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

I need m such that m <=6, m <=1, m <=8, and sum(max(m - a_i,0)) <=k=4.

Wait, m cannot be greater than the smallest a_i, which is 1, but I can buy k=4 cards of type 2.

So, if I buy 4 cards of type 2, a2 becomes 5.

Then, m can be up to 5, since a1=6, a2=5, a3=8.

So, m=5.

Then, total length is 15.

Number of permutations is 15-3+1=13, but output is 15.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that the number of permutations is total_length - n +1.

Wait, maybe in this arrangement, some windows are not permutations, so 13 might be the correct answer, but the output is 15.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the cards in a way that some windows are repeated permutations.

But in the standard arrangement [1,2,3,1,2,3,...], every window is a permutation, so 15-3+1=13 should be the number of permutations.

But the output is 15, which is higher.

So, perhaps there is a better arrangement.

Wait, maybe I can arrange the cards in a way that some windows overlap in a way that increases the number of permutations.

For example, arrange them as [1,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,2,...]

Then, windows like [1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3], [2,3,1], etc.

But [2,3,2] is not a permutation, since 2 repeats.

So, it won't increase the number of permutations.

In fact, it might decrease it.

So, perhaps the standard arrangement is the best.

But then, why does the output say 15 for the third test case, when m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of permutations=13?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that m is not just 5, but higher.

Wait, in the third test case, with n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

If I buy 4 cards of type 2, a2 becomes 5, and m=5.

Total length=15, number of permutations=13.

But output is 15.

So, perhaps I can arrange the cards in a way that some extra permutations are achieved.

Wait, maybe by arranging the extra cards in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some additional cards that allow for more permutations.

But in the standard arrangement, [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], with m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of permutations=13.

But output is 15, which suggests that there are 15 permutations.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of permutations in this arrangement.

Let me list them:

Positions 1-3: [1,2,3]

Positions 2-4: [2,3,1]

Positions 3-5: [3,1,2]

Positions 4-6: [1,2,3]

Positions 5-7: [2,3,1]

Positions 6-8: [3,1,2]

Positions 7-9: [1,2,3]

Positions 8-10: [2,3,1]

Positions 9-11: [3,1,2]

Positions 10-12: [1,2,3]

Positions 11-13: [2,3,1]

Positions 12-14: [3,1,2]

Positions 13-15: [1,2,3]

Total of 13 permutations, but output is 15.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's explanation or my understanding.

Wait, maybe the number of permutations is m *n - (n -1), which is 15 -2=13, but output is 15.

Alternatively, perhaps it's m *n - (m -1), which is 15 -4=11, doesn't match.

I'm stuck here.

Let me look back at the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some overlapping permutations beyond the standard sliding window.

But in the standard arrangement, each window is a permutation, so I don't see how to get more than m *n - (n -1).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some permutations are counted multiple times in different arrangements.

But in the standard arrangement, each window is unique in its positions, so I don't see overlapping permutations being counted more than once.

I think there might be a mistake in my understanding of the problem or the calculation.

Let me look at the fourth test case.

n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2]

After buying, say, 7 cards of type 2 and 2 cards of type 3, making a=[7,13,4], then m=4 (limited by a3=4), total length=12, number of permutations=12-3+1=10, but output is 22.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of permutations is m * (2*n -1) - something.

Wait, for n=3, m=4, 4*5=20, close to 22.

But still not matching.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that in the arrangement, I can have overlapping permutations.

Wait, but in the standard arrangement, each window is a permutation, and they are all unique in their positions.

I think I need to accept that my current approach is flawed.

Perhaps I need to think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that each complete block of [1,2,3,...,n] contributes n permutations in its own window.

Wait, no, each block contributes n -1 overlapping permutations.

Wait, no, each block of n cards contributes one permutation.

But in a sequence of m blocks, arranged end to end, the total number of permutations is m *n - (n -1).

Wait, no, it's m * (n -1) +1.

Wait, for m blocks, each of size n, arranged in a sequence, the total number of permutations is (m *n - n +1).

Wait, no, for m blocks, total length is m *n, number of permutations is m *n - n +1.

But in the third test case, m=5, n=3, total permutations=15 -3 +1=13, but output is 15.

Still doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some permutations are being double-counted or there is an offset in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is m *n - (m -1).

For m=5, n=3, 15 -4=11, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m *n.

For m=5, n=3, 15, matches output.

But for n=2, m=8, 16, but output is 15.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m *n - something.

Wait, for n=2, m=8, 16 -1=15, matches.

For n=3, m=5, 15, matches output.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2]

After buying, say, 5 cards of type 3, making a=[7,6,7], so m=7, total permutations=21, but output is 22.

Doesn't match.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some extra permutations from the remaining cards.

But in the standard arrangement, the number of permutations is m *n - (n -1).

Wait, for m=7, n=3, 21 -2=19, not matching output 22.

I'm getting more confused.

Perhaps I need to abandon this approach and look for another way.

Let me consider the entire sequence as a whole.

Suppose I have a sequence of length l, then the number of subarrays of length n is l - n +1.

To maximize the number of permutations, I need as many of these subarrays as possible to be permutations.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, the best way is to arrange them in a way that every possible window of size n is a permutation.

This is achievable if I can form a sequence where every n consecutive cards are permutations.

This is similar to de Bruijn sequences, but I'm not sure.

In practice, the standard arrangement [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...] achieves this, with number of permutations being l - n +1, where l = m *n.

So, number of permutations = m *n - n +1.

But in the third test case, m=5, n=3, so 15 -3 +1=13, but output is 15.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, m=7, n=3, 21 -3 +1=19, but output is 22.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the way I'm calculating m.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that m can be higher than the minimum a_i + bought_i.

Wait, no, m is limited by the smallest a_i + bought_i.

Wait, in the third test case, with a=[6,1,8], k=4, buying 4 of type 2 makes a2=5, so m=5.

Total length=15, number of permutations=15-3+1=13, but output is 15.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's sample output or my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some additional permutations from the remaining cards.

Wait, in the standard arrangement, with m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of permutations=13, but output is 15.

So, perhaps there are 2 extra permutations from the remaining cards.

But in this arrangement, all remaining cards are already used in the m blocks.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some extra cards that allow for more permutations.

Wait, but in this arrangement, all cards are used in the m blocks.

I need to think differently.

Maybe instead of arranging in blocks, I can arrange the cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutations.

Perhaps by maximizing the number of times each number appears in the sequence, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is m *n - (n -1), but adjusted for the remaining cards.

But in the third test case, m *n - (n -1)=15 -2=13, but output is 15.

In the fourth test case, m=7, n=3, 21 -2=19, but output is 22.

Still doesn't match.

I need to find another approach.

Let me consider that the number of permutations is equal to the number of times each number appears in the sequence, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the number of permutations is equal to the sum over i from 1 to m of i.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's m * (m +1 ) /2.

No, that doesn't match.

I'm stuck.

Maybe I should look at the code provided and see how it works.

Looking at the code:

def func():

ans_list = []

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

ans = a[0]

res = n - 1

for i in range(n - 1):

dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]

if dif == 0:

res -= 1

if dif != 0:

if k >= dif * (i + 1):

ans += dif

k -= dif * (i + 1)

res -= 1

else:

ans += k // (i + 1)

if i != 0:

res += k % (i + 1)

k = 0

break

if k == 0:

break

if k != 0:

ans += k // n

res += k % n

ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)

ans += res

ans_list.append(ans)

for a in ans_list:

print(a)

Okay, let's try to understand this code.

First, it sorts the a array.

Then, it initializes ans to a[0] and res to n-1.

Then, it loops from i=0 to n-2.

For each i, it computes dif = a[i+1] - a[i]

If dif ==0, it decreases res by 1.

If dif !=0, it checks if k >= dif * (i +1)

If yes, it adds dif to ans, subtracts dif*(i+1) from k, and decreases res by 1.

If not, it adds k//(i+1) to ans, adds k%(i+1) to res (if i !=0), sets k=0, and breaks.

Then, if k is still >0 after the loop, it adds k//n to ans and res += k%n.

Finally, it computes ans += (ans -1)*(n -1) and ans += res, and appends ans to ans_list.

Then, it prints each ans in ans_list.

This seems quite involved.

I need to understand what this code is doing.

It seems to be trying to maximize the number of permutations by adjusting ans and res based on the differences between sorted a_i and the available k.

But I'm not fully following the logic.

Perhaps I need to test this code with the sample inputs and see if it produces the correct outputs.

Take the first test case:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

sorted a=[1]

ans=1

res=0

No loop since n-1=0

k=10

ans += 10//1=10

res +=10%1=0

ans=11

ans += (11-1)*(1-1)=0

ans +=0

ans=11

Which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

sorted a=[4,8]

ans=4

res=1

i=0

dif=8-4=4

dif !=0

k=4 >=4*(0+1)=4

ans +=4 -> ans=8

k -=4 -> k=0

res -=1 -> res=0

k==0, break

ans +=(8-1)*(2-1)=7*1=7 -> ans=15

ans +=0 -> ans=15

Which matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=3, k=4

a=[6,1,8]

sorted a=[1,6,8]

ans=1

res=2

i=0

dif=6-1=5

dif !=0

k=4 >=5*(0+1)=5? No

ans +=4//(0+1)=4//1=4 -> ans=5

i!=0, so res +=4%1=0

k=0

break

ans +=(5-1)*(3-1)=4*2=8 -> ans=13

ans +=0 -> ans=13

But the output is 15.

Wait, but according to the code, it should output 13, but the sample output is 15.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading the code.

Wait, in the loop, when dif !=0 and k < dif*(i+1), it adds k//(i+1) to ans.

Here, k=4, i=0, so i+1=1

k//(i+1)=4//1=4

ans=1+4=5

k=0

break

Then, ans +=(5-1)*(3-1)=4*2=8 -> ans=13

ans += res=0 -> ans=13

But sample output is 15.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but in the second test case, it correctly output 15.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the code.

Looking back, in the third test case, a=[1,6,8], n=3, k=4

After sorting a=[1,6,8]

ans=1

res=2

i=0

dif=6-1=5

k=4 <5*(0+1)=5

ans +=4//1=4 -> ans=5

res +=4%1=0

k=0

break

Then, ans +=(5-1)*(3-1)=4*2=8 -> ans=13

ans += res=0 -> ans=13

But sample output is 15.

So, the code is producing 13, but sample output is 15.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the second test case, it produced the correct output.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, in the third test case, m=5, and according to the code, ans=13, but sample output is 15.

So, the code is wrong.

Hence, Correctness: False

But wait, in the second test case, it produced the correct output.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample output is wrong.

But according to the sample, output should be 15 for the third test case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the third test case, with m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of permutations=15-3+1=13, but sample output is 15.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` after buying up to `k` new cards and rearranging all cards.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Read input values: number of test cases `t`, for each test case, read `n` (number of distinct types of cards), `k` (number of coins to buy new cards), and the list `a` (initial count of each card type).
   
2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - **Sort the initial counts (`a`):** This helps in determining how to distribute the new cards efficiently.
   - **Determine the minimal counts:** By sorting, we can easily find the differences needed to make the smaller counts closer to the larger ones.
   - **Calculate the base answer (`ans`):** Start with the smallest count in `a`.
   - **Adjust counts using available coins (`k`):** Distribute the new cards to increase the counts of the smaller card types, thereby allowing more permutations.
   - **Compute the final answer:** Using the formula derived from the sliding window technique for counting permutations in the rearranged sequence.

3. **Formula Explanation:**
   - **Base Answer (`ans`):** Start with the smallest count in `a`.
   - **Residual Adjustments (`res`):** Track remaining card types that need adjustments.
   - **Loop through differences:** For each difference between consecutive sorted counts, decide how many new cards to allocate to minimize the difference.
   - **Final Adjustments:** After the loop, handle any remaining coins to further increase the answer.
   - **Calculate permutations:** Use the formula to compute the total number of permutations based on the adjusted counts.
