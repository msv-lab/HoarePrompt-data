Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position instead. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I choose an element that's at least 10, I can replace it with its individual digits in the same order they appear in the number. So, for 12, it would be 1 and 2; for 45, it's 4 and 5, and so on.

Now, I need to think about how this operation can help me sort the array in non-decreasing order. I should consider that I can apply this operation to any element that's at least 10, any number of times. But I have to be careful because once I split an element, I can't undo it, as the problem doesn't mention any way to merge digits back into a number.

Let me consider the first example given: [12, 3, 45, 67]. If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted. So, in this case, it's possible.

Another example is [12, 28, 5]. If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. This is not sorted. If I split 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is still not sorted. If I split 12 and then split 28, I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which isn't sorted. It seems like there's no way to sort this array through these operations.

The third example is [0, 0], which is already sorted, so no operation is needed.

From these examples, it seems that splitting numbers can help in breaking them down into smaller parts that might help in sorting, but it's not always possible to achieve a sorted array.

Now, I need to think about a general approach to solve this problem for any given array within the constraints.

Constraints:

- Number of test cases, t: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3

- For each test case:

- Array length, n: 2 ≤ n ≤ 50

- Array elements, a_i: 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99

Given that n can be up to 50 and t up to 10^3, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n^2) or better per test case to handle the time constraints.

I need to find a way to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting numbers that are at least 10 any number of times.

First, I need to understand what happens when I split a number.

- Splitting a number into its digits can be seen as replacing the number with a sequence of digits.

- For example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, which are both smaller than 12.

- Similarly, 45 becomes 4 and 5.

- Splitting a number can only help in sorting if the digits are smaller than the original number and can be placed in the correct order.

- However, splitting might also disrupt the order if not done carefully.

I need to find a way to model this operation and see if, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

One way to approach this is to consider the potential splits for each element and see if there's a combination of splits that leads to a sorted array.

But considering all possible combinations would be exponential, which is not feasible given the constraints.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of the array and the operation.

- The operation only affects elements that are at least 10.

- Splitting an element that is at least 10 can only decrease the value of the elements in the array, since digits are always less than the original number (for numbers >=10).

- However, splitting can also increase the length of the array, which might make it harder to sort.

Wait, no. The length of the array increases only if the number being split has more than one digit, which in this case, since a_i <=99, splitting a two-digit number always results in two single-digit numbers.

So, for any number >=10, splitting it will replace it with its two digits, which are both <=9.

Therefore, splitting a number >=10 will always result in smaller numbers in the array.

Given that, splitting a number >=10 can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are placed in the correct positions.

But I need to ensure that after all possible splits, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to find a way to decide whether such a sequence of splits exists that leads to a sorted array.

Let me consider the array as a sequence of elements, some of which may be split into digits.

I need to check if there's a way to split some elements (zero or more) such that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a problem where I need to consider the potential splits for each element and see if there's a path that leads to a sorted array.

But again, considering all possible combinations is not efficient.

I need to find a way to model this more efficiently.

Let me consider the array positions and the possible values that can be placed in each position after possible splits.

For each element in the array, if it's >=10, it can either stay as is or be split into its digits.

So, for each position, there are two choices: keep the number as is or split it into digits.

Then, I need to consider all possible combinations of these choices and check if any of them result in a sorted array.

But as mentioned earlier, this is not efficient for n=50 and t=10^3.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to build the sorted array step by step, starting from the first position.

I need to place the smallest possible value in the first position, then the next smallest in the second position, and so on.

But in this problem, I don't have the flexibility to choose any value from the array; I have to place the values in the positions they are in, possibly splitting some of them.

Wait, but splitting allows me to replace a number with its digits, so in a way, it's like having multiple choices for each position: either keep the number as is or replace it with its digits.

This seems similar to having multiple possible values for each position, and I need to choose one option for each position such that the resulting array is sorted.

Given that, I can model each position as a set of possible values: if the number is less than 10, the set contains only that number; if the number is >=10, the set contains the number itself and its digits.

Then, I need to select one value from each set and arrange them in a sequence that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This seems like a problem of selecting one option from each set such that the resulting sequence is sorted.

This is similar to a multiple-choice sorting problem, where each position has multiple choices, and I need to pick one from each to form a sorted sequence.

Now, how can I efficiently solve this?

Given the constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider processing the array from left to right, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far, and ensuring that each new value is >= the maximum value so far.

But in this problem, for each position, I have multiple choices (the number itself if <10, or its digits if >=10).

So, for each position, I can consider each possible choice and ensure that it's >= the previous choice.

But I need to make sure that the sequence as a whole is sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each position, consider all possible choices, and keep track of the maximum value up to that point.

If at any point, there's no choice that is >= the previous maximum, then it's impossible to sort the array.

This sounds promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a variable, say prev, to -1 (since all a_i >=0).

Iterate through each position in the array:

For the current position, get the set of possible values for that position.

From these possible values, choose the smallest one that is >= prev.

If such a value exists, set prev to this value and move to the next position.

If not, then it's impossible to sort the array.

If I can successfully choose a value for all positions in this manner, then it's possible to sort the array.

This seems like a greedy approach, choosing the smallest possible value at each step that is >= the previous one.

This should work because choosing smaller values gives more flexibility for future choices.

Let me test this approach with the examples.

First example: [12, 3, 45, 67]

Possible values for each position:

Pos 1: {12, 1, 2}

Pos 2: {3}

Pos 3: {45, 4, 5}

Pos 4: {67, 6, 7}

Start with prev = -1.

Choose the smallest >= -1 for pos1: 1.

Set prev =1.

Next, pos2: {3}, smallest >=1 is 3. Set prev=3.

Next, pos3: {4,5}, smallest >=3 is 4. Set prev=4.

Next, pos4: {6,7}, smallest >=4 is 6. Set prev=6.

All positions are covered, so it's possible to sort.

Which matches the first example.

Second example: [12,28,5]

Possible values:

Pos1: {12,1,2}

Pos2: {28,2,8}

Pos3: {5}

Start with prev=-1.

Choose smallest >=-1 for pos1:1.

Set prev=1.

Next, pos2: {2,8}, smallest >=1 is 2. Set prev=2.

Next, pos3: {5}, which is >=2. Set prev=5.

So, it seems like it's possible, but according to the example, it's NO.

Wait, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, in the second example, according to the problem, it's NO, but according to this approach, it's YES.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the positions more carefully.

Let me think again.

In the second example, if I choose 1 from pos1, then pos2 must have >=1, so choose 2 from pos2, then pos3 is 5, which is >=2. So, sequence is [1,2,5], which is sorted.

But according to the problem, it's NO. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operation can only be applied once to each element, or there are restrictions on the order.

Wait, no, the operation can be applied any number of times, and the digits are inserted in the same position.

Wait, perhaps when I split a number, the digits are inserted in the same position, but the subsequent elements shift.

Wait, in the first example, splitting 12 in [12,3,45,67] results in [1,2,3,45,67]. Then, it's sorted.

In the second example, [12,28,5], if I split 12, it becomes [1,2,28,5]. This is not sorted. If I split 28, it becomes [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted. If I split both 12 and 28, I get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted. If I split neither, it's [12,28,5], which is not sorted. So, indeed, it's impossible to sort this array through these operations.

But according to my earlier approach, it seems possible, but in reality, it's not.

So, my approach must be flawed.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider the operation more carefully.

The operation is: take an element >=10, delete it, and insert its digits in the same position.

So, splitting a number doesn't just replace the number with its digits; it inserts the digits in place of the number, maintaining their order in the array.

So, in [12,28,5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5]. Then, if I split 28, it becomes [1,2,2,8,5]. In this process, the digits are inserted in place of the number, and the rest of the array shifts accordingly.

So, in terms of the array indices, it's not just replacing the number with its digits; it's inserting the digits in place of the number.

Given that, perhaps I need to think about the potential splits and how they affect the relative positions of the elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the array can be modified by splitting numbers >=10 into their digits, and I can do this operation any number of times, I need to consider what the final array can look like.

Each number in the original array can be either kept as is (if <10) or split into its digits (if >=10).

So, for each element, if it's >=10, its final form is its digits; if it's <10, its final form is itself.

Wait, but I can choose to split or not to split numbers >=10.

So, for each number >=10, I have two choices: keep it as is or split it into digits.

I need to consider all possible combinations of these choices and see if any of them result in a sorted array.

Given that n <=50 and t<=10^3, iterating over all possible combinations (2^n) is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 can be seen as inserting its digits in place of the number, which can be thought of as replacing the number with a sequence of its digits.

So, for example, [12,28,5] can be transformed into [1,2,28,5] or [12,2,8,5], or [1,2,2,8,5], etc., depending on which numbers are split.

Wait, no. Each split operation replaces one number with its digits, so in [12,28,5], if I split 12, it becomes [1,2,28,5]. If I then split 28, it becomes [1,2,2,8,5]. So, the splits are sequential, and the positions of the digits are inserted in place of the number.

Given that, the final array after all splits would consist of the digits of the split numbers and the unchanged numbers that were less than 10.

But I need to ensure that this final array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given that, perhaps I can model the problem as building a sorted array by choosing for each number >=10 whether to split it or not.

Wait, but choosing to split a number affects the positions of subsequent numbers.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider the array after all possible splits have been performed.

Each number >=10 can be either kept as is or split into its digits.

So, for each such number, I have two choices: keep or split.

Then, the final array is a combination of the chosen representations for each element.

I need to check if there's a combination where the resulting array is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the possible values that can be in each position, considering whether to split or not.

Then, I need to ensure that for each position, the chosen value is >= the previous one.

This sounds similar to dynamic programming, where I keep track of the possible previous values and make choices for the current position based on that.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the original array, and j is the previous value in the constructed array.

But with n=50 and j can be up to 99, this might be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and maintain a set of possible previous values.

Start with prev = -1.

For each position, consider the possible choices for that position:

- If a_i <10, only one choice: a_i.

- If a_i >=10, choices: a_i itself or its digits.

Then, for each choice, check if it's >= any of the possible prev values.

If yes, set prev to this choice.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a list of possible prev values.

Initialize possible_prev = [-1].

For each position:

new_possible_prev = []

For each possible prev in possible_prev:

For each choice in current position:

if choice >= prev:

new_possible_prev.append(choice)

Then, set possible_prev = sorted(set(new_possible_prev))

Continue to the next position.

At the end, if possible_prev is not empty, it's possible to sort.

Given that n=50 and for each position, there are up to 3 choices (the number itself and its two digits if >=10), this should be efficient enough.

Let me test this with the second example: [12,28,5]

Initialize possible_prev = [-1]

First position, a=12:

Choices: 12, 1, 2

For prev=-1:

1 >= -1, so add 1

2 >= -1, so add 2

12 >= -1, so add 12

So, possible_prev = [1,2,12]

Second position, a=28:

Choices: 28,2,8

For prev=1:

2 >=1, add 2

8 >=1, add 8

28 >=1, add 28

For prev=2:

8 >=2, add 8

28 >=2, add 28

For prev=12:

28 >=12, add 28

So, new_possible_prev = [2,8,28]

Third position, a=5:

Choices:5

For prev=2:

5 >=2, add 5

For prev=8:

5 >=8? No

For prev=28:

5 >=28? No

So, new_possible_prev = [5]

Now, 5 is not >= any of the previous values, but in this approach, we only add if choice >= prev.

But in this case, 5 >=2, so it's added.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's impossible to sort this array.

But according to this approach, it's possible because we have 5 >=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the sequence is built in a way that respects the order of the positions.

Maybe I need to track the previous choice more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for each position, the chosen value is >= the previous chosen value, not just any previous possible prev.

Let me try to adjust the approach.

Initialize possible_prev = [(-1, [])], where each entry is (prev_value, sequence_so_far)

For each position:

new_possible_prev = []

For each (prev, seq) in possible_prev:

For each choice in current position:

if choice >= prev:

new_seq = seq + [choice]

new_possible_prev.append((choice, new_seq))

Set possible_prev = new_possible_prev

At the end, if possible_prev is not empty, it's possible to sort.

Let's apply this to the second example: [12,28,5]

Initialize possible_prev = [(-1, [])]

First position, a=12:

Choices:12,1,2

For prev=-1:

1 >= -1, new_seq=[1]

2 >= -1, new_seq=[2]

12 >= -1, new_seq=[12]

So, possible_prev = [(1,[1]),(2,[2]),(12,[12])]

Second position, a=28:

Choices:28,2,8

For prev=1:

2 >=1, new_seq=[1,2]

8 >=1, new_seq=[1,8]

28 >=1, new_seq=[1,28]

For prev=2:

8 >=2, new_seq=[2,8]

28 >=2, new_seq=[2,28]

For prev=12:

28 >=12, new_seq=[12,28]

So, new_possible_prev = [(2,[1,2]),(8,[1,8]),(28,[1,28]),(8,[2,8]),(28,[2,28]),(28,[12,28])]

Third position, a=5:

Choices:5

For prev=2:

5 >=2, new_seq=[1,2,5]

For prev=8:

5 >=8? No

For prev=28:

5 >=28? No

For prev=8:

5 >=8? No

For prev=28:

5 >=28? No

For prev=28:

5 >=28? No

So, new_possible_prev = [(5,[1,2,5])]

At the end, possible_prev = [(5,[1,2,5])], which seems like it's possible to sort.

But according to the problem, it's NO, which suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operation.

The operation is: delete the number and insert its digits in the same position.

So, in [12,28,5], if I split 12, it becomes [1,2,28,5].

Then, if I split 28, it becomes [1,2,2,8,5].

But in my approach, I'm building a sequence by choosing one value per position, which doesn't account for the fact that splitting a number inserts its digits in place, affecting the positions of subsequent elements.

Perhaps I need to think about the array as a sequence where splitting a number increases the length of the array.

This complicates things, as the length of the array can change based on the splits.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways to split the array and check if any of them result in a sorted sequence.

But this seems too time-consuming for the given constraints.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I consider the array after all possible splits, treating each split as inserting digits in place of the number.

Then, I need to check if there's a subsequence of the original array (with splits considered) that is sorted.

Wait, but it's not exactly a subsequence, because splits insert digits in place, not remove elements.

This is getting confusing.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I consider the array as a stream of digits, where numbers <10 are single digits, and numbers >=10 are two digits.

For example, [12,28,5] would be [1,2,2,8,5].

Similarly, [12,3,45,67] would be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

Then, if I sort this stream of digits, I can check if it's possible to arrange them in non-decreasing order.

But the problem is that splitting numbers >=10 inserts their digits in place, but I can choose which numbers to split.

So, I need to choose which numbers to split to achieve a sorted sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as constructing a sequence where for each number, I can choose to either keep it as is (if <10) or split it into its digits.

Then, I need to arrange these choices in order to form a sorted sequence.

But I need to ensure that the sequence is sorted after all splits are applied.

This seems similar to deciding which numbers to split to achieve a sorted sequence.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and decide for each number whether to split it or not, based on the previous choice.

Wait, but splitting a number affects the positions of subsequent numbers.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Treat each number <10 as a single element.

- Treat each number >=10 as either a single element or its individual digits.

- Then, arrange these elements in a way that forms a sorted sequence.

This sounds similar to choosing for each number >=10 whether to keep it as is or split it into digits, and then arranging them in order.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each position has multiple possible values, and I need to find a path through the graph that is sorted.

But this might be too time-consuming.

Given time constraints, I need a more efficient solution.

Let me consider that for numbers >=10, their digits are always less than the number itself.

So, splitting a number >=10 can only help in making the array smaller at that position.

Given that, to sort the array, I might need to split some numbers to make them smaller so that the array can be sorted.

But in the second example, [12,28,5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], which isn't sorted. Splitting 28 gives [1,2,2,8,5], which isn't sorted. Splitting both gives [1,2,2,8,5], still not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67], splitting 12 gives [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, in this case, it's possible.

In the third example, [0,0], it's already sorted.

So, I need to find a general way to determine this.

Let me consider that for the array to be sorted, each element must be >= the previous one.

When I have a number >=10, I have the option to split it into its digits, which are smaller, or keep it as is.

So, for each position, I need to choose the smallest possible value that is >= the previous one.

If I can find such a value for each position, then it's possible to sort the array.

Wait, but in the second example, according to this, it's possible, but according to the problem, it's not.

So, perhaps I need to consider the positions more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that when I split a number, the digits are inserted in the same position, and the subsequent elements shift accordingly.

This means that splitting a number can affect the positions of subsequent elements.

Given that, perhaps I need to process the array from right to left, deciding for each number whether to split it or not, based on the required value from the previous positions.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position from the right, and j is the required value for this position.

But this might still be too slow.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the array after all splits are applied, and I need to check if there's a way to arrange these splits such that the array is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can collect all possible digits from the splits and see if they can be arranged into a sorted sequence.

But this doesn't take into account the positions of the splits.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a sliding window, where for each position, I choose to split or not, and keep track of the maximum value so far.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from left to right, keeping track of the possible values that can be placed in each position, considering whether to split or not.

At each position, for each possible previous value, I choose the smallest possible value that is >= the previous one.

If I can find such a value for all positions, then it's possible to sort the array.

This sounds similar to the earlier approach, but perhaps I need to adjust it to account for the fact that splitting a number inserts its digits in place.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the lengths of the array after splits.

Each split increases the length of the array by (number of digits -1).

So, for a number >=10, splitting it increases the length by 1 (since it's two digits).

Given that, the final array can have different lengths based on which numbers are split.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible lengths and track the possible values at each position.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider that the problem can be reduced to checking if the sequence of digits, after possible splits, can be arranged in a sorted manner, respecting the original order of the digits.

Wait, but the digits are inserted in place of the number, maintaining their order.

Given that, perhaps I can flatten the array by considering all possible splits and then check if the flattened array can be sorted.

But again, this doesn't directly give me an efficient solution.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the problem requires checking all possible combinations of splits for numbers >=10 and see if any of them result in a sorted array.

Given that n<=50 and t<=10^3, and each number >=10 has up to 2 choices (split or not), this would be O(2^n * n), which is too slow.

Therefore, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for numbers <10, there's only one choice: keep them as is.

For numbers >=10, I have two choices: keep them as is or split them into digits.

So, for each number >=10, I have two options.

I need to choose a combination of these options such that the resulting array is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, making choices accordingly.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element in the array:

if a_i <10:

if a_i >= prev:

set prev = a_i

else:

return NO

else:

if a_i >= prev:

option 1: keep a_i, set prev = a_i

else:

option 1: cannot keep a_i

if a_i //10 >= prev:

option 2: split a_i, set prev = a_i //10

else:

option 2: cannot split a_i

if neither option is possible, return NO

else:

set prev to the chosen option's value

Wait, but in the second example, [12,28,5]:

Start with prev=-1

First element, 12 >= -1, so options:

Option 1: keep 12, set prev=12

Option 2: split 12, digits are 1 and 2, set prev=1 or 2?

Wait, this is confusing.

Perhaps I need to consider that splitting a number >=10 inserts its digits in place, so the digits become separate elements in the array.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider the array as a sequence where splitting a number >=10 replaces it with its digits, and then check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

So, for [12,28,5], possible sequences:

- Keep 12, keep 28, keep 5: [12,28,5] -> not sorted

- Split 12, keep 28, keep 5: [1,2,28,5] -> not sorted

- Keep 12, split 28, keep 5: [12,2,8,5] -> not sorted

- Split 12, split 28, keep 5: [1,2,2,8,5] -> not sorted

- Keep 12, keep 28, split 5: [12,28,5] -> same as first, not sorted

- Split 12, keep 28, split 5: [1,2,28,5] -> same as second, not sorted

- Keep 12, split 28, split 5: [12,2,8,5] -> same as third, not sorted

- Split 12, split 28, split 5: [1,2,2,8,5] -> same as fourth, not sorted

So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67]:

- Split 12, keep 3, split 45, split 67: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> sorted

Hence, it's possible.

So, in this approach, I need to consider all possible combinations of splits and check if any of them result in a sorted array.

But as mentioned earlier, this is too slow for the given constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for the array to be sorted after splits, the sequence of digits, in their original order, must be sorted.

Wait, but splitting a number inserts its digits in place, so the order of digits is preserved.

Given that, perhaps I can flatten the array by considering all possible splits and then check if the flattened sequence is sorted.

But this doesn't account for the fact that I can choose to keep some numbers without splitting them.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building a sequence where for each element, I choose either the number itself (if <10) or its digits (if >=10), and then check if this sequence is sorted.

But I need to ensure that the sequence is built by choosing for each position either the number or its digits, in their original order.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and build the sequence step by step, choosing for each element the smallest possible value that is >= the previous one.

If at any point, no such choice exists, then it's impossible to sort.

This sounds similar to the earlier approach, but perhaps I can optimize it.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize prev = -1

Initialize a list to hold the chosen sequence.

Iterate through each element in the array:

if a_i <10:

if a_i >= prev:

append a_i to the sequence

set prev = a_i

else:

return NO

else:

if a_i >= prev:

option 1: keep a_i, append a_i to the sequence, set prev = a_i

else:

option 1 is not possible

if a_i //10 >= prev:

option 2: split a_i, append a_i //10 and a_i %10 to the sequence, set prev = a_i %10

else:

option 2 is not possible

if neither option is possible, return NO

else:

choose the option that allows the sequence to progress

At the end, if the sequence is sorted, return YES

Wait, but in the second example, [12,28,5]:

Start with prev=-1

First element, 12 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 12, sequence=[12], prev=12

Second element, 28 >=12:

Option 1: keep 28, sequence=[12,28], prev=28

Third element,5 <28:

Cannot keep 5, since 5 <28

Option 2: split 5? But 5 <10, so only one option: keep 5.

But 5 <28, so return NO

Alternatively, if I choose to split 28:

First element, 12 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 12, sequence=[12], prev=12

Second element, 28 >=12:

Option 2: split 28, append 2 and 8, set prev=8

Third element,5 >=8? No, return NO

Alternatively, split 12:

First element, split 12: append 1 and 2, prev=2

Second element,28 >=2:

Option 1: keep 28, sequence=[1,2,28], prev=28

Third element,5 <28:

Cannot keep 5, return NO

Alternatively, split 28:

First element, split 12: append 1 and 2, prev=2

Second element, split 28: append 2 and 8, prev=8

Third element,5 <8: cannot keep 5, return NO

So, in all possible choices, it's impossible to sort the array.

Hence, the answer is NO, which matches the problem's expectation.

In the first example, [12,3,45,67]:

Split 12: append 1 and 2, prev=2

Next,3 >=2: keep 3, append 3, prev=3

Next,45 >=3: split 45, append 4 and 5, prev=5

Next,67 >=5: split 67, append 6 and 7, prev=7

Final sequence: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

Hence, YES.

So, this approach seems to work for these examples.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize prev = -1

Initialize an empty sequence.

Iterate through each element in the array:

if a_i <10:

if a_i >= prev:

append a_i to the sequence

set prev = a_i

else:

return NO

else:

if a_i >= prev:

Option 1: keep a_i, append a_i, set prev = a_i

else:

Option 1 is not possible

if a_i //10 >= prev:

Option 2: split a_i, append a_i //10 and a_i %10, set prev = a_i %10

else:

Option 2 is not possible

if neither option is possible, return NO

At the end, return YES

Let me test this with the third example: [0,0]

Start with prev=-1

First element,0 >= -1: append 0, set prev=0

Second element,0 >=0: append 0, set prev=0

Final sequence: [0,0], which is sorted.

Hence, YES.

Seems correct.

Another test case: [15,2,34]

Possible sequences:

- Keep 15, keep 2, keep 34: [15,2,34] -> not sorted

- Split 15, keep 2, keep 34: [1,5,2,34] -> not sorted

- Keep 15, split 2 (not possible, 2<10), keep 34: [15,2,34] -> same as first

- Split 15, split 2 (not possible), keep 34: [1,5,2,34] -> same as second

- Keep 15, keep 2, split 34: [15,2,3,4] -> not sorted

- Split 15, keep 2, split 34: [1,5,2,3,4] -> not sorted

- Keep 15, split 2 (not possible), split 34: [15,2,3,4] -> same as fifth

- Split 15, split 2 (not possible), split 34: [1,5,2,3,4] -> same as sixth

So, in all cases, it's impossible to sort.

Using the approach:

Start with prev=-1

First element,15 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 15, append 15, prev=15

Second element,2 <15:

Option 1: keep 2, but 2 <15, so cannot keep 2

Option 2: split 2? 2<10, only one option: keep 2, but 2 <15, so cannot

Hence, return NO

Which is correct.

Another test case: [19,25,3]

Possible sequences:

- Keep 19, keep 25, keep 3: [19,25,3] -> not sorted

- Split 19, keep 25, keep 3: [1,9,25,3] -> not sorted

- Keep 19, split 25, keep 3: [19,2,5,3] -> not sorted

- Split 19, split 25, keep 3: [1,9,2,5,3] -> not sorted

- Keep 19, keep 25, split 3: [19,25,3] -> same as first

- Split 19, keep 25, split 3: [1,9,25,3] -> same as second

- Keep 19, split 25, split 3: [19,2,5,3] -> same as third

- Split 19, split 25, split 3: [1,9,2,5,3] -> same as fourth

All are not sorted, so NO.

Using the approach:

Start with prev=-1

First element,19 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 19, append 19, prev=19

Second element,25 >=19:

Option 1: keep 25, append 25, prev=25

Third element,3 <25:

Option 1: keep 3, but 3 <25, cannot

Option 2: split 3? 3<10, only one option: keep 3, which is <25, so cannot

Hence, return NO

Correct.

Another test case: [10,11,12]

Possible sequences:

- Keep all: [10,11,12] -> sorted, YES

- Split 10: [1,0,11,12] -> not sorted

- Split 11: [10,1,1,12] -> not sorted

- Split 12: [10,11,1,2] -> not sorted

- Split 10 and 11: [1,0,1,1,12] -> not sorted

- Split 10 and 12: [1,0,11,1,2] -> not sorted

- Split 11 and 12: [10,1,1,1,2] -> not sorted

- Split all: [1,0,1,1,1,2] -> not sorted

So, only keeping all gives a sorted array.

Using the approach:

Start with prev=-1

First element,10 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 10, append 10, prev=10

Second element,11 >=10:

Option 1: keep 11, append 11, prev=11

Third element,12 >=11:

Option 1: keep 12, append 12, prev=12

Final sequence: [10,11,12], which is sorted. YES

Correct.

Another test case: [5,15,10]

Possible sequences:

- Keep all: [5,15,10] -> not sorted

- Split 15: [5,1,5,10] -> not sorted

- Split 10: [5,15,1,0] -> not sorted

- Split 15 and 10: [5,1,5,1,0] -> not sorted

So, cannot sort.

Using the approach:

Start with prev=-1

First element,5 >= -1:

Option 1: keep 5, append 5, prev=5

Second element,15 >=5:

Option 1: keep 15, append 15, prev=15

Third element,10 <15:

Option 1: keep 10, but 10 <15, cannot

Option 2: split 10, append 1 and 0, prev=0

But prev=0 < previous prev=15, which is not allowed

Hence, cannot sort. NO

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for these test cases.

Now, let's see if it works for the general case.

Consider [20,30,40]

Possible sequences:

- Keep all: [20,30,40] -> sorted

- Split any of them: [2,0,30,40], [20,3,0,40], [20,30,4,0], [2,0,3,0,40], [2,0,30,4,0], [20,3,
