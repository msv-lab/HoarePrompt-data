Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to earn a lot of money by going to a casino. The casino has some specific rules for betting, and there's also a promotion where Sasha can't lose more than a certain number of times in a row. I need to determine whether, given these rules, Sasha can always reach any target amount of coins, no matter how big it is.

First, I need to understand the casino's rules properly. When Sasha places a bet of y coins, if he wins, he gets y * k coins. So, his coins increase by y * (k - 1). If he loses, he loses the entire bet amount y. Importantly, y has to be a positive integer and cannot exceed his current coins.

Also, there's this promotion: Sasha can't lose more than x times in a row. That means after x consecutive losses, the next bet must be a win.

Now, the question is whether Sasha can make bets in such a way that, no matter what, he can reach any target amount n of coins. In other words, is there a strategy where, regardless of the outcomes (as long as they don't contradict the rules), he can guarantee that he will at some point have at least n coins.

Given that n can be any integer, this seems like Sasha needs to be able to increase his coins without bound, essentially being able to make his coin amount arbitrarily large.

I need to think about how Sasha can manage his bets to ensure that, even in the worst-case scenario (maximal losses), he still progresses towards his goal.

Let me consider the constraints:

- k is at least 2, meaning that wins more than double his bet.

- x is at least 1, meaning he can lose at least once before needing a win.

- a is his starting amount, which is at least 1.

I need to find out if, with a given k, x, and a, Sasha can always reach any n.

Looking at the sample input and output:

- For k=2, x=1, a=7, the answer is YES.

- For k=2, x=1, a=1, the answer is NO.

- For k=2, x=3, a=15, the answer is YES.

- And so on.

From these, it seems that for the same k and x, different starting amounts a can lead to different answers.

I need to find a relationship between k, x, and a that determines whether it's possible to reach any n.

I recall that in problems involving betting and multiplication factors, the concept of a "martingale" betting system comes up, where you double your bet after every loss to recoup previous losses when you finally win. But here, the multiplication factor is k, which may not necessarily be 2.

However, in this problem, Sasha can't lose more than x times in a row, which limits the number of consecutive losses.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the maximum amount Sasha could lose in x consecutive losses and ensure that his starting amount a is sufficient to cover that.

But it's not just about covering losses; it's about being able to keep betting and eventually reach any large n.

Wait, actually, the problem is to determine if Sasha can be guaranteed to reach any n, meaning that no matter how large n is, there's a strategy that allows him to reach it.

This sounds like needing to have unbounded growth in his coin amount.

But with the constraint on consecutive losses, I need to ensure that even in the worst-case sequence of wins and losses, his coin amount doesn't get stuck at a certain level.

Let me try to model this.

Let's think recursively. Suppose Sasha has c coins currently.

He bets y coins, where y is some positive integer <= c.

If he wins, his new coin amount is c - y + y * k = c + y*(k-1).

If he loses, his new coin amount is c - y.

Now, the sequence of wins and losses is constrained by the x consecutive losses limit.

Meaning, in any sequence of outcomes, he can have at most x consecutive losses before there's a win.

I need to consider the minimal amount he can have after any sequence of outcomes, given this constraint.

If, in the worst case, he suffers x losses in a row, then he must have enough coins left to continue betting.

But since he can't have more than x consecutive losses, after x losses, the next bet must be a win.

So, perhaps I can model the minimal amount he needs to start with to ensure that he can keep betting without getting stuck.

Wait, but the problem is to see if he can reach any n, not just to avoid getting stuck.

But to reach arbitrary n, he needs to be able to keep increasing his coin amount indefinitely.

So, perhaps if he has a certain minimal starting amount based on k and x, he can achieve unbounded growth.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- For k=2 and x=1, a=7 is enough to say YES, but a=1 is NO.

- For k=2 and x=3, a=15 is YES.

This seems like there's a threshold for a based on k and x.

Maybe I need to compute some sum based on k and x to find the minimal required a.

Let me try to think about the minimal a required.

Suppose x=1, meaning Sasha can't lose more than once in a row.

So, after one loss, the next bet must be a win.

Let's say he starts with a coins.

He makes a bet of y1.

If he wins, his coins become a - y1 + y1 * k = a + y1 * (k-1).

If he loses, he has a - y1, and since x=1, his next bet must win.

So, he bets y2 <= a - y1, and if he wins, his coins become (a - y1) - y2 + y2 * k.

But since the next bet must win, perhaps he can choose y2 to maximize his coins.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal a that allows Sasha to withstand x consecutive losses and still have enough to make a winning bet that significantly increases his coins.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the maximal possible loss.

If Sasha can lose up to x times in a row, his maximal loss would be the sum of the bets in those x losses.

But he can't lose more than x times in a row, so after x losses, the next bet must be a win.

So, perhaps the total amount he can lose is the sum of the bets in x losses.

But the bets can vary.

He can choose different y for each bet.

To maximize his potential growth, he needs to balance his bets so that the potential wins outweigh the possible losses.

This seems tricky.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

In the first sample:

k=2, x=1, a=7 → YES

k=2, x=1, a=1 → NO

So, for k=2 and x=1, a needs to be at least some value, which seems to be 7.

In the third sample:

k=2, x=3, a=15 → YES

So, for x=3, a needs to be at least 15.

Is there a formula that relates a, k, and x to determine if it's possible?

Let me try to find a general formula.

Suppose Sasha can lose up to x times in a row.

Each loss reduces his coins by y, and each win increases his coins by y*(k-1).

After x losses, the next bet must be a win.

So, perhaps I can model the minimal a required based on the maximal possible losses and the gains from wins.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the total possible losses.

If Sasha can lose up to x times in a row, and each loss is y_i, then his total loss is sum_{i=1}^x y_i.

After x losses, he must have enough coins left to make a winning bet y_{x+1}, which will give him y_{x+1} * (k - 1) coins.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define f(c) as the minimal n that Sasha can guarantee to reach starting with c coins.

But this seems too abstract.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal a such that, after x losses, he still has enough to make a winning bet that allows him to progress.

Wait, perhaps I can model the worst-case scenario where Sasha suffers x losses in a row, and then has to win once.

In this scenario, his coins would be a - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx) + y_{x+1} * (k - 1).

But he has to choose y1, y2, ..., y_{x+1} such that y_{i} <= current coins at that step.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a pattern in the sample inputs.

Looking at k=2, x=1, a=7 → YES

What is special about a=7?

Similarly, for k=2, x=3, a=15 → YES

Is there a relationship between k, x, and a?

Let me try to compute a based on k and x.

For k=2 and x=1, a=7 is acceptable, but a=1 is not.

What is the minimal a required for k=2 and x=1?

Let me try to compute it.

If x=1, meaning Sasha can't lose more than once in a row.

So, after one loss, the next bet must be a win.

Suppose he starts with a coins.

He makes a bet y1.

If he wins, his coins become a - y1 + y1 * 2 = a + y1.

If he loses, he has a - y1, and the next bet must be a win.

So, he bets y2 <= a - y1.

If he wins this bet, his coins become (a - y1) - y2 + y2 * 2 = a - y1 - y2 + 2 y2 = a - y1 + y2.

Wait, to maximize his coins, he would want to choose y2 as large as possible, which is a - y1.

So, a - y1 + (a - y1) = 2(a - y1).

Comparing this to the initial a + y1 in the win scenario.

To maximize his coins in the loss scenario, he should choose y1 as small as possible, to maximize a - y1.

But y1 has to be at least 1.

So, minimal y1 is 1.

Thus, after one loss and one win, his coins would be 2(a - 1).

Now, to ensure that he can reach any n, he needs to be able to keep increasing his coins.

But I'm not sure if this approach is leading me somewhere.

Maybe I need to consider that with x=1, he can't have two losses in a row.

So, after one loss, he must have a win.

Therefore, his sequence of bets can be: win, loss+win, win, loss+win, etc.

Each loss+win sequence effectively reduces his coins by y1 and then increases by y2*(k-1).

But y2 is <= a - y1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the net gain per cycle.

Suppose a cycle is: possibly some losses followed by a win.

Given that he can't have more than x losses in a row, each cycle consists of up to x losses followed by one win.

I need to compute the net gain per cycle.

Let me try to model one cycle.

In one cycle:

- He loses x times, betting y1, y2, ..., yx coins respectively.

- Then he wins once, betting y_{x+1} coins.

His coins after x losses:

c - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx)

Then he wins the next bet:

c - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx) - y_{x+1} + y_{x+1} * k

Simplify:

c - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx) - y_{x+1} + y_{x+1} * k = c - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx) + y_{x+1} * (k - 1)

To maximize the coins after each cycle, he needs to choose y1, y2, ..., y_{x+1} such that y_{i} <= current coins at that step.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that in the worst-case scenario, he suffers x losses followed by a win, and this cycle repeats.

I need to ensure that after each such cycle, his coins are still increasing without bound.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the minimal a such that the potential losses don't deplete his coins to a point where he can't make further bets.

Wait, maybe I can model the minimal a required based on the sum of a geometric series.

Let me consider that each loss reduces his coins by y, and each win increases them by y*(k-1).

If he can choose y appropriately, perhaps he can ensure that his coins keep growing.

But I'm still not seeing a clear path to the solution.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can reverse-engineer the logic.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())

s = 1

for i in range(x):

s += s // (k - 1) + 1

print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')

So, for each test case, it reads k, x, a.

Then, it initializes s = 1.

Then, it runs a loop x times, where in each iteration, it adds to s the integer division of s by (k - 1) plus 1.

Finally, it checks if a >= s and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

I need to understand why this code is doing this.

Let me try to see what s represents.

In the first iteration (i=0):

s = 1

add s // (k - 1) + 1 = 1 // (k - 1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

so s becomes 1 + 1 = 2

Second iteration (i=1):

add 2 // (k - 1) + 1

Third iteration (i=2):

add (previous s) // (k - 1) + 1

and so on, up to x iterations.

Then, it checks if a >= s.

I need to see if this s corresponds to some minimal required a.

Perhaps s represents the minimal starting amount a needed to withstand x consecutive losses and still be able to make the required bets to reach an arbitrary n.

Wait, maybe s is calculated based on the maximal possible losses.

Let me try to compute s for the sample input where k=2, x=1, a=7.

s = 1

First iteration:

s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

So s = 1 + 2 = 3

Wait, no, the code is s = 1, then s += 1 // 1 + 1, which is s = 1 + (1 // 1 + 1) = 1 + (1 + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3

But in the sample input, for k=2, x=1, a=7, it's YES, but according to this, s would be 3, and a=7 >= 3, which is true, matching the sample output of YES.

In the second sample input, k=2, x=1, a=1:

s = 1 + (1 // 1 + 1) = 1 + (1 + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3

a=1 < 3, so NO.

Third sample, k=2, x=3, a=15:

Iteration 1: s = 1 + (1//1 + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3

Iteration 2: s = 3 + (3//1 + 1) = 3 + 4 = 7

Iteration 3: s = 7 + (7//1 + 1) = 7 + 8 = 15

So s=15, and a=15 >=15, YES.

Another sample: k=3, x=3, a=6

Iteration 1: s=1 + (1//2 +1) =1 + (0 +1)=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + (2//2 +1)=2 + (1 +1)=4

Iteration 3: s=4 + (4//2 +1)=4 + (2 +1)=7

a=6 <7, NO.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's NO, which matches.

Another sample: k=4, x=4, a=5

Iteration 1: s=1 + (1//3 +1)=1 + (0 +1)=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + (2//3 +1)=2 + (0 +1)=3

Iteration 3: s=3 + (3//3 +1)=3 + (1 +1)=5

Iteration 4: s=5 + (5//3 +1)=5 + (1 +1)=7

a=5 <7, NO.

Sample input has NO, which matches.

Another sample: k=5, x=4, a=7

Iteration 1: s=1 + (1//4 +1)=1 + (0 +1)=2

Iteration 2: s=2 + (2//4 +1)=2 + (0 +1)=3

Iteration 3: s=3 + (3//4 +1)=3 + (0 +1)=4

Iteration 4: s=4 + (4//4 +1)=4 + (1 +1)=6

a=7 >=6, YES.

Sample input has YES, which matches.

So, it seems that this code is correctly computing s in a way that matches the sample inputs.

Therefore, it seems that the logic in the code is correct.

But I still don't understand why this formula works.

Let me try to understand the logic behind s.

It seems that s is built iteratively, where in each iteration, we're adding something based on the previous s divided by (k-1) and adding 1.

This resembles some kind of recursive relationship.

Perhaps it's modeling the maximal possible loss sequence.

Let me consider that in x losses, the total loss is the sum of the bets y1, y2, ..., yx.

But in the code, s seems to be accumulating these potential losses in a specific way.

Wait, maybe s represents the total potential losses plus some.

Let me consider that after each loss, the next bet is based on the previous one.

For example, if y1 is the first bet and is lost, then y2 is the second bet, which might be related to y1.

But I'm still not getting it.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that with x losses in a row, the total loss is y1 + y2 + ... + yx.

But due to the promotion, after x losses, the next bet must be a win.

So, the sequence is x losses followed by one win.

In that case, the net change in coins would be:

- (y1 + y2 + ... + yx) + y_{x+1} * (k - 1)

But y_{x+1} is the bet after x losses, which must be a win.

To maximize the net gain, Sasha would want y_{x+1} to be as large as possible, but it can't exceed his current coins after x losses.

So, after x losses, his coins are a - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx).

Then, y_{x+1} <= a - (y1 + y2 + ... + yx).

He wants to choose y_{x+1} to maximize the net gain.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose x=1, meaning Sasha can't lose more than once in a row.

So, after one loss, the next bet must be a win.

In this case, his sequence is: win, loss+win, win, loss+win, etc.

Let's see what's the minimal a required.

In the sample input, for k=2 and x=1, a=7 is acceptable, but a=1 is not.

Wait, in the code, for k=2, x=1, s=3.

But in the sample input, a=7 >=3, YES, and a=1 <3, NO.

But in the explanation, it says that for k=2, x=1, a=7, Sasha can use a strategy where he bets 1 coin if it's the first bet or he won the previous bet, and bets 2 coins if he lost the previous bet.

He can't lose more than once in a row, so after a loss, he must win the next bet.

Let's simulate this:

Start with a=7.

First bet: win -> coins become 7 -1 +1*2 = 8

Second bet: win -> 8 -1 +1*2 =9

And so on, increasing by 1 each time he wins.

Alternatively, first bet: loss -> coins become 7 -1 =6

Then, next bet must be a win: bet y <=6.

To maximize, he bets y=6.

Wins: coins become 6 -6 +6*2 =12

Then, next bet: win -> 12 -1 +1*2=13

And so on.

So, in this way, he can reach higher amounts.

But with a=1:

First bet: win -> 1 -1 +1*2=2

Second bet: win ->2 -1 +1*2=3

Third bet: win ->3 -1 +1*2=4

And so on, increasing by 1 each time.

Alternatively, first bet: loss -> coins become 1 -1=0

But he can't make any more bets because he has 0 coins left.

Hence, a=1 is not sufficient, as there's a risk of ending up with 0 coins.

So, s=3 seems to be the minimal a required for k=2 and x=1.

But according to the code, s=3 for x=1 and k=2.

How is s calculated?

s =1

Iteration 1: s += 1//(2-1) +1 =1 + (1//1 +1)=1 + (1 +1)=2

s=1 +2=3

So, s=3.

Similarly, for x=3 and k=2:

s=1

Iteration 1: s +=1//1 +1=1 + (1 +1)=2 -> s=3

Iteration 2: s +=3//1 +1=3 + (3 +1)=7 -> s=10

Iteration 3: s +=7//1 +1=7 + (7 +1)=15 -> s=22

But in the sample input, for k=2, x=3, a=15, it's YES, but according to this, s=22, which would require a >=22, but the sample input has a=15 and output YES.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating s.

Wait, no, in the code, it's s += s//(k-1) +1.

Wait, in the sample input, for k=2, x=3, a=15, output is YES.

But according to the code, s=15 for k=2, x=3.

Wait, let's compute s step by step for k=2, x=3.

s=1

Iteration 1: s += 1//(2-1) +1 =1 + (1//1 +1)=1 + (1 +1)=2 -> s=1 +2=3

Iteration 2: s +=3//(2-1) +1=3 + (3//1 +1)=3 + (3 +1)=7 -> s=7 +0=7

Wait, no, the code does s += s//(k-1) +1, so s =7

Iteration 3: s +=7//(2-1) +1=7 + (7//1 +1)=7 + (7 +1)=15 -> s=15

So, s=15.

Hence, a=15 >=15, YES.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had s=1+2=3, then 3+4=7, then 7+8=15, total s=15.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

In any case, the code seems to be correctly calculating s for the given sample inputs.

Therefore, it seems that the code is correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Sasha can make bets in a way that guarantees he can reach any desired number of coins `n`, given the constraints of the casino's rules and promotion.

## Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - **Winning Bet**: If Sasha bets `y` coins and wins, he receives `y * k` coins.
    - **Losing Bet**: If he loses, he loses the entire bet amount `y`.
    - **Consecutive Losses Limit**: Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Strategy**:
    - We need to ensure that even in the worst-case scenario (maximal losses), Sasha can still progress towards his goal of reaching any large `n`.
    - Calculate a threshold value `s` based on `k` and `x` to determine the minimal starting amount `a` required to guarantee reaching any `n`.

3. **Calculation of Minimal Starting Amount**:
    - Initialize `s` to 1.
    - Iteratively compute `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` times.
    - Compare the starting amount `a` with the computed `s` to decide if it's possible to reach any `n`.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `s` starts at 1, representing the base case or minimal initial coin requirement.
  
- **Iterative Calculation**:
  - For each possible sequence of up to `x` consecutive losses, we compute the cumulative effect on the coin amount.
  - In each iteration, `s` is updated to account for the potential losses and necessary wins to recover and progress.

- **Decision Making**:
  - If the starting amount `a` is greater than or equal to the computed threshold `s`, it is possible to guarantee reaching any `n` (`Yes`).
  - Otherwise, it is not guaranteed (`No`).

This approach ensures that we account for the worst-case scenarios imposed by the constraints, thereby determining the feasibility of reaching any desired coin amount `n`.
