Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i != i, so no one is their own best friend, and no two friends have the same best friend.

2. A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least two friends to come to the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and p_i are distinct, this forms a permutation of the friends. In other words, it's like a matching where each friend is matched to another friend, and this matching is a derangement because no one is matched to themselves.

Given that, the friendships form a collection of cycles. Because it's a permutation, the friends are organized into cycles where each friend points to another's best friend, and eventually, you loop back.

For example, if n=3 and p=[2,3,1], then friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 1. This forms a cycle of length 3.

In this problem, the goal is to select a set of friends to invite such that at least two friends come to the party, and the number of invitations sent is minimized.

Given the condition that a friend comes only if both they and their best friend are invited, it's clear that for a friend to come, we need to invite both them and their best friend.

But here's the twist: when you invite two friends who are each other's best friends, both will come only if they both are invited. However, if you have cycles longer than two, the conditions become more interesting.

Let's consider the example given:

First testcase:

n=5

p=[3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 2's best friend is 1, friend 3's best friend is 2, friend 4's best friend is 5, and friend 5's best friend is 4.

This forms two cycles: 1->3->2->1 and 4->5->4.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5, then both will come because each is the best friend of the other, and both are invited.

So, in this case, sending two invitations is enough to have two friends come to the party.

Second testcase:

n=4

p=[2,3,4,1]

Friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 3, friend 3's best friend is 4, and friend 4's best friend is 1.

This forms a single cycle of length 4: 1->2->3->4->1.

To get at least two friends to come, Monocarp needs to invite three friends.

For example, inviting 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 will come if both 1 and 2 are invited. Yes, both are invited.

- Friend 2 will come if both 2 and 3 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 3 will come if both 3 and 4 are invited. But 4 is not invited, so friend 3 does not come.

- Friend 4 was not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 will come.

It's mentioned that it's impossible to send invitations to fewer than three friends and have at least two come.

Third testcase:

n=2

p=[2,1]

Only two friends, each other's best friends.

If Monocarp invites both, both will come.

So, sending two invitations results in both coming.

Now, the task is to find the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least two friends come.

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

v = [0] * (n + 1)

v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if v[v[i]] == i:

print(2)

return

print(3)

So, the program reads t test cases, and for each, it reads n and the list p_i.

Then, it checks for each friend i whether v[v[i]] == i. If this condition holds for any i, it prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, it prints 3.

Wait a minute, what does v[v[i]] == i mean?

Given that v[i] is the best friend of i, v[v[i]] is the best friend of the best friend of i.

So, if v[v[i]] == i, it means that i and v[i] are in a cycle of length 2: i's best friend is v[i], and v[i]'s best friend is i.

In other words, they are each other's best friends.

In such a case, Monocarp can invite both i and v[i], which totals two invitations, and both will come because each is the best friend of the other, and both are invited.

Hence, in this scenario, sending two invitations is sufficient to have two friends come.

On the other hand, if there are no such pairs (i.e., no cycles of length 2), then the minimal number of invitations needed is 3.

Is this always the case?

Let's think about it.

If there are no cycles of length 2, that means all cycles are of length greater than or equal to 3.

In a cycle of length 3, say 1->2->3->1.

To have at least two friends come, we need to invite in such a way that at least two friends have both themselves and their best friends invited.

Suppose we invite 1, 2, and 3.

Then:

- Friend 1 will come if both 1 and 2 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 2 will come if both 2 and 3 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 3 will come if both 3 and 1 are invited. Yes.

So, all three will come, but that's more than needed.

But the problem is to minimize the number of invitations.

Is there a way to have at least two friends come with fewer than three invitations?

Let's see.

If we invite only two friends, say 1 and 2.

Then:

- Friend 1 will come if both 1 and 2 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 2 will come if both 2 and 3 are invited. No, because 3 is not invited.

- Friend 3 will not come since not invited.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

If we invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1 will come if both 1 and 2 are invited. No, because 2 is not invited.

- Friend 3 will come if both 3 and 1 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 2 will not come since not invited.

So, only friend 3 comes, which is insufficient.

If we invite 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 will come if both 2 and 3 are invited. Yes.

- Friend 3 will come if both 3 and 1 are invited. No, because 1 is not invited.

- Friend 1 will not come since not invited.

So, only friend 2 comes, which is insufficient.

Hence, in a cycle of three, we cannot have at least two friends come with fewer than three invitations.

Therefore, in cycles of three or more, we need to invite at least three friends to have at least two friends come to the party.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct:

- If there exists at least one pair of friends who are each other's best friends (a cycle of length 2), then sending two invitations to these two is enough to have both come.

- Otherwise, in cycles of three or more, we need to send at least three invitations to have at least two friends come.

Therefore, the program correctly identifies whether such a pair exists. If it does, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

Looking back at the examples:

First testcase:

n=5

p=[3,1,2,5,4]

Here, friend 1's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 2, which is not 1. So, v[v[1]] = v[3] =2 !=1.

Similarly, friend 2's best friend is 1, and v[v[2]] = v[1] =3 !=2.

Friend 3's best friend is 2, v[v[3]] = v[2] =1 !=3.

Friend 4's best friend is 5, v[v[4]] = v[5] =4 ==4, but wait, p_i !=i, but in this case, p_i are distinct and p_i !=i.

Wait, p_i are distinct and p_i !=i.

Wait, in this case, p=[3,1,2,5,4]

So, v[1]=3, v[2]=1, v[3]=2, v[4]=5, v[5]=4

Then, v[v[1]]=v[3]=2 !=1

v[v[2]]=v[1]=3 !=2

v[v[3]]=v[2]=1 !=3

v[v[4]]=v[5]=4 !=4 (since p_i !=i)

v[v[5]]=v[4]=5 !=5

Hence, no v[v[i]] ==i, so it should print 3, but in the example, it's printing 2.

Wait, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the first testcase, the explanation says that inviting friends 4 and 5 is sufficient, which are each other's best friends.

Wait, v[4]=5 and v[5]=4, so v[v[4]]=4 ==i (i=4), and similarly v[v[5]]=5 ==5.

Wait, but in the code, it has v[0]=0, and v[1 to n] are the p_i.

So, in the first testcase, v=[0,3,1,2,5,4]

Then, for i=1: v[v[1]]=v[3]=2 !=1

i=2: v[v[2]]=v[1]=3 !=2

i=3: v[v[3]]=v[2]=1 !=3

i=4: v[v[4]]=v[5]=4 ==4

i=5: v[v[5]]=v[4]=5 ==5

So, for i=4 and i=5, v[v[i]]==i.

Hence, the condition is satisfied for i=4 and i=5.

Therefore, it should print 2, which matches the first testcase.

Similarly, in the second testcase:

n=4

p=[2,3,4,1]

v=[0,2,3,4,1]

Then, for i=1: v[v[1]]=v[2]=3 !=1

i=2: v[v[2]]=v[3]=4 !=2

i=3: v[v[3]]=v[4]=1 !=3

i=4: v[v[4]]=v[1]=2 !=4

Hence, no v[v[i]]==i, so it should print 3, which matches the second testcase.

Third testcase:

n=2

p=[2,1]

v=[0,2,1]

for i=1: v[v[1]]=v[2]=1 ==1

i=2: v[v[2]]=v[1]=2 ==2

Hence, it should print 2, which matches the third testcase.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

Wait, but in the first testcase, according to the program, it should print 2 if there exists any i where v[v[i]]==i.

But in the explanation, it's possible to have two friends come by inviting only two friends.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the first testcase, p=[3,1,2,5,4], which forms two cycles: 1-3-2 and 4-5.

For 4-5, v[4]=5 and v[5]=4, so v[v[4]]=4==4, and v[v[5]]=5==5.

Hence, the condition is satisfied for i=4 and i=5.

Therefore, it's correct to print 2.

In the second testcase, p=[2,3,4,1], which forms a single cycle of length 4:1-2-3-4.

No v[v[i]]==i, hence print 3.

In the third testcase, p=[2,1], which is a cycle of length 2:1-2.

Hence, v[v[1]]=1 and v[v[2]]=2, so print 2.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic based on whether there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{2} \]
