Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that it can always be done, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. By selecting i, j, and x, I'm essentially replacing a substring of the array with a single value x, and the cost is the length of that substring.

Since I can perform this operation at most once, I need to decide whether it's better to perform the operation or not. If I don't perform the operation, the array remains as it is, and all elements must already be equal for the cost to be zero. If they're not equal, I need to perform the operation to make them equal.

But wait, the problem says I can perform the operation "no more than once," meaning I can choose to perform it zero or one time.

Given that, I need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal, possibly by doing nothing (if the array is already uniform) or by performing one operation.

Looking at the example:

Input:

8

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

1 2

3

1 2 3

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

Let's take the first test case:

n = 6

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

The output is 4.

So, I need to make all elements equal with at most one operation, and the minimum cost is 4.

How can I achieve that?

If I choose i=2, j=4, x=8, the array becomes [1,8,8,8,5,1], which is not all equal.

Wait, no, the example in the problem seems to be different from the test case output.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's just an example of performing the operation, not the exact test case.

Looking back at the problem, it says "what is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements of the array equal?"

And you can perform the operation at most once, meaning you can choose to perform it or not.

If you don't perform the operation, the array remains as it is. So, if the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.

If not, you need to perform the operation to make all elements equal.

But you can only perform the operation once, so you need to find the minimal cost to make the array uniform with at most one operation.

I need to find the minimal cost such that after performing at most one operation, all elements are equal.

Wait, but the operation allows me to set a subarray to a single value x, and I can do this only once.

So, I need to choose i, j, x such that after setting arr[i..j] to x, the entire array becomes equal to x, or to some other value.

Wait, but if I set arr[i..j] to x, the rest of the array remains as is, so I need to make sure that the rest of the array is already equal to x.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about making the entire array equal to some value y, and to do that, I need to set certain parts of the array to y, and find the minimal cost for that.

But I can only perform one operation, which allows me to set a subarray to a single value x.

Wait, but if I set a subarray to x, and the rest of the array is already x, then the whole array becomes x.

So, I need to choose a value x, and a subarray to set to x, such that the rest of the array is already x, and the cost is minimized.

But in reality, the rest of the array may not be x, so I need to find a way to make the entire array x by setting one subarray to x.

Wait, maybe I should choose x to be the most frequent value in the array, but I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set the entire array to a single value x. The minimal cost would be to set the smallest subarray that covers all the elements that are not equal to x.

So, I need to find the minimal cost to cover all non-x elements with one subarray.

But I can only perform one operation, so I need to cover all non-x elements with one subarray.

Therefore, for a given x, the cost is the length of the subarray that covers all non-x elements.

I need to choose x such that this length is minimized.

So, the minimal cost is the minimal length among all possible x of the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

Alternatively, for each x, find the minimal subarray that covers all elements not equal to x, and then choose the x that minimizes this subarray length.

That seems correct.

So, the algorithm would be:

- For each test case:

- Find the frequency of each element in the array.

- Find the element with the highest frequency.

- Calculate the minimal subarray length that covers all elements not equal to this highest frequency element.

- The cost is the length of this subarray.

- If the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.

Let me verify this with the first test case:

n=6

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

The frequency of 1 is 2, frequency of 2 is 1, frequency of 3 is 1, frequency of 4 is 1, frequency of 5 is 1.

The most frequent element is 1 with frequency 2.

So, I need to cover all elements that are not 1, which are positions 2,3,4,5.

The subarray from i=2 to j=5, which has length 4.

So, the cost is 4, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=7

arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

All elements are 1, so cost is 0.

Another test case:

n=8

arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

The most frequent element is 8, with frequency 6.

Non-8 elements are at positions 4 and 5.

So, the minimal subarray covering positions 4 and 5 is from i=4 to j=5, length 2.

So, cost is 2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=1

arr=[1]

Already uniform, cost is 0.

Another test case:

n=2

arr=[1,2]

The most frequent elements are 1 and 2, both with frequency 1.

Choosing x=1, non-x elements are at position 2, so subarray from 2 to 2, length 1.

Choosing x=2, non-x elements are at position 1, subarray from 1 to1, length 1.

So, minimal cost is 1, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=3

arr=[1,2,3]

Choose x=1, non-x elements at positions 2 and 3, subarray from 2 to 3, length 2.

Choose x=2, non-x elements at positions 1 and 3, subarray from 1 to 3, length 3.

Choose x=3, non-x elements at positions 1 and 2, subarray from 1 to 2, length 2.

So, minimal cost is 2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=7

arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Most frequent element is 1, frequency 2.

Non-1 elements are positions 1,2,3,4,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering these positions is from 1 to 7, length 7.

But according to the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, positions are 1-based, so positions 1 to 7 are the entire array.

But the sample output is 6, which would be positions 1 to 6, but that doesn't cover position 7.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be an element that is already in the array, but maybe not necessarily the most frequent one.

Wait, but in the previous test cases, choosing the most frequent element seems to work.

Wait, in this case, choosing x=1, non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,6,7.

To cover these, I need a subarray from 1 to 7, which is length 7.

But the sample output is 6, which is less than 7.

So, perhaps choosing x=1 is not the best choice.

Maybe choosing a different x gives a better result.

Let's try x=3.

Frequency of 3 is 2.

Non-3 elements are at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering these is from 1 to 7, length 7.

Worse than choosing x=1.

Choose x=2.

Frequency of 2 is 1.

Non-2 elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Worse.

Choose x=7.

Frequency of 7 is 1.

Non-7 elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Worse.

Choose x=4.

Frequency of 4 is 1.

Non-4 elements are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 2 to 7, length 6.

So, choosing x=4, the minimal subarray to cover all non-x elements is from 2 to 7, length 6, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, choosing x=4 gives a better result than choosing the most frequent element x=1.

Wait, so my initial assumption that choosing the most frequent element is always optimal might be wrong.

I need to consider all possible x values, not just the most frequent one.

So, the correct approach is to consider all possible x values (from 1 to n, since a_i <= n), and for each x, calculate the minimal subarray length that covers all non-x elements, and then take the minimal among these.

In the previous test case, choosing x=4 gives a minimal subarray length of 6, which is better than choosing x=1, which gives 7.

So, I need to consider all possible x, not just the most frequent one.

Therefore, my initial approach needs correction.

So, the correct algorithm is:

- For each test case:

- For each possible x (from 1 to n):

- Find all positions where arr[i] != x.

- Find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions.

- If no such positions exist, cost is 0.

- The minimal subarray length covering all non-x positions is the difference between the maximum and minimum positions plus one.

- If there are no non-x elements, cost is 0.

- Find the minimal such length over all x.

- That's the answer.

Wait, but in the previous test case, x=4 has non-x elements at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

The minimal subarray covering these is from 1 to 7, length 7.

But according to the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, positions are from 1 to 7.

If I choose x=4, non-x elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

So, the minimal subarray covering these is from 1 to 7, which is length 7.

But the sample output is 6.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x=5.

Let's see:

x=5, frequency=1.

Non-5 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Worse.

x=5 is not in the array, actually.

Wait, no, in the array [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], the elements are from 1 to 7, since n=7.

Wait, n=7, a_i <=n, so x can be from 1 to 7.

Wait, in the array [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], x=5 is not present.

So, non-5 elements are all positions, 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

Wait, perhaps x=2.

x=2, frequency=1.

Non-2 elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

x=3, frequency=2.

Non-3 elements at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

x=4, frequency=1.

Non-4 elements at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

x=7, frequency=1.

Non-7 elements at positions 1,2,3,4,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

x=1, frequency=2.

Non-1 elements at positions 1,2,3,4,6,7.

Minimal subarray from 1 to 7, length 7.

Not better.

Wait, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe choosing x=4 and setting subarray from 2 to 7, which is positions 2 to 7, length 6.

Then, arr becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is all equal to 4.

Yes, that works.

So, in this case, choosing x=4 and setting positions 2 to 7 to 4, which costs 6.

So, in this case, the minimal subarray length is 6, not 7.

Wait, but according to my previous logic, to cover all non-4 positions, which are 1,2,3,5,6,7, I thought I need to set from 1 to 7, but actually, if I set positions 2 to 7 to 4, then position 1 is already 4, so it's already equal to 4.

Wait, no, arr[1]=4, which is equal to x=4, so I don't need to include position 1 in the subarray to be set.

So, only positions 2,3,5,6,7 need to be set to 4 to make the entire array equal to 4.

So, the minimal subarray covering positions 2,3,5,6,7 is from 2 to 7, which is length 6.

So, the cost is 6, which matches the sample output.

Therefore, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

So, for a given x, the minimal subarray length to cover all positions where arr[i] != x.

In this case, for x=4, non-x positions are 2,3,5,6,7, so minimal subarray is from 2 to 7, length 6.

Similarly, for x=1, non-x positions are 2,3,4,5,6,7, minimal subarray from 2 to 7, length 6.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 7, but actually, positions 2 to 7 cover positions 2,3,4,5,6,7, which is length 6.

Wait, position 2 to 7 is 6 positions: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, from 2 to 7 is 6 elements.

So, the cost is 6.

Similarly, for x=4, positions 2,3,5,6,7, setting from 2 to 7, length 6.

So, the minimal cost is 6.

Wait, but in my earlier thinking, I mistakenly thought that to cover positions 1,2,3,5,6,7, I need to set from 1 to 7, which is length 7, but actually, position 1 is already 4, so I don't need to include it in the subarray to be set.

So, only positions where arr[i] != x need to be included in the subarray to be set.

Therefore, for a given x, find all i where arr[i] != x, and find the minimal subarray that covers all these i's.

The length of this subarray is max(i) - min(i) + 1, where i are the positions where arr[i] != x.

Wait, but in the earlier case, for x=4, positions to set are 2,3,5,6,7, so max(i)=7, min(i)=2, so length is 7-2+1=6.

Wait, no, 7-2+1=6, but in 1-based indexing, positions 2 to 7 are 6 positions.

Wait, actually, in programming terms, if positions are 1-based, from 2 to 7 is 6 elements.

So, the length is 6.

Similarly, for x=1, positions to set are 2,3,4,5,6,7, which is 6 positions.

So, the minimal cost is 6.

But in the sample input, the output is 6 for this test case.

So, it's consistent.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- For each possible x (from 1 to n):

- Find all positions i where arr[i] != x.

- If there are no such positions, the cost is 0.

- Otherwise, find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions, which is from the minimum i to the maximum i, inclusive.

- The length of this subarray is max(i) - min(i) + 1, where i are the positions where arr[i] != x.

- Take the minimal such length over all x.

- That's the answer.

This seems correct based on the sample inputs.

Now, considering time constraints.

Given that t <= 10^4 and n <= 2*10^5, and the total sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5, we need an efficient algorithm.

If for each test case, we iterate over all possible x (from 1 to n), and for each x, find the minimal subarray length covering all non-x positions, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2*10^5 in total.

So, we need a better approach.

Alternative approach:

- Find the minimal length of the maximal subarray consisting of identical elements, and then the cost would be n - length.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps find the maximal length of a subarray with identical elements, and then the cost is n - length, since we can set the rest of the array to that value.

But, in the first test case, n=6, the longest subarray with identical elements is 1 (since all elements are unique except the two 1's), so n - length = 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=7, all elements are 1, so maximal subarray length is 7, cost is 7 - 7 = 0, which matches.

In the third test case, n=8, the longest subarray of identical elements is 3 (four 8's), but the answer is 2.

Wait, n=8, arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the longest subarray of identical elements is 4 (positions 1-4: 8,8,8,1 is not all 8's; positions 1-3: 8,8,8; positions 6-8: 8,8,8), so maximal subarray of identical elements is length 3.

Then, n - length = 8 - 3 = 5, but the sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

- Find the minimal number of elements to change to make all elements equal.

- This is equivalent to n - max frequency.

- But in the problem, we can perform at most one operation, which sets a subarray to a single value x, with cost equal to the length of the subarray.

- So, it's not directly equivalent to changing individual elements.

- Changing a subarray to x is cheaper than changing each element individually if the subarray contains multiple elements that need to be changed.

So, I need to find a way to minimize the cost of setting one subarray to make the entire array equal.

Given that, perhaps it's better to find, for each possible x, the minimal subarray that covers all positions where arr[i] != x, and then take the minimal over all x.

But as discussed earlier, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

Is there a better way?

Let's think about it differently.

Suppose I choose to make the entire array equal to x.

Then, I need to set all elements that are not x to x.

I can do this by setting a single subarray that covers all positions where arr[i] != x.

The minimal such subarray is from the minimum i where arr[i] != x to the maximum i where arr[i] != x.

So, for each x, the cost is max(i) - min(i) + 1, where i are positions where arr[i] != x.

If there are no such positions, the cost is 0.

So, for each x, calculate this value, and take the minimal over all x.

Given that n <= 2*10^5 and t <= 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5, we need an efficient way to compute this.

One way is to precompute for each x, the positions where arr[i] != x, and then find the minimal subarray that covers all such positions, which is max(positions) - min(positions) + 1.

But doing this for each x would be O(n * n), which is too slow.

Alternative approach:

- Find the element x that has the maximum frequency.

- Then, the minimal subarray to cover all non-x elements is from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

- So, for the x with the maximum frequency, the cost is the position of the last non-x element minus the position of the first non-x element plus one.

- If all elements are x, the cost is 0.

- We need to consider all x, not just the one with the maximum frequency.

- But considering that n is large, we need a faster way.

Optimized approach:

- Iterate through the array and find the maximum frequency for each x.

- Then, for each x, find the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

- To optimize, we can find for each x, the first and last positions of non-x elements.

- Then, the minimal subarray length is last - first + 1, if there are non-x elements, else 0.

- So, for each x, find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x, and compute last - first + 1.

- Then, take the minimal over all x.

- To implement this efficiently, we can:

- Find the frequency of each x.

- Find the positions where arr[i] != x.

- Find the minimal (last - first + 1) over all x.

But this still seems O(n^2).

Wait, but since n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, we can afford O(n) per test case.

So, perhaps we can precompute the first and last positions of non-x elements for each x.

But that would still be O(n * n).

Wait, no, if we iterate through the array once and store the positions of each x, then for each x, we can find the first and last positions of non-x elements.

Wait, perhaps we can do better.

Alternative idea:

- Find the element x with the maximum frequency.

- Find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- The minimal subarray to cover all non-x elements is from first to last.

- So, the cost is last - first + 1.

- If there are no non-x elements, cost is 0.

- Then, the minimal cost is the minimal last - first + 1 over all x.

- To optimize, we can find the x with the maximum frequency and compute last - first + 1 for that x.

- But as seen in earlier test cases, sometimes choosing a different x gives a better result.

- So, we need to consider all x, not just the one with the maximum frequency.

- But since n is large, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Optimized solution:

- For each test case, iterate through the array and count the frequency of each x.

- Find the x with the maximum frequency.

- For that x, find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- Compute last - first + 1.

- However, to consider all x efficiently, we can iterate through the array once and keep track of the first and last positions where arr[i] != x, for all x.

- But that would still be O(n * n).

Alternative approach:

- Find the minimal window that, when set to a specific x, makes the entire array equal to x.

- But again, this seems too slow.

Efficient approach:

- Iterate through the array and find the maximum frequency of any element.

- Then, find the minimal window that covers all positions where arr[i] != x, for the x with maximum frequency.

- Wait, but as seen in the sample input, choosing x with maximum frequency may not always give the minimal cost.

- So, we need to consider all x, not just the one with maximum frequency.

- Given time constraints, perhaps we can iterate through all possible x, but since x can be from 1 to n, and n <= 2e5, and t <=1e4, but sum of n over all test cases <=2e5, it's still manageable.

- So, per test case, iterate through all x from 1 to n, find the minimal last - first +1 for x where arr[i] != x.

- But this would be O(n * n), which is too slow.

Better approach:

- For each test case, iterate through the array and store the positions of each x in a list.

- Then, for each x, the positions to be set are the positions not in the list of x's positions.

- The minimal subarray covering all non-x positions is from the first to the last of these positions.

- So, for each x, compute the minimal subarray length as last_non_x - first_non_x +1.

- To optimize, we can find the overall first and last positions of all non-x elements for each x.

- But this seems too slow.

Optimized solution:

- Find the intersection of all intervals where arr[i] != x for each x.

- But I'm not sure.

Efficient way:

- Precompute the first and last positions of each x.

- Then, for each x, the first non-x position is the first position before the first x position.

- Similarly, the last non-x position is the last position after the last x position.

- But need to think carefully.

Another idea:

- Find the union of all intervals where arr[i] != x for each x.

- Wait, I'm getting confused.

A better way:

- Iterate through the array and find for each x, the positions where arr[i] != x.

- Then, for each x, find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions.

- To optimize, realize that the minimal subarray is from the first position where arr[i] != x to the last position where arr[i] != x.

- So, for each x, find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- Then, the cost for x is last - first +1.

- If there are no such positions, cost is 0.

- Then, the minimal cost is the minimal last - first +1 over all x.

- To implement this efficiently, we can:

- Find the frequency of each x.

- Find the positions where arr[i] != x.

- Find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- Compute last - first +1.

- But iterating over all x would be too slow for large n.

Alternative efficient approach:

- Find the element x with the maximum frequency.

- Find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- The minimal subarray to cover all non-x elements is from first to last.

- So, cost is last - first +1.

- If all elements are x, cost is 0.

- Then, consider that choosing x with maximum frequency minimizes last - first +1.

- But as seen in earlier test cases, sometimes choosing a different x gives a better result.

- So, this approach might not always give the correct answer.

- Therefore, I need a better way.

Efficient algorithm:

- Find all the positions where arr[i] != mode, where mode is the most frequent element.

- Then, the minimal subarray to cover all these positions is from the first to the last of these positions.

- However, as seen in the sample input, choosing a different x can give a better result.

- So, perhaps choosing the x that maximizes the density of x's in the array minimizes the cost.

- But it's getting complicated.

Optimal solution:

- For each test case, iterate through the array and count frequency of each x.

- Find the x with the maximum frequency.

- For that x, find the first and last positions where arr[i] != x.

- The cost is last - first +1.

- However, to ensure correctness, need to consider all x, not just the one with maximum frequency.

- Given time constraints, perhaps it's acceptable to iterate through all x, since x ranges from 1 to n, and n <= 2e5, and sum of n over all test cases is <=2e5.

- So, per test case, iterating through all x from 1 to n and computing the cost for each x is acceptable.

Implementation:

- For each test case:

- Read n and arr.

- Create a frequency array freq[1..n] initialized to 0.

- For each element in arr, freq[arr[i]] +=1.

- Initialize min_cost to n.

- For x from 1 to n:

- If freq[x] == n:

- cost = 0

- Else:

- Find the first position where arr[i] != x.

- Find the last position where arr[i] != x.

- cost = last - first +1

- Set min_cost to the minimum of min_cost and cost.

- Print min_cost.

This should work and is efficient enough, as it's O(n) per test case.

Now, looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

print(func_1(arr))

t -= 1

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

j = len(arr) -1

while i <=j:

if arr[i] == arr[j]:

i +=1

j -=1

else:

break

if i >j:

return 0

while arr[i] == arr[i+1]:

i +=1

if j != len(arr)-1:

return j -i +1

return j -i

So, the function func_1 is defined to solve this problem.

Let's analyze this function.

It seems to be trying to find a subarray to set so that the array becomes symmetric or something, but it's not clear.

Step by step:

- Initialize i=0 and j=len(arr)-1.

- While i <= j:

- If arr[i] == arr[j], increment i and decrement j.

- Else, break.

- If i > j, return 0.

- While arr[i] == arr[i+1], increment i.

- If j != len(arr)-1, return j -i +1.

- Else, return j -i.

This seems to be trying to find a subarray to set so that the array becomes symmetric, but the problem is to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

This doesn't seem to align with the problem requirements.

Let's test it with the first test case:

n=6

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

Initially, i=0, j=5

arr[0]==arr[5] (1==1), so i=1, j=4

arr[1]==arr[4] (2==5)? No, so break.

i=1, j=4

Then, while arr[1]==arr[2], which 2==3? No, so i remains 1.

j=4, which is not len(arr)-1=5, so return j - i +1 =4 -1 +1=4, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=7

arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

i=0 to j=6

arr[0]==arr[6] (1==1), so i=1, j=5

arr[1]==arr[5] (1==1), so i=2, j=4

arr[2]==arr[4] (1==1), so i=3, j=3

arr[3]==arr[3] (1==1), so i=4, j=2

Now, i=4 > j=2, so return 0, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=8

arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

i=0 to j=7

arr[0]==arr[7] (8==8), i=1, j=6

arr[1]==arr[6] (8==8), i=2, j=5

arr[2]==arr[5] (8==8), i=3, j=4

arr[3]==arr[4] (1==8)? No, break.

So, i=3, j=4

Then, while arr[3]==arr[4], 1==8? No, so i remains 3.

j=4 != 7, so return j -i +1=4-3+1=2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=1

arr=[1]

i=0, j=0

arr[0]==arr[0], so i=1, j=-1

i=1 > j=-1, so return 0, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2

arr=[1,2]

i=0, j=1

arr[0]==arr[1]? 1==2? No, break.

i=0, j=1

Then, while arr[0]==arr[1], 1==2? No, so i=0

j=1 != len(arr)-1=1, so return 1-0+1=2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, the minimal cost should be 1, but the function returns 2.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in this case, to make both elements equal, I can set one of them.

For example, set arr[1] to 1, so arr becomes [1,1], cost=1.

Or set arr[0] to 2, arr becomes [2,2], cost=1.

But according to the function, it returns 2, which is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=2, arr=[1,2], output is 1, but the function returns 2.

So, it's incorrect.

Another test case:

n=3

arr=[1,2,3]

According to the function:

i=0, j=2

arr[0]==arr[2]? 1==3? No, break.

i=0, j=2

while arr[0]==arr[1], 1==2? No, so i=0

j=2 != len(arr)-1=2, so return 2-0+1=3, but sample output is 2.

So, incorrect.

Another test case:

n=7

arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

According to the function:

i=0, j=6

arr[0]==arr[6]? 4==3? No, break.

i=0, j=6

while arr[0]==arr[1], 4==3? No, so i=0

j=6 != len(arr)-1=6, so return 6-0+1=7, but sample output is 6.

Incorrect.

Another test case:

n=9

arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

According to the function:

i=0, j=8

arr[0]==arr[8]? 9==3? No, break.

i=0, j=8

while arr[0]==arr[1], 9==9, so i=1

arr[1]==arr[2], 9==2? No, so i=1

j=8 != len(arr)-1=8, so return 8-1+1=8, but sample output is 7.

Incorrect.

So, it seems that the function is not correctly implementing the required logic.

In the second test case, n=2, arr=[1,2], the function returns 2, but the correct cost is 1.

Similarly, in n=3, arr=[1,2,3], function returns 3, but correct is 2.

In n=7, arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3], function returns 7, correct is 6.

In n=9, arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], function returns 8, correct is 7.

So, the function seems to be returning j - i +1, which in some cases is one more than the correct answer.

Looking back at the function:

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

j = len(arr) -1

while i <=j:

if arr[i] == arr[j]:

i +=1

j -=1

else:

break

if i > j:

return 0

while arr[i] == arr[i+1]:

i +=1

if j != len(arr)-1:

return j -i +1

return j -i

In the case where j == len(arr)-1, it returns j -i, which is one less than j -i +1.

But in the test cases where it's incorrect, j is len(arr)-1, so it returns j -i, which is one less than j -i +1.

But in the n=2 case, j=1, len(arr)-1=1, so returns 1 -0 =1, which matches the sample output of 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought it returned 2, but actually, in n=2, arr=[1,2], i=0, j=1, arr[0]!=arr[1], so break.

Then, while arr[0]==arr[1], which is not, so i=0.

j=1 == len(arr)-1=1, so return j -i =1 -0=1, which matches the sample output of 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought it returned 2, but actually, according to the code, it returns j -i =1 -0=1.

So, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me check n=3, arr=[1,2,3]:

i=0, j=2

arr[0]!=arr[2], break.

while arr[0]==arr[1], which 1==2? No, so i=0.

j=2 == len(arr)-1=2, so return j -i =2 -0=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, the minimal subarray to set is from position 2 to 3, which is length 2, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the function is correct after all.

Wait, but in n=2, arr=[1,2], it returns 1, which matches the sample output of 1.

In n=3, arr=[1,2,3], returns 2, matches sample output of 2.

In n=7, arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3], returns 6, matches sample output of 6.

In n=9, arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], returns 7, matches sample output of 7.

So, perhaps the function is correct.

I must have misread the function earlier.

So, the function seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But I still don't understand the logic behind the function.

Let me try to understand what the function is doing.

It seems to be finding the minimal subarray to set so that the array becomes symmetric.

But the problem is to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

So, perhaps there's a different logic.

Looking at the function:

- It first tries to find the largest symmetric portion of the array.

- If the entire array is symmetric (i.e., i > j after the loop), return 0.

- Else, it finds the first position where the symmetry breaks and sets i to the first such position.

- Then, it sets j to the end of the array.

- If j != len(arr)-1, which it always is, unless len(arr)-1 != len(arr)-1, which is impossible, so this condition is always false.

- So, it returns j - i.

Wait, in the code, there is:

if j != len(arr)-1:

return j -i +1

else:

return j -i

But in the test cases, j is always len(arr)-1, so it always returns j -i.

Wait, in n=6, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,1], i=1, j=4, returns 4-1=3, but sample output is 4.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, in n=6, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,1], i=1, j=4, but len(arr)-1=5, so j != len(arr)-1, so returns j -i +1=4-1+1=4, which matches the sample output.

Ok, got it.

So, in this case, j=4 != len(arr)-1=5, so returns j -i +1=4-1+1=4.

In n=3, arr=[1,2,3], i=0, j=2, arr[0]!=arr[2], so i=0, j=2, len(arr)-1=2, so returns j -i=2-0=2, which matches the sample output.

In n=2, arr=[1,2], i=0, j=1, arr[0]!=arr[1], so i=0, j=1, len(arr)-1=1, so returns j -i=1-0=1, which matches the sample output.

In n=7, arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3], i=0, j=6, arr[0]!=arr[6], so i=0, j=6, len(arr)-1=6, so returns j -i=6-0=6, which matches the sample output.

In n=9, arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], i=0, j=8, arr[0]!=arr[8], so i=0, j=8, len(arr)-1=8, so returns
