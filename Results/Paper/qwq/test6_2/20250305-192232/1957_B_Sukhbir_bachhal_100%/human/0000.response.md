Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I have to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3. The number of 1s in the binary representation of 3 is two, which seems to be higher than either 1 or 2 alone.

So, the goal is to choose n numbers that add up to k, and when I OR them all together, the resulting number has as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR'd result, I want to set as many bits to 1 as possible in the OR operation. The OR operation sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1.

Given that, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should try to have as many different bits set across the numbers as possible. In other words, I want to spread out the 1s across different bits among the numbers.

But I also have the constraint that the sum of the numbers must be exactly k.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 1, k = 5

Here, there's only one number, so it has to be 5. The OR is just 5, which in binary is 101, having two 1s. That's straightforward.

Second example:

n = 2, k = 3

They provided 1 and 2, which sum to 3, and 1 | 2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, having two 1s. Is there a better option? Let's see:

- If I choose 0 and 3, 0 | 3 = 3, which is the same.

- If I choose 3 and 0, same as above.

- If I choose 1 and 2, same as provided.

- If I choose 2 and 1, same.

- If I choose 3 and 0, same.

So, in this case, it seems that two 1s is the maximum achievable.

Wait, but the problem says to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, and in this case, it's two. Is there a way to get more than two 1s? Let's see.

Well, 3 in binary is 11, which already has two 1s. Is there a way to have more than two 1s in the OR?

Wait, but k=3, which is 11 in binary, so any combination that sums to 3 won't have higher bits set beyond the second bit. So, two is the maximum possible here.

Another example:

n=2, k=5

They provided 5 and 0, which gives 5 | 0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

Is there a better combination?

Let's try:

- 4 and 1: 4 | 1 = 5, same as above.

- 3 and 2: 3 | 2 = 3 | 2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, having two 1s.

- 5 and 0: same as provided.

- 1 and 4: same as above.

So, again, two 1s is the maximum.

Another example:

n=6, k=51

They provided 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12, which sum to 3+1+1+32+2+12=51, and the OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12.

Let's compute that step by step:

- 3 in binary: 00011

- 1: 00001

- 1: 00001

- 32: 100000

- 2: 00010

- 12: 01100

OR'ing them all together:

- Start with 00011

- OR 00001: 00011

- OR 00001: still 00011

- OR 100000: 100111

- OR 00010: 100111

- OR 01100: 111111

Which is 63 in decimal, which has six 1s in binary. But the note says it has five 1s. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 100111 OR 00010 is 100111, then OR 01100 is 11111, which is 31 in decimal, which has five 1s. Yes, I see. So, it's five 1s.

Is there a better combination for n=6 and k=51?

Let me think.

If I try to set as many bits as possible, I need to have numbers that cover different bits.

For example, if I choose numbers with unique bits set, that would maximize the OR's 1s.

But k=51 is 110011 in binary, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1.

So, if I choose numbers that cover these bits and possibly more, but I have to sum to 51.

Wait, but I have n=6 numbers to sum to 51.

If I want to maximize the OR's 1s, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in the OR result.

The maximum possible number of 1s in the OR would be the number of bits in the largest number plus any additional bits needed to reach k.

Wait, but in binary, the number of bits in k is log2(k) plus one.

Wait, for k=51, which is 110011, it's 6 bits.

So, the maximum possible 1s in OR is 6, but in the example, they achieved five.

Is it possible to get six 1s?

Let me try.

If I choose numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 10, which sum to 1+2+4+8+16+10=41, which is less than 51.

Wait, I need to sum to 51.

Alternatively, choose 32, 16, 2, 1, and then two zeros.

But that would be n=5, but I need n=6.

Wait, n=6.

So, 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51, but that's only four numbers. I need six numbers.

So, I can add two zeros.

So, 32, 16, 2, 1, 0, 0.

The OR would be 32 | 16 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 = 32 | 16 | 2 | 1 = 49, which is 110001 in binary, having three 1s.

Wait, that's worse than the provided solution.

Wait, in the provided solution, they have five 1s.

So, maybe adding zeros isn't the best idea.

Alternatively, maybe I can split some numbers to cover more bits.

For example, instead of 32 and 16, maybe use smaller numbers that cover more bits.

But I need to sum to exactly 51.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

What's the maximum number of 1s I can have in the OR?

Well, the OR is the union of all the bits set in any of the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to have as many distinct bits set across all numbers as possible.

Given that, I should try to have numbers that don't share the same bits if possible.

But I also need to sum to k.

So, perhaps I should start by identifying all the bits in k and then distribute them among the n numbers.

Wait, but the numbers can have overlapping bits as long as the sum is k.

But overlapping bits don't hurt because OR will still set those bits to 1.

So, maybe I should aim to have each number set a unique set of bits.

But I need to sum to k, so I need to make sure the sum of all numbers is k.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider the minimal OR.

If all numbers are the same, equal to k/n, then the OR would be k/n, which might not be optimal.

On the other hand, if I spread the bits across different numbers, the OR would have more 1s.

So, to maximize the OR's 1s, I should aim to have as many bits set across the numbers as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should find the minimal number that sums to k with n numbers, and then set the remaining numbers to zero.

But that wouldn't maximize the OR's 1s.

Wait, no.

Actually, setting some numbers to zero reduces the OR, which is not desirable.

Wait, no, zero doesn't affect the OR because 0 | x = x.

So, adding zeros doesn't change the OR.

Therefore, setting some numbers to zero doesn't affect the OR.

So, in the earlier example, adding zeros didn't reduce the OR, but in practice, it did because the OR was 49 with three 1s, which was worse than the provided solution of five 1s.

Wait, perhaps I need a better strategy.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

The program takes t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

If n > 1, it calls a function func_1(k) and sets arr to [2^func_1(k) -1, k - (2^func_1(k)-1)] and then appends n-2 zeros.

If n == 1, it just prints k.

So, what does func_1(k) do?

func_1(k) seems to be calculating the position of the highest set bit in k.

Wait, in the function func_1, it returns the position of the highest set bit.

Let's see:

def func_1(n):

if n == 0:

return -1

position = 0

while n != 0:

n >>= 1

position += 1

return position -1

So, this function returns the position of the highest set bit, 0-indexed from the least significant bit.

For example, for k=5 (101 in binary), the highest set bit is at position 2 (0-indexed).

2^func_1(k) -1 would be 2^2 -1 = 4 -1 = 3.

So, arr = [3, 5-3=2], and then if n > 2, append n-2 zeros.

In this case, n=2, so arr = [3,2], which OR to 3|2=3|10 in binary, which is 11 | 10 = 11, which is 3, having two 1s.

Wait, but in the first test case where n=1, k=5, it just prints 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

In the second test case, n=2, k=3, it would do arr = [2^1 -1=1, 3-1=2], so [1,2], which OR to 3, having two 1s.

In the third test case, n=2, k=5, it would do arr = [2^2 -1=3, 5-3=2], which is [3,2], OR to 3|2=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

But in the note, they have [5,0], which OR to 5|0=5, which is 101, also two 1s.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, it would do arr = [2^5 -1=31, 51-31=20], and then append 4 zeros.

So, arr = [31,20,0,0,0,0], OR is 31|20|0|0|0|0 = 31|20.

31 is 11111, 20 is 10100, OR is 11111 | 10100 = 11111, which is 31, having five 1s.

Wait, but in the provided solution, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which OR to 3|1|1|32|2|12=32|1|1|2|12=32|3|2|12=32|15|12=32|15=32|15=47, which is 101111, which has five 1s.

Wait, but according to my calculation, 31 has five 1s, which matches the provided solution's five 1s.

So, in this case, it seems correct.

Wait, but in my earlier manual calculation, I thought 32|16|2|1|0|0 would be 49, which is 110001, having three 1s, which is worse.

So, the program's approach seems better.

So, what's the logic behind choosing 2^func_1(k)-1 and k - (2^func_1(k)-1)?

Let's see.

func_1(k) returns the position of the highest set bit in k.

2^func_1(k) is the value of that highest set bit.

2^func_1(k) -1 is all the bits below that set to 1.

For example, for k=5 (101), func_1(k)=2, 2^2=4, 4-1=3 (11).

So, arr = [3,2], which OR to 3|2=3, which has two 1s.

Wait, but 3 is 11 and 2 is 10, OR is 11, which is 3, which has two 1s.

Similarly, for k=3, func_1(k)=1, 2^1-1=1, arr=[1,2], OR is 3, two 1s.

For k=51, func_1(k)=5 (since 2^5=32 is the highest set bit), 2^5-1=31, arr=[31,20], OR is 31|20=31|10100=11111|10100=11111, which is 31, having five 1s.

So, in each case, it seems to be achieving the maximum possible 1s in OR.

Is this always the case?

Let me try another example.

Suppose n=3, k=7.

func_1(7)=2 (since 2^2=4 is the highest set bit in 7=111), 2^2-1=3, arr=[3,4], and then append one zero.

So, arr=[3,4,0], OR is 3|4|0=7, which is 111, having three 1s.

Is this the maximum?

Well, 7 is 111, so yes, three 1s is the maximum possible.

Another example: n=4, k=10.

func_1(10)=3 (since 2^3=8 is the highest set bit), 2^3-1=7, arr=[7,3,0,0], OR is 7|3|0|0=7|3=7, which is 111, having three 1s.

Is there a better way?

If I choose [8,2,0,0], OR is 8|2|0|0=10, which is 1010, having two 1s, which is worse.

Or [4,4,2,0], OR is 4|4|2|0=6, which is 110, having two 1s, worse.

Or [5,5,0,0], OR is 5|5|0|0=5, which is 101, having two 1s, worse.

So, [7,3,0,0] seems better with three 1s.

Another example: n=2, k=6.

func_1(6)=2 (since 2^2=4 is the highest set bit), 2^2-1=3, arr=[3,3], OR is 3|3=3, which is 11, having two 1s.

Is there a better way?

[2,4], OR is 2|4=6, which is 110, having two 1s.

[1,5], OR is 1|5=5, which is 101, having two 1s.

[6,0], OR is 6|0=6, which is 110, having two 1s.

So, no, two 1s is the maximum.

So, it seems that this approach is achieving the maximum.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, k=5, it just prints 5, which has two 1s, which is correct.

In the second test case, n=2, k=3, it prints [1,2], which OR to 3, having two 1s, which matches the provided solution.

In the third test case, n=2, k=5, it prints [5,0], which OR to 5, having two 1s, same as [3,2] which also OR to 3, having two 1s.

Wait, but 5 is 101 and 3 is 11, both have two 1s, so it's the same.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, it prints [31,20,0,0,0,0], which OR to 31|20=31|10100=11111|10100=11111, which is 31, having five 1s, same as the provided solution's OR of 11111, which has five 1s.

So, it seems that this approach is correct.

But let's think about why this works.

By choosing 2^func_1(k)-1, which is a number with the first func_1(k) bits set to 1, and then k - (2^func_1(k)-1), we ensure that we have at least one number with higher bits set.

Wait, in the case of k=51, func_1(k)=5, so 2^5 -1=31, and k-31=20.

31 is 11111, and 20 is 10100.

OR'ing them gives 11111 | 10100 = 11111, which has five 1s.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

If I choose 16, 16, 2, 1, 0, 0, sum is 35, which is less than 51.

Wait, I need to sum to exactly 51.

Alternatively, choose 32, 16, 2, 1, which sums to 49 + 2 = 51, but that's only five numbers.

Wait, n=6, so I need to add one more number, which would be 0.

So, arr = [32,16,2,1,0,0], OR is 32|16|2|1|0|0 = 32|16|2|1 = 32|16|3 = 32|19 = 32|19=35, which is 100011, having four 1s, which is worse than the previous approach's five 1s.

So, the program's approach seems better.

Another thought: maybe I should set as many bits as possible in the first number, and then set the remaining sum with the other numbers.

But, in the program's approach, by choosing 2^func_1(k)-1, which is a number with the first func_1(k) bits set to 1, and then the remainder, it seems to maximize the OR's 1s.

Because 2^func_1(k)-1 sets the lowest func_1(k) bits to 1, and the remainder might set some higher bits.

Wait, in the case of k=51, func_1(k)=5, so 2^5 -1=31, which is 11111, and k-31=20, which is 10100.

OR'ing them gives 11111 | 10100 = 11111, which is 31, having five 1s.

Is there a way to get more than five 1s?

Well, 51 in binary is 110011, which has five 1s. So, it's not possible to have more than five 1s in the OR.

Wait, but in the provided solution, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which OR to 3|1|1|32|2|12=32|1|1|2|12=32|3|2|12=32|3=35, which is 100011, having three 1s, but according to the note, it's five 1s.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me compute it step by step.

Start with 3, which is 00011.

OR with 1: 00011 | 00001 = 00011.

OR with 1: still 00011.

OR with 32: 00011 | 100000 = 100011.

OR with 2: 100011 | 000010 = 100011.

OR with 12: 100011 | 001100 = 101111, which is 47 in decimal, having five 1s.

Ah, I see. I missed that step earlier.

So, 47 has five 1s, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the program's approach of [31,20,0,0,0,0] gives OR=31, which is 11111, having five 1s, which is the same as the provided solution.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct.

Let me try another test case.

Suppose n=3, k=9.

func_1(9)=3 (since 2^3=8 is the highest set bit), 2^3-1=7, arr=[7,2,0], since n=3.

OR is 7|2|0=7|2=7, which is 111, having three 1s.

Is there a better way?

[4,4,1], OR is 4|4|1=5, which is 101, having two 1s, worse.

[8,1,0], OR is 8|1|0=9, which is 1001, having two 1s, worse.

[5,3,1], OR is 5|3|1=7, which is 111, having three 1s, same as the program's approach.

[6,2,1], OR is 6|2|1=7, same as above.

So, three 1s is the maximum achievable.

Another test case: n=4, k=15.

func_1(15)=3 (since 2^3=8 is the highest set bit), 2^3-1=7, arr=[7,8,0,0], since k-7=8.

OR is 7|8|0|0=7|8=15, which is 1111, having four 1s.

Is there a better way?

[1,2,4,8], OR is 1|2|4|8=15, which is 1111, four 1s, same as above.

[3,5,7,0], OR is 3|5|7|0=7, which is 111, three 1s, worse.

So, four 1s is the maximum.

Wait, but 15 is 1111, which has four 1s, so that's the maximum.

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=1.

func_1(1)=0, 2^0 -1=0, arr=[0,1], OR is 0|1=1, which has one 1.

Is there a better way? No, because k=1, so sum must be 1.

Hence, it's correct.

Edge case: n=1, k=0.

The program would print 0, which is correct, since 0 in binary has zero 1s.

Another edge case: n=2, k=0.

arr=[0,0], OR is 0, which has zero 1s, which is correct.

Another edge case: n=3, k=1.

arr=[1,0,0], OR is 1|0|0=1, which has one 1, which is correct.

Seems like the program handles edge cases correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
