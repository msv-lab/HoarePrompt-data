Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and the Kraken attacks them k times. The attacks alternate between the first and the last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. When a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the sequence, affecting who the "first" and "last" ships are for the next attacks.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15, I need an efficient algorithm. Iterating through each attack one by one would be too slow because k can be very large.

Let me think about how to optimize this. Since the attacks alternate between the first and last ships, and ships are removed when they sink, I need a way to handle this efficiently without simulating each attack.

One idea is to use two pointers, one starting from the left (first ship) and one from the right (last ship). I can keep track of the remaining durability of the ships at these pointers and calculate how many attacks are needed to sink one or both ships.

Let's consider that in each cycle of attacks (first, last), the Kraken can reduce the durability of both ships by 1 each, but only if both ships are still afloat. If one ship has already sunk, subsequent attacks will only target the remaining ship.

But with k up to 10^15, I need a way to handle large numbers of attacks without iterating through each one. Maybe I can calculate how many full cycles of attacks (first, last) can be performed before one of the ships sinks, and then update the remaining attacks and ship durabilities accordingly.

Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize two pointers, l and r, starting at the first and last ships, respectively. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

While l <= r (there are ships left):

- Determine which ship has the smaller durability, the one at l or the one at r.

- Calculate how many attacks can be performed on both ships before one of them sinks. This would be the minimum of a[l] and a[r], multiplied by 2, since each cycle consists of two attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last.

- If k is greater than or equal to this amount, subtract this amount from k, reduce both a[l] and a[r] by that minimum value, and check if either ship has sunk (a[l] <= 0 or a[r] <= 0). If a ship has sunk, increment the sunk counter and move the pointer accordingly.

- If k is less than this amount, determine how many full cycles can be performed (k // 2), and how many extra attacks are left (k % 2). Update a[l] and a[r] accordingly and check for sinking.

This seems like a step in the right direction, but I need to handle the cases where one ship sinks before the other in a cycle.

Wait, actually, in each cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, and so on. So, in each cycle, it's not necessarily attacking both ships equally. It's alternating between the first and last.

Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps simulate the attacks one by one, but in a way that's efficient for large k.

Let me consider using a queue or deque to manage the ships, but that might not be efficient enough for the time constraints.

Another idea: Since the attacks alternate between the first and last ships, I can consider that in odd-numbered attacks, the first ship is attacked, and in even-numbered attacks, the last ship is attacked, and so on.

But with k up to 10^15, I can't simulate each attack individually. I need a way to handle large chunks of attacks at once.

Let me think about the sequence of attacks. Suppose I have ships with durabilities a1, a2, ..., an.

- Attack 1: a1 -=1

- Attack 2: an -=1

- Attack 3: a1 -=1

- Attack 4: an -=1

- And so on...

I need to continue this process until k attacks are made or until a1 and an are both 0.

But ships in the middle might also be affected if a1 and an are sunk and k is still large.

Wait, no. Once a ship sinks, it's removed, so the sequence of attacks changes.

This complicates things. When a ship sinks, it's removed, so the "first" and "last" ships change.

I need a way to handle this efficiently.

Let me consider that each time a ship sinks, I remove it from the sequence, and the next "first" or "last" ship becomes the new target.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15, I need an optimized approach.

Maybe I can consider that in each "round", I can handle a certain number of attacks on the first and last ships, sinking them if their durability allows, and then proceed to the next pair.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a process where I repeatedly attack the first and last ships in alternating order, removing them when their durability reaches zero.

I need to find an efficient way to calculate how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of attacks needed to sink the first and last ships.

Suppose I have ships a1, a2, ..., an.

- First attack: a1 -=1

- Second attack: an -=1

- Third attack: a1 -=1

- Fourth attack: an -=1

- And so on...

Each pair of attacks (first and last) reduces a1 and an by 1 each.

But if a1 or an reaches zero, it's removed, and the sequence shortens.

I need to handle this efficiently.

Perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach, where l starts at 0 and r starts at n-1, and I keep track of the remaining durability at these points.

I can calculate how many full cycles of attacks (first and last) can be performed before one of the ships sinks.

For example, if a[l] <= a[r], then it will take a[l]*2 attacks to sink the first ship (since it's attacked every other time).

Similarly, if a[r] < a[l], it will take a[r]*2 attacks to sink the last ship.

Wait, no. Actually, since attacks alternate between first and last, the number of attacks to sink a ship is not simply a[l]*2.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a[l] = x and a[r] = y.

Each cycle of 2 attacks reduces x and y by 1 each.

So, the number of full cycles needed to sink the first ship is x, and for the last ship is y.

But in each cycle, both x and y are reduced by 1.

So, the number of cycles needed to sink the first ship is x, and to sink the last ship is y.

If x <= y, then after 2*x attacks, the first ship is sunk, and we're left with a[r] reduced by x.

Similarly, if y <= x, after 2*y attacks, the last ship is sunk, and a[l] is reduced by y.

Wait, no. Let's say a[l] = x and a[r] = y.

Each cycle of 2 attacks reduces both x and y by 1.

So, after min(x, y) cycles, both x and y are reduced by min(x, y).

If x <= y, then after 2*x attacks, x becomes 0, and y becomes y - x.

Similarly, if y <= x, after 2*y attacks, y becomes 0, and x becomes x - y.

This seems promising.

So, in code, I can do something like:

while l <= r:

if l == r:

# Only one ship left

if k >= a[l]:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

else:

# Two or more ships

x = a[l]

y = a[r]

if x <= y:

# Sinking the first ship

if k >= 2*x:

k -= 2*x

a[r] -= x

sunks +=1

l +=1

else:

# Not enough attacks to sink the first ship

break

elif y < x:

# Sinking the last ship

if k >= 2*y:

k -= 2*y

a[l] -= y

sunks +=1

r -=1

else:

# Not enough attacks to sink the last ship

break

This seems similar to the given code.

Wait, the given code has:

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

sunks = 0

while l <= r:

if k == 0:

break

if l == r:

if k >= a[r]:

sunks +=1

break

break

if a[l] <= a[r]:

if k >= a[l] * 2:

k -= a[l] * 2

a[r] -= a[l]

if a[r] == 0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

sunks +=1

l +=1

continue

elif a[l] * 2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

if k ==0:

break

if a[r] < a[l]:

if k >= a[r] *2:

k -= a[r] *2

a[l] -= a[r]

if a[l] ==0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

sunks +=1

r -=1

continue

elif a[r] *2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

return sunks

So, it's implementing the logic I described, but with some additional checks.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's take the first example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1: Attack first ship (1), a=[0,2,4,3], k=4, sunks=1, remove first ship, a=[2,4,3]

Step 2: Attack last ship (3), a=[2,4,2], k=3, sunks=1

Step 3: Attack first ship (2), a=[1,4,2], k=2, sunks=1

Step 4: Attack last ship (2), a=[1,4,1], k=1, sunks=1

Step 5: Attack first ship (1), a=[0,4,1], k=0, sunks=2, remove first ship, a=[4,1]

So, final sunks=2, which matches the example.

Let's see how the code handles this.

Initially, l=0, r=2, a=[2,4,3]

Check l == r? No.

a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

k=5 >= 2*2=4

k -=4, k=1

a[r] -=a[l], a[r]=3-2=1, a=[2,4,1]

if a[r]==0: no

sunks +=1, sunks=1

l +=1, l=1

continue

Now, l=1, r=2, a=[2,4,1]

Check l ==r? No.

a[l]=4 > a[r]=1

So, go to the second part:

if a[r]<a[l]: yes, 1<4

if k >= a[r]*2=2:

k=1 <2, so break

So, total sunks=1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in the first iteration, when l=0, r=2, a=[2,4,3]

After first iteration: k=1, a=[2,4,1], l=1, r=2, sunks=1

Second iteration: l=1, r=2, a=[2,4,1]

a[l]=4 > a[r]=1

Check if k >= a[r]*2=2: k=1 <2, so break

So, total sunks=1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Hmm, seems like there's a mistake.

Wait, in the example, after 5 attacks, a=[1,4,1], and then the first ship is attacked again, reducing it to 0 and sinking it, making sunks=2.

But according to the code, in the second iteration, since k=1 <2, it breaks, resulting in sunks=1.

So, the code seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Let me look again.

In the first part, when a[l] <= a[r]:

if k >= a[l]*2:

k -= a[l]*2

a[r] -= a[l]

if a[r]==0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

sunks +=1

l +=1

continue

elif a[l]*2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

In the second part, when a[r] < a[l]:

if k >= a[r]*2:

k -= a[r]*2

a[l] -= a[r]

if a[l]==0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

sunks +=1

r -=1

continue

elif a[r]*2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

So, in the first iteration, l=0, r=2, a=[2,4,3]

a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

k=5 >= 2*2=4

k -=4, k=1

a[r] -=2, a[r]=1

if a[r]==0: no

sunks +=1, sunks=1

l +=1, l=1

continue

Now, l=1, r=2, a=[2,4,1]

a[l]=4 > a[r]=1

So, go to the second part:

if k >= a[r]*2=2: k=1 <2, so break

So, total sunks=1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps the code is missing something.

Looking back at the example:

After 4 attacks:

- Attack 1: a=[1,2,4,3] -> [0,2,4,3], sunks=1, remove first ship, a=[2,4,3]

- Attack 2: a=[2,4,3] -> [2,4,2], sunks=1

- Attack 3: a=[2,4,2] -> [1,4,2], sunks=1

- Attack 4: a=[1,4,2] -> [1,4,1], sunks=1

- Attack 5: a=[1,4,1] -> [0,4,1], sunks=2, remove first ship, a=[4,1]

So, after 5 attacks, sunks=2.

But according to the code, it only counts sunks=1.

So, the code seems incorrect.

Perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

An alternative approach could be to simulate the attacks in cycles, where each cycle consists of attacking the first and last ship once each.

But I need to handle the cases where one ship is sunk before the other.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of attacks needed to sink both ships, and handle accordingly.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have ships a1, a2, ..., an.

Initialize l=0, r=n-1

Initialize sunks=0

While l <= r:

if l == r:

# Only one ship left

if k >= a[l]:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

else:

# Two or more ships

attacks_needed_first = a[l] * 2

attacks_needed_last = a[r] * 2

if attacks_needed_first <= k:

k -= attacks_needed_first

a[r] -= a[l]

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

elif attacks_needed_last <=k:

k -= attacks_needed_last

a[l] -= a[r]

sunks +=1

r -=1

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

else:

break

This seems similar to the given code but with some differences in handling the cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I handle the attacks.

Let me consider that each cycle of 2 attacks reduces a[l] and a[r] by 1 each.

So, for each cycle, a[l] -=1 and a[r] -=1, and k -=2

But need to handle when a[l] or a[r] reach 0.

Wait, but attacks are alternating between first and last.

So, in reality, it's not exactly reducing both by 1 in each cycle.

Wait, no. Since attacks alternate, in two attacks, each ship is attacked once.

So, yes, in two attacks, each ship is attacked once, so their durability is reduced by 1.

So, in each cycle of two attacks, a[l] -=1 and a[r] -=1, and k -=2

Then, if a[l] <=0, sink it and remove it, l +=1

Similarly, if a[r] <=0, sink it and remove it, r -=1

This seems correct.

Let's apply this to the example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

l=0, r=3

a[l]=1, a[r]=3

attacks_needed_first = 2*1=2

attacks_needed_last = 2*3=6

k=5 >= attacks_needed_first=2

k -=2, k=3

a[r] -=1, a[r]=2, a=[1,2,4,2]

sunks +=1, sunks=1

l +=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[1,2,4,2]

a[l]=2, a[r]=2

attacks_needed_first=4, attacks_needed_last=4

k=3 <4, so break

Total sunks=1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Wait, maybe this approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the case when a[l] == a[r].

In that case, both ships would be reduced equally, and I need to see how many full cycles I can perform before one of them sinks.

But in the example, after the first cycle, a[r] becomes 2, and a[l]=2, so attacks_needed_first=4, attacks_needed_last=4, but k=3<4, so it breaks.

But in reality, after 2 attacks, a[r] becomes 2, and a[l]=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the calculation.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate how many full cycles can be performed before one ship sinks.

Let me try to think in terms of the minimum of a[l] and a[r].

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the number of full cycles that can be performed before the first ship sinks or the last ship sinks, whichever comes first.

Then, in each step, I can subtract the number of attacks corresponding to the number of full cycles performed.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of full cycles that can be performed before the first ship sinks, which is a[l] cycles, and similarly for the last ship, which is a[r] cycles.

Then, the number of full cycles I can perform is min(a[l], a[r])

Each full cycle consists of 2 attacks.

So, total attacks needed for min(a[l], a[r]) cycles is 2 * min(a[l], a[r])

Then, I can subtract this from k, update a[l] and a[r], and check if any ship sinks.

Let's try this.

Initialize l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3], k=5

First step:

min(a[l], a[r]) = min(1,3)=1

attacks needed: 2*1=2

k -=2, k=3

a[l] -=1, a[l]=0

a[r] -=1, a[r]=2

sunks +=1 (since a[l]=0)

remove first ship, l +=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[2,4,2], k=3

min(a[l], a[r])=min(2,2)=2

attacks needed: 2*2=4

k=3 <4, so can't perform these cycles

But in the example, after 4 attacks, a=[1,4,1], sunks=2

So, perhaps I need to handle partial cycles.

Wait, maybe I need to see how many full cycles I can perform with the current k.

Let me try:

while l <= r:

if l == r:

if k >= a[l]:

sunks +=1

k -= a[l]

else:

break

else:

# Two or more ships

cycles = min(a[l], a[r])

if k >= 2*cycles:

k -= 2*cycles

a[l] -= cycles

a[r] -= cycles

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

elif k >= (2*cycles -1):

# Not sure about this condition

else:

break

But in the first step:

l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3], k=5

cycles = min(1,3)=1

k >= 2*1=2: yes

k -=2, k=3

a[l]-=1, a[l]=0

a[r]-=1, a[r]=2

sunks +=1, sunks=1

remove first ship, l +=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[2,4,2], k=3

cycles = min(2,2)=2

k >= 4: 3 <4, so can't perform these cycles

But in reality, with k=3, I can perform one more cycle:

Attack 3: a[l] -=1, a[l]=1

Attack 4: a[r] -=1, a[r]=1

Attack 5: a[l] -=1, a[l]=0, sunks +=1

Total sunks=2

So, the code needs to handle the remaining attacks after full cycles.

Maybe I need to handle full cycles and then handle the remaining attacks.

Let me try to adjust the logic.

while l <= r:

if l == r:

if k >= a[l]:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

else:

# Two or more ships

cycles = min(a[l], a[r])

if k >= 2*cycles:

# Can perform full cycles to reduce both a[l] and a[r] by cycles

k -= 2*cycles

a[l] -= cycles

a[r] -= cycles

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

continue

else:

# Not enough attacks for full cycles

# Calculate how many attacks can be performed

# Each cycle requires 2 attacks

full_cycles = k // 2

a[l] -= full_cycles

a[r] -= full_cycles

k -= 2*full_cycles

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

# If k is odd, perform one more attack on the first ship

if k ==1:

if l <= r:

a[l] -=1

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

break

else:

break

return sunks

Let's see how this works with the example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

l=0, r=3

cycles = min(1,3)=1

k=5 >=2*1=2

k -=2, k=3

a[l]-=1, a[l]=0

a[r]-=1, a[r]=2

sunks +=1, sunks=1

remove first ship, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[2,4,2], k=3

cycles = min(2,2)=2

k=3 < 4, so can't perform full cycles

full_cycles = k //2 =1

a[l]-=1, a[l]=1

a[r]-=1, a[r]=1

k -=2, k=1

if a[l]<=0: no

if a[r]<=0: no

if k==1:

attack first ship, a[l]-=1, a[l]=0

sunks +=1, sunks=2

l +=1, l=2

break

Total sunks=2, which matches the example.

Seems better.

Now, let's check another example.

Input:

4 6

1 2 4 3

Steps:

Initial: a=[1,2,4,3], k=6

First cycle: k=6 >=2*1=2, k=4, a=[0,2,4,2], sunks=1, remove first ship, a=[2,4,2]

Second cycle: a=[2,4,2], cycles=min(2,2)=2, k=4 >=4, k=0, a=[0,4,0], sunks+=2, remove first and last ships, a=[4]

Since k=0, stop.

Total sunks=3, which matches the example.

Another example:

2 2

3 2

Initial: a=[3,2], k=2

cycles=min(3,2)=2

k=2 >=4: no

full_cycles =2//2=1

a[l]-=1, a[l]=2

a[r]-=1, a[r]=1

k -=2, k=0

if a[l]<=0: no

if a[r]<=0: no

if k==1: no

Total sunks=0, which matches the example.

Another example:

2 7

5 2

Initial: a=[5,2], k=7

cycles=min(5,2)=2

k=7 >=4: yes

k=3, a[l]=3, a[r]=0

sunks +=1, remove last ship, a=[3]

Now, l=0, r=0

k=3 >=3: yes

sunks +=1, remove first ship

Total sunks=2, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given code:

def func_1(n, k, a):

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

sunks = 0

while l <= r:

if k == 0:

break

if l == r:

if k >= a[r]:

sunks +=1

break

break

if a[l] <= a[r]:

if k >= a[l] * 2:

k -= a[l] * 2

a[r] -= a[l]

if a[r] == 0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

sunks +=1

l +=1

continue

elif a[l] * 2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

if k ==0:

break

if a[r] < a[l]:

if k >= a[r] *2:

k -= a[r] *2

a[l] -= a[r]

if a[l] ==0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

sunks +=1

r -=1

continue

elif a[r] *2 -1 ==k:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

return sunks

Wait, in the first part, when a[l] <= a[r], it subtracts a[l]*2 from k and a[r] -= a[l], then checks if a[r]==0, increments sunks and r -=1, then increments sunks again and l +=1.

This seems different from what I have.

In my adjusted logic, I subtract cycles=min(a[l],a[r]) from both a[l] and a[r], and then check if they are <=0.

In the given code, it subtracts a[l]*2 from k and a[r] -= a[l], then checks if a[r]==0.

This seems inconsistent.

In the first example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

First iteration:

a[l]=1 <= a[r]=3

k=5 >=2*1=2

k=3, a[r]-=1, a[r]=2

if a[r]==0: no

sunks +=1, sunks=1

l +=1, l=1

continue

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[2,4,3]

a[l]=4 > a[r]=3

So, go to the second part:

if a[r]<a[l]: yes

k=3 >=2*3=6: no

elif a[r]*2-1==k: 3*2-1=5 !=3: no

else: break

So, total sunks=1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

I need to adjust the code to match my correct logic.

Here's the corrected version:

def func_1(n, k, a):

l, r = 0, n-1

sunks = 0

while l <= r:

if l == r:

if k >= a[l]:

sunks +=1

break

else:

break

else:

cycles = min(a[l], a[r])

if k >= 2*cycles:

k -= 2*cycles

a[l] -= cycles

a[r] -= cycles

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

continue

else:

full_cycles = k // 2

a[l] -= full_cycles

a[r] -= full_cycles

k -= 2*full_cycles

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

if a[r] <=0:

sunks +=1

r -=1

if k ==1:

if l <= r:

a[l] -=1

if a[l] <=0:

sunks +=1

l +=1

break

else:

break

return sunks

This should correctly handle the cases.

But the given code doesn't match this logic, so it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ships are sunk after a series of attacks by the Kraken. The Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ships in a line, reducing their durability until they sink.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the first and last ships.
   - Maintain a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.

2. **Simulate Attacks**:
   - While there are ships left (`l <= r`), perform attacks in cycles.
   - Calculate the number of full cycles possible based on the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
   - Reduce the durability of the ships accordingly and sink them if their durability drops to zero.
   - Handle any remaining attacks after full cycles.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If only one ship is left, check if the remaining attacks can sink it.
   - Handle cases where ships are sunk in the process and adjust the pointers.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if l == r:
            # Only one ship left
            if k >= a[l]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        else:
            # Two or more ships
            cycles = min(a[l], a[r])
            if k >= 2 * cycles:
                # Perform full cycles
                k -= 2 * cycles
                a[l] -= cycles
                a[r] -= cycles
                if a[l] <= 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                if a[r] <= 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                continue
            else:
                # Perform partial cycles
                full_cycles = k // 2
                a[l] -= full_cycles
                a[r] -= full_cycles
                k -= 2 * full_cycles
                if a[l] <= 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                if a[r] <= 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                # Handle remaining attack
                if k == 1:
                    if l <= r:
                        a[l] -= 1
                        if a[l] <= 0:
                            sunks += 1
                            l += 1
                break
    return sunks

# Read input and process each test case
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Set pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the ship list.
- **Simulate Attacks**:
  - Calculate the number of full cycles possible with the current minimum durability of the first and last ships.
  - Reduce the durability of the ships by the number of cycles.
  - If a ship's durability drops to zero, increment the sunk counter and move the pointer.
  - Handle any remaining attacks after full cycles are performed.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If only one ship is left, check if the remaining attacks can sink it.
  - Adjust pointers and counters accordingly when ships are sunk.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle large input sizes and attack counts by processing multiple attacks in each iteration, avoiding the need to simulate each attack individually.
