Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column, right? Okay, so I need to place white rooks and the computer places black rooks in response, mirroring my moves by swapping rows and columns.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. I start by placing a white rook at some position (r, c). Then the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r equals c, in which case the computer skips its turn. So, if I place a rook on the diagonal, the computer doesn't place one in response.

After k initial moves have already been made, both mine and the computer's, and it's guaranteed that these moves are valid, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward, until no more moves can be made. And since the number can be large, I have to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand the state of the board after k moves. Each move I make adds a white rook, and except when I place on the diagonal, the computer adds a black rook in response.

So, for each of my moves:

- If I place at (r, c) where r != c, the computer places at (c, r).

- If I place at (r, r), the computer skips.

Given that, after k moves, there are k white rooks and, potentially, k black rooks, but fewer if some of my moves were on the diagonal.

Wait, no. According to the problem, for each of my moves, if r != c, the computer places at (c, r). If r == c, the computer skips its turn.

So, after k moves:

- I have placed k white rooks.

- The computer has placed k black rooks, unless some of my moves were on the diagonal, in which case the computer skipped those turns.

But the problem says: "the computer tries to mirror these moves too". So, for the initial k moves, both me and the computer have made k moves each, considering the mirroring.

Wait, re-reading: "You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to mirror these moves too)"

So, it seems that both have already made k moves each, considering the mirroring rule.

Wait, maybe it's that I've made k moves, and for each of those, the computer has mirrored, except when I place on the diagonal.

Wait, the problem says: "You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to mirror these moves too)", and "It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid."

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's assume that I've made k moves, and for each of those, the computer has mirrored, unless I placed on the diagonal, in which case the computer skipped.

So, the board currently has:

- k white rooks from my moves.

- k - x black rooks from the computer, where x is the number of times I placed on the diagonal.

Because for each non-diagonal move I make, the computer places a black rook in response.

Wait, no. The problem says: "If r = c, then the computer can't mirror your move, and skips its turn."

So, for each of my moves:

- If r != c, the computer places at (c, r).

- If r = c, the computer skips.

So, currently, the board has:

- k white rooks from my moves.

- k - x black rooks from the computer, where x is the number of times I placed on the diagonal.

Because for each non-diagonal move I make, the computer places a black rook at the mirrored position.

Now, I need to continue the game from this state until no more moves can be made, and count the number of possible final configurations.

Okay, to do that, I need to understand the current state of the board in terms of occupied rows and columns.

Each rook, whether white or black, occupies its row and column, meaning no other rook can be placed in the same row or column.

Wait, but in chess, rooks attack along rows and columns, so if a rook is placed at (r, c), no other rook can be placed in row r or column c.

But in this problem, it's specified that two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, regardless of color.

Wait, but the problem says: "two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

But then, in the rules, it says: "a valid move is placing a rook on a position (r, c) such that it doesn't attack any other rook."

So, I need to place rooks such that no two rooks are in the same row or column.

Wait, but in chess, rooks can be placed in the same row or column as long as they are not in the same row or column, but here it's specified that they attack if they share the same row or column.

Wait, no, in standard chess, rooks attack along the same row or column, so they can be placed on different rows and columns without attacking each other.

But according to the problem, two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, regardless of color.

So, to avoid attacks, each row and each column can have at most one rook, regardless of color.

Wait, but in the problem, it's about placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, meaning no two rooks share the same row or column.

So, essentially, it's about placing non-attacking rooks on the chessboard.

Now, in standard chess, non-attacking rooks can be placed where no two rooks share the same row or column, which is similar to placing rooks on positions where each row and each column has at most one rook.

But in this problem, it's more restrictive because rooks of different colors also cannot share rows or columns.

Wait, no, the problem says: "two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, regardless of color."

So, whether they are white or black, if two rooks share the same row or column, they attack each other.

But the computer mirrors my moves by placing at (c, r) when I place at (r, c), unless r = c.

So, the computer's moves are dependent on mine.

Given that, I need to ensure that no two rooks, regardless of color, share the same row or column.

Wait, but in the mirroring, if I place at (r, c), the computer places at (c, r), which is fine as long as r != c, because if r != c, then (r, c) and (c, r) are different positions, and they don't share the same row or column.

Wait, (r, c) and (c, r) share the same row and column only if r = c.

Wait, no, (r, c) is row r, column c, and (c, r) is row c, column r.

So, unless r = c, they don't share the same row or column.

Therefore, when r != c, placing at (r, c) and (c, r) is allowed because they don't attack each other.

But, according to the problem, the computer places at (c, r) in response to my move at (r, c), provided r != c.

If r = c, the computer skips.

So, in the initial k moves, for each of my moves at (r, c):

- If r != c, the computer places at (c, r).

- If r = c, the computer skips.

And it's guaranteed that these moves are valid, meaning that no two rooks, whether white or black, share the same row or column.

Now, from this state, I need to continue the game until no more moves can be made, and count the number of possible final configurations.

So, I need to consider all possible sequences of moves from this point onward, following the same rules, and count how many distinct board states can result.

Now, to approach this, I need to think about the current state of the board in terms of occupied rows and columns.

Each rook, whether white or black, occupies its row and column, meaning no other rook can be placed in that row or column.

So, the available positions for future moves are those that are not in any row or column already occupied by any rook.

Therefore, the available positions form a subgrid where the rows and columns not yet used are considered.

Now, given that, I need to find out how many ways to place rooks on this subgrid, following the same placement rules.

But it's not just about placing any rooks; I have to alternate turns, placing white and black rooks accordingly, and the computer mirrors my moves.

Wait, no, in the continuation of the game, I still place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks in response, mirroring my moves, unless I place on the diagonal.

So, it's similar to the initial k moves.

Therefore, the game continues with me placing a white rook, and the computer placing a black rook in response, unless I place on the diagonal.

So, I need to consider the symmetry in the placement due to the mirroring.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model this.

Let me think about the degrees of freedom in placing the rooks.

Given that the computer mirrors my moves, the placements are linked.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of pairs of positions: for each pair (r, c) and (c, r), with r < c, I can choose to place both or neither.

But I need to be careful with the diagonal positions, where r = c, which are only placed by me and not mirrored.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of available rows and columns that are still free.

Let me consider that after the initial k moves, some rows and columns are already occupied.

So, let's define:

- Let R be the set of rows already occupied by any rook.

- Let C be the set of columns already occupied by any rook.

Then, the available positions are those not in R or C.

Now, in the continuation of the game, when I place a white rook at (r, c), with r not in R and c not in C, and then the computer places a black rook at (c, r), provided c != r.

If c = r, then the computer skips.

So, the game continues until there are no more available positions that don't conflict with R or C.

Now, to count the number of possible final configurations, I need to consider all possible sequences of moves from this point onward, following the rules, and see how many distinct board states can result.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a mathematical pattern or formula that can be applied here.

Let me consider a simpler case first.

Suppose k = 0, meaning no moves have been made yet.

Then, the board is empty, and I need to find out how many possible ways to place rooks alternately, with the computer mirroring my moves, until no more moves can be made.

In this case, the game is symmetric, and the number of final configurations might be related to the number of ways to choose pairs of positions that are mirrors of each other.

Wait, but n is the size of the board, and k can be up to n.

Wait, no, k can be up to n, but n can be up to 3*10^5, which is large, so I need an efficient way to compute the answer.

Looking at the sample input and output:

For n=4, k=1, with move (1,2), the output is 3.

Let me see why it's 3.

After the initial move:

- I place a white rook at (1,2).

- The computer places a black rook at (2,1).

Now, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

So, the remaining available positions are (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).

Now, I need to place white rooks in these positions, with the computer mirroring my moves.

Option 1:

- I place a white rook at (3,4).

- Computer places a black rook at (4,3).

Option 2:

- I place a white rook at (4,3).

- Computer places a black rook at (3,4).

Option 3:

- I place a white rook at (3,3).

- Since r = c, computer skips.

- Then, I place a white rook at (4,4).

- Computer skips.

Alternatively:

- I place a white rook at (4,4).

- Computer skips.

- Then, I place a white rook at (3,3).

But in both cases, the final configuration is the same: white rooks at (3,3) and (4,4).

So, total distinct configurations: 3.

Similarly, for n=8, k=1 with move (7,6), the output is 331.

I need to find a general way to compute this for any n and k.

Looking at the code provided:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

(n, k) = (L[0], L[1])

for j in range(k):

L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

(a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])

if a != b:

n -= 2

else:

n -= 1

print(func_1(n))

continue

def func_1(n):

dp = [1, 1]

for i in range(2, n + 1):

dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]

dp.pop(0)

return dp[-1]

So, the code reads t test cases, and for each test case, reads n and k, then reads k lines of moves, and then adjusts n based on whether the moves were on the diagonal or not, and finally calls func_1(n) to compute the number of final configurations.

In func_1, it seems to be using a dynamic programming approach to compute some value based on n.

Looking at the dp array:

dp = [1, 1]

for i in range(2, n + 1):

dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]

dp.pop(0)

return dp[-1]

So, it's building up a dp array where each entry dp[i] depends on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], with some multiplication and addition.

But I need to verify if this is the correct approach.

First, I need to understand what n represents after adjusting for the initial k moves.

In the code, for each of the k moves:

- If a != b, n -= 2

- If a == b, n -= 1

So, it seems that for each non-diagonal move, it removes 2 from n, and for each diagonal move, it removes 1 from n.

Wait, but n is the size of the board, and k is the number of moves I've already made.

But in the problem, n is the size of the board, and k is the number of moves I've already made.

But in the code, it's adjusting n based on the moves made.

Wait, perhaps n here represents the number of rows (or columns) that are still free, i.e., not yet occupied by any rook.

Wait, but in the problem, when a rook is placed at (r, c), both row r and column c are occupied.

So, for each rook placed, two degrees of freedom are removed: one row and one column.

But if r = c, it's on the diagonal, so only one unique row and column are occupied.

Wait, no, even if r = c, both row r and column c are still two separate constraints.

Wait, but row r and column c are different only if r != c.

Wait, no, if r = c, then row r and column c are the same, so only one degree of freedom is removed.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If I place a rook at (r, c):

- If r != c, then row r and column c are both occupied, removing two degrees of freedom.

- If r = c, then only one degree of freedom is removed, because row r and column r are the same.

Therefore, for each move:

- If r != c, n -= 2

- If r == c, n -= 1

But in the code, it's adjusting n based on whether a != b for each of the k moves.

Wait, but in the code, it's n -= 2 if a != b, and n -=1 if a == b.

Which aligns with the above reasoning.

So, after adjusting n, it calls func_1(n), which seems to compute some value based on n.

Now, func_1 seems to be implementing some dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an n x n board, with certain constraints.

Looking at the dp formula:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]

And taking modulo 10^9 + 7.

This seems familiar; it looks like it's related to the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board, considering some symmetries.

Wait, in standard combinatorics, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an n x n board is given by the number of permutations of n elements taken k at a time, which is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!.

But in this problem, it's more complex due to the mirroring and the alternating turns.

Perhaps func_1 is trying to compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining free part of the board, considering the mirroring.

But I need to verify if this dp formula is correct for the problem.

Looking back at the sample input:

For n=4, k=1, with move (1,2), after adjusting n:

- a=1, b=2, a != b, so n -= 2, n becomes 2.

Then, func_1(2) should return 3, which matches the sample output.

Let's see:

def func_1(n):

dp = [1, 1]

for i in range(2, n + 1):

dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]

dp.pop(0)

return dp[-1]

For n=2:

dp = [1, 1]

i=2:

dp += [dp[1] + 2*(1)*dp[0]) % (10**9 + 7)] = [1 + 2*1*1] = [3]

dp.pop(0), so dp = [1, 3]

return dp[-1] = 3

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input: n=8, k=1, move (7,6)

- a=7, b=6, a != b, n -= 2, n becomes 6.

func_1(6) should return 331.

Let's compute func_1(6):

dp = [1, 1]

i=2: dp += [1 + 2*1*1] = [1, 1, 3]

pop 1, dp = [1, 3]

i=3: dp += [3 + 2*2*1] = [1, 3, 7]

pop 1, dp = [3, 7]

i=4: dp += [7 + 2*3*3] = [3, 7, 16]

pop 3, dp = [7, 16]

i=5: dp += [16 + 2*4*7] = [7, 16, 48]

pop 7, dp = [16, 48]

i=6: dp += [48 + 2*5*16] = [16, 48, 160]

pop 16, dp = [48, 160]

return 160

Wait, but the sample output is 331, not 160.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me recalculate:

dp = [1,1]

i=2: dp += [1 + 2*1*1] = [1,1,3], pop 1, dp=[1,3]

i=3: dp += [3 + 2*2*1] = [1,3,7], pop 1, dp=[3,7]

i=4: dp += [7 + 2*3*3] = [3,7,25], pop 3, dp=[7,25]

i=5: dp += [25 + 2*4*7] = [7,25,65], pop 7, dp=[25,65]

i=6: dp += [65 + 2*5*25] = [25,65,165], pop 25, dp=[65,165]

return 165

Wait, but the sample output is 331, not 165.

I must be making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's check the dp formula again:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]

So, for i=6:

dp[6] = dp[5] + 2*5*dp[4] = 65 + 10*25 = 65 + 250 = 315

Wait, but earlier I had dp[5]=65 and dp[4]=25.

Wait, but in my calculation above, for i=5:

dp[5] = dp[4] + 2*4*dp[3] = 25 + 8*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

Wait, but earlier I had dp[5]=65, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the previous steps.

Let me recalculate step by step:

dp = [1,1]

i=2: dp += [1 + 2*1*1] = [1,1,3], pop 1, dp=[1,3]

i=3: dp += [3 + 2*2*1] = [1,3,7], pop 1, dp=[3,7]

i=4: dp += [7 + 2*3*3] = [3,7,25], pop 3, dp=[7,25]

i=5: dp += [25 + 2*4*7] = [7,25,65], pop 7, dp=[25,65]

i=6: dp += [65 + 2*5*25] = [25,65,165], pop 25, dp=[65,165]

So, dp[6] = 165, but the sample output is 331.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the dp formula.

Alternatively, maybe the dp array is intended to be 0-indexed or differently handled.

Wait, perhaps the dp array is for n starting from 0.

Let me try computing dp for n=0 and n=1.

For n=0:

dp = [1], since there's one way to have no rooks.

For n=1:

dp = [1,1]

For n=2:

dp[2] = dp[1] + 2*1*dp[0] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 3

For n=3:

dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*2*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

For n=4:

dp[4] = dp[3] + 2*3*dp[2] = 7 + 6*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

For n=5:

dp[5] = dp[4] + 2*4*dp[3] = 25 + 8*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

For n=6:

dp[6] = dp[5] + 2*5*dp[4] = 81 + 10*25 = 81 + 250 = 331

Wait, so dp[6] = 331, which matches the second sample output.

Earlier, I mistakenly calculated dp[5]=65, but actually dp[5]=81,
