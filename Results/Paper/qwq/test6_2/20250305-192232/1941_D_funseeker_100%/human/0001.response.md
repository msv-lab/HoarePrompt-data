Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there are n players standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They play a game where they throw a ball to each other. The ball starts with player x, and there are m throws in total. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction, which can be clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown.

My task is to determine which players could have the ball after m throws, based on the given distances and directions for each throw.

First, I need to understand the setup. Players are in a circle, so the concept of clockwise and counterclockwise makes sense. The ball can be thrown in either direction, and sometimes the direction is unknown, which means it could be either.

Let me think about how to model this.

Each throw can be represented as adding or subtracting the distance r_i from the current position, modulo n, since it's a circle.

Wait, but the problem mentions that players are numbered from 1 to n, so I need to be careful with the modulo operation because it's usually from 0 to n-1.

I need to handle the modulo operation correctly to wrap around the circle.

Let's consider an example to make sure I understand.

Take the first example in the input:

6 3 2

Each of the three throws has r_i = 2 and c_i = '?'

So, starting from player 2, each throw can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 2 positions.

After the first throw, from 2, clockwise by 2 would be to player 4, and counterclockwise would be to player 6.

After the second throw, from player 4, clockwise by 2 is player 6, counterclockwise is player 2.

From player 6, clockwise by 2 is player 2, counterclockwise is player 4.

After the third throw, from player 2, it can go to player 4 or player 6 again.

From player 4, it can go to player 6 or player 2.

From player 6, it can go to player 2 or player 4.

So, after three throws, the possible positions are players 2, 4, and 6.

That matches the first output in the example.

Another example:

12 1 2

Throw: 3, direction '1' (counterclockwise)

So, from player 2, counterclockwise by 3 would be to player 12 - 3 = 9, but wait, let's see.

Wait, n=12, starting at 2, throw 3 counterclockwise.

In a circle of 12, counterclockwise by 3 from 2 would be 2 - 3 = -1, but since it's a circle, it should wrap around.

So, -1 mod 12 is 11, but the output says 11.

Wait, but in the problem, players are numbered from 1 to n, so player 0 doesn't exist.

Wait, in the code, there's a part where if 0 is in the set, it's replaced with n.

That makes sense because in modulo n, 0 corresponds to player n.

In this case, from 2, throw 3 counterclockwise: 2 - 3 = -1, which is equivalent to 11 mod 12.

So, the ball would be with player 11.

That matches the second output.

Another example:

10 7 4

A series of throws with directions specified or unknown.

I won't go through all of them, but the idea is to keep track of possible positions after each throw.

The code seems to handle this by maintaining a set of possible current positions and updating it for each throw based on the direction.

Now, looking at the code provided:

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, m, x.

It initializes a set 'ans' with the starting position x.

Then, for each of the m throws, it reads r and c.

For each possible current position in 'ans', it calculates the new positions based on the direction c.

If c is '0' or '?', it adds (q + r) % n to the temporary set.

If c is '1' or '?', it adds (q - r) % n to the temporary set.

After processing all throws, it checks if 0 is in the set, because in modulo n, 0 corresponds to player n.

It discards 0 and adds n instead.

Finally, it prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

This seems correct based on my understanding of the problem.

But I need to make sure that the modulo operation is handled properly.

In Python, negative numbers modulo n can be tricky.

For example, in Python, (-1) % 12 is 11, which is correct for our circle.

So, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n should correctly wrap around the circle.

Also, the code replaces 0 with n because players are numbered from 1 to n.

That makes sense.

Let me check if there are any edge cases that might break this logic.

Edge case 1: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='0'

Clockwise from 1 by 1 would go to 2.

Counterclockwise would also go to 2 (since 1 - 1 = 0, which is player 2).

Wait, no: in n=2, player numbers are 1 and 2.

So, (1 - 1) % 2 = 0 % 2 = 0, which should be player 2.

But according to the code, it would add 0 to the set and then replace it with 2.

Yes, that's correct.

Another edge case: n=4, m=2, x=1, throws: (2,'0'), (2,'1')

First throw: from 1, clockwise by 2 is 3.

Second throw: from 3, counterclockwise by 2 is 1.

So, final position is 1.

Let's see what the code does.

Initial ans = {1}

First throw: r=2, c='0'

temp = {(1 + 2) % 4} = {3}

ans = {3}

Second throw: r=2, c='1'

temp = {(3 - 2) % 4} = {1}

ans = {1}

Yes, correct.

Another edge case: n=5, m=3, x=1, throws: (4,'0'), (4,'?'), (1,'?')

First throw: from 1, clockwise by 4 is 5.

Second throw: from 5, since c='?', it can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 4.

Clockwise: (5 + 4) % 5 = 9 % 5 = 4

Counterclockwise: (5 - 4) % 5 = 1 % 5 = 1

So, possible positions after second throw: {1, 4}

Third throw: from 1, with c='?', r=1: can go to (1 + 1) % 5 = 2 or (1 - 1) % 5 = 0 -> 5

From 4, with c='?', r=1: can go to (4 + 1) % 5 = 5 or (4 - 1) % 5 = 3

So, possible positions: {2, 5, 3, 5, 4}

Wait, no: from 1: 2 or 5

From 4: 5 or 3

So, combined: {2, 5, 3, 5, 4}

But sets automatically remove duplicates, so {2, 3, 4, 5}

But according to the last test case in the example, it's:

5 3 1

4 0

4 ?

1 ?

And the output is:

3

2 3 5

Wait, in my calculation, I got {2,3,4,5}

But according to the example, it's {2,3,5}

So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's see:

Starting at 1.

First throw: 4 clockwise: 1 + 4 = 5

Second throw: from 5, r=4, c='?'

So, can go clockwise: 5 + 4 = 9 % 5 = 4

Or counterclockwise: 5 - 4 = 1 % 5 = 1

Third throw: from 4, r=1, c='?'

So, can go to 4 + 1 = 5 or 4 - 1 = 3

From 1, can go to 1 + 1 = 2 or 1 - 1 = 0 -> 5

So, overall possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5

But in the example, output is 3: 2,3,5

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Looking back, the last test case in the input is:

5 3 1

4 0

4 ?

1 ?

And the output is:

1

3

Wait, no, the last test case in the input is:

4 1 1

2 ?

And the output is:

1

3

Wait, perhaps I looked at the wrong example.

Let me check again.

Wait, the example provided in the problem statement has 5 test cases:

1. 6 3 2

2. 12 1 2

3. 10 7 4

4. 5 3 1

5. 4 1 1

And their outputs are:

1. 3

2 4 6

2. 1

11

3. 4

3 5 7 9

4. 3

2 3 5

5. 1

3

Wait, in my earlier calculation for the fourth test case, I had possible positions {2,3,4,5}, but the output is {2,3,5}, meaning player 4 is not possible.

I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Let's retrace.

Starting at 1.

First throw: 4 clockwise: 1 + 4 = 5

Second throw: from 5, r=4, c='?'

So, can go to (5 + 4) % 5 = 4 or (5 - 4) % 5 = 1

Third throw: from 4, r=1, c='?'

So, can go to (4 + 1) % 5 = 5 or (4 - 1) % 5 = 3

From 1, r=1, c='?'

So, can go to (1 + 1) % 5 = 2 or (1 - 1) % 5 = 0 -> 5

So, overall possible positions: 2, 3, 5

Wait, no player 4 is possible through the path: 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

But according to the output, player 4 is not possible.

Wait, but in my calculation, from 4, with r=1 and c='?', it can go to 3 or 5.

So, player 4 is not a final position; it's only an intermediate step.

Hence, the possible final positions are 2,3,5.

I see where I made a mistake earlier.

So, the code seems to handle this correctly.

Another thing to consider is the efficiency.

Constraints are t <= 10^4, n <= 1000, m <= 1000, and sum(n*m) <= 2*10^5.

The code uses a set to keep track of possible positions, and for each throw, it updates the set based on the direction.

Sets in Python are efficient for lookups and additions.

Given that n <= 1000 and m <= 1000, and t <= 10^4, but with the sum n*m <= 2*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

No recursion is used, so no risk of stack overflow.

Also, the code uses (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, which is correct for circular movements.

It also handles the case where (q - r) % n might be negative, but in Python, negative modulo is handled correctly.

Finally, it checks if 0 is in the set and replaces it with n, which is correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
