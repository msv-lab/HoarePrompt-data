Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i has to be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

I need to find values for a_1 to a_n that satisfy this condition for each x_i. The problem says that if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can return any one of them.

Let's look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

The output is a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify this:

- a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2 = 2

- a_3 % a_2 = 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3 = 4

- a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4 = 1

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, how can I generalize this to find such an array a for any given x?

I need to find a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Let me try to find a pattern or a way to construct such an array.

One approach could be to choose a_1 arbitrarily and then determine the rest based on that. But since a_1 affects a_2 through the modulo operation, it might be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can build the array a incrementally, starting from a_1 and choosing each subsequent a_i based on the previous one and the corresponding x_i.

Let's think about a_1. Since a_2 % a_1 = x_2, a_2 should be equal to k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k >= 0. But a_2 needs to be greater than x_2 because x_2 is the remainder, and remainders are less than the divisor. So, a_2 >= x_2 + 1.

Wait, no. Actually, in the example, a_2 = 5 and a_1 = 3, and 5 % 3 = 2. Here, a_2 is less than a_1 * 2, but in general, a_2 could be larger.

I need to ensure that a_2 % a_1 = x_2, which means a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k >= 0, and a_2 >= x_2.

But to make things simpler, maybe I can choose a_1 to be greater than x_2, so that a_2 is at least a_1 + x_2.

Wait, let's think differently. If I set a_1 to be greater than x_2, then a_2 can be a_1 + x_2, and (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2, which is correct.

Let me check this with the example:

a_1 = 3, x_2 = 2, so a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5, and 5 % 3 = 2, which matches.

Similarly, a_2 = 5, x_3 = 4, so a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9, but in the example, a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong. In the example, a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2 = 5, but 4 % 5 = 4, which is correct because 4 divided by 5 is 0 with remainder 4.

So, in this case, a_3 is less than a_2, but still satisfies a_3 % a_2 = x_3.

So, my previous assumption that a_i should be a_{i-1} + x_i is not always correct, as seen in the example where a_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5.

Wait, in the example, a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2 = 5, but still satisfies the condition because 4 % 5 = 4.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me try to generalize.

Given x_i, I need to find a_{i-1} and a_i such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

This can be satisfied in multiple ways:

1. a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0, provided that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, actually, the modulo operation ensures that x_i < a_{i-1}, because the remainder is always less than the divisor.

So, x_i < a_{i-1} must hold for the modulo to be x_i.

Therefore, for each i from 2 to n, a_{i-1} > x_i must hold.

So, a_{i-1} must be greater than x_i.

Given that, I can try to choose a_1 to be greater than x_2, and then choose a_2 such that a_2 % a_1 = x_2, and so on.

But in the example, a_1 = 3 and x_2 = 2, which satisfies a_1 > x_2.

Then a_2 = 5, and a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

Next, a_2 = 5 and x_3 = 4, so a_3 % 5 = 4.

In the example, a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2, and 4 % 5 = 4, which is correct.

Then, a_3 = 4 and x_4 = 1, so a_4 % 4 = 1.

In the example, a_4 = 9, and 9 % 4 = 1, which is correct.

So, in this case, a_3 is less than a_2, but still satisfies the condition.

So, my initial assumption that a_i should be equal to a_{i-1} + x_i is not always necessary.

In fact, in the example, a_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5, which is different from a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

So, perhaps I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that for each step, I can choose a_i to be a_{i-1} + x_i, but that may not always work, as seen in the example.

Wait, in the first step, a_2 = a_1 + x_2, which works because (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2.

In the second step, a_3 should be such that a_3 % a_2 = x_3.

If I set a_3 = a_2 + x_3, then a_3 % a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) % a_2 = x_3, which works only if x_3 < a_2.

But in the example, x_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5, so x_3 < a_2, and a_3 = 4, which is less than a_2, and still satisfies a_3 % a_2 = 4.

So, both a_3 = 4 and a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9 would satisfy a_3 % 5 = 4.

But in the example, they chose a_3 = 4.

So, perhaps choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is not the only option.

I need to find a_i such that a_i >= x_i and a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, no, actually, a_i can be less than a_{i-1}, as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But x_i is given, and a_i % a_{i-1} must equal x_i, so a_i must be equal to k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

So, a_i could be x_i, a_{i-1} + x_i, 2 * a_{i-1} + x_i, and so on.

But, if a_i < a_{i-1}, it's still possible as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, no, if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, provided that a_i < a_{i-1}.

So, in that case, a_i = x_i.

But x_i is given, and a_i must be >= x_i.

Wait, actually, in the example, a_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5, and x_3 = 4.

So, a_3 = x_3 because a_3 < a_2.

Alternatively, a_3 could have been 9, which is 5 + 4, and 9 % 5 = 4, which also satisfies the condition.

So, multiple possibilities exist.

So, to generalize, for each i from 2 to n, a_i can be set to a_{i-1} + x_i, which ensures that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But in some cases, setting a_i = x_i also works if x_i < a_{i-1}.

But to make things simpler, maybe I should always set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let me check this approach with the example.

Starting with a_1 = 3, x_2 = 2, so a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the example.

Then a_2 = 5, x_3 = 4, so a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9, but in the example, a_3 = 4.

So, it's different, but both are valid.

Since the problem allows any valid a array, both are acceptable.

So, choosing a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is a valid approach.

Let me see if this works for other test cases.

Take the second test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output: a = [2, 5, 11]

Let's verify:

- a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 2 = 1, which matches x_2 = 1

- a_3 % a_2 = 11 % 5 = 1, which matches x_3 = 1

Now, if I apply my approach:

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 2 + 1 = 3

Then a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 3 + 1 = 4

But the output is a = [2, 5, 11], which is different.

Let's check if a = [2, 3, 4] would work:

- 3 % 2 = 1, correct

- 4 % 3 = 1, correct

So, [2, 3, 4] is also a valid solution, but the example chose [2, 5, 11].

So, multiple solutions exist, and any one is acceptable.

So, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work.

Let me try this approach for the third test case.

n = 6

x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]

Output: a = [5, 14, 16, 5, 11, 24]

Let's check:

- 14 % 5 = 4, correct

- 16 % 14 = 2, correct

- 5 % 16 = 5, correct

- 11 % 5 = 1, correct

- 24 % 11 = 2, correct

Now, applying my approach:

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 5 + 4 = 9

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 9 + 2 = 11

a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 11 + 5 = 16

a_5 = a_4 + x_5 = 16 + 1 = 17

a_6 = a_5 + x_6 = 17 + 2 = 19

So, a = [5, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19]

Let's verify:

- 9 % 5 = 4, correct

- 11 % 9 = 2, correct

- 16 % 11 = 5, correct

- 17 % 16 = 1, correct

- 19 % 17 = 2, correct

So, this works as well.

Comparing to the example output a = [5, 14, 16, 5, 11, 24], both are valid, but my approach gives a different valid array.

So, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to be a valid and straightforward approach.

Let me see if there are any edge cases where this might not work.

Consider n = 2

x = [500]

So, a_2 % a_1 = 500

I need a_1 > 500, because x_i < a_{i-1}.

So, set a_1 = 501

Then a_2 = 501 + 500 = 1001

Check: 1001 % 501 = 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, which is not possible.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, 1001 % 501 should be 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, but modulo operations result is non-negative, so actually, 1001 % 501 = 1001 - 2*501 = -1 + 501 = 500.

Wait, no, in programming, modulo of positive numbers is straightforward.

In Python, 1001 % 501 is indeed 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, but Python adjusts it to be positive by adding the divisor.

Wait, no, in Python, 1001 % 501 is actually 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, but Python's modulo operation for positive numbers is always non-negative, so 1001 % 501 is actually 1001 - 1*501 = 499, because 1001 = 1*501 + 499.

Wait, let me calculate:

501 * 1 = 501

501 * 2 = 1002, which is greater than 1001, so quotient is 1, remainder is 1001 - 501 = 499.

So, 1001 % 501 = 499, not 500.

So, in this case, setting a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 501 + 500 = 1001, but 1001 % 501 = 499, which is not equal to x_2 = 500.

So, my approach fails here.

So, what's the correct way to set a_2 in this case?

I need a_2 % a_1 = 500, with a_1 > 500.

So, a_2 should be equal to k*a_1 + 500 for some integer k >= 0.

To make a_2 as small as possible, set k=0, so a_2 = 500.

But a_2 % a_1 = 500 % 501 = 500, which matches x_2 = 500.

So, in this case, setting a_2 = x_2 works because x_2 < a_1.

So, in general, if x_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i can be set to x_i.

But in my earlier approach, I was setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, which may not be the minimal or always correct.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Set a_1 to be x_2 + 1 (to ensure a_1 > x_2)

- For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i

Wait, but in the edge case above, x_i = 500 and a_1 = 501, so x_i < a_1, and setting a_2 = x_i = 500, which is less than a_1 = 501, and 500 % 501 = 500, which matches x_2 = 500.

In the earlier test cases, this also works.

For example, in the first test case:

a_1 = 3, x_2 = 2 < 3, so a_2 = 2, but in the example, a_2 = 5.

Wait, in the example, a_2 = 5, which is greater than a_1 = 3, and 5 % 3 = 2, which is correct.

But according to this approach, I could set a_2 = x_2 = 2, which is less than a_1 = 3, and 2 % 3 = 2, which is also correct.

So, both are valid.

So, to generalize:

For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i (or any multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i)

But in the edge case where x_i >= a_{i-1}, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i ensures a_i > x_i, and a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, but x_i >= a_{i-1} cannot happen because x_i is the remainder of a_i divided by a_{i-1}, and remainders must be less than the divisor.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that 1 <= x_i <= 500, and a_{i-1} can be at least 1.

But to ensure x_i < a_{i-1}, I need to set a_{i-1} > x_i.

Wait, no, in the problem, x_i is given, and I need to find a_{i-1} and a_i such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, to ensure that x_i < a_{i-1}, I need to set a_{i-1} > x_i.

So, in the first step, set a_1 > x_2.

Then, for each subsequent step, set a_{i-1} > x_i.

Wait, but in the earlier edge case, x_i = 500, and I set a_1 = 501 > 500, and then a_2 = x_2 = 500 < a_1 = 501, which works.

So, in general, as long as a_{i-1} > x_i, setting a_i = x_i works.

But what if x_i >= a_{i-1}?

Wait, but x_i < a_{i-1} must hold, because x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.

So, in the algorithm, I need to ensure that a_{i-1} > x_i.

In the first step, set a_1 > x_2.

Then, for each i from 2 to n-1, ensure that a_i > x_{i+1}.

Wait, but in the edge case, a_1 = 501 > x_2 = 500, and a_2 = 500 < a_1 = 501, and then for a_3, if there was an x_3, I would need a_2 > x_3.

But in this particular case, n=2, so no further steps.

So, in general, to ensure that a_{i-1} > x_i, I need to set a_{i-1} > x_i for all i from 2 to n.

In the first step, set a_1 > x_2.

Then, set a_2 = x_2, which is less than a_1, and then set a_3 = x_3 if x_3 < a_2, otherwise set a_3 = a_2 + x_3, and so on.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, a_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5, which satisfies a_2 > x_3 = 4.

So, in that case, setting a_3 = x_3 = 4 works.

Alternatively, setting a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9 also works.

So, both options are valid.

So, to make it simple, I can set a_i = x_i if x_i < a_{i-1}, else set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This ensures that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

And, by setting a_1 = x_2 + 1, I ensure that a_1 > x_2.

So, this seems like a valid approach.

Let me try this approach with the third test case:

n = 6

x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

Then:

- i=2: x_2=4 < a_1=5, set a_2 = x_2 = 4

- i=3: x_3=2 < a_2=4, set a_3 = x_3 = 2

- i=4: x_4=5 > a_3=2, set a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 2 + 5 = 7

- i=5: x_5=1 < a_4=7, set a_5 = x_5 = 1

- i=6: x_6=2 < a_5=1, set a_6 = a_5 + x_6 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, a = [5, 4, 2, 7, 1, 3]

Let's verify:

- 4 % 5 = 4, correct

- 2 % 4 = 2, correct

- 7 % 2 = 1, but x_4 = 5, which is not matching.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, 7 % 2 = 1, but x_4 = 5, which is not equal to 1.

So, there's a mistake in this approach.

Wait, in step i=4: x_4=5 > a_3=2, so set a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 7.

But 7 % 2 = 1, which should be equal to x_4=5.

But 1 != 5, so this is incorrect.

Wait, what's wrong here?

Ah, I see. The condition is a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

In this case, a_4 % a_3 = 7 % 2 = 1, but x_4 = 5.

This is not matching.

So, my approach is flawed.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a_i is greater than a_{i-1} when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in this case, x_4 = 5 > a_3 = 2, so I set a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 7.

But 7 % 2 = 1, which is not equal to 5.

So, that's incorrect.

Wait, but 7 % 2 should be 1, not 5.

So, clearly, my approach is wrong here.

I need to find a way to set a_i such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, even when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, but remainders are always less than the divisor, so x_i should always be less than a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be set accordingly.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's given that 1 <= x_i <= 500, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

But in the earlier edge case, x_i = 500, and I set a_{i-1} = 501, which is greater than x_i, and then a_i = x_i = 500, which works because 500 % 501 = 500.

So, in general, as long as a_{i-1} > x_i, setting a_i = x_i works.

But in the third test case, when x_i >= a_{i-1}, my approach fails.

Wait, in the third test case, x_4 = 5 and a_3 = 2, which is less than x_4.

Wait, but according to the condition, x_i < a_{i-1}, because x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.

So, x_i must be less than a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the input, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be set to be greater than x_i.

Wait, in the third test case, x_4 = 5, and a_3 = 2.

But 5 >= 2, which violates the condition that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that x_i < a_{i-1}, right?

Wait, no, it's not explicitly stated.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says "c mod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the integer d, where c >= 0 and d > 0, and the remainder is such that 0 <= c mod d < d."

So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}, which implies that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the input, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be set to be greater than x_i.

But in my
