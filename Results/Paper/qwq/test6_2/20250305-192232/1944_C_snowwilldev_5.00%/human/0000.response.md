Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array of integers, and I need to determine the final score of the game based on their optimal plays. The score is defined as the MEX of the array that Alice constructs. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

First, I need to understand the rules of the game:

1. The game is played on an array `a` of size `n`.

2. Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

3. Players take turns, with Alice going first.

4. On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

5. On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a`, and deletes it from `a`.

6. The game ends when `a` is empty.

7. The score is the MEX of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find the final score assuming both play optimally.

Okay, so MEX is about finding the smallest missing non-negative integer in the array. For example:

- MEX of [2,2,1] is 0.

- MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2.

- MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4.

So, in the game, Alice wants the MEX to be as large as possible, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, which means he wants to prevent Alice from having certain numbers in `c`.

Given that Alice can choose to add elements to `c`, and Bob can just remove elements from `a`, I need to see how their interactions affect the final composition of `c`.

Let me think about the game mechanics:

- Alice's action: pick an element from `a`, add it to `c`, and delete it from `a`.

- Bob's action: pick an element from `a`, delete it from `a`.

- The game continues until `a` is empty.

- The final score is MEX of `c`.

I need to model their optimal strategies.

First, since Alice wants to maximize MEX, she would ideally want to have all the small numbers in `c`. However, Bob is trying to minimize the MEX, so he would want to prevent Alice from having certain numbers.

Let me consider the possible scenarios:

1. If a number is present multiple times in `a`, Alice can ensure that at least one of them makes it into `c`, because she can pick them before Bob can eliminate them.

2. If a number is present only once in `a`, Alice has to pick it promptly to include it in `c`, otherwise Bob might pick it and remove it from `a` without adding it to `c`.

3. Bob can remove elements that Alice hasn't picked yet, potentially denying Alice the opportunity to pick certain numbers.

I need to find a way to determine, for each possible MEX value, whether Alice can force that value or higher, and Bob can force a lower value.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of occurrences of each number in `a`.

Let's define:

- For each number `i`, count how many times it appears in `a`. Let's call this count `cnt[i]`.

- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements until `a` is empty.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, which means she wants to have as many small numbers in `c` as possible.

- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, which means he wants to prevent Alice from having small numbers in `c`.

I need to find the smallest number `k` such that, no matter how Alice plays, Bob can ensure that `k` is not in `c`.

Wait, no. Actually, since Alice is trying to maximize the MEX, she wants to have as many small numbers in `c` as possible, and Bob is trying to minimize it, so he wants to prevent Alice from having those small numbers in `c`.

So, perhaps I should think in terms of which numbers Alice can guarantee to have in `c`, despite Bob's attempts to prevent them.

Let me consider that:

- For a number `i`, if `cnt[i]` is the count of `i` in `a`, then:

- If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can pair Alice's picks of `i` with his own picks to remove them, preventing Alice from having more than `cnt[i] // 2` instances of `i` in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can ensure at least one instance of `i` in `c`, because she can pick it first and then match Bob's picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Let's consider that Alice and Bob are alternately picking elements from `a`, with Alice picking first. Alice can choose to add elements to `c`, while Bob just removes elements.

But actually, in terms of who controls which elements end up in `c`:

- Alice adds elements to `c` when she picks them.

- Bob cannot add elements to `c`; he only removes them from `a`.

So, Bob can influence which elements Alice has the opportunity to add to `c` by removing elements that Alice might want to add.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total number of picks.

Total number of picks is `n`, since `a` has `n` elements.

Alice makes the first pick, then Bob, then Alice, and so on.

Total number of picks by Alice is ceil(n/2).

Total number of picks by Bob is floor(n/2).

Wait, no. If `n` is even, Alice and Bob each make `n/2` picks.

If `n` is odd, Alice makes `(n+1)/2` picks, and Bob makes `(n-1)/2` picks.

But Alice can choose which elements to add to `c`, and Bob can choose which elements to remove.

Wait, more precisely:

- On Alice's turn: she picks an element from `a`, adds it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn: he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`.

So, in total, Alice adds ceil(n/2) elements to `c`, and the rest are just removed.

But I need to consider that Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want to add later.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the availability of elements.

Let me consider that the game is a sequence of turns where Alice and Bob alternately pick elements from `a`, with Alice adding her picked element to `c` and both deleting their picked elements from `a`.

I need to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

To maximize the MEX, Alice wants to have as many small numbers in `c` as possible.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having small numbers in `c`.

I need to find, for each number `k`, whether Alice can ensure that `k` is in `c`, or Bob can ensure that `k` is not in `c`.

The MEX will be the smallest `k` that is not in `c`.

So, to find the final MEX, I need to find the smallest `k` such that Bob can prevent Alice from having `k` in `c`.

Let me try to think about it in terms of the counts of each `k`.

Let's say for a number `k`, if it appears `cnt[k]` times in `a`.

Alice wants to have at least one `k` in `c`.

Bob wants to prevent that.

If `cnt[k]` is 0, obviously `k` is not in `a`, so MEX could be `k`.

If `cnt[k]` is 1, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to `c`, unless Bob picks it first.

But Alice goes first, so she can pick it before Bob if she wants.

Wait, but Bob can pick it on his turn, removing it from `a` before Alice can pick it.

Wait, but Alice picks first.

So, if `cnt[k]` is 1, and Alice picks it, it goes to `c`.

If `cnt[k]` is 1, and Bob picks it, it is removed from `a`, and not added to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can ensure `k` is in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Since Alice picks first, she can pick it on her first turn, adding it to `c`.

If she doesn't pick it on her first turn, Bob can pick it on his turn, removing it from `a`, and then Alice cannot add it to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can choose to add `k` to `c`, but only if she picks it on her first turn.

Wait, no. She can pick it on any of her turns, but Bob can pick it on his turns.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can ensure `k` is in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Since Alice picks first, she can pick it on any of her turns before Bob picks it.

But Bob can pick it on his turn if it's still in `a`.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can ensure `k` is in `c` by picking it on one of her turns before Bob picks it.

Similarly, for `cnt[k]` >= 2, Alice can ensure at least one `k` in `c`, because even if Bob picks one, there's still one left for Alice to pick.

Wait, no. If `cnt[k]` = 2, and Bob picks one, then Alice can pick the remaining one and add it to `c`.

But Bob can pick one, and then Alice picks the other and adds it to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` >= 1, Alice can ensure `k` is in `c`, unless Bob picks all instances of `k` before Alice can pick any.

But for `cnt[k]` = 1, Bob can pick it only if Alice hasn't picked it yet.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can pick it on her first turn, adding it to `c`.

If she doesn't pick it on her first turn, Bob can pick it on his turn, removing it from `a`.

Then, Alice cannot add it to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice can choose whether to include `k` in `c` or not.

Similarly, for `cnt[k]` >= 2, Alice can ensure at least one `k` in `c`, because even if Bob picks one, Alice can pick the remaining one and add it to `c`.

Wait, but if `cnt[k]` >= 2, and Bob picks one, then Alice can pick the other and add it to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` >= 1, Alice can always ensure `k` is in `c`, by picking it on one of her turns before Bob picks all instances of it.

Wait, but for `cnt[k]` = 1, if Alice doesn't pick it on her first turn, Bob can pick it on his turn, removing it from `a`, and then Alice cannot add it to `c`.

So, for `cnt[k]` = 1, Alice has the option to pick it or not.

If she picks it, it goes to `c`; if she doesn't, Bob can remove it.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice will pick the smallest possible `k` with `cnt[k]` >=1 to include in `c`.

But Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having small `k` in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include any `k` with `cnt[k]` >=1 in `c`, unless Bob can prevent it.

But Bob can prevent Alice from having a specific `k` in `c` by picking it before Alice does, but only if `cnt[k]` =1.

If `cnt[k]` >=2, Bob cannot prevent Alice from having at least one in `c`.

So, for each `k`, starting from 0 upwards:

- If `cnt[k]` >=1, Alice can include `k` in `c`, unless Bob can prevent it.

- But Bob can only prevent it if `cnt[k]` =1 and Alice doesn't pick it on one of her turns before Bob picks it.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of turns.

Total turns are `n`, with Alice making ceil(n/2) picks and Bob making floor(n/2) picks.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in games where one player wants to maximize and the other to minimize, often the result is determined by some kind of parity or counting argument.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Let me count how many numbers have `cnt[k]` >=1.

Wait, but I need to consider that for numbers with `cnt[k]` =1, Bob can choose to remove them, preventing Alice from adding them to `c`.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of numbers that Alice can guarantee to include in `c`.

Let me try to think of it as:

- For each `k`, if `cnt[k]` >=1, Alice can include `k` in `c`, unless Bob can prevent it by removing the only instance when `cnt[k]` =1.

So, for `cnt[k]` >=2, Alice can always include `k` in `c`.

For `cnt[k]` =1, Alice can include `k` in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Given that Alice picks first, she can choose to pick any `k` with `cnt[k]` =1 on her first turn, adding it to `c`.

But if she doesn't pick it on her first turn, Bob can pick it on his turn, removing it from `a`.

So, for `cnt[k]` =1, Alice has the choice to include `k` in `c` by picking it on one of her turns.

Given that, to maximize the MEX, Alice will include as many small `k` as possible in `c`.

Bob, to minimize the MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including small `k` in `c`.

So, for each `k`, starting from 0 upwards:

- If `cnt[k]` >=1, Alice can include `k` in `c`, unless Bob prevents it.

- For `cnt[k]` >=2, Alice can always include `k` in `c`.

- For `cnt[k]` =1, Alice can choose to include `k` in `c` by picking it on one of her turns.

But Bob can choose to pick it on his turn if Alice doesn't pick it first.

So, in terms of optimal play, Alice will prioritize picking the smallest `k` with `cnt[k]` =1 to include in `c`, to maximize the MEX.

Bob will try to pick those smallest `k` with `cnt[k]` =1 to prevent Alice from including them in `c`.

Wait, but Alice picks first, so she can pick the smallest `k` with `cnt[k]` =1 on her first turn, adding it to `c`.

Then, Bob can pick another element, possibly another `k` with `cnt[k]` =1.

This continues until all elements are picked.

So, it seems that for each `k` with `cnt[k]` =1, Alice can include it in `c` if she picks it on one of her turns before Bob picks it.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) picks and Bob has floor(n/2) picks, Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements to include in `c`.

But I need to think about which elements she can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of elements with `cnt[k]` =1.

Let me define:

- Let `singles` be the count of elements with `cnt[k]` =1.

- Let `multiples` be the count of elements with `cnt[k]` >=2.

Then, the total number of elements is `n = singles + multiples`.

Alice can include all `multiples` in `c`, since for each such `k`, there are at least two instances. So, even if Bob picks one, Alice can pick the other and include it in `c`.

For the `singles`, Alice can include up to ceil(singles / 2) of them in `c`, because she has ceil(n/2) picks in total, and Bob has floor(n/2) picks.

Wait, but actually, for each single, Alice can choose to pick it or not.

But if she doesn't pick it, Bob can pick it and remove it from `a`.

So, for each `k` with `cnt[k]` =1, Alice can choose to include it in `c` by picking it on one of her turns before Bob picks it.

Given that Alice has ceil(singles / 2) picks dedicated to picking singles (since multiples are already accounted for), she can include up to ceil(singles / 2) singles in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that:

- For each `k` with `cnt[k]` >=2, Alice can always include at least one in `c`.

- For each `k` with `cnt[k]` =1, Alice can include it in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Given that, the number of singles is `s`, and the number of multiples is `m`, with `n = s + m`.

Alice has ceil(n / 2) picks to include elements in `c`.

Bob has floor(n / 2) picks to remove elements from `a`.

For the multiples, Alice can include all `m` in `c`, since she can pick one from each pair.

For the singles, she can include ceil(s / 2) in `c`, because she can pick ceil(s / 2) singles before Bob picks floor(s / 2) of them.

So, total elements in `c` would be `m + ceil(s / 2)`.

But I need to map this to the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider which specific elements Alice can include.

Let me try to think in terms of the frequency counts.

Let me sort the numbers and see how many of each are present.

I need to find the smallest `k` such that, in the optimal play, `k` is not included in `c`.

Given that Alice can include all `k` with `cnt[k] >=2`, and ceil(cnt[k=1]/2) of those with `cnt[k]=1`.

Wait, no. For `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include it in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) picks, and Bob has floor(n/2) picks, and Alice picks first.

So, for each `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include it in `c` if she picks it on one of her picks before Bob picks it.

Given that, Alice can choose to include up to ceil(s / 2) singles in `c`, where s is the number of singles.

But I need to map this to the actual values of `k`.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through the possible MEX values.

For each `k` from 0 to n:

- Check if Alice can ensure that `k` is in `c`.

- If she can, then MEX is greater than `k`.

- If she cannot, then MEX is `k`.

So, for each `k`, determine if Alice can include `k` in `c`.

If she can include all `k` from 0 to some `k-1`, but cannot include `k`, then MEX is `k`.

Given that, I need a way to determine, for each `k`, whether Alice can include `k` in `c`.

Given that:

- If `cnt[k] >=2`, Alice can always include `k` in `c`.

- If `cnt[k] ==1`, Alice can include `k` in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

So, to find the MEX, I need to find the smallest `k` such that:

- If `cnt[k] >=1`, Alice can include it in `c`.

- But if `cnt[k] ==1`, and Bob picks it before Alice, then it's not in `c`.

Wait, but Alice picks first, so for `cnt[k]=1`, she can pick it on her first pick, adding it to `c`.

If she doesn't pick it on her first pick, Bob can pick it on his pick, removing it from `a`.

So, for `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can choose to include `k` in `c` by picking it on one of her picks before Bob picks it.

Given that, Alice can include all `k` with `cnt[k]>=2`, and some of the `k` with `cnt[k]=1`.

Specifically, she can include ceil(s / 2) of the `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, where s is the number of such `k`.

But I need to map this to the actual values of `k` to determine the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I should iterate through the possible MEX values.

Start with `k=0`:

- If `cnt[0] >=1`, Alice can include 0 in `c`.

- If `cnt[0] ==0`, then MEX is 0.

If `cnt[0] >=1`, then MEX is at least 1.

Now, check `k=1`:

- If `cnt[1] >=1`, Alice can include 1 in `c`.

- If `cnt[1] ==0`, MEX is 1.

Continue this way until we find the smallest `k` where Alice cannot include `k` in `c`.

But for `cnt[k]>=1`, Alice can include `k` in `c`, unless `cnt[k]=1` and Bob picks it before Alice.

Wait, so for `cnt[k]>=2`, Alice can always include `k` in `c`.

For `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can choose to include it in `c` by picking it before Bob does.

So, in terms of the MEX, the smallest `k` where `cnt[k]=0` or (`cnt[k]=1` and Bob picks it), that would be the MEX.

But since Alice picks first, for `cnt[k]=1`, she can pick it on her first pick, adding it to `c`.

If she doesn't pick it on her first pick, Bob can pick it, removing it from `a`.

So, for `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can choose whether to include `k` in `c` or not.

To maximize the MEX, Alice will include the smallest possible `k` with `cnt[k]=1` in `c`.

Bob, to minimize the MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest `k` with `cnt[k]=1` in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of singles and how many Alice can include.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me sort the numbers and see how many of each are present.

I need to find the smallest `k` such that, after the game, `k` is not in `c`.

Given that Alice can include all `k` with `cnt[k]>=2`, and some of the `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, depending on the number of picks.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of singles Alice can include.

Let me calculate the number of singles (`s`) and the number of multiples (`m`).

Total picks by Alice: ceil(n / 2)

Total picks by Bob: floor(n / 2)

Alice can include all `m` multiples in `c`, since for each multiple, she can pick one for `c` even if Bob picks one.

Then, with her remaining picks, she can include ceil(s / 2) singles in `c`.

So, total elements in `c` would be `m + ceil(s / 2)`.

But I need to map this to the actual values of `k`.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the possible MEX values.

Start with `k=0`:

- If `cnt[0] >=1`, Alice can include 0 in `c`.

- If `cnt[0] ==0`, MEX is 0.

If `cnt[0] >=1`, proceed to `k=1`.

- If `cnt[1] >=1`, Alice can include 1 in `c`.

- If `cnt[1] ==0`, MEX is 1.

Continue this way until we find the smallest `k` where Alice cannot include `k` in `c`.

But for `cnt[k]>=1`, Alice can include `k` in `c`, unless `cnt[k]=1` and Bob picks it before Alice.

Wait, but since Alice picks first, for `cnt[k]=1`, she can pick it on her first pick, adding it to `c`.

If she doesn't pick it on her first pick, Bob can pick it, removing it from `a`.

So, for each `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can choose to include it in `c` by picking it on her first pick.

Therefore, for each `k` with `cnt[k]>=1`, Alice can include it in `c`, unless she chooses not to.

But to maximize the MEX, she would include as many small `k` as possible.

So, the MEX would be the smallest `k` where `cnt[k]=0`.

Wait, but that can't be right, because in the example given:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

In the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], N=4.

Counts: 0:2, 1:2.

So, Alice can include 0 and 1 in `c`.

MEX would be 2.

Which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], N=4.

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

Alice can include 0 and 1 in `c`, since she has ceil(4/2)=2 picks.

Bob has floor(4/2)=2 picks.

So, Alice can include two singles in `c`.

So, she can include 0 and 1, or 0 and 2, or whatever.

But to maximize MEX, she would include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the second test case, N=4, a=[0,1,2,3], counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

Alice has 2 picks.

Bob has 2 picks.

Alice can include 0 and 1 in `c`, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which suggests that Bob can prevent Alice from having 0 or 1 in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include it in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

In the second test case, all counts are 1.

Alice picks first. She can pick, say, 0 and add it to `c`.

Bob picks next, say, 1.

Alice picks next, say, 2.

Bob picks next, say, 3.

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Wait, but 1 is not in `c`.

So, MEX is 1.

But according to the sample, the output is 1.

So, in this case, Alice couldn't include 1 in `c`.

Wait, but if Alice picks 1 instead of 0 first, then c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But MEX=0 is worse for Alice, who wants to maximize MEX.

So, perhaps in this case, the optimal MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include only ceil(s / 2) singles in `c`.

In this case, s=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2.

So, she can include 2 singles in `c`.

But there are four possible singles: 0,1,2,3.

So, she can include any two of them.

To maximize MEX, she would include 0 and 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the sample, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the sample explanation for the first test case, they have a game where c=[1,0], MEX=2.

But they mention that it's an example and doesn't represent optimal strategy.

So, perhaps in that test case, the optimal MEX is indeed 2.

But in the second test case, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the MEX depends on the specific choices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include up to ceil(s / 2) of them in `c`.

In the second test case, s=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2.

So, Alice can include 2 singles in `c`.

So, she can include 0 and 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which suggests that Bob can force a lower MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the game progress.

Let me simulate the second test case:

N=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

Alice picks first. She can pick any one:

- If she picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks next, say 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks next, say 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

- c=[0,2], MEX=1

- If she picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

- c=[1,2], MEX=0

- If she picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

- Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

- c=[2,1], MEX=0

- If she picks 3, c=[3], a=[0,1,2]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,2]

- Alice picks 1, c=[3,1], a=[2]

- Bob picks 2, a=[]

- c=[3,1], MEX=0

So, the best MEX Alice can achieve is 2, by picking 0 and then 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Bob can choose to pick in a way that minimizes the MEX.

Let me try another sequence:

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 2, a=[1,3]

Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,1], MEX=2

Alternatively:

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 3, a=[1,2]

Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[2]

Bob picks 2, a=[]

c=[0,1], MEX=2

Another sequence:

Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[2,1], MEX=0

So, depending on Alice's choices, she can achieve MEX=2 or MEX=0.

But the sample output is 1, which is not achievable in any of these sequences.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the game.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to pick elements to minimize the MEX.

So, Bob would choose to pick elements that help in minimizing the MEX.

In the first sequence:

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1

In this sequence, MEX is 1.

In another sequence:

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 3, a=[1,2]

Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[2]

Bob picks 2, a=[]

c=[0,1], MEX=2

Here, MEX is 2.

So, Bob can choose to pick 1 first to force MEX=1.

Therefore, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, with Bob playing optimally, is 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, in this case, even though Alice can achieve MEX=2, Bob can force MEX=1 by picking 1.

Similarly, in the third test case:

N=2, a=[1,1]

Counts: 1:2

Alice picks first, picks 1, c=[1], a=[1]

Bob picks 1, a=[]

c=[1], MEX=0

So, the output is 0.

Hence, the output is 2,1,0.

Now, back to my earlier thought.

I need to find, for each `k` from 0 to n, whether Alice can include `k` in `c`.

If she can, then MEX is greater than `k`; otherwise, it's `k`.

For `cnt[k]>=2`, Alice can always include `k` in `c`.

For `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include it in `c` if she picks it before Bob does.

Given that Alice picks first, she can pick it on her first pick.

But Bob can also pick singles, removing them from `a`.

So, the number of singles that Alice can include in `c` is ceil(s / 2), where s is the number of singles.

But in the second test case, s=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2.

So, Alice can include 2 singles in `c`.

But in reality, Bob can choose to pick certain singles to minimize the MEX.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to remove the smallest possible `k` with `cnt[k]=1` to minimize the MEX.

So, in the second test case, to minimize the MEX, Bob would pick 0 or 1 to prevent Alice from including them.

Wait, in the second test case, if Bob picks 1 on his first pick, then:

Alice picks first, say 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1

Alternatively, if Bob picks 0 on his first pick:

Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[2,1], MEX=0

So, Bob can choose to pick 1 to force MEX=1, or pick 0 to force MEX=0.

But in the sample output, it's 1, so perhaps the minimal MEX is 1.

Wait, but in one sequence, Bob can force MEX=0.

But the sample output is 1, so perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice is trying to maximize the MEX, and Bob is trying to minimize it, and find the final MEX when both play optimally.

So, in this scenario, Bob can choose to pick 1, forcing MEX=1, or pick 0, forcing MEX=0.

But since Bob wants to minimize the MEX, he would choose the option that results in the smaller MEX, which is 0.

But the sample output is 1, which is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample output.

Wait, checking the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Sample Output:

2

1

0

In the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], N=4.

Counts: 0:2,1:2.

Alice can include both 0 and 1 in `c`, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Which matches the sample output of 2.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], N=4.

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

Alice can include two singles in `c`.

If she includes 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

If she includes 0 and 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

If she includes 1 and 2, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

Bob can force MEX=1 by picking appropriately.

Hence, the output is 1.

In the third test case, a=[1,1], N=2.

Counts:1:2.

Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[1]

Bob picks 1, a=[]

c=[1], MEX=0.

Hence, the output is 0.

So, in the second test case, the output is 1, which suggests that Bob can force the MEX to be 1.

Hence, my earlier thought that Alice can include ceil(s / 2) singles in `c` might not be accurate.

Perhaps I need to consider that the game is more strategic, and the order of picks matters.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many small `k` in `c` as possible, while Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each `k` from 0 to n:

- If `cnt[k] >=2`, Alice can always include it in `c`.

- If `cnt[k] ==1`, Alice can include it in `c` only if she picks it before Bob does.

Given that, to find the minimal MEX, I need to find the smallest `k` such that Alice cannot include `k` in `c`.

Which means:

- If `cnt[k] ==0`, obviously MEX is `k`.

- If `cnt[k] >=1`, Alice can include it in `c` unless Bob can prevent it.

For `cnt[k] >=2`, Alice can always include it.

For `cnt[k] ==1`, Alice can include it by picking it before Bob does.

Given that Alice picks first, she can pick it on her first pick.

But Bob can also pick it on his pick if Alice doesn't pick it first.

So, for each `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can choose to include it in `c` by picking it on her first pick.

But Bob can choose to pick it on his pick if Alice doesn't pick it first.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice will include the smallest possible `k` with `cnt[k]=1` in `c`.

Bob, to minimize the MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest `k` with `cnt[k]=1` in `c`.

Given that, perhaps the minimal MEX is the smallest `k` where:

- `cnt[k] ==0`, or

- `cnt[k] ==1` and Bob can pick it before Alice does.

But since Alice picks first, she can pick the smallest `k` with `cnt[k]=1` on her first pick, including it in `c`.

Then, Bob would pick the next smallest `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, removing it from `a`.

Then, Alice would pick the next smallest `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, including it in `c`.

And so on.

Hence, Alice can include every other `k` starting from the smallest.

So, for `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, Alice can include ceil(s / 2) of them in `c`, starting from the smallest.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest `k` where `cnt[k]=0`, or `cnt[k]=1` and it's one of the ones that Bob picks.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the `k` with `cnt[k]>=1` and assign them to `c` based on Alice's picks.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me sort all `k` with `cnt[k]>=1` in ascending order: k1, k2, k3, ..., km.

Let s be the number of `k` with `cnt[k]=1`.

Let m be the number of `k` with `cnt[k]>=2`.

Alice can include all m `k` with `cnt[k]>=2` in `c`.

Additionally, she can include ceil(s / 2) of the `k` with `cnt[k]=1`, starting from the smallest.

Hence, the MEX would be:

- If m + ceil(s / 2) >= all k from 0 to some k-1, then MEX is k.

Wait, more precisely:

- Let's list all `k` with `cnt[k]>=1`, sorted ascendingly.

- Alice can include all `k` with `cnt[k]>=2` and the first ceil(s / 2) of `k` with `cnt[k]=1`.

- The MEX is the smallest `k` not in this list.

For example, in the second test case:

a=[0,1,2,3], counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

m=0 (no k with cnt[k]>=2), s=4.

Alice can include ceil(4 / 2)=2 of the k with cnt[k]=1, starting from the smallest: 0 and 1.

Hence, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that Bob can interfere with Alice's choices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can pick elements to prevent Alice from including certain k.

In the second test case, Alice can include two k with cnt[k]=1, but Bob can pick one of them to remove it from a, forcing a higher MEX.

Wait, no, in the earlier simulation, Bob can pick in a way that forces MEX=1.

Hence, perhaps the minimal MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to pick the smallest k with cnt[k]=1 to minimize the MEX.

So, in the second test case:

Alice picks first, can pick 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks next, can pick 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks next, picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1

Alternatively, Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 2, a=[1,3]

Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,1], MEX=2

Or, Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[1,2], MEX=0

So, depending on Bob's choices, MEX can
