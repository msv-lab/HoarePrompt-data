Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these n numbers.

First, I need to understand what bitwise OR does. Bitwise OR takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 OR 2 is 3 because in binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, and OR'ing them gives 11, which is 3.

So, the goal is to have the bitwise OR of all these n numbers have as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of n numbers that sum to k.

One way to think about this is to maximize the number of bits that are set to 1 in the OR of all these numbers.

Since OR is a bit-wise operation, I can consider each bit independently. For each bit position, if at least one of the numbers has that bit set to 1, then the OR will have that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many different bit positions to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

Given that the sum of the numbers is k, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many bit positions as possible are set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

One strategy is to use numbers that have single bits set, i.e., powers of two. For example, 1 (0001), 2 (0010), 4 (0100), etc. Each of these sets only one bit.

If I can use up to n such numbers, and their sum is k, then the OR would have as many 1s as the number of distinct powers of two used.

However, k might not be exactly representable as a sum of distinct powers of two beyond what n allows. But in reality, any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of two because that's how binary representation works.

Wait, but in binary representation, each power of two is used at most once. So, for example, 5 is 4 + 1, which are two distinct powers of two.

If I have n numbers, I can have up to n distinct powers of two, but if k requires more than n distinct powers, I might need to reuse some powers or combine them in some way.

Wait, but since I can use 0 as one of the numbers, that might help in filling up the sequence without affecting the sum or the OR.

Let me think about an example.

Take the second example from the problem:

n=2, k=3

Possible sequences:

- 1 and 2: sum is 3, and 1|2 = 3, which has two 1s in binary (11).

- Another option could be 3 and 0: sum is 3, and 3|0 = 3, which also has two 1s.

- Or 1 and 1: sum is 2, which doesn't meet the sum requirement.

So, in this case, both sequences 1 and 2, or 3 and 0, achieve the maximum number of 1s in the OR, which is two.

Another example:

n=2, k=5

Possible sequences:

- 5 and 0: 5|0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

- 1 and 4: 1|4 = 5, which is 101, same as above.

- 3 and 2: 3|2 = 3|2 = 3, which is 11 in binary, having two 1s.

- 5 and 0: same as above.

So, in this case, all these sequences achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

But according to the sample output, they chose 5 and 0.

So, it seems that there are multiple possible sequences that achieve the maximum number of 1s in the OR.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such a sequence for any given n and k.

Let me think about the strategy.

First, I need to identify the bit positions that are set in k.

Let's consider the binary representation of k.

For example, k=5 is 101 in binary.

So, bits 0 and 2 are set.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have at least one number that has each of these bits set.

In this case, I can have one number as 5 (101) and the rest as 0. That would satisfy the sum if n is large enough.

But I also need the sum to be exactly k.

So, if n=1, then I just have one number, which is k.

If n=2, I can have k and 0, or two numbers that sum to k and their OR has as many 1s as possible.

In the second example, n=2, k=3, they chose 1 and 2, which sum to 3 and OR to 3, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, I could choose 3 and 0, which also sum to 3 and OR to 3.

So, both are valid.

In the third example, n=2, k=5, they chose 5 and 0, which sum to 5 and OR to 5, which has two 1s.

Another option is 1 and 4, which sum to 5 and OR to 5.

So, again, multiple possibilities.

In the fourth example, n=6, k=51, and the output is 3,1,1,32,2,12.

Let's see:

Sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12 = 51.

OR: 3|1|1|32|2|12.

Let's compute that step by step.

3 in binary: 00011

1: 00001

1: 00001

32: 100000

2: 00010

12: 01100

OR'ing all of these:

Starting with 0.

0 | 3 = 3 (00011)

| 1 = 3 | 1 = 3 (00011)

| 1 = still 3 (00011)

| 32 = 100000 | 00011 = 100111

| 2 = 100111 | 000010 = 100111

| 12 = 100111 | 001100 = 101111

So, the OR is 101111, which has five 1s in binary.

Is this the maximum possible?

Well, let's see.

k=51 in binary is 110011, which has four 1s.

But the OR of the sequence is 101111, which has five 1s.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, 51 is 110011, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1.

But the OR of the sequence is 101111, which is 32 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12.

Wait, but 32 is 100000, 1 is 000001, 1 is 000001, 2 is 000010, 12 is 001100.

So, OR'ing them:

32: 100000

| 1: 100001

| 1: still 100001

| 2: 100011

| 12: 101011

Wait, but in the explanation, it says it's 101111.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 32 is 100000

3 is 000011

1 is 000001

1 is 000001

32 is 100000

2 is 000010

12 is 001100

So, OR'ing all of them:

100000 | 000011 | 000001 | 000001 | 100000 | 000010 | 001100

Which is 101111, which is 47 in decimal, which has five 1s.

But k=51 is 110011, which also has four 1s.

Wait, but the OR can have more 1s than k itself.

Wait, no, actually, the OR can have more 1s than k, because the OR is combining the bits from all the numbers, not just summing them.

In other words, if any of the numbers has a particular bit set, then that bit is set in the OR.

So, even if k doesn't have that bit set, if one of the numbers in the sequence has it set, then the OR will have it set.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many bits as possible in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

So, ideally, I want to set as many bits as possible in the sequence.

Given that the sum is k, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many bits as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

One way to do this is to assign the smallest possible numbers to as many elements as possible, and assign the remaining sum to the last element.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of bits set in the OR.

So, I need to have as many distinct bits set across the sequence as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should identify all the bits set in k and assign each of them to separate numbers in the sequence, if possible.

Wait, but k might require some bits to be set multiple times.

Wait, no, in binary, each bit is either set or not set.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the binary representation of k.

Let's list all the bits that are set in k.

Then, for each of these bits, I can assign a separate number in the sequence that has only that bit set.

If n is greater than the number of set bits in k, then I can assign the remaining numbers as 0.

But wait, the sum must be exactly k.

So, if I assign numbers that correspond to each set bit in k, their sum would be k.

But if n is larger than the number of set bits in k, I need to assign the remaining numbers as 0.

That way, the OR would still be the same as the OR of the set bits.

Wait, but in the fourth example, n=6 and k=51.

51 in binary is 110011, which has four bits set.

But in the output, they have six numbers: 3,1,1,32,2,12.

The OR of these is 101111, which has five bits set, even more than the number of set bits in k.

Wait, how is that possible?

Because some numbers can have multiple bits set.

For example, 3 is 000011, which sets bits 0 and 1.

1 is 000001 (bit 0), 1 is 000001 (bit 0), 32 is 100000 (bit 5), 2 is 000010 (bit 1), 12 is 001100 (bits 2 and 3).

So, OR'ing them together: bit 0 from 3 or 1 or 1; bit 1 from 3 or 2; bit 2 from 12; bit 3 from 12; bit 5 from 32.

So, bits 0,1,2,3,5 are set, which is five bits.

But k=51 is 110011, which is bits 0,1,4,5.

Wait, but in the OR, they have bit 2 and bit 3 set, which are not set in k.

How is that possible?

Wait, but k is the sum of the sequence, but the OR can have bits set that are not in k.

Wait, no, k is the sum, but the OR is the bitwise OR.

So, the OR can have bits set that are set in any of the numbers, even if they don't contribute to the sum in that particular way.

Wait, but in this case, they have bit 2 and bit 3 set in the OR, which are not set in k.

Wait, but k=51 is 110011 in binary, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

Wait, 16 is bit 4, not bit 2 and bit 3.

Wait, let's check:

51 in binary:

2^0 = 1

2^1 = 2

2^2 = 4

2^3 = 8

2^4 = 16

2^5 = 32

So, 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

So, bits 0,1,4,5 are set in k=51.

But in the OR of the sequence, bits 0,1,2,3,5 are set.

Wait, but bit 4 is not set in the OR, even though it's set in k.

Wait, but according to the explanation, the OR is 101111, which is 47 in decimal, which is bits 0,1,2,3,5.

But k=51 is 110011, which is bits 0,1,4,5.

So, how does this make sense?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

In the fourth example, they have bits 0,1,2,3,5 set in the OR, which is five 1s.

But k=51 has only four 1s in its binary representation.

But the OR can have more 1s than k, because the OR combines the bits from all the numbers in the sequence.

So, even if k doesn't have a particular bit set, if one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set, it will be set in the OR.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to set as many bits as possible in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many bits as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

One way to do this is to assign k to one of the numbers and set the rest to 0.

That would give the OR equal to k, which has a certain number of 1s.

But perhaps I can set more bits by distributing k across multiple numbers, each having some unique bits set.

For example, if k has bits a,b,c set, and I have n=4, I can set one number to have bit a, another to have bit b, another to have bit c, and the fourth to have some other bit d, as long as the sum is k.

But, the sum has to be exactly k.

So, I need to make sure that the sum of the numbers is k.

Wait, but if I set numbers to have distinct bits, their sum would be equal to the bitwise OR, because there's no overlapping.

But in this problem, the sum can be k, which might require some overlapping.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of which bits can be set in multiple numbers without affecting the OR.

Since OR is insensitive to multiple numbers having the same bit set.

So, if multiple numbers have the same bit set, the OR will still have that bit set only once.

Therefore, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should set as many unique bits as possible in the sequence.

Given that, I should try to assign numbers such that each number has some unique bit set, and the sum of all these numbers is k.

If n is larger than the number of set bits in k, I can still set some numbers to 0, which doesn't affect the OR.

Wait, but k might require some bits to be set multiple times in the sequence to achieve the sum.

Wait, no, since the sum is k, and each number is non-negative, I need to make sure that the sum is exactly k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I identify all the bits that are set in k.

Then, for each of these bits, I can assign a number that has only that bit set.

If n is greater than the number of set bits in k, I can assign the remaining numbers as 0.

This way, the OR will be equal to k, which has a certain number of 1s.

But perhaps I can set more bits in the OR by assigning numbers that have bits set which are not in k, as long as the sum is still k.

Wait, but if I set a bit that's not in k, I need to make sure that the sum still adds up to k.

For example, if I have a number with a bit that's not in k, I need to adjust other numbers accordingly.

Wait, but in the fourth example, they have bits 0,1,2,3,5 set in the OR, even though k=51 has bits 0,1,4,5 set.

So, they have an additional bit 2 and 3 set, which are not in k.

How is that possible?

Wait, because the OR combines all the bits from all the numbers, regardless of whether they are set in k or not.

So, if one number has bit 2 set, and another has bit 3 set, and their sum still adds up to k, then the OR will have those bits set.

But in that case, I need to make sure that the sum is still k.

So, perhaps I can set some numbers to have bits that are not in k, as long as their contributions to the sum allow the total to be k.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, so I should try to set as many unique bits as possible across the sequence, while ensuring that the sum is k.

So, perhaps I should identify all the bits that are set in k, and also consider other bits that can be set in some numbers, as long as the sum is k.

Wait, but setting extra bits in some numbers can help increase the number of 1s in the OR, as long as their contributions to the sum are managed.

So, perhaps I should start by identifying all the possible bits that can be set in the sequence, and then assign numbers such that their sum is k and as many bits as possible are set in at least one of them.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me think about an algorithm.

One possible approach is:

1. Identify all the bits that are set in k.

2. Try to assign numbers such that each number has some unique bit set, preferably bits that are not set in k, but still the sum adds up to k.

Wait, but setting bits that are not in k would require that those bits' contributions are balanced by adjusting other numbers.

This seems tricky.

Another approach is:

- Start by assigning the smallest possible numbers to as many elements as possible, and assign the remaining sum to the last element.

- This way, more elements can have unique bits set.

Wait, but the smallest possible numbers are 0, but 0 doesn't set any bits.

So, perhaps assign 1 to as many elements as possible, and assign the remaining sum to the last element.

But 1 sets only bit 0.

So, if I assign 1 to multiple elements, their OR will still have only bit 0 set.

Not helpful for maximizing the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps assign numbers with distinct single bits set, up to the number of set bits in k, and then assign the remaining sum to the last element.

But this might not maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign numbers with distinct single bits set, even if those bits are not set in k, as long as their sum contributes to k.

But I need to ensure that the sum is exactly k.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample:

n=1, k=5

Output: 5

Explanation: only one number, which is 5.

Second sample:

n=2, k=3

Output: 1 2

OR: 1|2 = 3, which has two 1s.

Alternative output: 3 0, which also gives OR=3 with two 1s.

Third sample:

n=2, k=5

Output: 5 0

OR: 5|0 = 5, which is 101 in binary, having two 1s.

Alternative output: 1 4, which also sums to 5 and OR=5.

Fourth sample:

n=6, k=51

Output: 3,1,1,32,2,12

Sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12=51

OR: 3|1|1|32|2|12=47 (101111 in binary), which has five 1s.

But k=51 is 110011 in binary, which has four 1s.

So, the OR has more 1s than k.

This suggests that it's acceptable for the OR to have bits set that are not set in k, as long as the sum is k.

So, perhaps the strategy is to set as many bits as possible in the OR, even if they are not set in k, as long as the sum is k.

Wait, but in the fourth example, they have bits that are not set in k in the OR.

Is there a constraint that the bits set in the OR must be a subset of the bits set in k?

Looking back at the problem statement, it says to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

There is no constraint that these 1s must correspond to the bits set in k.

So, it's acceptable for the OR to have bits set that are not set in k, as long as the sum is k.

So, in that case, perhaps the strategy is to set as many bits as possible in the OR, even if they are not set in k, as long as the sum of the sequence is k.

Given that, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many bits as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

One way to do this is to assign numbers with distinct single bits set, up to the number of set bits in k, and then assign the remaining sum to one of the numbers.

But in the fourth example, they have set bits that are not in k.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some numbers can have multiple bits set, allowing for more bits to be set in the OR while still summing to k.

For example, if I have a number that has two bits set, I can set two bits in the OR with that number.

But I need to make sure that the sum is k.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of 1s in the OR.

The maximum possible number of 1s in the OR is 32, since integers are up to 1e9, which is less than 2^30.

But in practice, it might be lower depending on k and n.

So, perhaps I need to greedily set as many bits as possible in the OR.

One possible approach is:

- Identify all the bits from 0 to 30 (since k can be up to 1e9).

- Try to assign numbers such that each number has some unique bit set, starting from the least significant bit.

- Assign the smallest possible numbers to as many elements as possible, and assign the remaining sum to the last element.

Wait, but assigning smallest possible numbers might not maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign numbers with distinct single bits set, up to the number of set bits in k, and then assign the remaining sum to the last element.

But in the fourth example, they have assigned numbers with multiple bits set to achieve more 1s in the OR.

So, maybe I need to prioritize assigning numbers with higher bit values to have more unique bits set.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign numbers that have the highest possible bits set, and then adjust the sum accordingly.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

l1 = input().split()

(n, k) = list(map(int, l1))

arr = []

k0 = k

i = 0

while k:

if k & 1 == 1:

arr.append(i)

k = k >> 1

i += 1

ans = []

c = 0

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, let's understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Initialize an empty list arr.

- Copy k to k0.

- Initialize i to 0.

- While k is not zero:

- If the least significant bit of k is 1, append i to arr.

- Right shift k by 1.

- Increment i.

- Initialize ans as an empty list.

- Initialize c to 0.

- For each i in arr:

- If c == n - 1, append (k0 - sum(ans)) to ans and break.

- Else, append (1 << i) to ans.

- Set c += 1.

- If len(ans) < n, append 0s to make the length n.

- Print the sequence.

So, what's happening here?

It seems to be identifying the bits set in k and assigning numbers that have only those bits set, up to n-1 numbers, and then assigning the remaining sum to the last number.

Wait, but in the fourth example, n=6 and k=51.

51 in binary is 110011, which has bits 0,1,4,5 set.

So, arr would be [0,1,4,5].

Then, for c from 0 to 3 (since len(arr)=4 and n=6), it appends 1<<0, 1<<1, 1<<4, 1<<5, which are 1,2,16,32.

Then, since len(ans)=4 and n=6, it appends two 0s.

So, the sequence would be 1,2,16,32,0,0.

But in the sample output, it's 3,1,1,32,2,12.

So, different sequence, but both achieve the same OR.

Wait, but in the sample output, they have a different sequence that also sums to 51 and has the same OR.

So, multiple sequences are possible.

In this case, the program is choosing 1,2,16,32,0,0, which sums to 1+2+16+32=51, and OR is 1|2|16|32|0|0=1|2|16|32=31, which is 11111 in binary, having five 1s.

Wait, but k=51 is 110011, which is also has four 1s.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is bits 0,1,4,5 set.

But 1|2|16|32|0|0 is 1|2|16|32 = 1 + 2 + 16 + 32 = 51, which is 110011 in binary, having four 1s.

But in the sample output, they have bits 0,1,2,3,5 set, which is five 1s.

So, their OR has five 1s, while this program's OR has four 1s.

Wait, but according to the problem, both are acceptable as long as the OR has the maximum number of 1s.

But in this case, the sample output has five 1s, while the program's output has four 1s.

Is five better than four?

Wait, but k=51 is 110011, which is four 1s.

But in the OR, they have five 1s by setting additional bits in some numbers.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the sum and OR for the sample output.

In the fourth sample:

n=6, k=51

Output: 3,1,1,32,2,12

Sum: 3+1+1+32+2+12=51

OR: 3|1|1|32|2|12 = 101111, which is 47, having five 1s.

But k=51 is 110011, which is 51 in decimal.

So, the OR is 47, which is different from k.

But according to the problem, the OR can have more 1s than k, as long as the sum is k.

Wait, but in this case, the OR is 47, which is less than k=51.

Wait, but in binary, 47 is 101111, and 51 is 110011.

So, OR is 101111, which has bits 0,1,2,3,5 set.

k=51 has bits 0,1,4,5 set.

So, in the OR, they have bits 2 and 3 set, which are not set in k.

But the OR is less than k because bit 4 is set in k but not in the OR.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, no, 47 in binary is 101111, which is:

bit 0: 1

bit 1: 1

bit 2: 1

bit 3: 1

bit 5: 1

So, bits 0,1,2,3,5 set.

k=51 is 110011, which is:

bit 0: 1

bit 1: 1

bit 4: 1

bit 5: 1

So, bits 0,1,4,5 set.

So, in the OR, they have bits 2 and 3 set, which are not set in k.

But the OR is 47, which is less than k=51.

But according to the problem, this is acceptable, as long as the OR has the maximum number of 1s.

In this case, OR=47 has five 1s, which is more than k=51's four 1s.

So, it's better to have OR=47 instead of OR=51.

Wait, but in the program, it's choosing OR=51, which has four 1s, whereas the sample output has OR=47 with five 1s.

So, is the program's output correct?

Well, the problem says to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

So, if OR=47 has five 1s and OR=51 has four 1s, then OR=47 is better.

So, the program's output is suboptimal in this case.

Wait, but maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

In the sample output, they have five 1s, but the program achieves only four.

So, perhaps the program is not correct.

Wait, but in the sample input, t=4, and for the fourth test case, n=6 and k=51.

But in the program, for n=6 and k=51, it outputs 1,2,16,32,0,0, which sums to 51 and OR is 1|2|16|32=1+2+16+32=51, which is 110011 with four 1s.

But the sample output has OR=101111 with five 1s.
