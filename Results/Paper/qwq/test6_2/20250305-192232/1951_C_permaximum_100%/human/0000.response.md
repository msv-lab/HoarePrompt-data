Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket. I need to buy k tickets, and there are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. Each time I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying these k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Let's look at the example provided to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 tickets on day 1. Prices for remaining days become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 tickets on day 2. Prices for remaining days become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 4. Prices for remaining day become [3]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 6 each.

Total cost = 4 + 12 = 16

But in the note, it says the cost is 10, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the note, it describes a different sequence:

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 4

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 6 each

Total cost = 4 + 12 = 16

But the output is 10, which suggests there's a better way. Maybe I need to consider the price increases properly.

Let me try again.

If I buy 0 on day 1, prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

Then buy 0 on day 2, prices for days 3-4 become [4,2]

Then buy 1 on day 3 for 4, prices for day 4 become [3]

Then buy 2 on day 4 for 3 each, total 6.

Total cost = 0 + 0 + 4 + 6 = 10.

Ah, that matches the sample output. So, the key is that buying tickets on a day increases the price for subsequent days, but only for the remaining days after that purchase.

So, the strategy seems to be to delay buying tickets as much as possible, preferring to buy on later days to take advantage of lower initial prices, and minimizing the price increases for earlier days.

But in this example, buying on day 3 and day 4 gave a total cost of 10, which is better than buying all on day 4, which would be 2*3 + 2*3 = 12, I think.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the order of days matters, and I should prioritize buying on days with the lowest price per ticket, considering the price increases.

Perhaps a greedy approach where I always buy on the day with the current lowest price, adjusted for the price increases due to previous purchases.

But I need to be careful because buying on a day affects the prices on subsequent days.

Let me consider the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

prices = [8,6,4,2]

In this case, the only way is to buy 2 tickets each day, and the prices increase by the number of tickets bought each day.

So:

- Day 1: buy 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16. Prices for remaining days become [10,8,6]

- Day 2: buy 2 tickets at 10 each, total 20. Prices for remaining days become [12,10]

- Day 3: buy 2 tickets at 12 each, total 24. Prices for remaining day become [14]

- Day 4: buy 2 tickets at 14 each, total 28.

Total cost = 16 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 88.

But the sample output is 64, which is different. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the price increase is per ticket bought, not per day.

Let me read the problem again.

"the prices per ticket increased by x"

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all subsequent days, the price per ticket increases by x.

Wait, but in the example, buying 2 tickets on day 1 makes the prices for day 2 onwards [10,8,6], which is increased by 2.

Then buying 2 tickets on day 2 makes the prices for day 3 onwards [12,10], increased by another 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying 1 ticket on day 3 makes the prices for day 4 [3], which is increased by 1.

Wait, but the initial prices were [8,6,4,2].

After buying 1 ticket on day 3, prices for day 4 become [3], which is 2 + 1 = 3.

So, it seems that the price increase is added to the original price for subsequent days.

Wait, but in the second test case, buying 2 tickets on day 1 makes prices for day 2 onwards [8+2, 4+2, 2+2] = [10,6,4], but in the explanation, it's [10,8,6]. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the price increase is added to the original price for each subsequent day.

Wait, in the first test case, buying 1 ticket on day 3 makes day 4's price 2 + 1 = 3.

So, in the second test case, buying 2 tickets on day 1 should make day 2's price 6 + 2 = 8, day 3's price 4 + 2 = 6, day 4's price 2 + 2 = 4.

Then, buying 2 tickets on day 2 makes day 3's price 6 + 2 = 8, day 4's price 4 + 2 = 6.

Then, buying 2 tickets on day 3 makes day 4's price 6 + 2 = 8.

Finally, buying 2 tickets on day 4 at 8 each.

Total cost: 2*8 (day1) + 2*8 (day2) + 2*8 (day3) + 2*8 (day4) = 64.

Ah, I see. So, the price increase is added to the original price for each subsequent day, and then if more tickets are bought on a later day, the price increases further.

So, in this case, the total cost is indeed 64.

Now, I need to find a general way to minimize the total cost for any given n, m, k, and prices.

Constraints are:

- t <= 10^4 test cases

- n <= 3*10^5

- m <= 10^9

- k <= min(n*m, 10^9)

- sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case.

Let me think about the problem.

I need to buy k tickets, with a daily limit of m tickets per day, and each ticket bought on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

I need to minimize the total cost.

One approach is to prioritize buying tickets on days with the lowest adjusted price, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

But since the price increases are cumulative based on the number of tickets bought on previous days, it's a bit tricky.

Let me consider that the price increase is a global variable that increases by the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, no. The price increase is per ticket bought on a particular day, affecting all subsequent days.

Wait, more precisely, buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket on day j (for j > i) by x.

So, the total price per ticket on day j is a_j plus the sum of x for all days i < j where x tickets were bought.

I need to minimize the sum of (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i) * x_j for j from 1 to n, where x_j is the number of tickets bought on day j, and sum_{j=1}^n x_j = k.

This seems like a minimization problem with dependencies between days.

This sounds similar to scheduling problems where tasks have increasing costs based on previous decisions.

I need to find an optimal sequence of ticket purchases across days to minimize the total cost.

Let me consider that the order of days matters, and I need to decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the price increases.

But with n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to model this problem efficiently.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x1, x2, ..., xn, with sum(xi) = k and xi <= m for all i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

Let me denote s_j = sum_{i=1}^j x_i

Then, the total cost can be rewritten as sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

But s_j is cumulative, which makes this a bit complex.

Alternatively, I can think of it as sum_{j=1}^n x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^n x_j * s_{j-1}

Which is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^n x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

This seems messy.

Maybe I can consider the problem in reverse, starting from the last day and moving backwards.

Because the price increases affect future days, but in reverse, earlier decisions affect later days.

So, if I decide how many tickets to buy on day 1, it will affect the prices on days 2 to n.

Then, for day 2, the prices are adjusted, and so on.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 3*10^5, standard DP might be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the price on day j is a_j plus the sum of x_i for i < j.

So, the cost of buying x_j tickets on day j is x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

I need to minimize the total cost sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i) given that sum_{j=1}^n x_j = k and x_j <= m for all j.

This seems complicated due to the dependency between x_j and the sum of previous x_i.

Perhaps I can rearrange the terms.

Let me consider expanding the expression:

sum_{j=1}^n x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^n x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

The first term is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * a_j

The second term is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * s_{j-1}, where s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

But s_{j-1} = s_j - x_j, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, sum_{j=1}^n x_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^n x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Let me think about the greedy approach.

Suppose I always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price.

But the current price on a day increases based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, even if a day has a low initial price, buying tickets on it early will increase the prices on subsequent days.

Therefore, it might not be optimal to buy all tickets on the day with the lowest initial price.

Instead, I should consider buying tickets on days with the lowest adjusted price, considering the cumulative increases from previous purchases.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the price increase is a global variable that increases every time I buy tickets.

Wait, no, the price increase is per ticket bought on previous days.

So, each ticket bought on any day increases the price for all subsequent days.

Wait, no, buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket on day j (j > i) by x.

So, the price on day j is a_j plus the sum of x_i for all i < j.

So, it's specifically tied to the days before j.

Given this, perhaps I can model this as assigning tickets to days, with the cost on day j being a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

Let me think about it in terms of assigning tickets to days.

Suppose I have k tickets to assign to n days, with each day having a base price a_j, and for each ticket assigned to days before j, the price on day j increases by 1.

I need to minimize the total cost of assigning k tickets to n days, with the constraint that no more than m tickets are assigned to any single day.

This seems like an assignment problem with dependencies.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a smaller example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

prices = [8,6,4,2]

From the sample, buying 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4 costs 4 + 6*2 = 16.

But according to the sample, it's 10, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it's 10, so perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the price increases are cumulative only for the days after the purchase.

So, if I buy on day 3, the price increases for day 4.

But in the sample, they bought 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, total cost 10.

Wait, let's recalculate:

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 4. Now, day 4's price increases by 1, so day 4's price becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

- Then buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 3 each, total 6.

- Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10.

Yes, that matches the sample.

So, the key is that the price increase is per ticket bought on previous days.

Hence, the order of buying tickets matters.

I need a strategy to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps I should prioritize buying tickets on days with lower base prices, but adjusted for the price increases.

Wait, but in this example, buying on day 4 is better because its base price is lower, but I have to account for the price increases from previous purchases.

Wait, but in the sample, buying on day 3 and day 4 gives a lower cost than buying on day 4 only.

If I try to buy all 3 tickets on day 4:

- If I buy 3 tickets on day 4, the price per ticket is 2 + (sum of x_i for i < 4) = 2 + (0+0+0)=2.

- So, 3*2=6.

But in the sample, it's 10, which is higher.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, in the sample, buying 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4 costs 4 + 6 = 10.

But buying all 3 on day 4 costs only 6, which is better.

But the sample output is 10, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the price increase mechanism.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"the prices per ticket increased by x"

So, buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket on all subsequent days by x.

Wait, in the sample, buying 1 ticket on day 3 increases the price on day 4 by 1, making it 3.

Then buying 2 tickets on day 4 costs 2*3=6.

Total cost: 4 + 6 =10.

But if I buy all 3 tickets on day 4, price per ticket is 2 + (sum of x_i for i <4) = 2 + (0+0+0)=2, so 3*2=6, which is better.

But the sample output is 10, which suggests that buying all on day 4 is not allowed or doesn't work that way.

Wait, perhaps the price increase is cumulative based on all previous purchases.

Wait, no, in the sample, buying 1 on day 3 makes the price on day 4 increase by 1, so day 4's price becomes 3.

Then buying 2 on day 4 at 3 each.

Total 4 + 6 =10.

But if I buy all 3 on day 4, price per ticket is 2 + 0 (since no previous purchases) =2, total 6.

Which is better, but contradicts the sample.

Wait, perhaps the price on day 4 is a_4 plus the sum of x_i for i <4.

So, a_4 + (x1 + x2 + x3).

If x1=0, x2=0, x3=3, then a4 + 3 = 5, total cost 3*5=15.

Which is worse than 10.

Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the price increase is the total number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, price on day j is a_j plus sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i.

So, in the sample:

- x1=0

- x2=0

- x3=1

- x4=2

Then, price on day 3: a3 + (x1 + x2) = 4 + 0 =4

Price on day 4: a4 + (x1 + x2 + x3) =2 +1=3

Total cost: 1*4 + 2*3 =4+6=10

If I buy all 3 on day 4:

- x1=0

- x2=0

- x3=0

- x4=3

Then, price on day 4: a4 + (x1 + x2 + x3) =2 +0=2

Total cost: 3*2=6, which is better.

But according to the sample, it's 10.

So, perhaps in the sample, buying all on day 4 is allowed and better, but the sample output is 10.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that m is 2, so I can't buy more than 2 tickets per day.

In the first test case, m=2, k=3.

So, I can't buy 3 tickets on day 4, because m=2.

Hence, I have to buy 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 on day 4, total cost 4 + 6=10.

Ah, that makes sense now.

So, with m=2, k=3, I have to buy at least two days because I can't buy more than 2 per day.

Hence, buying 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4.

If m=3, k=3, I could buy all 3 on day 4 for 6, which is better.

But in the first test case, m=2, so I can't buy 3 on day 4.

Hence, the sample output is 10.

Got it.

So, in this problem, I need to distribute the k tickets across the n days, respecting the daily limit m, and minimizing the total cost, considering that each ticket bought on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

This seems like a complex optimization problem.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about the properties of an optimal solution.

Suppose I sort the days based on their base prices, considering the price increases.

But the price increases are dependent on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

This seems too interdependent for a simple greedy approach.

Perhaps I need to model this as a minimum cost assignment problem.

But with n up to 3*10^5, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum of (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i) * x_j for j=1 to n.

Let me denote s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + s_j)

But s_j is the sum of x_i for i < j.

This seems like a linear function in terms of x_j, but with dependencies.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x1, x2, ..., xn, with sum(x_i)=k and x_i <=m for all i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

Let me denote t_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

Then, s_j = t_j - x_j

So, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + t_j - x_j) = sum_{j=1}^n (a_j * x_j + x_j * t_j - x_j^2)

This seems even more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of choosing which days to buy tickets on, considering the increasing prices.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the price on day j is a_j plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the cost of buying x_j tickets on day j is x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

I need to minimize the sum of these costs over all j, with sum(x_j)=k and x_j <=m.

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

Given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) per test case.

Let me think about a priority queue approach.

Suppose I maintain a priority queue of days, sorted by their current price.

I start with all days having their initial prices.

I buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price, up to m tickets, and then increase the prices of all subsequent days by the number of tickets bought.

Repeat this until I've bought k tickets.

Wait, but maintaining a priority queue where each day's price increases by the number of tickets bought previously seems too slow for n=3e5.

Each extraction would be O(log n), and I might need to do up to k extractions, which could be up to 1e9, which is too slow.

So, that won't work.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed in terms of the assignment of tickets to days, with the cost on each day depending on the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

This seems similar to a knapsack problem, but with dependencies between the days.

This is getting too involved.

Let me look for a mathematical optimization.

Suppose I denote t_j = sum_{i=1}^j x_i

Then, s_j = t_j - x_j = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + s_j) = sum_{j=1}^n x_j * (a_j + t_j - x_j)

Which is sum_{j=1}^n (a_j * x_j + x_j * t_j - x_j^2)

This still seems too complex to optimize directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the problem differently.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on day j costs a_j plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the cost of the p-th ticket bought on day j is a_j plus the total number of tickets bought on days before j plus the number of tickets bought on j before the p-th ticket.

This seems too involved.

Let me think about it in terms of assigning tickets to days.

Each ticket assigned to day j has a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

So, if I assign t_j tickets to day j, the cost for those tickets is t_j * a_j plus t_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i

Hence, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n (t_j * a_j + t_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i)

Which is sum_{j=1}^n t_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^n t_j * s_{j-1}, where s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i

This can be rewritten as sum_{j=1}^n t_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^n t_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = s_j - t_j, but that might not help.

Alternatively, sum_{j=1}^n t_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^n t_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i = sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i * t_j

So, total cost is sum_{j=1}^n t_j * a_j + sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i * t_j

This seems like a quadratic form.

Given that, I need to minimize this quadratic form subject to sum_{j=1}^n t_j = k and t_j <= m for all j.

This is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.

Given the constraints on n and k, I need an efficient way to solve this.

This seems too complex for a programming competition problem at this level.

Perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider that the cost increase is due to the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, tickets bought on earlier days increase the cost of tickets bought on later days.

Hence, it might be better to buy tickets on later days to minimize the increases.

Wait, but buying on later days means that the base prices might be higher.

So, there's a trade-off between base prices and the increases caused by previous purchases.

I need to find a balance.

Let me consider that the price on day j is a_j plus the number of tickets bought on days before j.

So, the cost per ticket on day j is a_j plus the total number of tickets bought on days 1 to j-1.

Hence, if I buy t_j tickets on day j, the cost is t_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i)

I need to minimize sum_{j=1}^n [t_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i)]

This seems tricky.

Let me consider rephrasing the problem.

Suppose I have to buy k tickets, distributed among n days, with daily limits m.

Each ticket bought on day j has a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets bought on days before j.

Hence, the cost of a ticket on day j is a_j plus sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i

So, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^n t_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i)

This seems similar to assigning weights to days, with dependencies.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum_{j=1}^n t_j * a_j + sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i * t_j

Yes, as I derived earlier.

Now, I need to minimize this expression subject to sum_{j=1}^n t_j = k and t_j <= m for all j.

This seems like a quadratic optimization problem.

I need to find a way to minimize this efficiently.

Let me consider that sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i * t_j = (sum_{j=1}^n t_j)^2 - sum_{j=1}^n t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no.

Actually, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i * t_j = (sum_{j=1}^n t_j)^2 - sum_{j=1}^n t_j^2 / 2

Wait, that's not correct.

Actually, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Actually, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no.

Wait, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, that's still not right.

Actually, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match.

Actually, it should be sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let's correct this:

(sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's still not right.

Wait, (sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, that can't be right because the left side is sum of products, and the right side doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall that sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

Actually, the correct formula is:

sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look it up.

Let me recall that:

(sum t_j)^2 = sum t_j^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j

Hence, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, it should be:

sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's still not right.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider n=2:

sum_{1 <= i < j <= 2} t_i t_j = t1 t2

And (sum t_j)^2 = t1^2 + t2^2 + 2 t1 t2

Hence, t1 t2 = (t1 + t2)^2 - t1^2 - t2^2 / 2

Wait, no:

(t1 + t2)^2 = t1^2 + t2^2 + 2 t1 t2

Hence, 2 t1 t2 = (t1 + t2)^2 - t1^2 - t2^2

Hence, t1 t2 = ( (t1 + t2)^2 - t1^2 - t2^2 ) / 2

So, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = ( (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 ) / 2

Ah, that's the correct formula.

Hence, in general, sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = ( (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 ) / 2

So, going back to the total cost:

sum_{j=1}^n t_j * a_j + sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} t_i t_j = sum t_j * a_j + ( (sum t_j)^2 - sum t_j^2 ) / 2

Given that sum t_j = k, this becomes sum t_j * a_j + (k^2 - sum t_j^2) / 2

Hence, total cost = sum t_j * a_j + (k^2 - sum t_j^2) / 2

I need to minimize this expression subject to sum t_j = k and t_j <= m for all j.

This seems a bit better.

So, total_cost = sum t_j * a_j + (k^2 - sum t_j^2) / 2

I need to minimize this.

Let me rearrange:

total_cost = sum t_j * a_j + 0.5 * k^2 - 0.5 * sum t_j^2

Which is -0.5 * sum t_j^2 + sum t_j * a_j + 0.5 * k^2

So, it's a quadratic function in terms of t_j.

I need to minimize this function subject to sum t_j = k and t_j <= m.

This is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.

Given the constraints on n and k, I need an efficient way to solve this.

Perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers or some other optimization technique.

But that might be too involved for this context.

Let me consider sorting the days based on their base prices.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_j.

Then, I can try to assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_j, respecting the daily limits m.

But considering the price increases, this might not be optimal, because buying on lower a_j days increases the prices for higher a_j days.

Hence, it might be better to buy on higher a_j days to minimize the increases.

Wait, but higher a_j might have higher base prices.

This is confusing.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

prices = [8,6,4,2]

If I sort the days in increasing order of a_j: day4=2, day3=4, day2=6, day1=8

Now, if I assign as many tickets as possible to the lowest a_j days first:

- day4: assign 2 tickets (m=2)

- day3: assign 1 ticket (k=3-2=1)

Total cost: 2*(2 +0) +1*(4 +2)=4 +6=10

Which matches the sample.

Wait, in this approach, I assign tickets to the lowest a_j days first, and for each day, the cost per ticket is a_j plus the sum of tickets assigned to earlier days.

In this case, day4 is assigned first, but in the sample, day3 is assigned first.

Wait, no, in this approach, I assign to day4 first, then day3.

But in the sample, it's day3 then day4.

Wait, but in my calculation, assigning to day4 first:

- day4: assign 2 tickets at cost 2 each (since sum of earlier tickets is 0)

- day3: assign 1 ticket at cost 4 +2=6

Total cost: 4 +6=10

Same as the sample.

So, perhaps sorting the days in increasing order of a_j and assigning as many tickets as possible to the lowest a_j days first is the way to go.

Let me try another example.

Second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

prices=[8,6,4,2]

Sort prices: [2,4,6,8]

Assign to lowest a_j first:

- day4: assign 2 tickets at cost 2 +0=2 each, total 4

- day3: assign 2 tickets at cost 4 +2=6 each, total 12

- day2: assign 2 tickets at cost 6 +4=10 each, total 20

- day1: assign 2 tickets at cost 8 +6=14 each, total 28

Total cost: 4+12+20+28=64

Which matches the sample.

Another example:

Third test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1

prices=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

Sort prices: [1,10,100,1000,10000]

Assign to lowest a_j first:

- day2: assign 1 ticket at cost 1 +0=1

Total cost:1

Which matches the sample.

Last example:

n=6, m=3, k=9

prices=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

Sort prices: [5,5,5,5,5,5]

Assign to the first 3 days:

- day1: assign 3 tickets at cost 5 +0=5 each, total 15

- day2: assign 3 tickets at cost 5 +3=8 each, total 24

- day3: assign 3 tickets at cost 5 +6=11 each, total 33

Total cost:15+24+33=72

Which matches the sample.

So, in all these cases, sorting the days by increasing a_j and assigning as many tickets as possible to the lowest a_j days first seems to work.

Hence, the strategy is:

1. Sort the days in increasing order of a_j.

2. Iterate through the sorted days, and assign the maximum possible tickets (up to m) to each day, starting from the lowest a_j.

3. For each day, the cost per ticket is a_j plus the sum of tickets assigned to earlier days.

4. Keep track of the total cost and the sum of tickets assigned.

5. Stop when the total tickets assigned reach k.

This seems to be an optimal strategy.

Let me see why this works.

By assigning tickets to the lowest a_j days first, I minimize the base cost of the tickets.

Additionally, since the price increases are additive for subsequent days, by assigning tickets to lower a_j days first, the increases are applied to higher a_j days, which might have higher base prices, but since we're assigning fewer tickets to them (due to the m limit), the overall increase might be manageable.

In the first test case, assigning to day4 first minimizes the base cost, and since we assign the maximum possible (m=2), we minimize the number of days used.

Then, assign the remaining tickets to the next lowest a_j day, which is day3.

This seems to be a greedy approach that works for these examples.

Let me see if there's a case where this approach fails.

Suppose n=2, m=1, k=2

prices=[1,100]

Sort prices: [1,100]

Assign to day1: assign 1 ticket at cost 1 +0=1

Assign to day2: assign 1 ticket at cost 100 +1=101

Total cost:1 +101=102

Is there a better way?

If I assign to day2 first: assign 1 ticket at cost 100 +0=100

Then assign to day1: assign 1 ticket at cost 1 +1=2

Total cost:100 +2=102

Same total cost.

Another case: n=3, m=1, k=3

prices=[1,2,3]

Sort prices: [1,2,3]

Assign to day1:1 ticket at 1 +0=1

Assign to day2:1 ticket at 2 +1=3

Assign to day3:1 ticket at 3 +2=5

Total cost:1+3+5=9

Alternative: assign to day3 first:

Assign to day3:1 ticket at 3 +0=3

Assign to day2:1 ticket at 2 +1=3

Assign to day1:1 ticket at 1 +2=3

Total cost:3+3+3=9

Same total cost.

Another case: n=3, m=2, k=3

prices=[1,2,3]

Sort prices: [1,2,3]

Assign to day1:2 tickets at 1 +0=1 each, total 2

Assign to day2:1 ticket at 2 +2=4, total 4

Total cost:2+4=6

Alternative: assign to day2 first:

Assign to day2:2 tickets at 2 +0=2 each, total 4

Assign to day
