Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, or if he's just wasting his time.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of the sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a by b, he can cut it into two rectangles of size a by something, or something by b.

Let's consider an example to get a better grasp. Take the example where a=2 and b=6. According to the problem, he can cut it into two 2 by 3 rectangles, and then rearrange them to form a 4 by 3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2 by 6.

Another example is a=2 and b=1. He cuts it into two 1 by 1 rectangles, and then tries to arrange them into a 1 by 2 or 2 by 1 rectangle, but since these are considered the same, he doesn't get a new rectangle.

So, the goal is to see if, after cutting and rearranging, Bob can get a rectangle that is different from the original one, not considering rotations.

Now, I need to think about the general case. Given a rectangle of size a by b, I need to consider all possible ways he can cut it and then rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

First, he can cut it horizontally or vertically.

If he cuts horizontally, he's cutting parallel to the b side, so he'd get two rectangles of size a by something.

Similarly, if he cuts vertically, he's cutting parallel to the a side, getting two rectangles of something by b.

But actually, wait, no. If he cuts parallel to the a side, he's cutting along the length of a, so he'd be getting two rectangles with height b and width something less than a.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of cutting either along the a side or along the b side.

Let's clarify:

- If he cuts parallel to the a side, he's making a cut along the b dimension, so he's dividing the b side into two parts.

- Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b side, he's making a cut along the a dimension, dividing the a side into two parts.

But according to the problem, he can cut parallel to one of the sides, so it's either cutting along a or along b.

But perhaps it's easier to consider that he can cut either way, and then consider the possibilities.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles, and he can rotate and move them to form a new rectangle.

The key is that the new rectangle must be different from the original one, not considering rotations.

So, if the original rectangle is a by b, and the new one is c by d, then c and d should not be equal to a and b in any order.

Meaning, if a != c or b != d, and a != d or b != c, then it's a different rectangle.

Wait, actually, since rotations are considered the same, a by b is the same as b by a.

So, to have a different rectangle, the new one must not have the same set of side lengths as the original.

Okay, now I need to think about how the cutting and rearranging can lead to a different set of side lengths.

Let's consider the cutting options:

1. Cut parallel to the a side:

- This means cutting along the b side, dividing b into two parts, say b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

- So, after cutting, he has two rectangles: a by b1 and a by b2.

- Now, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

- He can place them side by side or one above the other.

- If he places them side by side, parallel to the a side, he'd get a rectangle of size a by (b1 + b2), which is the same as the original a by b.

- If he places them one above the other, he'd need to rotate one of them.

- Rotating a rectangle of size a by b1 to be b1 by a, and then placing it next to the other a by b2 rectangle.

- So, he'd have two rectangles: b1 by a and b2 by a.

- If he places them side by side, the new rectangle would be (b1 + b2) by a, which is again the same as the original a by b.

- Alternatively, if he places them one above the other, he'd have a height of a and width of max(b1, b2), but that might not form a proper rectangle.

- Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

- Actually, if he has two rectangles of b1 by a and b2 by a, and he places them side by side, he gets (b1 + b2) by a, which is again a by b.

- So, in this case, he doesn't get a new rectangle.

- Unless b1 and b2 are different, but even then, it's still a by b.

- Hmm, seems like cutting parallel to the a side doesn't help in getting a different rectangle.

Wait, but the example given is a=2, b=6, cut into two 2 by 3 rectangles, and then arranging them to form a 4 by 3 rectangle, which is different from 2 by 6.

Wait, in this case, he cut parallel to the b side, dividing a into two parts.

Wait, no, a=2, b=6, cutting parallel to the b side means cutting a into two parts, say a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

But in the example, he cut it into two 2 by 3 rectangles, which means he cut the b side into two 3's.

So, he cut parallel to the a side, dividing b into two 3's.

Then, he has two 2 by 3 rectangles.

Now, he can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

If he places them side by side along the 3 side, he gets a 2 by 6, which is the original.

If he places them one above the other along the 2 side, he gets a 4 by 3.

Now, 4 by 3 is different from 2 by 6, since 4 != 6 and 3 != 2.

So, in this case, he can get a different rectangle.

Similarly, in the second example, a=2, b=1, cutting into two 1 by 1 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 1 by 2 or 2 by 1, which is the same as the original, so no new rectangle.

So, the key is to see if, after cutting and rearranging, he can get a rectangle with dimensions different from the original in any order.

Now, to generalize this.

Given a rectangle a by b, he can cut it either along a or along b.

Let's consider cutting along a, dividing b into two parts, b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Then, he has two rectangles of a by b1 and a by b2.

He can rotate them, so each can be either a by b1 or b1 by a, similarly for b2.

Then, he can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if he cuts along b, dividing a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a, he gets two rectangles of a1 by b and a2 by b.

Again, he can rotate them.

Now, he needs to arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle, and check if this new rectangle is different from the original one.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose he cuts the rectangle into two parts, and then rearranges them.

The total area remains the same, obviously.

So, the new rectangle must have the same area, a * b.

So, any possible new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c * d = a * b.

Moreover, to be different from the original, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

So, the question reduces to: can I find two integers c and d such that c * d = a * b, and c != a and c != b?

Wait, more precisely, c != a or c != b, since if c != a and c != b, then d will also be different from a and b respectively.

Wait, no, if c != a and c != b, then d will be a * b / c, which is not equal to a or b, provided a and b are integers.

But actually, I need to ensure that the new rectangle is different from the original in both dimensions.

Wait, more carefully:

- The original rectangle has dimensions a and b.

- A new rectangle has dimensions c and d, with c * d = a * b.

- To be different from the original, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

So, I need to check if there exists any pair (c, d) such that c * d = a * b, and c != a or d != b, considering that rotations are the same.

Wait, actually, since rotations are considered the same, (c, d) is considered the same as (d, c).

So, to have a different rectangle, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

Now, the question is, can Bob obtain such a rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

But, I need to ensure that such a rectangle can be formed from the two pieces he has.

So, perhaps not all pairs (c, d) with c * d = a * b are achievable by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

Hence, I need to consider what specific rectangles can be formed from the two pieces he has.

Let's think about the cutting options again.

If he cuts parallel to the a side, he divides b into b1 and b2, getting two rectangles of a by b1 and a by b2.

Then, he can rotate them, so effectively, he has two rectangles with dimensions a by b1 and a by b2, or b1 by a and b2 by a.

Then, he can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b side, he divides a into a1 and a2, getting two rectangles of a1 by b and a2 by b.

Rotating them, he can have a1 by b or b by a1, and a2 by b or b by a2.

Then, he arranges them to form a new rectangle.

Now, to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, he needs to arrange them in such a way that their sides match up properly.

Let me consider the possible arrangements.

Case 1: Cutting parallel to the a side.

- He divides b into b1 and b2, getting two rectangles of a by b1 and a by b2.

- He can rotate them to be b1 by a and b2 by a.

- Now, to form a new rectangle, he can place them side by side along the b1 and b2 sides, forming a rectangle of (b1 + b2) by a, which is the same as the original a by b.

- Or, he can place them one above the other along the a side, forming a rectangle of a by (b1 + b2), again the same as the original.

- Alternatively, he can place one rotated and one not rotated, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps there are other ways.

Wait, in the example, when a=2 and b=6, he cuts it into two 2 by 3 rectangles, and then arranges them to form a 4 by 3 rectangle.

How does that work?

If he has two 2 by 3 rectangles, he can place them side by side along the 3 side to get a 2 by 6, which is the original.

Or, he can place them one above the other along the 2 side to get a 4 by 3.

Now, 4 by 3 is different from 2 by 6, since 4 != 2 and 3 != 6.

Hence, in this case, he can get a different rectangle.

So, in this arrangement, he placed two 2 by 3 rectangles one above the other, stacking them, to get a height of 4 and width of 3.

Similarly, if he had two 3 by 2 rectangles, he could arrange them differently.

Wait, but 2 by 3 and 3 by 2 are considered the same up to rotation.

But in terms of arrangement, it might matter.

Wait, no, since he can rotate the pieces as he wishes.

So, in terms of the pieces, their dimensions are a by b1 and a by b2, and he can rotate them to be b1 by a and b2 by a.

Then, arranging them side by side along the b1 and b2 sides gives (b1 + b2) by a, which is a by b.

Arranging them one above the other gives a by (b1 + b2), which is again a by b.

Wait, but in the example, he arranged them to get a 4 by 3, which is a by (b1 + b2) = 2 by (3 + 3) = 2 by 6, but that's not what happened.

Wait, no, in the example, he cut into two 2 by 3 rectangles, and then placed them one above the other to get a 4 by 3 rectangle.

Wait, how does that work?

If he has two 2 by 3 rectangles and places them one above the other, stacking them vertically, then the height becomes 2 + 2 = 4, and the width remains 3, giving a 4 by 3 rectangle.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, he can get a 4 by 3 rectangle from the original 2 by 6 by cutting and rearranging.

Now, is there a general way to see when this is possible?

Let me think about the conditions under which he can get a different rectangle.

First, he needs to be able to cut the rectangle into two pieces in such a way that, after rotating and arranging them, they form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

In the example, a=2, b=6, he cuts b into two 3's, getting two 2 by 3 rectangles.

Then, by stacking them vertically, he gets a 4 by 3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2 by 6.

Similarly, in the second example, a=2, b=1, he cuts b into two 1's, getting two 2 by 1 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side gives a 2 by 2 rectangle, which is the same as 2 by 2, but since 2 by 2 is the same as 2 by 2, it's not different.

Wait, but in the note, it says that from 2 by 2, he can cut it into two 1 by 2 rectangles, and then arrange them to form a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2 by 2.

Wait, but in the output, for a=2, b=2, it's "Yes", meaning he can get a different rectangle.

So, in that case, cutting a=2 into two 1's, getting two 1 by 2 rectangles, and then arranging them side by side to get a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2 by 2.

Hence, in that case, it's possible.

Wait, but according to the initial approach, if he cuts the a side into two 1's, getting two 1 by 2 rectangles, and then arranges them side by side to get a 1 by 4, which is different from 2 by 2.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Another example: a=3, b=2.

He can cut a into 1 and 2, getting two rectangles of 1 by 2 and 2 by 2.

Then, arranging them appropriately, he can get a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the sample input, a=3, b=2 outputs "Yes", meaning he can get a different rectangle.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me try to find a general condition.

I need to find if there exists a way to cut the rectangle into two pieces and rearrange them to form a new rectangle different from the original.

Given that, I need to see if there's any way to cut and rearrange to get c and d such that c * d = a * b and (c, d) != (a, b) or (b, a).

But, not all such c and d are achievable by cutting and rearranging in the specified way.

Hence, I need to find if there's any way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then arrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let me consider the cutting options more carefully.

If he cuts parallel to the a side, dividing b into b1 and b2, then he has two rectangles of a by b1 and a by b2.

He can rotate them to be b1 by a and b2 by a.

Then, to form a new rectangle, he can place them side by side along the b1 and b2 sides to get (b1 + b2) by a, which is a by b, or place them one above the other to get a by (b1 + b2), which is again a by b.

Alternatively, he can arrange them in other ways, like placing them in an L-shape or something, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but in the example, he placed two 2 by 3 rectangles one above the other to get a 4 by 3 rectangle.

So, in that case, he stacked them vertically to get a height of 4 and width of 3.

Similarly, with two 1 by 2 rectangles, he can stack them to get a 2 by 2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2 by 2.

Wait, but in the note, it says that from 2 by 2, he can cut it into two 1 by 2 rectangles and arrange them to form a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different.

How does that work?

If he has two 1 by 2 rectangles, he can place them side by side along the 2 side to get a 1 by 4 rectangle.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this arrangement, he placed them horizontally to get a wider rectangle.

Hence, in this case, he can get a different rectangle.

Similarly, in the a=3, b=2 case, he can cut a=3 into 1 and 2, getting a 1 by 2 and a 2 by 2.

Then, arranging them side by side appropriately, he can get a new rectangle.

Wait, but I'm not sure what the new dimensions would be in this case.

If he has a 1 by 2 and a 2 by 2, he can place them side by side along the 2 side to get a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different from the original 3 by 2.

Hence, in this case, it's possible.

So, perhaps, in general, if either a or b is even, he can cut it into two equal parts and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Wait, in the a=2, b=6 example, b is even, so he cut b into two 3's and arranged them to get a 4 by 3 rectangle.

Similarly, in a=2, b=1, b is odd, and he couldn't get a different rectangle.

In a=2, b=2, b is even, and he could get a different rectangle.

In a=3, b=2, a is odd, but b is even, and he could get a different rectangle.

In a=6, b=3, which is the last test case, output is "No", meaning he cannot get a different rectangle.

Wait, but 6 is even, but in this case, it's "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, a=6, b=3 outputs "No".

Wait, but 6 is even, so why can't he get a different rectangle?

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

Wait, in the sample input:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Looking at these, I see that when a and b are both even, or when one is even and the other is a multiple that allows for a different arrangement, it's "Yes", otherwise "No".

Wait, but a=6, b=3 is "No", even though 6 is even.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share a common factor beyond 1.

Wait, in a=6, b=3, GCD is 3.

In a=2, b=6, GCD is 2.

In a=3, b=2, GCD is 1.

In a=2, b=2, GCD is 2.

In a=2, b=1, GCD is 1.

Wait, but in a=2, b=6 (GCD=2), output is "Yes".

In a=3, b=2 (GCD=1), output is "Yes".

In a=2, b=2 (GCD=2), output is "Yes".

In a=2, b=1 (GCD=1), output is "No".

In a=6, b=3 (GCD=3), output is "No".

Hmm, seems like when GCD is 1, it's "Yes" sometimes and "No" sometimes.

Wait, perhaps it's not directly related to GCD.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the aspect ratio.

If a and b are both even, or if one is even and the other is a multiple that allows for a different arrangement, then "Yes".

But in a=6, b=3, a is even, but output is "No".

Wait, maybe it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, in a=2, b=6, b is divisible by 2*a, since 6 is divisible by 4, but no, 6 is not divisible by 4.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a divides b or vice versa.

In a=2, b=6, a divides b.

In a=3, b=2, a does not divide b and b does not divide a.

In a=2, b=1, a does not divide b and b does not divide a.

But output is "No" for a=2, b=1.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, in a=2, b=6, a is divisible by 2.

In a=3, b=2, b is divisible by 2.

In a=2, b=2, a is divisible by 2.

In a=2, b=1, neither is divisible by 2.

In a=6, b=3, a is divisible by 2.

So, when a or b is divisible by 2, it's "Yes", except for a=6, b=3, which is "No".

Wait, but a=6 is divisible by 2, but output is "No".

Hmm, maybe it's more specific.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the smaller side is divisible by 2.

Wait, in a=2, b=6, smaller side a=2 is divisible by 2, output "Yes".

In a=3, b=2, smaller side b=2 is divisible by 2, output "Yes".

In a=2, b=1, smaller side b=1 is not divisible by 2, output "No".

In a=6, b=3, smaller side b=3 is not divisible by 2, output "No".

Wait, but in a=2, b=2, both sides are divisible by 2, output "Yes".

So, perhaps if the smaller side is divisible by 2, then "Yes", else "No".

But in a=6, b=3, smaller side b=3 is not divisible by 2, output "No".

Similarly, in a=2, b=1, smaller side b=1 is not divisible by 2, output "No".

In a=2, b=6, smaller side a=2 is divisible by 2, output "Yes".

In a=3, b=2, smaller side b=2 is divisible by 2, output "Yes".

In a=2, b=2, smaller side a=2 is divisible by 2, output "Yes".

In a=6, b=3, smaller side b=3 is not divisible by 2, output "No".

So, this seems to hold.

Hence, the condition is: if the smaller side is even, output "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, a=6, b=3, smaller side is 3, which is odd, output "No".

a=2, b=1, smaller side is 1, which is odd, output "No".

a=2, b=6, smaller side is 2, which is even, output "Yes".

a=3, b=2, smaller side is 2, even, output "Yes".

a=2, b=2, smaller side is 2, even, output "Yes".

a=2, b=4, smaller side is 2, even, output "Yes".

So, it seems consistent.

Hence, the condition is: if the smaller side is even, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in the note, it says that from a=2, b=2, he can cut it into two 1 by 2 rectangles and arrange them to form a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2 by 2.

So, in this case, smaller side is 2, which is even, and output is "Yes".

Similarly, in a=2, b=6, smaller side is 2, even, output "Yes".

In a=3, b=2, smaller side is 2, even, output "Yes".

In a=2, b=1, smaller side is 1, odd, output "No".

In a=6, b=3, smaller side is 3, odd, output "No".

So, this seems to be the pattern.

Hence, perhaps the condition is simply: if the smaller side is even, output "Yes", else "No".

But is this always true?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose a=4, b=2.

Smaller side is 2, even, so output should be "Yes".

Indeed, he can cut b=2 into two 1's, getting two 4 by 1 rectangles.

Then, arrange them side by side to get a 4 by 2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Wait, but according to the note, in a=2, b=2, he can cut a=2 into two 1's, getting two 1 by 2 rectangles, and arrange them side by side to get a 1 by 4 rectangle, which is different.

Similarly, in a=4, b=2, if he cuts a=4 into two 2's, getting two 2 by 2 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side, he gets a 2 by 4 rectangle, which is the same as 4 by 2.

Alternatively, stacking them, he gets a 4 by 2, same as original.

Wait, but is there a way to get a different rectangle?

Wait, if he cuts a=4 into two 2's, getting two 2 by 2 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side, he gets a 2 by 4 rectangle, which is the same as 4 by 2.

If he arranges them one above the other, he gets a 4 by 2, same as original.

Is there another way to cut it?

Alternatively, he can cut b=2 into two 1's, getting two 4 by 1 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side, he gets a 4 by 2, same as original.

Alternatively, stacking them, he gets an 8 by 1 rectangle, which is different from the original 4 by 2.

Wait, is that possible?

If he has two 4 by 1 rectangles and stacks them vertically, he gets an 8 by 1 rectangle, which is different from the original 4 by 2.

Hence, in this case, he can get a different rectangle.

So, even though a=4 and b=2, both a and b are even, and he can get a different rectangle.

Hence, the condition holds.

Another example: a=5, b=3.

Smaller side is 3, which is odd, so output should be "No".

Is there a way to get a different rectangle?

If he cuts a=5 into two parts, say 2 and 3, getting two rectangles of 2 by 3 and 3 by 3.

Then, arranging them, he can place them side by side to get a 2 by 6 rectangle and a 3 by 3, but that doesn't form a single rectangle.

Alternatively, placing them in an L-shape doesn't form a rectangle.

Hence, likely, he cannot get a different rectangle in this case.

Hence, output should be "No", which matches the condition.

Another example: a=4, b=3.

Smaller side is 3, odd, output should be "No".

Is there a way to get a different rectangle?

If he cuts a=4 into two parts, say 1 and 3, getting two rectangles of 1 by 3 and 3 by 3.

Arranging them doesn't seem to form a new rectangle different from the original.

Hence, likely "No", which matches the condition.

Another example: a=4, b=4.

Smaller side is 4, even, output should be "Yes".

Indeed, he can cut a=4 into two 2's, getting two 2 by 4 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side, he gets a 2 by 8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4 by 4.

Hence, "Yes".

So, it seems that if the smaller side is even, he can always get a different rectangle by cutting it into two equal parts and arranging them appropriately.

Hence, the condition is: if min(a, b) is even, output "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, a=6, b=3, min(a, b)=3, which is odd, output "No".

a=2, b=1, min(a, b)=1, odd, output "No".

a=2, b=6, min(a, b)=2, even, output "Yes".

a=3, b=2, min(a, b)=2, even, output "Yes".

a=2, b=2, min(a, b)=2, even, output "Yes".

a=2, b=4, min(a, b)=2, even, output "Yes".

a=6, b=3, min(a, b)=3, odd, output "No".

Hence, this seems consistent.

Hence, the condition is: if the smaller side is even, output "Yes", else "No".

Hence, the function should return "Yes" if min(a, b) is even, else "No".

But in the given code, it returns "yes" if b is even, else "no".

This is not exactly the same as my conclusion.

Wait, in my conclusion, it's min(a, b) is even.

But in the code, it's checking if b is even.

Is this equivalent to checking if min(a, b) is even?

No, it's not.

Because min(a, b) could be a or b, whichever is smaller.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it only checks if b is even, not if the smaller side is even.

Hence, the correctness is False.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems
