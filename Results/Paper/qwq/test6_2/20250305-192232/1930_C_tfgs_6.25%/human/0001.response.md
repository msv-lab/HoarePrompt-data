Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation, he selects an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from the array `a`. After `n` operations, the set `S` will contain unique values since it's a set, and then he sorts these values in decreasing order to form array `b`. The task is to find the lexicographically largest `b` that can be achieved.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that when comparing two arrays, we look for the first position where they differ, and the array with the larger value at that position is considered larger. So, to maximize `b`, we want the largest possible values to appear first in the sorted order.

Given that `S` is a set, it only contains unique elements. So, if we insert the same value multiple times, it only appears once in `S`. The problem allows us to choose which index to pick at each step, so we have some control over which values go into `S`.

Let's think about how to maximize `b`. Since `b` is sorted in decreasing order, to make it lexicographically largest, we want the largest possible values to appear as early as possible in `b`. That means we should try to maximize the maximum value in `S`, then the second maximum, and so on.

Each value inserted into `S` is `a[i] + i`, where `i` is the index chosen at each step. The index `i` is 1-based, and after deleting `a[i]`, the indices of elements to the right of `a[i]` decrease by 1.

Wait, but in Python, arrays are 0-based, so I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first sample input:

2

2 1

So, n=2, a=[2,1]

Step 1: Choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, delete a[1], so a becomes [1]

Step 2: Choose i=1 again, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S, delete a[1], a is empty

S = {2,3}, sorted in decreasing order: b = [3,2]

Alternatively, if in step 1, I choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, delete a[2], a becomes [2]

Step 2: Choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, but since 3 is already in S, S remains {3}

b = [3]

But [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3], so the first approach is better.

Another example from the input:

5

1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000

n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

If I always choose the last element:

Step 1: i=5, insert a[5] + 5 = 1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005, delete a[5], a=[1,100,1000,1000000]

Step 2: i=4, insert a[4] + 4 = 1000000 + 4 = 1000004, delete a[4], a=[1,100,1000]

Step 3: i=3, insert a[3] + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003, delete a[3], a=[1,100]

Step 4: i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 100 + 2 = 102, delete a[2], a=[1]

Step 5: i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, delete a[1], a=[]

S = {1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2}, sorted decreasing: b = [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]

Another approach might give a different `b`, but according to the sample output, this is the correct one.

Looking at the third sample:

3

6 4 8

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

Possible steps:

Step 1: choose i=3, insert a[3] + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11, delete a[3], a=[6,4]

Step 2: choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6, delete a[2], a=[6]

Step 3: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1], a=[]

S = {11,6,7}, sorted decreasing: b = [11,7,6]

But according to the sample output, it's [11,7,6], which matches this approach.

Alternatively, if I choose differently:

Step 1: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1], a=[4,8]

Step 2: choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10, delete a[2], a=[4]

Step 3: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, delete a[1], a=[]

S = {7,10,5}, sorted decreasing: b = [10,7,5]

But [11,7,6] is lexicographically larger than [10,7,5], as 11 > 10.

So, the first approach is better.

From these examples, it seems that choosing the largest possible `a[i] + i` at each step leads to a better `b`. But sets don't allow duplicates, so we need to be careful about inserting duplicates.

Wait, but in the first sample, choosing i=2 first would lead to inserting 3 again, but since it's a set, it only keeps one 3.

So, perhaps the strategy is to maximize the sum `a[i] + i` at each step, but also consider the potential impact on future steps.

But in the first sample, choosing i=1 first gives a better `b`.

Wait, in the first sample, choosing i=1 first gives S = {3,2}, and choosing i=2 first gives S = {3}.

So, choosing i=1 first is better.

In the second sample, choosing the last element each time seems to give the largest possible `b`.

In the third sample, choosing the last element each time gives [11,7,6], which is better than other choices.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose the element that gives the largest possible `a[i] + i`, considering that future choices might be affected by the deletion.

But it's a bit tricky because deleting an element affects the indices of the remaining elements.

Wait, in the operation, after deleting `a[i]`, the indices of elements to the right of `a[i]` decrease by 1.

So, if I have a array a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], and I choose i=k, then insert a[k] + k into S, and delete a[k], then the new array becomes [a1, a2, ..., a(k-1), a(k+1), ..., an], with indices adjusted.

So, the indices change after deletion.

This makes it a bit complicated to keep track of indices.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Wait, since the operations are done one by one, and at each step, I can choose any index from the current array, perhaps I can think in terms of choosing elements without worrying about the indices changing, by considering the original positions.

But the sum `a[i] + i` depends on the current index, which changes after deletion.

This seems messy.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me consider that the set `S` will contain values that are `a[i] + idx`, where `idx` is the index at the time of selection.

Since indices change after each deletion, it's hard to predict what `idx` will be for each element.

Wait, but in programming terms, if I simulate the process, I can keep track of the current array and indices, but for n up to 3e5, and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 3e5, I need an efficient solution.

So, simulation is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Since I have to perform n operations, each time selecting an element and inserting `a[i] + i` into a set, and then deleting that element.

After n operations, S contains unique values, and b is S sorted in decreasing order.

I need to maximize b lexicographically.

Lexicographical order means comparing the first element, then the second, and so on.

So, I need to maximize the first element of b, then the second, and so on.

To maximize the first element, I need the largest possible value in S.

To maximize the second element, given the first, and so on.

But since S is a set, it contains unique values.

So, I need to select n times, each time choosing an `a[i] + i` to add to S, ensuring that duplicates are handled correctly.

Wait, but since S is a set, duplicates are automatically handled.

But in the operation, I can't choose to insert a value that's already in S; it won't be added again.

But in the program, it's not clear how this is being handled.

Looking at the given program:

from collections import Counter

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):

a[i] += i + 1

counter = Counter(a)

a = list(set(a))

a.sort(reverse=True)

cnt = n - len(a)

ans = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if i > 0:

adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])

for j in range(adv):

ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)

cnt -= adv

counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv

ans.append(a[i])

counter[a[i]] -= 1

for _ in range(cnt):

ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)

print(*ans)

So, what's happening here?

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a

- For each element in a, add i + 1 to it, where i is the 0-based index.

Wait, in the problem, it's a[i] + i, with i being 1-based.

So, in code, a[i] += i + 1, which seems correct.

Then, it creates a Counter of a, which counts the frequency of each value.

Then, it creates a set from a, converts it to a list, and sorts it in reverse order.

So, a becomes a list of unique values, sorted descending.

Then, cnt is set to n - len(a), which is the number of duplicates in the original a.

Then, it initializes an empty list ans.

Then, it iterates over the sorted unique values:

For each value a[i], if i > 0, it calculates adv = min(a[i-1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i-1]])

Then, it appends adv numbers to ans, starting from a[i-1] -1, decrementing by 1 each time.

Then, subtracts adv from cnt and from counter[a[i-1]]

Then, appends a[i] to ans and decrements counter[a[i]] by 1.

Finally, if there are still some cnt left, it appends cnt numbers, each being ans[-1] -1.

Then, it prints the ans list.

This seems... complicated. I need to understand what it's doing.

Wait, in the problem, we have to perform n operations, each time selecting an index, inserting a[i] + i into S, and deleting a[i].

But in the code, it's adding i +1 to each a[i] upfront, which seems like it's calculating a[i] + i for each element.

But in the problem, i changes at each step based on the current array.

So, I'm not sure if this approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to precompute all possible a[i] + i values and then figure out which ones to include in S to maximize b.

But it needs to account for the fact that some a[i] + i might be the same, and sets don't allow duplicates.

Also, the way indices change after deletion complicates things.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider all possible a[i] + i values, considering the original array.

But since indices change after each deletion, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this as selecting a permutation of the elements, and calculating a[i] + pos, where pos is the position in the permutation.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be trying to collect all a[i] + i values, sort them, and then fill in the ans list accordingly.

But I need to verify if this approach indeed maximizes b lexicographically.

Looking at the first sample input:

n=2, a=[2,1]

After adding i+1:

a[0] += 1 => 2 +1 =3

a[1] +=2 =>1 +2=3

So, a becomes [3,3]

Counter: {3:2}

Set of a: [3], sorted descending: [3]

cnt = 2 -1 =1

Then, loop over a:

i=0:

since i>0 is False, skip the if clause.

append a[0]=3 to ans.

counter[3] -=1 => counter[3]=1

Then, for _ in range(cnt=1):

append ans[-1]-1 =3-1=2 to ans.

So, ans=[3,2], which matches the sample output.

Seems correct for this case.

Another sample:

n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=1+1=2

a[1]+2=100+2=102

a[2]+3=1000+3=1003

a[3]+4=1000000+4=1000004

a[4]+5=1000000000+5=1000000005

Counter: {2:1,102:1,1003:1,1000004:1,1000000005:1}

Set a: [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], sorted descending.

cnt =5-5=0

Loop over a:

i=0:

i>0 False, append 1000000005, counter[1000000005]-=1

i=1:

i>0 True:

adv = min(1000004 -1000000005 -1, 0, 1) = min(-999999998,0,1) = -999999998 => 0

So, no append, cnt remains 0

append 1000004, counter[1000004]-=1

i=2:

adv = min(1003 -1000004 -1,0,1)=min(-999998,0,1)= -999998 =>0

append 1003, counter[1003]-=1

i=3:

adv = min(102 -1003 -1,0,1)=min(-902,0,1)=-902=>0

append 102, counter[102]-=1

i=4:

adv = min(2 -102 -1,0,1)=min(-101,0,1)=-101=>0

append 2, counter[2]-=1

Then, cnt=0, so no more appends.

ans=[1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Another sample:

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=6+1=7

a[1]+2=4+2=6

a[2]+3=8+3=11

Counter: {7:1,6:1,11:1}

Set a: [11,7,6], sorted descending.

cnt=3-3=0

Loop over a:

i=0:

i>0 False, append 11, counter[11]-=1

i=1:

adv = min(7 -11 -1,0,1)=min(-5,0,1)=-5=>0

append 7, counter[7]-=1

i=2:

adv = min(6 -7 -1,0,1)=min(-2,0,1)=-2=>0

append 6, counter[6]-=1

cnt=0, no more appends.

ans=[11,7,6], matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

But is this always optimal?

Let me think of a case where this might not be optimal.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,2,3]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=1+1=2

a[1]+2=2+2=4

a[2]+3=3+3=6

Counter: {2:1,4:1,6:1}

Set a: [6,4,2], sorted descending.

cnt=3-3=0

Loop over a:

i=0:

append 6

i=1:

adv = min(4-6-1= -3,0,1)= -3 =>0

append 4

i=2:

adv = min(2-4-1=-3,0,1)= -3 =>0

append 2

ans=[6,4,2]

Is this the best possible?

Alternative approach:

If I choose i=1 first, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [2,3]

Then choose i=2, insert 3+2=5, delete a[2], a becomes [2]

Then choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,5,3}, sorted descending: [5,3,2], which is better than [6,4,2]

Wait, according to the code, it would produce [6,4,2], but another approach gives [5,3,2], which is better because 5 > 3 >2 vs 6 >4 >2, and 5 >4.

Wait, but according to the code's approach, it's sorting the unique a[i]+i values descending and taking them as is, but in this case, choosing different orders can lead to different S sets.

So, in this case, the code would output [6,4,2], but choosing a different sequence gives [5,3,2], which is lexicographically larger than [6,4,2], because 5 >3 >2 is better than 6>4>2 at the first position.

Wait, but according to the problem, the code's output is [6,4,2], but in reality, choosing differently can give [5,3,2], which is better.

So, is the code incorrect?

Wait, but according to the problem statement, we need to choose the sequence of operations to maximize b.

In this case, choosing i=1 first gives S={2,5,3}, b=[5,3,2]

Choosing i=3 first gives S={6,4,2}, b=[6,4,2]

But [5,3,2] is lexicographically larger than [6,4,2] because 5 >6.

Wait, no, 5 >6 is false, 5 <6.

So, [6,4,2] is better than [5,3,2], because 6 >5.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought [5,3,2] was better, but that's not correct.

Because 6 >5, so [6,4,2] is better than [5,3,2].

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, choosing i=1 first gives S={2,5,3}, b=[5,3,2], and choosing i=3 first gives S={6,4,2}, b=[6,4,2], and [6,4,2] is better than [5,3,2] because 6 >5.

So, my earlier thought was wrong; [6,4,2] is indeed better.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, a=[3,2,1]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=3+1=4

a[1]+2=2+2=4

a[2]+3=1+3=4

Counter: {4:3}

Set a: [4], sorted descending.

cnt=3-1=2

Loop over a:

i=0:

append 4

adv = N/A

Then, append 4-1=3, cnt=1

append 3-1=2, cnt=0

So, ans=[4,3,2]

Alternative approach:

Choose i=1, insert 3+1=4, delete a[1], a=[2,1]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={4,3,2}, b=[4,3,2], same as code's output.

Another approach:

Choose i=3, insert 1+3=4, delete a[3], a=[3,2]

Choose i=2, insert 2+2=4, delete a[2], a=[3]

Choose i=1, insert 3+1=4, delete a[1], a=[]

S={4}, b=[4], which is worse than [4,3,2]

So, the code's approach seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[1,2,2,1]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=1+1=2

a[1]+2=2+2=4

a[2]+3=2+3=5

a[3]+4=1+4=5

Counter: {2:1,4:1,5:2}

Set a: [5,4,2], sorted descending.

cnt=4-3=1

Loop over a:

i=0:

append 5

i=1:

adv = min(4-5-1=-2,1,1)= -2 =>0

append 4

i=2:

adv = min(2-4-1=-3,1,1)= -3 =>0

append 2

Then, cnt=1, append 2-1=1

So, ans=[5,4,2,1]

Is this the best possible?

Alternative approach:

Choose i=4, insert 1+4=5, delete a[4], a=[1,2,2]

Choose i=3, insert 2+3=5, delete a[3], a=[1,2]

Choose i=2, insert 2+2=4, delete a[2], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,4,2}, b=[5,4,2], which is worse than [5,4,2,1]

Wait, but [5,4,2,1] is longer, but all elements are larger or equal to [5,4,2].

But since they are sorted descending, adding smaller elements at the end doesn't make it larger lexicographically.

So, [5,4,2,1] is not better than [5,4,2], because [5,4,2] is longer with no smaller elements.

Wait, but according to the definition, p is lexicographically larger than q if:

- q is a prefix of p, but p != q; or

- in the first position where p and q differ, p has a larger element.

So, [5,4,2,1] vs [5,4,2], [5,4,2] is a prefix of [5,4,2,1], but [5,4,2,1] != [5,4,2], so [5,4,2,1] is lexicographically larger.

But according to the code, it's producing [5,4,2,1], which is correct.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=1+1=2

a[1]+2=2+2=4

a[2]+3=3+3=6

a[3]+4=4+4=8

Counter: {2:1,4:1,6:1,8:1}

Set a: [8,6,4,2], sorted descending.

cnt=4-4=0

Loop over a:

append 8

append 6

append 4

append 2

ans=[8,6,4,2]

Alternative approach:

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[2,3,4]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[3,4]

Choose i=1, insert 3+1=4, delete a[1], a=[4]

Choose i=1, insert 4+1=5, delete a[1], a=[]

S={2,3,4,5}, b=[5,4,3,2], which is [5,4,3,2] vs [8,6,4,2]

Comparing [8,6,4,2] and [5,4,3,2], since 8 >5, [8,6,4,2] is better.

So, the code's approach seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[4,3,2,1]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=4+1=5

a[1]+2=3+2=5

a[2]+3=2+3=5

a[3]+4=1+4=5

Counter: {5:4}

Set a: [5], sorted descending.

cnt=4-1=3

Loop over a:

append 5

Then, append 5-1=4

append 4-1=3

append 3-1=2

ans=[5,4,3,2]

Alternative approach:

Choose i=1, insert 4+1=5, delete a[1], a=[3,2,1]

Choose i=1, insert 3+1=4, delete a[1], a=[2,1]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,4,3,2}, b=[5,4,3,2], same as code's output.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=1+1=2

a[1]+2=1+2=3

a[2]+3=1+3=4

Counter: {2:1,3:1,4:1}

Set a: [4,3,2], sorted descending.

cnt=3-3=0

Loop over a:

append 4

append 3

append 2

ans=[4,3,2]

Alternative approach:

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[1,1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={2}, b=[2], which is worse than [4,3,2]

So, the code's approach seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[2,2,2,2]

After adding i+1:

a[0]+1=2+1=3

a[1]+2=2+2=4

a[2]+3=2+3=5

a[3]+4=2+4=6

Counter: {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

Set a: [6,5,4,3], sorted descending.

cnt=4-4=0

Loop over a:

append 6

append 5

append 4

append 3

ans=[6,5,4,3]

Alternative approach:

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[2,2,2]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[2,2]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[2]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[]

S={3}, b=[3], which is worse than [6,5,4,3]

So, again, the code's approach seems correct.

Wait, but in one of the earlier test cases, n=4, a=[1,2,2,1], the code produced [8,6,4,2], which was better than [5,4,3,2].

Wait, no, in that case, a=[1,2,2,1], after adding i+1:

a[0]+1=2

a[1]+2=4

a[2]+3=5

a[3]+4=5

Counter: {2:1,4:1,5:2}

Set a: [5,4,2], sorted descending.

cnt=4-3=1

Loop over a:

append 5

append 4

append 2

then, append 2-1=1

ans=[5,4,2,1]

But in reality, choosing differently can give S={5,4,3,2}, which is better than [5,4,2,1].

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, in that case, choosing i=4, insert 1+4=5, delete a[4], a=[1,2,2]

Choose i=3, insert 2+3=5, delete a[3], a=[1,2]

Choose i=2, insert 2+2=4, delete a[2], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,4,2}, b=[5,4,2]

But in another approach, choosing i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[2,2,1]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[2,1]

Choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={2,3}, b=[3,2]

Wait, this seems worse.

Wait, earlier I thought choosing differently could give S={5,4,3,2}, but I'm not sure how that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me think again.

In n=4, a=[1,2,2,1]

Option 1:

Choose i=1 (1-based), insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [2,2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, delete a[1], a becomes [2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, delete a[1], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes []

S={2,3}, b=[3,2]

Option 2:

Choose i=4, insert a[4]+4=1+4=5, delete a[4], a=[1,2,2]

Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=2+3=5, delete a[3], a=[1,2]

Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, delete a[2], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,4,2}, b=[5,4,2], which is better than [3,2]

Option 3:

Choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, delete a[2], a=[1,2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={4,2,3}, b=[4,3,2]

Option 4:

Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=2+3=5, delete a[3], a=[1,2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[2,1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[1]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,2,3}, b=[5,3,2]

Option 5:

Choose i=4, insert a[4]+4=1+4=5, delete a[4], a=[1,2,2]

Choose i=2, insert a[2]+3=2+3=5, delete a[2], a=[1,2]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, delete a[1], a=[2]

Choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=2+1=3, delete a[1], a=[]

S={5,2,3}, b=[5,3,2]

So, the best possible is [5,4,2], which is what the code produces.

Wait, but in one of my earlier thoughts, I thought choosing differently could give [5,4,3,2], but now I see that's not possible because 3 is not a possible value in S.

Wait, how is 3 obtained?

Wait, in the operation, when I choose i=1 in the first step, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [2,2,1]

Then choose i=1 again, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a becomes [2,1]

Then choose i=1 again, insert 2+1=3, delete a[1], a becomes [1]

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes []

So, S={2,3}, because 3 is inserted twice but only one 3 is in S.

So, b=[3,2]

But [5,4,2] is better than [3,2], as per earlier.

Hence, the code's approach seems correct.

So, in conclusion, the code seems to be correct.
