Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. My job is to calculate the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed to have a positive area. Okay, that sounds manageable.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and the first line tells me how many test cases there are. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers: the x and y coordinates of each corner of the square.

My task is to compute the area of the square for each test case and print it out.

Looking at the example, it seems straightforward. For each test case, I'm supposed to calculate the area and output it. But I need to make sure that my approach is correct.

Now, since the square has sides parallel to the axes, that means the sides are either horizontal or vertical. So, the coordinates should reflect that. For example, in the first test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

These points form a square with side length 3, hence the area is 9.

In the second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

This forms a square with side length 2, so area is 4.

And the third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Here, the side length seems to be 22 (since 39 - 17 = 22), so the area should be 484. Wait, but in the example output, it's 784. Hmm, that doesn't match. Let me check again.

Wait, 45 - 17 = 28, and 39 - 11 = 28, so side length is 28, area is 784. Okay, got it wrong there. My mistake.

So, the approach should be to identify the side length of the square and then compute the area by squaring the side length.

But the points are given in a random order, so I need a way to determine the side length regardless of the order of the points.

One way to do this is to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the unique distances. In a square, there should be two unique distances: the side length and the diagonal length.

But since the squares have sides parallel to the axes, the side lengths will have either the same x or the same y coordinate between the points.

Wait, actually, since the sides are parallel to the axes, it's even simpler. The side lengths can be determined by the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, depending on whether the side is horizontal or vertical.

So, for example, if two points have the same y-coordinate but different x-coordinates, the difference in x will give the side length.

Similarly, if two points have the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates, the difference in y will give the side length.

Given that, I can look for pairs of points that share an x or y coordinate and calculate the differences.

But since the points are given in a random order, I need to make sure I correctly identify which pairs to consider.

Wait, actually, since all sides are parallel to the axes, all sides will either be horizontal or vertical, and the diagonals will run from one corner to the opposite corner, following the axes.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal bounding box that contains all four points. Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the bounding box should coincide with the square itself.

So, I can find the minimal and maximal x and y coordinates from the four points, and the differences between them should give me the side length.

Let me try that with the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Minimal x: 1

Maximal x: 4

Minimal y: 2

Maximal y: 5

Side length: 4 - 1 = 3 (or 5 - 2 = 3)

Area: 3 * 3 = 9, which matches the example.

Second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Minimal x: -1

Maximal x: 1

Minimal y: -1

Maximal y: 1

Side length: 1 - (-1) = 2

Area: 2 * 2 = 4, matches the example.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Minimal x: 17

Maximal x: 45

Minimal y: 11

Maximal y: 39

Side length: 45 - 17 = 28

Area: 28 * 28 = 784, matches the example.

Okay, this seems to be a consistent and correct approach.

So, in code, I need to read the four points for each test case, find the minimal and maximal x and y values, compute the differences, and square that to get the area.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The function `func` is defined to handle the test cases.

It reads the number of test cases `t`.

Then, for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates: (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h).

Then, it calculates two distances squared:

n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2

x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2

And then prints the smaller one between n and x.

Wait, that seems problematic.

First, it's calculating the squared distances between two pairs of points, but it's not guaranteed that these pairs correspond to sides of the square.

Given that the points are provided in a random order, picking arbitrary pairs may not give me the side lengths.

In fact, in the first test case, if I pick (1,2) and (1,5), that's a vertical side with length 3.

And (4,5) and (4,2), another vertical side with length 3.

Or (1,2) and (4,2), a horizontal side with length 3.

But the code is picking (a,e) and (c,g), which may or may not correspond to side lengths.

This seems error-prone and not reliable.

Moreover, in the third test case, if I pick (45,11) and (17,11), difference is 28, which is correct.

But if I pick (45,11) and (45,39), difference is 28 in y, which is also correct.

But squaring these differences and comparing doesn't make sense for finding the area.

Wait, actually, in a square, all sides are equal, so any side length should give the same area.

But the code is comparing two arbitrary distances and printing the smaller one.

This seems incorrect because it's not guaranteed that the smaller one corresponds to the side length.

In fact, in a square, the side length should be the same for all sides, and the diagonal should be longer.

But since the problem guarantees that the four points form a square with positive area and sides parallel to the axes, I can safely assume that the minimal and maximal x and y differences will give me the side length.

Therefore, the provided program's approach is flawed.

A better approach would be to find the minimal and maximal x and y coordinates among the four points, compute the differences, and square that to get the area.

Let me try to implement that.

For each test case:

Read four pairs of coordinates.

Find min_x = min(a, c, e, g)

Find max_x = max(a, c, e, g)

Find min_y = min(b, d, f, h)

Find max_y = max(b, d, f, h)

Side length = max_x - min_x (or max_y - min_y, should be the same)

Area = side_length ^ 2

Print area

This seems straightforward and reliable.

Let me check with the third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

min_x = 17

max_x = 45

min_y = 11

max_y = 39

side_length = 45 - 17 = 28

area = 28 * 28 = 784, which matches the example.

Similarly, for the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

min_x = 1

max_x = 4

min_y = 2

max_y = 5

side_length = 4 - 1 = 3

area = 9, matches the example.

Second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

min_x = -1

max_x = 1

min_y = -1

max_y = 1

side_length = 1 - (-1) = 2

area = 4, matches the example.

So, this approach works correctly for all the provided test cases.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it calculates two squared distances and prints the smaller one.

In the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Let's assign:

(a,b) = (1,2)

(c,d) = (4,5)

(e,f) = (1,5)

(g,h) = (4,2)

Then,

n = (1 - 1)^2 + (2 - 5)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

x = (4 - 4)^2 + (5 - 2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

So, it prints 9, which is correct.

In the second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Assign:

(a,b) = (-1,1)

(c,d) = (1,-1)

(e,f) = (1,1)

(g,h) = (-1,-1)

Then,

n = (-1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

x = (1 - (-1))^2 + (-1 - (-1))^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

So, it prints 4, which is correct.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Assign:

(a,b) = (45,11)

(c,d) = (45,39)

(e,f) = (17,11)

(g,h) = (17,39)

Then,

n = (45 - 17)^2 + (11 - 11)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

x = (45 - 17)^2 + (39 - 39)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

So, it prints 784, which is correct.

Wait, in this case, it happens to work because both n and x are equal to the squared side length.

But this might be a coincidence based on how the points are assigned.

Let me try assigning the points differently.

Suppose for the first test case:

(a,b) = (1,2)

(c,d) = (1,5)

(e,f) = (4,2)

(g,h) = (4,5)

Then,

n = (1 - 4)^2 + (2 - 2)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

x = (1 - 4)^2 + (5 - 5)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

Again, prints 9, which is correct.

But what if I assign points such that n and x are not both side lengths.

For example:

Assign:

(a,b) = (1,2)

(c,d) = (4,5)

(e,f) = (4,2)

(g,h) = (1,5)

Then,

n = (1 - 4)^2 + (2 - 2)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

x = (4 - 1)^2 + (5 - 5)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

Still correct.

Wait, in all these assignments, n and x are coming out to be the side length squared.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider a different assignment.

Assign:

(a,b) = (1,2)

(c,d) = (1,5)

(e,f) = (4,5)

(g,h) = (4,2)

Then,

n = (1 - 4)^2 + (2 - 5)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18

x = (1 - 4)^2 + (5 - 2)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18

So, it would print 18, which is the squared distance between two diagonally opposite points, which is not the side length squared. Wait, but in the provided program, it prints the smaller one between n and x, but in this case, both are 18, which is actually the squared diagonal length, not the side length squared.

Wait, but in the earlier assignments, it happened to print the side length squared, but in this assignment, it would print the squared diagonal length, which is not correct.

Wait, but according to the provided program, it prints the smaller one between n and x.

But in this case, both n and x are 18, so it would print 18.

But in the first test case, the side length squared is 9, not 18.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the provided program.

Looking back, the provided program calculates n and x as squared distances between two pairs of points, then prints the smaller one.

But in the first test case, it happened to get 9, which is correct, but in this different assignment, it gets 18, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program's logic is flawed because it depends on the assignment of points to variables, which is arbitrary.

Hence, it's not a reliable method to calculate the area.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final Verdict**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
