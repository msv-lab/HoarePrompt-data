Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game played by Alice and Bob on an array of integers. The array is of size n, and they take turns playing, with Alice starting first. The game ends when the array is empty, and the score is defined as the MEX of the array c that Alice builds.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for Minimum EXcludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 1] is 2 because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

Let me try to grasp the game mechanics:

- Alice's turn: She picks an element from the array a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a.

- Bob's turn: He picks an element from the array a and deletes it from a.

The game alternates between them until the array a is empty.

I need to find the final MEX of c when both play optimally.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's analyze the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

Possible game play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

2. Bob picks 0, a = [0, 1]

3. Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [1]

4. Bob picks 1, a = []

MEX of c = [1, 0] is 2.

Is this the optimal play? Let's see if Alice can force a higher MEX.

Another possible play:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0, 1, 1]

2. Bob picks 1, a = [0, 1]

3. Alice picks 1, c = [0, 1], a = [0]

4. Bob picks 0, a = []

MEX of c = [0, 1] is 2 again.

Seems like regardless of the choices, MEX is 2.

Second test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Possible play:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1, 2, 3]

2. Bob picks 1, a = [2, 3]

3. Alice picks 2, c = [0, 2], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a = []

MEX of c = [0, 2] is 1.

Is this the optimal? Let's see:

Another play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 2, 3]

2. Bob picks 0, a = [2, 3]

3. Alice picks 2, c = [1, 2], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a = []

MEX of c = [1, 2] is 0.

Bob managed to make MEX 0.

But in the first play, MEX is 1.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she would choose the first play to make MEX 1.

So, the output is 1.

Third test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 1]

Possible play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

2. Bob picks 1, a = []

MEX of c = [1] is 0.

Is this the only possible outcome? Yes, because Alice has to pick 1, and Bob picks the remaining 1.

So, MEX is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the MEX depends on which elements Alice can pick to ensure certain numbers are in c.

I need to find a general strategy for Alice to maximize MEX and Bob to minimize it.

Let me think about how MEX is determined.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in c.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many small integers in c as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to prevent Alice from having certain numbers in c to minimize MEX.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the array a.

Let's count how many times each number from 0 to n appears in a.

I'll create a frequency array freq where freq[i] is the count of i in a.

Since a contains numbers from 0 to n-1, but MEX can be up to n (if n is not in a), I should consider freq of size n+1.

Wait, in the problem, a_i can be from 0 to n-1, so MEX can be from 0 to n.

Hence, freq should be of size n+1.

Now, Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from a, but Alice also adds her chosen elements to c.

The total number of turns is n, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting first.

So, Alice gets to choose floor((n+1)/2) elements for c.

Bob gets to choose ceil(n/2) elements to remove.

Wait, no.

Actually, since Alice starts, and they alternate, the number of turns for Alice and Bob depends on whether n is even or odd.

If n is even:

- Alice chooses n/2 elements for c.

- Bob chooses n/2 elements to remove.

If n is odd:

- Alice chooses (n+1)/2 elements for c.

- Bob chooses (n-1)/2 elements to remove.

Wait, no.

Wait, total turns are n.

Alice goes first, so:

- If n is even, Alice and Bob each get n/2 turns.

- If n is odd, Alice gets (n+1)/2 turns, Bob gets (n-1)/2 turns.

But in this game, Alice chooses an element and adds it to c in her turn.

Bob just removes an element in his turn.

So, the number of elements in c is equal to the number of times Alice plays, which is ceil(n/2).

Wait, no.

In each game, Alice plays floor((n+1)/2) times, and Bob plays floor(n/2) times.

Wait, more carefully:

- Total turns: n.

- Alice starts.

- If n is even:

- Alice plays n/2 times.

- Bob plays n/2 times.

- If n is odd:

- Alice plays (n+1)/2 times.

- Bob plays (n-1)/2 times.

But in terms of selecting elements for c, only Alice adds elements to c, based on her turns.

So, the size of c is equal to the number of times Alice plays, which is ceil(n/2).

Wait, in programming terms:

- If n is even, Alice plays n/2 times.

- If n is odd, Alice plays (n+1)/2 times.

So, size of c is ceil(n/2).

But I need to think about which elements end up in c, considering both players play optimally.

Alice wants to maximize MEX of c, so she wants to include as many small integers as possible in c.

Bob wants to minimize MEX of c, so he wants to prevent Alice from including small integers in c.

Let me think in terms of available choices at each step.

At each turn, Alice chooses an element to add to c and remove from a.

Bob chooses an element to remove from a.

They alternate, with Alice starting.

The game ends when a is empty.

I need to find the MEX of c at the end, given both play optimally.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players have conflicting objectives.

I need to find the optimal strategy for both.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think in terms of the frequency of each number.

Let me consider the frequency of each number from 0 to n in a.

If a number has a frequency of 0, it's not in a, so it will be the MEX.

If a number has a frequency of 1, Alice can pick it once, and Bob can't remove it from c.

If a number has a frequency of 2, Alice can pick it twice, but Bob can interfere.

Wait, Bob can remove elements, but Alice is the one adding to c.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose which elements to add to c, and Bob can choose which elements to remove from a, but only Alice adds to c.

So, Bob can try to remove elements that Alice wants to add to c.

Wait, but once Alice picks an element and adds it to c, it's removed from a, so Bob can't remove it again.

Wait, no, after Alice adds it to c and removes it from a, Bob can remove other elements from a.

Wait, the problem says:

- Alice picks an element from a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a.

- Bob picks an element from a, deletes it from a.

So, in Alice's turn: choose an element from a, add to c, remove from a.

In Bob's turn: choose an element from a, remove from a.

So, elements once added to c stay in c.

Elements removed by Bob are permanently removed and don't go to c.

So, the final c is built only by Alice's choices.

The MEX is determined by c at the end.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants c to have as many small numbers as possible.

Wait, no, actually, to maximize MEX, Alice wants c to have as many small numbers as possible, but MEX is the smallest missing number.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small numbers in c as possible, in order: 0,1,2,3,...

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

So, Bob will try to force Alice to pick larger numbers or duplicate numbers.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements from a, not directly affect what Alice picks.

But by removing certain elements, Bob can influence Alice's choices.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array a in ascending order.

Then, try to see which numbers from 0 to n can be included in c by Alice.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the frequency of each number.

Let me count the frequency of each number from 0 to n in a.

freq = [0] * (n+1)

for num in a:

freq[num] += 1

Now, Alice and Bob will play n turns.

Alice starts.

In each turn:

- Alice picks an element from a, adds to c, removes from a.

- Bob picks an element from a, removes from a.

This continues until a is empty.

I need to determine which elements end up in c.

Alice wants to maximize MEX of c, which is counterintuitive.

Wait, no.

Wait, to maximize MEX, Alice wants c to have as many small numbers as possible, so that the smallest missing number is as large as possible.

Wait, actually, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many small numbers in c as possible, but since MEX is the smallest missing number, having more small numbers would potentially allow larger numbers to be missing, thus increasing MEX.

Wait, it's a bit confusing.

Let me think.

If c contains all numbers from 0 to k-1, and k is not in c, then MEX is k.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small numbers in c as possible, up to a point where some larger number is missing.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain small numbers in c.

Given that, I need to see, for each number from 0 to n, whether Alice can include it in c or not, considering Bob's interference.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the frequency of each number.

If a number appears only once in a, and Alice picks it, it goes to c.

If it appears twice, Alice can pick one, and Bob can pick the other, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many times each number can be forced into c.

Let me consider that.

For each number i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] is 0, it's not in a, so it's not possible to have it in c. So, it will be the MEX.

- If freq[i] is 1, Alice can pick it once, and it goes to c.

- If freq[i] is 2, Alice can pick one, and Bob can pick the other, or vice versa.

Wait, more carefully:

- If freq[i] is 0, MEX is i.

- If freq[i] is 1, Alice can pick it and add to c.

- If freq[i] is 2, Alice can pick one, Bob can pick the other, so only one goes to c.

- If freq[i] is 3, Alice can pick two, Bob picks one, so two go to c.

Wait, perhaps in general, for freq[i]:

- If freq[i] is even, Alice can get freq[i]/2 instances into c.

- If freq[i] is odd, Alice can get (freq[i]/2) + 1 instances into c.

But, since we are dealing with MEX, which is about the presence of numbers, not their counts, perhaps the count doesn't matter beyond whether it's possible to include at least one in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of whether Alice can include at least one of each number i in c.

For each i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c, unless Bob prevents it.

But Bob can prevent Alice from including it by removing it.

Wait, no, Bob can only remove elements from a, but Alice chooses first.

Wait, more carefully:

- In each turn:

- Alice picks an element from a, adds it to c, removes it from a.

- Bob then picks an element from a and removes it.

So, Alice can choose to pick a specific element to add to c.

Bob can choose to remove any remaining element from a.

So, Bob can't directly prevent Alice from adding a specific element to c, but he can remove elements that Alice might want to add.

But once Alice picks and adds an element to c, it's removed from a, so Bob can't remove it again.

So, Bob can only remove elements that are still in a after Alice's pick.

Given that, perhaps the number of times a number appears in a determines how many can be included in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the floor of freq[i]/2 + 1.

Wait, in terms of the number of times Alice can include it in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the game as a selection process where Alice tries to include elements in c, and Bob tries to block her.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a pattern or a greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the numbers in a in ascending order.

Then, Alice can try to pick the smallest available number each time.

Bob can try to block her by removing numbers she might need.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and check if it's possible for Alice to include it in c.

For each i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can pick it and include it in c, provided that Bob doesn't remove it before Alice can pick it.

But Bob can only remove elements after Alice picks and removes one.

Wait, since Alice picks first and removes the element, Bob can only remove from the remaining elements.

So, if freq[i] >=1, Alice can always pick it and include it in c, unless Bob removes it before Alice's turn.

But Alice picks first in each turn, so she can prioritize picking the numbers that are important for MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of available moves Alice has to pick certain numbers.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me consider that Alice has ceil(n/2) turns to pick elements for c.

Bob has floor(n/2) turns to remove elements from a.

Alice wants to include as many small numbers in c as possible.

Bob wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

So, for each number i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can try to include it in c.

- Bob can try to reduce freq[i] to make it harder for Alice.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements from a, not specifically target what Alice picks.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimum number of times Alice can include a number in c.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times a number appears and the number of moves Alice has.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the possible MEX values.

Start with MEX=0:

- If 0 is not in c, MEX=0.

- Else, check for 1, and so on.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she wants to have as many small numbers in c as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

Given that, perhaps I can consider for each number i from 0 to n:

- Check if Alice can include it in c.

- If she can, include it.

- If not, then MEX is i.

But I need a way to determine if Alice can include i in c.

Let me consider the frequency of i.

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c, because she can pick it in her turn.

- Bob can try to reduce freq[i] by picking it, but Alice picks first.

Wait, no.

Bob can only remove elements from a after Alice picks and removes one.

So, if freq[i] >=1, Alice can pick it in her turn and include it in c.

Bob cannot prevent her from doing so, because Alice picks first.

Wait, but Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to pick in future turns.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times a number appears and the number of turns Alice has.

Let me consider that Alice has ceil(n/2) turns to pick elements for c.

She needs to pick as many small numbers as possible.

So, she should pick the smallest available number in each turn.

Bob, to minimize MEX, should try to force Alice to pick larger numbers.

Bob can do this by removing small numbers that are not critical for Alice.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements from a, not directly affect what Alice picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the remaining elements.

Let me try to simulate the process.

Start with a list of elements.

Alice picks the smallest available number and adds it to c.

Bob then picks a number to remove, possibly trying to disrupt Alice's strategy.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need a better approach.

Let me look at the frequency of each number.

For each number i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c, because she can pick it in her turn.

- Bob cannot prevent Alice from picking it, because Alice picks first and can choose to pick it before Bob can remove it.

Wait, but Bob can remove elements after Alice picks, potentially removing other elements that Alice might need.

But in terms of including a specific i in c, if freq[i] >=1, Alice can pick it in her turn and include it in c.

So, for each i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c.

- Else, i is not in a, so MEX is i.

But this seems too simplistic and probably incorrect.

Wait, in the first test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

freq=[2,2,0,0]

So, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, freq[2]=0, freq[3]=0

According to above, MEX would be 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

freq=[1,1,1,1]

So, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

According to above, MEX would be 4, but in the example, it's 1.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Hence, there must be something wrong with that approach.

In the second test case, MEX is 1, but according to frequency, all numbers from 0 to 3 are present once.

But in the example, MEX is 1, not 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can only include ceil(n/2) elements in c.

In the second test case, n=4, ceil(4/2)=2.

So, c can have at most 2 elements.

Alice wants to include 0 and 1, but Bob can prevent that.

Wait, how?

In the explanation, they showed a play where c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Another play where c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, Alice can choose to have c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Bob can force c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she会选择 MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, in this case, even though all numbers from 0 to 3 are present once, Alice can only include two of them in c.

Hence, the MEX is 1.

Wait, but according to frequency, all numbers are present once.

So, Alice can include any two numbers in c.

To maximize MEX, she should include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the example, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Another possible c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Wait, but in the explanation, they showed c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But Alice can choose to have c=[0,1], MEX=2.

So, why is the output 1?

Wait, in the explanation, they showed c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But it's possible to have c=[0,1], MEX=2.

So, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from having both 0 and 1.

Wait, how?

Let's simulate:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Turn 1: Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Turn 2: Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

Turn 3: Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Turn 4: Bob picks 3, a=[]

MEX of c=[0,2] is 1.

Alternatively:

Turn 1: Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

Turn 2: Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

Turn 3: Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

Turn 4: Bob picks 3, a=[]

MEX of c=[1,2] is 0.

So, in both cases, MEX is 1 and 0.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she would choose the play where MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Another possible play:

Turn 1: Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

Turn 2: Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

Turn 3: Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

Turn 4: Bob picks 3, a=[]

MEX of c=[2,1] is 0.

Or:

Turn 1: Alice picks 3, c=[3], a=[0,1,2]

Turn 2: Bob picks 0, a=[1,2]

Turn 3: Alice picks 1, c=[3,1], a=[2]

Turn 4: Bob picks 2, a=[]

MEX of c=[3,1] is 0.

So, the best Alice can do is MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, in this case, Alice can't include both 0 and 1 in c because Bob can prevent it by removing one of them.

Wait, but in one of the plays, c=[0,2], which includes 0 but not 1.

So, Bob can force it to be MEX=1 by removing 1.

Hence, the MEX is 1.

So, perhaps the strategy is that Alice can include ceil(n/2) smallest numbers, considering Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the array and see which elements Alice can include.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of each number and determine how many times Alice can include them in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and check if Alice can include that number in c.

For each number i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c, provided that she has a turn left to pick it.

- But she has ceil(n/2) turns.

So, she can include up to ceil(n/2) numbers in c.

Hence, she needs to choose the smallest possible numbers to maximize MEX.

So, she should try to include the smallest numbers available.

Bob, on the other hand, will try to prevent her from including the smallest numbers.

Hence, the MEX will be the smallest number that Alice cannot include in c.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate the number of smallest numbers Alice can include.

Let me sort the numbers from 0 to n based on their frequency.

Then, iterate through them and see how many Alice can include in c.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, and Alice has a turn left, she can include it in c.

- Otherwise, MEX is i.

But in the second test case, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

Alice has ceil(4/2)=2 turns.

So, she can include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But in the example, it's 1.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice wants.

Wait, more carefully.

Alice has ceil(n/2) turns to pick elements for c.

Bob has floor(n/2) turns to remove elements from a.

Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

Hence, for each small number, Bob can try to remove it before Alice can pick it.

But Alice picks first, so she can prioritize picking the smallest available number.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of available copies of each number.

Wait, in the second test case, Alice can include any two numbers in c.

To maximize MEX, she should include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But according to the example, it's 1.

Hence, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is determined by the final c, and Bob can influence which elements are in c.

In the second test case, Bob can force c to be [0,2], MEX=1, or [1,2], MEX=0.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she会选择 [0,2], MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Hence, in cases where Alice can't include all the smallest numbers due to Bob's interference, the MEX is the smallest number she can't include.

Hence, perhaps I need to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and count how many of them Alice can include in c.

The MEX will be the first number that Alice can't include.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, and she should prioritize including the smallest numbers.

Hence, for each i from 0 to n:

- If freq[i] >=1, and Alice has a turn left, she includes it in c.

- Otherwise, MEX is i.

But in the second test case, with n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

So, Alice can include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But the example shows MEX=1.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice wants.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each number i, the number of times Alice can include it in c is ceil(freq[i]/2).

Because:

- If freq[i] is odd, Alice can include (freq[i]+1)/2 in c.

- If freq[i] is even, Alice can include freq[i]/2 in c.

Wait, but in the second test case, freq[i]=1 for i=0,1,2,3.

Hence, ceil(1/2)=1 for each.

But Alice has ceil(4/2)=2 turns.

Hence, she can include two different numbers, say 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

But the example shows MEX=1.

Hence, this approach is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice wants.

Hence, for each number i, the number of times Alice can include it in c is freq[i] - floor(freq[i]/2).

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in game theory, such games can be analyzed using the concept of "Nimbers" or "grundy numbers", but that might be too complex for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of available choices Alice has for each number.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and keep track of the number of available turns Alice has left to pick them.

Initialize turns = ceil(n/2)

For i from 0 to n:

if freq[i] >=1 and turns >=1:

c includes i

turns -=1

else:

MEX = i

But in the second test case, this would make MEX=2, which contradicts the example.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the frequencies and see how many smallest numbers Alice can include.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of elements Alice can pick and see how many smallest numbers she can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and check if freq[i] >=1, and if Alice has a turn left to pick it.

If yes, include it in c and decrement turns.

Else, MEX is i.

But again, in the second test case, this would make MEX=2, which is not matching the example.

Hence, perhaps there is a mistake in understanding the game.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, and Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants.

Hence, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice is likely to pick, forcing her to pick other elements.

Hence, perhaps the correct approach is:

Initialize a list of available numbers from a.

Initialize c as empty.

Simulate the game:

While a is not empty:

Alice's turn:

Pick the smallest available number and add it to c, remove it from a.

Bob's turn:

Remove the smallest available number from a.

After the game, compute MEX of c.

But in the second test case, this would be:

a=[0,1,2,3]

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob removes 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob removes 3, a=[]

MEX of c=[0,2] is 1.

Hence, output is 1.

Alternatively:

a=[0,1,2,3]

Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

Bob removes 0, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

Bob removes 3, a=[]

MEX of c=[1,2] is 0.

Alice would choose the first option where MEX is 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

Sort the array a.

Initialize c as empty.

Simulate the game:

While a is not empty:

Alice's turn:

Pick the smallest available number and add it to c, remove it from a.

Bob's turn:

Remove the smallest available number from a.

After the game, compute MEX of c.

This seems to work for the second test case.

Let's try for the first test case:

a=[0,0,1,1]

Sort a=[0,0,1,1]

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[0,1,1]

Bob removes 0, a=[1,1]

Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[1]

Bob removes 1, a=[]

MEX of c=[0,1] is 2.

Hence, output is 2.

Third test case:

a=[1,1]

Sort a=[1,1]

Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[1]

Bob removes 1, a=[]

MEX of c=[1] is 0.

Hence, output is 0.

This matches the examples.

Hence, the strategy is:

- Sort the array a in ascending order.

- Simulate the game:

- While a is not empty:

- Alice picks the smallest available number and adds it to c, removes it from a.

- Bob removes the smallest available number from a.

- After the game, compute MEX of c.

This seems to work.

Hence, in code, I can sort a, then simulate the turns:

- Alice picks ceil(n/2) smallest numbers and adds them to c.

- Bob removes floor(n/2) smallest numbers from a.

Then, compute MEX of c.

Wait, but in the simulation, Alice picks the smallest available, and Bob removes the smallest available.

Hence, it's equivalent to Alice picking the smallest available in her turn, and Bob removing the next smallest available in his turn.

Hence, in code, I can sort a, then assign the first ceil(n/2) elements to c (since Alice picks first, she gets the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. elements), and Bob gets the remaining floor(n/2) elements.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

If n is even:

- Alice picks positions 1,3,5,...,n-1

- Bob picks positions 2,4,6,...,n

If n is odd:

- Alice picks positions 1,3,5,...,n

- Bob picks positions 2,4,6,...,n-1

Hence, in sorted a:

- Alice picks a[0], a[2], a[4],..., up to ceil(n/2) elements.

- Bob picks a[1], a[3], a[5],..., up to floor(n/2) elements.

Hence, c consists of a[0], a[2], a[4],...

Hence, in code, I can do:

sort a in ascending order.

c = [a[i] for i in range(0, n, 2)]

Then, compute MEX of c.

Let's verify with the second test case:

a=[0,1,2,3]

sorted a=[0,1,2,3]

c = [0,2]

MEX of c=[0,2] is 1.

Hence, output is 1.

First test case:

a=[0,0,1,1]

sorted a=[0,0,1,1]

c = [0,1]

MEX of c=[0,1] is 2.

Hence, output is 2.

Third test case:

a=[1,1]

sorted a=[1,1]

c = [1]

MEX of c=[1] is 0.

Hence, output is 0.

All match the examples.

Hence, the correct approach is:

- Sort the array a in ascending order.

- Build c by taking elements at even indices (0-based): a[0], a[2], a[4],...

- Compute MEX of c.

Hence, in code, I can sort a, build c by taking a[0], a[2],..., up to ceil(n/2) elements.

Then, find MEX of c.

To compute MEX of c:

- Initialize a set s = set(c)

- Iterate i from 0 to n:

- if i not in s:

- return i

Hence, the code should be:

for each test case:

read n

read a as list of integers

sort a

c = a[0:ceil(n/2):2]

# or more precisely, take elements at positions 0,2,4,...

# but in Python, a[0:ceil(n/2):2] might not be accurate.

Hence, better to iterate and collect elements at even indices.

But need to ensure that c has ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, no, in the simulation, c has elements at positions 0,2,4,... up to ceil(n/2) elements.

Hence, in code:

sorted_a = sorted(a)

c = []

for i in range(0, n, 2):

c.append(sorted_a[i])

# but need to ensure that c has ceil(n/2) elements.

But in Python, slicing a[0:n:2] will give elements at positions 0,2,4,... up to n-1.

Hence, len(c) = ceil(n/2)

Hence, c = sorted_a[0:n:2]

Then, find MEX of c.

Implement MEX as:

i = 0

while i in c:

i +=1

print(i)

Hence, the code should work.

Looking back at the given code:

def func_1(arr):

freq = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in arr:

freq[i] += 1

cou = 0

for i in range(n + 1):

if freq[i] >= 2:

continue

if freq[i] == 1:

cou += 1

if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:

print(i)

break

This seems incorrect.

In the second test case, freq=[1,1,1,1]

So, iterate i from 0 to 4:

i=0: freq[0]=1 ==1, cou=1

cou !=2 and freq[i]!=0, continue

i=1: freq[1]=1, cou=2

cou ==2, print(1)

Hence, output is 1, which matches the example.

In the first test case:

freq=[2,2,0,0]

i=0: freq[0]=2 >=2, continue

i=1: freq[1]=2 >=2, continue

i=2: freq[2]=0 ==0, print(2)

Hence, output is 2, matches the example.

In the third test case:

n=2

arr=[1,1]

freq=[0,2]

i=0: freq[0]=0 ==0, print(0)

Hence, output is 0, matches the example.

Hence, the given code seems to work for the examples.

But is this logic correct in general?

The logic is:

- Count frequency of each i from 0 to n.

- Initialize cou=0

- Iterate i from 0 to n:

- if freq[i] >=2: continue

- if freq[i]==1: cou +=1

- if cou ==2 or freq[i]==0: print(i) and break

Hence, it prints:

- The smallest i with freq[i]==0, or

- The second number with freq[i]==1.

In the second test case, freq=[1,1,1,1], so:

i=0: freq[0]=1 ==1, cou=1

i=1: freq[1]=1 ==1, cou=2, print(1)

Hence, output is 1.

In this case, it's correct.

In another case, suppose n=5

a=[0,1,2,3,4]

freq=[1,1,1,1,1]

Following the logic:

i=0: freq[0]=1 ==1, cou=1

i=1: freq[1]=1 ==1, cou=2, print(1)

Hence, output is 1.

But, simulating the game:

sorted a=[0,1,2,3,4]

c = [0,2,4]

MEX of c=[0,2,4] is 1.

Hence, output should be 1.

Hence, matches.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[0,1,1]

freq=[1,2,0]

i=0: freq[0]=1 ==1, cou=1

i=1: freq[1]=2 >=2, continue

i=2: freq[2]=0 ==0, print(2)

But, simulating the game:

sorted a=[0,1,1]

c=[0,1]

MEX of c=[0,1] is 2.

Hence, matches.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[0,0,1,1,2]

freq=[2,2,1]

i=0: freq[0]=2 >=2, continue

i=1: freq[1]=2 >=2, continue

i=2: freq[2]=1 ==1, cou=1

i=3: freq[3]=0 ==0, print(3)

But, simulating the game:

sorted a=[0,0,1,1,2]

c=[0,1,2]

MEX of c=[0,1,2] is 3.

Hence, matches.

Seems like the logic is correct.

Hence, the given code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the final score of a game played by Alice and Bob on an array of integers, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of a subset of the array that Alice builds. Both players play optimally, with Alice aiming to maximize the MEX and Bob aiming to minimize it.

### Approach

1. **Understanding MEX**: MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice starts first and picks an element from the array, appends it to her subset `c`, and deletes it from the array.
   - Bob then picks an element from the remaining array and deletes it.
   - This alternates until the array is empty.
3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of her subset `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
4. **Simulation**:
   - By sorting the array and selecting elements in a specific order, we can simulate the game.
   - Alice will pick elements starting from the smallest available, and Bob will remove elements in a way that minimizes Alice's advantage.
5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After simulating the game, compute the MEX of Alice's subset `c`.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(arr)
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - We count the frequency of each number from `0` to `n` in the array.
2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - We iterate through numbers from `0` to `n`:
