Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this operation any number of times to make all elements in the array the same. The operation involves choosing two indices l and r, finding the median of the subarray from a_l to a_r, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that median.

The goal is to find out what the maximum possible value can be when all elements in the array are the same.

First, I need to understand what a median is in this context. The problem says that the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2) after sorting the subarray in non-decreasing order. So, for a subarray of length m, sort it, and pick the element at position floor((m+1)/2). For example, in a subarray of length 3, the median would be the second smallest element.

Mocha can perform this operation any number of times, choosing any subarray each time, and setting the entire subarray to its median. She keeps doing this until all elements in the array are the same, and we need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved in this way.

Let me think about how this operation affects the array. Each operation sets a subarray to its median. So, if I choose a subarray and set it to its median, the median is kind of a "representative" value for that subarray.

I need to find a way to maximize the final uniform value of the array. To do that, I need to find the highest possible value that can be propagated to the entire array through a series of such operations.

I should consider the properties of the median. In a sorted subarray, the median is a central value. For an odd-length subarray, it's the middle element; for even-length subarrays, according to the definition, it's the element at position floor((m+1)/2), which is similar to the lower median.

I need to find a way to propagate the highest possible values across the array using these operations.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the example provided:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Operations:

1. Choose (l, r) = (4, 5), subarray [4, 5], median is 4 (since sorted subarray is [4,5], floor((2+1)/2) = 1, so the first element is 4). Set both to 4: a becomes [1,2,3,4,4]

2. Choose (l, r) = (3,5), subarray [3,4,4], sorted is [3,4,4], median is 4. Set to 4: a becomes [1,2,4,4,4]

3. Choose (l, r) = (1,5), subarray [1,2,4,4,4], sorted is [1,2,4,4,4], median is 4. Set to 4: a becomes [4,4,4,4,4]

So, the final value is 4.

Is 4 the maximum possible? According to the note, yes, it's the maximum.

Another example:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Only one operation: choose (1,2), subarray [1,2], sorted [1,2], median is 1 (floor((2+1)/2) = 1, first element is 1). Set both to 1: a becomes [1,1]

So, the final value is 1.

From these examples, it seems that the final value is related to the medians of subarrays.

I need to find a way to maximize this final value.

Let me think about the properties of the operations.

First, note that once an operation is performed on a subarray, all elements in that subarray are set to the median of the original subarray.

Also, operations can be performed any number of times, and on any subarrays.

I need to find the highest possible value that can be achieved when all elements are made equal.

I need to find a way to propagate the highest possible medians across the array.

Let me consider that the median of a subarray is at least the smallest element in the subarray and at most the largest element.

Wait, actually, in a sorted subarray, the median is greater than or equal to the smallest and less than or equal to the largest.

But in the operation, we set all elements to the median, which is kind of like replacing the subarray with a value that is neither too small nor too large, but rather in the middle.

I need to find a way to maximize the final uniform value.

Let me consider that the final value must be achievable through a series of operations, each of which sets a subarray to its median.

I need to find the highest value in the array that can be spread to the entire array through such operations.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal values needed to affect the entire array.

But I need to maximize the final value, so maybe I need to find the highest value that can be propagated to every position in the array via a series of operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of connected components where operations can spread values.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the maximum value that appears in some subarray whose median is that value, and that can be spread to the entire array.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the minimal elements that can limit the final value.

But I need to maximize, so maybe I need to look for the highest possible median that can be achieved in some subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the final value must be less than or equal to the median of the entire array.

But no, in the example, the median of the entire array [1,2,3,4,5] is 3, but the final value is 4, which is higher than the median of the entire array.

Wait, but in that operation, they first set a subarray to its median, which can be higher than the median of the entire array.

So, that approach doesn't hold.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the entire array, and I can perform operations on any subarrays.

I need to make all elements equal to the highest possible value.

I need to find a way to maximize this value.

Perhaps I can consider that the final value must be present in some subarray as a median.

So, if I can find the maximum median over all possible subarrays of length 3, that might be a candidate.

Wait, but in the second operation in the example, they chose a subarray of length 3 and set it to 4, which is higher than some other medians.

But I need to consider all possible subarrays and their medians.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum median over all subarrays of length 3.

But in the first operation of the example, they chose a subarray of length 2.

So, I need to consider subarrays of all lengths greater than or equal to 2.

But considering subarrays of length 3 seems to be a key, as in the provided code.

Wait, let's look at the provided code to understand what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if n == 2:

print(min(a))

continue

max = 0

for i in range(n - 2):

temp = a[i:i + 3]

temp.sort()

if temp[1] > max:

max = temp[1]

print(max)

So, for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

If n == 2, it prints the minimum of a.

Otherwise, it initializes max to 0.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-3, it considers the subarray a[i:i+3], sorts it, and takes the median (temp[1]), and updates max if this median is larger.

Finally, it prints this max value.

So, it's considering all subarrays of length 3, finding their medians, and taking the maximum of these medians.

But in the example with n=5 and a=[1,2,3,4,5], the subarrays of length 3 are:

[1,2,3] -> sorted [1,2,3] -> median 2

[2,3,4] -> sorted [2,3,4] -> median 3

[3,4,5] -> sorted [3,4,5] -> median 4

So, the maximum median among these is 4, which matches the output in the example.

In the first test case with n=2 and a=[1,2], it prints the minimum, which is 1.

So, the code is doing this: for n=2, print the minimum; for n>2, print the maximum median over all subarrays of length 3.

Is this correct?

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, for n=2, it's clear that the only operation is to set both elements to the median of the two, which is the minimum of the two.

Because for two elements, the median is the first element in the sorted array, which is the minimum.

So, for n=2, this is correct.

For n>2, the code considers all subarrays of length 3, finds their medians, and takes the maximum among them.

Is this the correct way to find the maximum possible final value?

In the example, it worked, but is it general?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=3 and a=[1,3,2]

Subarrays of length 3: [1,3,2] -> sorted [1,2,3] -> median 2

So, according to the code, it would print 2.

But can I make all elements 2?

Let's see:

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), median is 2, set a=[2,2,2]

Yes, all elements become 2.

Is there a way to make it higher than 2?

Suppose I choose (l,r)=(2,3), subarray [3,2], median is 2, set to 2.

Then a=[1,2,2]

Then choose (l,r)=(1,2), subarray [1,2], median is 1, set to 1.

So, a=[1,1,2]

Then choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,1,2], median is 1, set to 1.

So, I can only get all 1's or all 2's, but not higher.

So, 2 is indeed the maximum possible.

Another example:

n=4, a=[1,2,5,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,5] -> sorted [1,2,5] -> median 2

[2,5,4] -> sorted [2,4,5] -> median 4

So, maximum median is 4.

Can I make all elements 4?

Let's see:

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [2,5,4] -> median 4, set to [2,4,4]

Wait, a becomes [1,4,4,4]

- Then choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,4,4] -> sorted [1,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Then choose (l,r)=(1,4), subarray [4,4,4,4] -> median 4, already all 4's.

So, yes, I can make all elements 4.

Is there a way to make it higher, say 5?

Let's see:

- Choose (l,r)=(3,4), subarray [5,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4]

- Then a=[1,2,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,4), subarray [1,2,4,4] -> sorted [1,2,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4,4]

Again, can't get higher than 4.

So, seems correct.

Another example:

n=5, a=[1,6,2,5,3]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,6,2] -> sorted [1,2,6] -> median 2

[6,2,5] -> sorted [2,5,6] -> median 5

[2,5,3] -> sorted [2,3,5] -> median 3

So, maximum median is 5.

Can I make all elements 5?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [6,2,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5]

- Then a=[1,5,5,5,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,5,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5]

- Now a=[5,5,5,5,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(4,5), subarray [5,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3]

- Then a=[5,5,5,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [5,5,5,3,3] -> sorted [3,3,5,5,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5,5,5]

So, yes, I can make all elements 5.

Is there a way to make it higher, like 6?

- Choose (l,r)=(1,2), subarray [1,6] -> median 1, set to [1,1]

- Then a=[1,1,2,5,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(2,5), subarray [1,2,5,3] -> sorted [1,2,3,5] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2,2]

- Then a=[1,2,2,2,2]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,2), subarray [1,2] -> median 1, set to [1,1]

- Then a=[1,1,2,2,2]

- Choose (l,r)=(3,5), subarray [2,2,2] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

- Then a=[1,1,2,2,2]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [1,1,2,2,2] -> sorted [1,1,2,2,2] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2,2,2]

So, I can only get up to 2 in this path, which is less than 5.

Alternatively, other sequences of operations might reach 5, as shown earlier.

So, 5 is indeed better.

Hence, the code's approach seems to work for these cases.

But is this approach general?

Let me think about a case where the maximum median of subarrays of length 3 might not be the maximum possible final value.

Is there any such case?

Suppose n=4, a=[1,2,6,3]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,6] -> sorted [1,2,6] -> median 2

[2,6,3] -> sorted [2,3,6] -> median 3

So, maximum median is 3.

Can I make all elements 3?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [2,6,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Then a=[1,3,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Now a=[3,3,3,3]

So, yes, I can make all elements 3.

Is there a way to make it higher, like 6?

- Choose (l,r)=(3,4), subarray [3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3]

- a remains [1,3,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,2), subarray [1,3] -> median 1, set to [1,1]

- Then a=[1,1,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(3,4), subarray [3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3]

- Then a=[1,1,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,4), subarray [1,1,3,3] -> sorted [1,1,3,3] -> median 1, set to [1,1,1,1]

So, can't get to 3 in this path.

Wait, but earlier I could get to 3.

So, it depends on the sequence of operations.

But in this approach, by taking the maximum median of subarrays of length 3, it seems to give the correct answer.

Another example:

n=5, a=[1,2,7,3,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,7] -> sorted [1,2,7] -> median 2

[2,7,3] -> sorted [2,3,7] -> median 3

[7,3,4] -> sorted [3,4,7] -> median 4

So, maximum median is 4.

Can I make all elements 4?

- Choose (l,r)=(3,5), subarray [7,3,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Then a=[1,2,4,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,2,4] -> sorted [1,2,4] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

- Then a=[2,2,2,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [2,2,2,4,4] -> sorted [2,2,2,4,4] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2,2,2]

So, in this path, I can only get to 2.

But according to the code, it should be 4, but in practice, I can't reach 4 with this sequence.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different subarrays.

Let's try another sequence:

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [2,7,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Then a=[1,3,3,3,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Then a=[3,3,3,3,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [3,3,3,3,4] -> sorted [3,3,3,3,4] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3,3,3]

So, again, I can only get to 3.

But according to the code, it should be 4.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I chose (l,r)=(3,5), set to 4, but then couldn't propagate it.

Is there a way to reach 4?

Maybe not in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, it would output 4, but in reality, I can't reach it.

So, is the code incorrect?

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Let me check the constraints.

n=5, a=[1,2,7,3,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,7] -> median 2

[2,7,3] -> median 3

[7,3,4] -> median 4

So, the code would output 4.

But in practice, I can't reach 4.

Wait, maybe I missed a step.

Let's try:

- Choose (l,r)=(3,5), subarray [7,3,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Then a=[1,2,4,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,2,4] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

- Then a=[2,2,2,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [2,2,2,4,4] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2,2,2]

Again, can't reach 4.

So, in this case, the code outputs 4, but it seems I can't actually achieve 4.

Hence, the code might be incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it worked.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the maximum possible final value is the minimum of the maximum medians of all possible subarrays of length 3.

But in this case, it's outputting 4, but I can't reach it.

So, perhaps I need to take the minimum of such medians.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider overlapping operations or something.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal value that can be propagated to the entire array.

Wait, but I need the maximum possible final value.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I want to make all elements equal to a certain value x.

I need to check if it's possible to achieve x through a series of operations.

I need to find the maximum x such that it's possible to make all elements equal to x.

So, it's a feasibility problem for each x.

But checking for each x would be too slow, as x can be up to 1e9.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal values in the array.

But I need to maximize x.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the final value x must be a median of some subarray.

But in the earlier example, x=4 is a median of some subarray, but I couldn't propagate it to the entire array.

Wait, maybe I need to consider connected components where x can be propagated.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the code.

The code considers all subarrays of length 3, finds their medians, and takes the maximum among them.

Then, it outputs this maximum median.

In the first example, it worked.

In the second example, it seemed not to work.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the operations.

Let's try again for n=5, a=[1,2,7,3,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(3,5), subarray [7,3,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Now a=[1,2,4,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [1,2,4,4,4] -> sorted [1,2,4,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4,4,4]

Ah, I see! In this step, the median is 4, so set all to 4.

So, it is possible to reach 4.

I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, in this case, the code is correct.

Another example:

n=4, a=[1,2,5,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,5] -> median 2

[2,5,4] -> median 4

Maximum median is 4.

Can I make all elements 4?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [2,5,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Then a=[1,4,4,4]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4]

- Now a=[4,4,4,4]

Yes, it works.

Another example:

n=5, a=[1,6,2,5,3]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,6,2] -> median 2

[6,2,5] -> median 5

[2,5,3] -> median 3

Maximum median is 5.

Can I make all elements 5?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [6,2,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5]

- Then a=[1,5,5,5,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,5), subarray [1,5,5,5,3] -> sorted [1,3,5,5,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5,5,5]

Yes, it works.

So, in these cases, the approach seems correct.

Let me think about n=2.

n=2, a=[1,2]

Only one operation: choose (1,2), median is 1, set to [1,1]

So, the final value is 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Subarrays of length 3: [1,2,3] -> median 2

So, output is 2.

Can I make all elements 2?

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,2,3] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

Yes, all elements become 2.

Is there a way to make it higher, like 3?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,3), subarray [2,3] -> median 2, set to [2,2]

- Then a=[1,2,2]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,2), subarray [1,2] -> median 1, set to [1,1]

- Then a=[1,1,2]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,1,2] -> median 1, set to [1,1,1]

So, can't get to 3.

Hence, 2 is the maximum possible.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[1,1,1,1]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,1,1] -> median 1

[1,1,1] -> median 1

Maximum median is 1.

Indeed, all elements are already 1.

So, output is 1, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[1,3,3,3]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,3,3] -> median 3

[3,3,3] -> median 3

Maximum median is 3.

Can I make all elements 3?

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [1,3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Then a=[3,3,3,3]

Yes, all elements become 3.

Is there a way to make it higher, like 3? Yes, it's already 3.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[2,1,3,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[2,1,3] -> sorted [1,2,3] -> median 2

[1,3,4] -> sorted [1,3,4] -> median 3

Maximum median is 3.

Can I make all elements 3?

- Choose (l,r)=(2,4), subarray [1,3,4] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Then a=[2,3,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [2,3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3]

- Now a=[3,3,3,3]

Yes, all elements become 3.

Is there a way to make it higher, like 4?

- Choose (l,r)=(3,4), subarray [3,4] -> median 3, set to [3,3]

- Then a=[2,1,3,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,3), subarray [2,1,3] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

- Then a=[2,2,2,3]

- Choose (l,r)=(1,4), subarray [2,2,2,3] -> sorted [2,2,2,3] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2,2]

So, can't get to 3 in this path.

But in another sequence, as before, I can get to 3.

Hence, the maximum possible is 3, which matches the code's output.

So, it seems that considering the maximum median of subarrays of length 3 gives the correct answer.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible value that an array can be统一 to after performing a series of operations where we set a chosen subarray to its median value.

## Approach
1. **Understanding the Operation**: Each operation allows us to choose a subarray, calculate its median, and set all elements in that subarray to this median. We repeat this until all elements in the array are the same, and our goal is to make this final value as large as possible.

2. **Key Insight for n=2**: For an array of length 2, the only possible operation is to set both elements to the median of the two elements, which is the smaller of the two values. Hence, the final value is the minimum of the two elements.

3. **General Approach for n > 2**: For longer arrays, the solution involves finding the maximum median among all subarrays of length 3. This is because medians from these subarrays can be propagated through the array via the operations, allowing higher values to be achieved compared to smaller subarrays.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating through the array and considering every possible subarray of length 3, we calculate the median of each and keep track of the maximum median found. This maximum median will be the highest value that can be achieved by performing the operations.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max_median = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            median = temp[1]
            if median > max_median:
                max_median = median
        print(max_median)

# Example Usage
# func()
```

## Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: We first read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, we read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Handling n=2**: If the array has only two elements, we directly print the minimum of the two, as this is the only possible value the array can be统一 to.

3. **Finding Maximum Median for n > 2**:
    - We initialize a variable `max_median` to keep track of the highest median found.
    - We iterate through the array, considering every subarray of length 3.
    - For each subarray, we sort it and find its median (the second element after sorting).
    - We update `max_median` if the current median is higher than the previously recorded one.
    - Finally, we print the highest median found, which is the maximum possible value the array can be统一 to.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the solution by leveraging the properties of medians in small subarrays, allowing us to achieve the desired result in an optimal manner.
