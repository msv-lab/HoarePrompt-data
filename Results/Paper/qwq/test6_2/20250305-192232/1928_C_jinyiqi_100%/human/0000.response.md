Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned numbers based on their positions and a parameter K. The task is to figure out how many possible values of K are valid given Vasya's position and the number he received.

First, I need to understand how the numbering works. It says that the first K people get numbers 1 through K, and then the next K-2 people get numbers K-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2K-2 positions.

So, for example, if K is 3, the sequence would be:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

Numbers: 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2...

Wait, in the example given in the problem, for K=3, position 10 would be 2, which matches this pattern.

Another example is K=2:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

Numbers: 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2...

And for K=5:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 2...

Got it. So the pattern repeats every 2K-2 positions. Now, Vasya remembers his position N and the number X he received, and we need to find how many K > 1 satisfy this condition.

Constraints:

- K > 1

- 1 ≤ X < N ≤ 10^9

- T ≤ 100 test cases

First, I need to find a way to relate N and X to K.

Let's think about the pattern:

- For positions 1 to K: numbers 1 to K

- Positions K+1 to 2K-2: numbers K-1 to 2

- Then it repeats.

So, the period is 2K-2.

Given a position N, we can find its position within its period.

Let’s define M = 2K - 2.

So, N mod M will give the position within the period.

But we have to handle the edge cases carefully.

Let’s consider two cases:

1. If N mod M is between 1 and K, then the number assigned is (N mod M).

2. If N mod M is between K+1 and M, then the number assigned is M - (N mod M) + 2.

Wait, let's verify this.

For K=3, M=4.

Positions:

1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, etc.

So, for N=5, N mod 4 = 1, which corresponds to number 1.

N=6, N mod 4 = 2, number 2.

N=7, N mod 4 = 3, number 3.

N=8, N mod 4 = 0, which is position M, which corresponds to number 2.

Wait, in Python, N mod M for N=8 and M=4 is 0, but in the pattern, it should correspond to position M, which is 4, and in K=3, position 4 has number 2.

So, we need to adjust for the fact that mod M gives 0 when N is a multiple of M, but in the pattern, position M corresponds to number K-1, which is 2 for K=3.

So, in general, if N mod M == 0, it corresponds to position M, which has number K-1.

Otherwise, if N mod M <= K, it's N mod M.

Else, it's M - (N mod M) + 2.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let’s define P = N mod M.

If P == 0, then P = M.

If P <= K, number = P.

Else, number = M - P + 2.

So, for K=3, M=4.

P=1: number=1

P=2: number=2

P=3: number=3

P=4: number=4 - 4 + 2 = 2

Which matches the pattern.

Similarly, for K=2, M=2.

P=1: number=1

P=2: number=2 - 2 + 2 = 2

Which matches the pattern.

For K=5, M=8.

P=1:1, P=2:2, P=3:3, P=4:4, P=5:5, P=6:8-6+2=4, P=7:8-7+2=3, P=8:8-8+2=2

Which matches the earlier example.

So, this seems correct.

Now, given N and X, we need to find all K >1 such that the above condition holds.

So, for each K, compute M=2K-2.

Compute P=N mod M, handle P=0 as P=M.

Then, compute the number based on P and check if it equals X.

But since N and K can be up to 1e9, and T=100, we need an efficient way to find all such K.

Brute-forcing K from 2 to N won't be efficient enough.

So, we need a smarter approach.

Let's try to derive a formula that relates K to N and X.

Given P=N mod M, with M=2K-2.

Case 1: P <= K, number = P = X

So, P = X

Therefore, N mod M = X

But N mod M can be 0, which means M divides N.

So, if X != M, then N mod M = X

If X == M, then N mod M = 0

Wait, X < N <=1e9, and K >1, so M >=2.

Given that X < N, and M=2K-2 >=2, so X can be from 1 to N-1.

But in the pattern, X can be from 1 to K.

So, in this case, X <= K.

But we need to consider both cases: P <=K and P >K.

Wait, in case 1, P <=K, number=P=X.

In case 2, P >K, number=M - P +2 =X.

So, two possibilities:

1. N mod M = X

2. M - (N mod M) + 2 = X, when N mod M > K

But N mod M can be 0, which is P=M.

So, we need to handle P=0 separately.

Wait, let's consider P=N mod M.

If P ==0, P = M.

If P <=K, number = P

Else, number = M - P +2

So, number = X.

Therefore, two cases:

Case 1: P <=K, P=X

So, P=X <=K

Case 2: P >K, M - P +2 =X

So, M - P +2 =X, and P >K

Since P=N mod M, and M=2K-2.

We need to find K such that either:

1. N mod (2K-2) == X, and X <=K

Or

2. N mod (2K-2) > K, and (2K-2) - (N mod (2K-2)) +2 =X

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider the periodicity.

The pattern repeats every M=2K-2 positions.

So, for a given K, the number at position N is determined by N mod M.

We can think of N as N = q*M + P, where P = N mod M.

Then, the number assigned is:

- If P <=K, number = P

- Else, number = M - P +2

So, we set this equal to X and solve for K.

But K is involved in M, which is in P, which is in the expression for the number.

This seems messy.

Maybe we can rearrange the equations.

Let’s consider case 1: P <=K, P=X

So, P = X <= K

Since P = N mod M, and M=2K-2

So, N mod (2K-2) = X

Also, since P <=K, X <=K

So, we have N mod (2K-2) = X, and X <=K

Similarly, case 2: P >K, M - P +2 =X

P = N mod M >K

And M - P +2 =X

So, M - (N mod M) +2 =X

But M=2K-2

So, 2K-2 - (N mod (2K-2)) +2 =X

Simplify: 2K - (N mod (2K-2)) =X

So, (N mod (2K-2)) =2K -X

And since P >K, which is P = N mod M >K

So, N mod M >K

So, N mod (2K-2) >K

And from above, N mod (2K-2) =2K -X

So, 2K -X >K ⇒ K >X

So, in this case, K >X

So, summarizing both cases:

Case 1:

N mod (2K-2) =X, and X <=K

Case 2:

N mod (2K-2) =2K -X, and K <X

Wait, but in the problem, X <N, and K >1.

But in the second case, K <X, and since K >1, X >1.

But in the problem, X can be from 1 to N-1.

Wait, but in the first case, X <=K, and in the second case, X <K.

Wait, no, in the second case, K <X.

Wait, let's double-check.

From case 2:

N mod (2K-2) =2K -X, and K <X

Because P >K, and P =2K -X, so 2K -X >K ⇒ K >X, but that contradicts K <X.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Let me re-express the second case.

Given that P = N mod M >K, and number = M - P +2 =X

So, M - P +2 =X

P = M - (X -2)

Wait, let's solve for P:

P = M - (X -2) = 2K -2 -X +2 =2K -X

So, P =2K -X

But P =N mod M, and P >K

So, N mod (2K-2) =2K -X >K

Therefore, 2K -X >K ⇒ K >X

So, in this case, K >X

But earlier, in the problem, X <N, and K >1.

Wait, but in the first case, X <=K, and in the second case, K >X.

Wait, but if K >X, then in the first case, X <=K, which is always true since K >X.

Wait, no, in the first case, X <=K, and in the second case, K >X.

So, actually, these two cases cover all possibilities where X <=K and X >K.

Wait, but in the second case, we have K >X, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that K >X in the second case.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let’s consider that N can be expressed as q*M + P, where P=N mod M, and M=2K-2.

Then, the number assigned is:

- If P <=K, number =P =X

- Else, number =M -P +2 =X

So, two possibilities:

1. P =X <=K

2. P =M -X +2 >K

Now, P =N mod M

So, N mod M =X (for case 1)

Or N mod M =2K -X (for case 2)

But in case 2, P >K, which is 2K -X >K ⇒ K >X

So, for case 2, K >X

In case 1, X <=K

So, combining both cases:

Either N mod (2K-2) =X, with X <=K

Or N mod (2K-2) =2K -X, with K >X

Our goal is to find all integers K >1 that satisfy one of these two conditions.

Given that M=2K-2, we can express N mod M in terms of K.

But since M=2K-2, we can write N mod (2K-2) in terms of K.

Let’s consider both cases separately.

Case 1: N mod (2K-2) =X, with X <=K

Case 2: N mod (2K-2) =2K -X, with K >X

Our task is to find all integers K >1 that satisfy either of these conditions.

Given that N and X are given, and K is the variable we're solving for.

Let’s try to solve for K in both cases.

Starting with case 1:

N mod (2K-2) =X, with X <=K

We know that N mod (2K-2) =X, which means N -X is divisible by (2K-2).

So, N -X ≡0 mod (2K-2)

Therefore, (2K-2) divides (N -X)

Similarly, since M=2K-2, and M divides (N -X), we have:

(2K-2) divides (N -X)

So, 2K-2 is a divisor of (N -X)

Let’s denote D=2K-2

Then, D divides (N -X), and D=2K-2

So, 2K-2 divides (N -X)

Also, since K >1, D >=2

And since X <=K in this case, and K >1, X >=1

So, we can write:

2K -2 divides (N -X)

And K >1

And X <=K

Now, let’s express K in terms of D:

D=2K-2 ⇒ K=(D+2)/2

Since K must be an integer greater than 1, D must be even and D >=2.

So, D is an even divisor of (N -X), where D >=2.

Then, K=(D+2)/2

Also, since X <=K, we have X <=(D+2)/2

Which implies D >=2X -2

Similarly, since K >X in the second case, but in this case, X <=K.

Wait, in case 1, X <=K, and in case 2, K >X.

So, for case 1, we have:

D=2K-2 divides (N -X), and D >=2X -2

Wait, let's see.

From D=2K-2 and K=(D+2)/2, and X <=K, which is X <=(D+2)/2

So, X <=(D+2)/2 ⇒ D >=2X -2

But D must be at least 2, and D must be even.

So, for case 1, D must be even, D >=max(2, 2X -2), and D divides (N -X).

Similarly, for case 2:

N mod (2K-2) =2K -X, with K >X

Similarly, N - (2K -X) is divisible by (2K -2)

So, N - (2K -X) ≡0 mod (2K -2)

Which means (2K -2) divides (N - (2K -X)) =N -2K +X

So, (2K -2) divides (N -2K +X)

Let’s denote D=2K-2 again.

Then, D divides (N -2K +X)

But D=2K-2, so we can write:

D divides (N -2K +X)

But D=2K-2 ⇒ 2K =D +2

Substitute:

D divides (N - (D +2) +X) =N -D -2 +X

So, D divides (N -D -2 +X)

But this seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider that in both cases, D=2K-2 divides either (N -X) or (N - (2K -X)).

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let’s consider the two cases again.

Case 1: N mod D =X, with X <=K, where D=2K-2

Case 2: N mod D =2K -X, with K >X

From case 1:

D divides (N -X), and X <=K=(D+2)/2

So, X <=(D+2)/2

Similarly, since X >=1, we have D >=2X -2

Also, D >=2, since K >1.

For case 2:

N mod D =2K -X, with K >X

Similarly, 2K -X >K, because P >K, which implies 2K -X >K, so K >X

Wait, earlier analysis seems conflicting.

Wait, in case 2, P=2K -X >K, which implies K >X

So, K >X

And D=2K-2 divides (N - (2K -X)) =N -2K +X

But 2K =D +2, so substitute:

D divides (N - (D +2) +X) =N -D -2 +X

Which can be rewritten as D divides (N +X -2 -D)

But this seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let’s consider that in both cases, D divides either (N -X) or (N - (2K -X))

But since D=2K-2, and K=(D+2)/2, perhaps we can find a relationship between D and (N -X), and D and (N - (2K -X))

This seems too convoluted.

Let’s try to think differently.

Let’s consider that for each possible D, which is a divisor of either (N -X) or (N +X -2), we can find K=(D+2)/2, and check if it satisfies the conditions.

Wait, perhaps we can consider that D=2K-2 must divide either (N -X) or (N +X -2)

Wait, how did (N +X -2) come up?

Let me see.

In case 1: D divides (N -X)

In case 2: D divides (N - (2K -X)) =N -2K +X

But 2K =D +2, so N - (D +2) +X =N -D -2 +X =N +X -2 -D

Which is equal to (N +X -2) -D

But D divides (N +X -2 -D), which implies D divides (N +X -2)

Wait, because if D divides (N +X -2 -D), then D divides (N +X -2)

Since D divides D, and D divides (N +X -2 -D), then D divides (N +X -2)

So, in case 2, D divides (N +X -2)

Therefore, in both cases, D divides either (N -X) or (N +X -2)

And D=2K-2, where K >1, so D >=2, and D is even.

So, to find all possible K, we need to find all even D >=2 that divide either (N -X) or (N +X -2), and then compute K=(D+2)/2, and ensure that in case 1, X <=K, and in case 2, K >X.

This seems manageable.

So, the plan is:

1. Find all even divisors D >=2 of (N -X)

For each such D:

Compute K=(D+2)/2

Check if X <=K

If yes, count this K

2. Find all even divisors D >=2 of (N +X -2)

For each such D:

Compute K=(D+2)/2

Check if K >X

If yes, count this K

3. Combine the results from both steps, remove duplicates, and count the total number of valid K

Wait, but we need to make sure that we don't double-count any K.

So, perhaps it's better to collect all K from both steps, remove duplicates, and count the remaining K.

Also, ensure that K >1.

Given that K=(D+2)/2, and D >=2, K >=2, which satisfies K >1.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

Given that N and X can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to find all even divisors of (N -X) and (N +X -2)

First, we need to factorize (N -X) and (N +X -2) to find their divisors.

But factorizing numbers up to 1e9 efficiently is feasible, as long as we optimize the factorization.

We can write a function to find all divisors of a given number efficiently.

Then, from the list of divisors, select only the even divisors that are >=2.

Then, for each such D, compute K=(D+2)/2, and check the conditions:

- For divisors of (N -X): check if X <=K

- For divisors of (N +X -2): check if K >X

Then, combine these K, remove duplicates, and count them.

Edge cases to consider:

- N -X ==0: but N >X, so N -X >=1

- N +X -2 <=0: but N >=X+1 >=2, so N +X -2 >=1

- K must be integer >1

- X <N

- K >1

Also, need to make sure that (D+2)/2 is integer, but since D is even, (D+2) is even, so K is integer.

Implementing the divisor function efficiently.

We can write a function that returns all divisors of a given number.

For a number X, iterate from 1 to sqrt(X), and for each i that divides X, add both i and X/i to the list of divisors.

Then, filter for even divisors >=2.

Implement this function for both (N -X) and (N +X -2)

Then, process as per the plan above.

Now, let's think about possible optimizations.

Given that N and X can be up to 1e9, and T up to 100, we need to make sure that the factorization is efficient.

In Python, factorizing a number up to 1e9 is acceptable within time limits, as long as we optimize the loop to run up to sqrt(X).

Also, since T=100, and N=1e9, it should be manageable.

Let’s consider the example from the problem.

Input:

5

10 2

3 1

76 4

100 99

1000000000 500000000

Output:

4

1

9

0

1

Let’s take the first test case: N=10, X=2

Compute N -X =8, N +X -2=10

Find even divisors of 8: 2,4,8

Compute K for each:

D=2, K=(2+2)/2=2, check X <=K ⇒2 <=2, valid

D=4, K=(4+2)/2=3, X <=3, valid

D=8, K=(8+2)/2=5, X <=5, valid

So, K=2,3,5

Now, for N +X -2=10

Find even divisors of 10: 2,10

Compute K for each:

D=2, K=2, check K >X ⇒2 >2, false

D=10, K=6, check 6 >2, valid

So, K=6

Combined K: 2,3,5,6 →4 values, which matches the first output.

Another test case: N=3, X=1

N -X=2, N +X -2=2

Even divisors of 2: 2

For N -X=2:

D=2, K=2, check X <=2 ⇒1 <=2, valid

For N +X -2=2:

D=2, K=2, check K >1 ⇒2 >1, valid

But K=2 is counted twice, so only one unique K=2, which matches the second output.

Another test case: N=76, X=4

N -X=72, N +X -2=74

Even divisors of 72: 2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

Compute K for each:

D=2, K=2, X <=2 ⇒4 <=2? No, invalid

D=4, K=3, 4 <=3? No

D=6, K=4, 4 <=4, valid

D=8, K=5, valid

D=12, K=7, valid

D=18, K=10, valid

D=24, K=13, valid

D=36, K=19, valid

D=72, K=37, valid

So, K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37

Now, for N +X -2=74

Even divisors of 74:2,74

Compute K for each:

D=2, K=2, check K >4 ⇒2 >4? No

D=74, K=38, check 38 >4, valid

So, K=38

Combined K:4,5,7,10,13,19,37,38 →8 values

But in the sample output, it's 9.

Wait, perhaps I missed some.

Wait, N -X=72 has divisors:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37

N +X -2=74 has divisors:2,74

K=38

Total unique K:7 from N -X and 1 from N +X -2: total 8

But sample output is 9.

Wait, maybe I missed some.

Wait, perhaps D=10 is a divisor of N -X=72?

Wait, 72 divided by 10 is 7.2, so 10 is not a divisor of 72.

Wait, maybe I need to double-check the divisors.

Compute divisors of 72:

1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72

Even divisors >=2:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72 →9 divisors

Wait, but earlier I listed only 9, but in the sample output, it's 9.

Wait, but in my earlier list, I had K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37,38 →8 values

But according to the sample output, it should be 9.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, K=4 is from D=6 (K=(6+2)/2=4)

K=5 from D=8

K=7 from D=12

K=10 from D=18

K=13 from D=24

K=19 from D=36

K=37 from D=72

K=38 from D=74

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there are more divisors.

Wait, 72 has divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72

Even ones:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72 →9

But according to my earlier mapping, only 7 K from N -X=72, and 1 from N +X -2=74, total 8

But sample output is 9, so perhaps I missed one.

Wait, maybe D=9 for N -X=72, but D must be even, so D=9 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps D=1

But D must be even and >=2

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps D=2 for N -X=72 gives K=2, but X=4, X <=K=2? 4 <=2? No, invalid

So, only K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37 from N -X=72

And K=38 from N +X -2=74

Total 8, but sample output is 9.

Wait, maybe there's an overlap or miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps D=4 for N -X=72: K=3, X=4 <=3? 4 <=3? No, invalid

Wait, in my earlier list, for D=4, K=3, X=4 <=3? No, invalid

So, K=3 is invalid

Similarly, D=2, K=2, X=4 <=2? No

So, only D=6,8,12,18,24,36,72 for N -X=72, giving K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37

And D=2,74 for N +X -2=74, giving K=2 (invalid), K=38 (valid)

So, total K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37,38 →8

But sample output is 9.

Wait, perhaps I missed D=10 for N +X -2=74

Wait, 74 divided by 10 is 7.4, not integer, so not a divisor

Wait, perhaps I need to check all even divisors again.

Wait, maybe D=36 for N -X=72: K=19

D=72: K=37

D=74: K=38

D=24: K=13

D=12: K=7

D=8: K=5

D=6: K=4

So, 7 from N -X=72, 1 from N +X -2=74: total 8

But sample output is 9, so perhaps there's an overlap or miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps D=4 for N -X=72: K=3, but X=4 <=3? 4 <=3? No, invalid

Similarly, D=2: K=2, invalid

So, only K=4,5,7,10,13,19,37 from N -X=72, and K=38 from N +X -2=74: total 8

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe D=38 for N +X -2=74: D=74, K=38

Is there another D?

Wait, 74 has divisors:1,2,37,74

Even divisors >=2:2,74

So, only D=2 and D=74 for N +X -2=74

Thus, only K=2 (invalid) and K=38 (valid)

So, total unique K:4,5,7,10,13,19,37,38 →8

But sample output is 9, so perhaps I missed one.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in assuming D=24 gives K=13

Let’s check:

D=24, K=(24+2)/2=13, X=4 <=13? Yes, valid

Similarly, all others seem correct.

Wait, perhaps D=9 is considered, but D must be even, so D=9 is invalid.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the divisor function.

Wait, perhaps I need to implement the divisor function carefully to ensure all even divisors are captured.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical oversight in the approach.

Let’s consider that in case 2, D divides (N +X -2), and K=(D+2)/2 >X

But perhaps there are multiple D that satisfy this.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to count the number of K without enumerating all D.

Wait, perhaps we can derive a formula for K.

Let’s consider that D=2K-2 divides either (N -X) or (
