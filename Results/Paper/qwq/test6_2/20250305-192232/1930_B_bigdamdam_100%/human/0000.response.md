Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation p of length n such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. From the problem, it says that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not because 2 appears twice, and [1,3,4] is not a permutation of n=3 because it includes 4, which is outside the range.

So, for a given n, I need to arrange the numbers from 1 to n in some order, but with the condition that no two pairs (i, j) and (i+1, j+1) have p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1}, where i and j are distinct indices less than n.

Let me try to wrap my head around this condition. It's saying that for any two positions i and j, if p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, then this should not happen unless i = j.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. Maybe looking at the examples will help.

In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's see why this is valid.

Check all possible pairs (i,j) where i < j < n:

- i=1, j=2: p1=4, p2=1; 4 does not divide 1. So, condition not satisfied.

- i=1, j=3: p1=4, p3=2; 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4. Wait, 4 doesn't divide 2, but 2 divides 4. But we also need to check p2 and p4: p2=1, p4=3; 1 divides 3, but since p1 doesn't divide p3, the overall condition is not violated.

- i=1, j=4: p1=4, p4=3; 4 doesn't divide 3, so condition not satisfied.

- i=2, j=3: p2=1, p3=2; 1 divides 2, and p3=2, p4=3; 2 doesn't divide 3, so condition not satisfied.

- i=2, j=4: p2=1, p4=3; 1 divides 3, and p3=2, p5 doesn't exist since n=4, so maybe I need to consider only j < n-1? Wait, the problem says 1 ≤ i, j < n, so j < n.

- i=3, j=4: p3=2, p4=3; 2 doesn't divide 3, so condition not satisfied.

So, in this permutation, the condition holds.

Now, the problem also mentions that for n=3, all 6 permutations are valid. Let's verify that.

For n=3, permutations are:

1. [1,2,3]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p1=1 divides p2=2, and p2=2 divides p3=3? 2 divides 3? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=1 divides p3=3, and p2=2 divides p4? p4 doesn't exist.

- i=2, j=3: p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

So, valid.

2. [1,3,2]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p1=1 divides p2=3, and p2=3 divides p3=2? 3 doesn't divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p1=1 divides p3=2, and p2=3 divides p4? doesn't exist.

- i=2, j=3: p2=3 divides p3=2? No.

Valid.

3. [2,1,3]

- i=1, j=2: p1=2 divides p2=1? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=2 divides p3=3? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=1 divides p3=3, and p3=3 divides p4? doesn't exist.

Valid.

4. [2,3,1]

- i=1, j=2: p1=2 divides p2=3? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=2 divides p3=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=3 divides p3=1? No.

Valid.

5. [3,1,2]

- i=1, j=2: p1=3 divides p2=1? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=3 divides p3=2? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=1 divides p3=2, and p3=2 divides p4? doesn't exist.

Valid.

6. [3,2,1]

- i=1, j=2: p1=3 divides p2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=3 divides p3=1? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=2 divides p3=1? No.

Valid.

So, indeed, for n=3, all permutations satisfy the condition.

Now, I need to find such a permutation for any n between 3 and 10^5.

The problem mentions that at least one such p exists under the given constraints.

Looking at the example permutation for n=4: [4,1,2,3]

Let me see if there's a pattern here.

It seems like the numbers are arranged in a specific order:

- The first position has the largest number, 4.

- Then 1, then 2, then 3.

Is there a particular strategy here?

Another way to look at it is to arrange the numbers in a way that avoids having p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} for any i ≠ j.

I need to find a permutation where this division condition doesn't hold for any two pairs (i,j) and (i+1,j+1).

Let me think about how to construct such a permutation.

One idea is to place larger numbers in certain positions to minimize the chances of division occurring.

Wait, in the example, they placed the largest number first, then the smallest, then the next smallest, and so on.

Is there a pattern or a specific ordering that can be generalized?

Looking at the provided code, it seems to be attempting to construct such a permutation.

Let's analyze the code to see what it's doing.

The function func() is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases based on the input.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- It reads n from input.

- Initializes a list p of size n with zeros.

- Sets ind to n.

- Fills in the even indices (0-based) with decreasing even positions from n, stepping down by 2 each time.

- Then, sets ind to 1 if n is odd, else 2, and fills in the odd indices with increasing odd positions starting from ind, stepping up by 2 each time.

Finally, it prints the permutation p for each test case.

Let me see an example to understand this.

Take n=4.

Initialize p = [0,0,0,0]

ind = 4

First loop: for i in range(0,4,2):

i=0: p[0] = 4, ind = 4 - 2 = 2

i=2: p[2] = 2, ind = 2 - 2 = 0

Then, ind = 1 + 4 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

Second loop: for i in range(1,4,2):

i=1: p[1] = 1, ind = 1 + 2 = 3

i=3: p[3] = 3, ind = 3 + 2 = 5 (but since n=4, ind exceeds, but it's okay as we're only filling up to i=3)

So, p = [4,1,2,3], which matches the first test case.

Another example, n=3.

Initialize p = [0,0,0]

ind = 3

First loop: for i in range(0,3,2):

i=0: p[0] = 3, ind = 3 - 2 = 1

i=2: p[2] = 1, ind = 1 - 2 = -1 (but it's not used further)

Then, ind = 1 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

Second loop: for i in range(1,3,2):

i=1: p[1] = 2, ind = 2 + 2 = 4

So, p = [3,2,1], which is one of the valid permutations for n=3.

Seems consistent.

Let me check for n=5.

p = [0,0,0,0,0]

ind = 5

First loop:

i=0: p[0] = 5, ind = 3

i=2: p[2] = 3, ind = 1

i=4: p[4] = 1, ind = -1

Then, ind = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

Second loop:

i=1: p[1] = 2, ind = 4

i=3: p[3] = 4, ind = 6

So, p = [5,2,3,4,1]

Let's verify if this permutation is valid.

Check all pairs (i,j):

- i=1, j=2: p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

- i=1, j=3: p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

- i=1, j=4: p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

- i=2, j=3: p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p2=2 divides p4=4, and p3=3 divides p5=1? 3 doesn't divide 1.

- i=3, j=4: p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

So, seems valid.

Another way to think about constructing the permutation is to alternate large and small numbers.

For example, placing the largest number first, then the smallest, then the next largest, then the next smallest, and so on.

But in the code, it seems to be filling even indices with decreasing numbers starting from n, stepping down by 2, and odd indices with increasing numbers starting from 1 or 2, depending on n.

This seems like a way to interleave larger and smaller numbers.

I need to confirm if this approach guarantees that the condition is satisfied.

Let me consider potential divisions.

In the permutation [4,1,2,3], check if there are any i and j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

From earlier, it seems not.

Similarly, for [5,2,3,4,1], no such pairs exist.

Is there a general proof for this construction?

I'm not sure, but based on the examples, it seems to work.

Given that the problem states that at least one such permutation exists under the constraints, and this construction appears to work for the examples, I can assume that it's correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
