Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to find the maximum number x such that when I remove exactly k edges from the tree, each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

So, the problem is about removing exactly k edges from this tree and ensuring that each part that remains is a connected component with at least x vertices. I need to maximize x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about it is to consider that removing an edge from a tree splits it into two connected components. So, if I remove one edge, I get two components. If I remove a second edge, I might split one of those components further, and so on.

I need to remove exactly k edges, so I'll have k+1 connected components in the end, since each edge removal increases the number of components by one.

But wait, actually, in a tree, removing k edges will always result in k+1 connected components. Because a tree is minimally connected; removing any edge increases the number of components by one.

So, I'll have exactly k+1 connected components after removing k edges.

Now, I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices, and I want to maximize x.

This sounds like a problem where I can use binary search on x, because the feasibility of a certain x can be determined based on whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To use binary search, I'll set the lower bound l to 1 and the upper bound r to n (the total number of vertices). Then, I'll iterate, picking mid = (l + r + 1) // 2, and check if it's possible to remove k edges such that each component has at least mid vertices. If it is possible, I set l = mid, else I set r = mid - 1. I'll continue this until l <= r.

But wait, in the code provided, it seems like they're using a similar approach. Let's look at func_4, which performs this binary search.

In func_4, they set beg = 1 and end = n, and then in the loop, mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2, and they call func_3 to check if it's possible to remove k edges such that each component has at least mid vertices. If it is possible, they set beg = mid, else they set end = mid - 1.

This seems correct for binary search on x.

Now, the key part is func_3, which checks if for a given x, it's possible to remove k edges such that each component has at least x vertices.

In func_3, they call func_1 to get the number of good components and the remaining size. A good component is one that has at least x vertices.

Then, they check if the number of good components is greater than k, or if it's equal to k and the remaining size is at least x.

I need to understand what "good components" and "remaining size" are in this context.

Looking at func_1, it seems to perform a postorder traversal of the tree, starting from vertex s, and for each node, it calculates the number of good components in its subtree and the remaining size.

A good component is a subtree with at least x vertices, and the remaining size is the number of vertices in the subtree that are not in any good component.

Wait, actually, in func_1, they are accumulating good_components from the children, and if a child's remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, they consider it a good component and increment good_components, otherwise they add the child's remaining_size to the parent's remaining_size.

So, it seems like they're trying to count how many subtrees can be separated as good components (i.e., have at least x vertices), and the remaining vertices are aggregated into the parent's remaining_size.

Then, in func_3, if the number of good_components is greater than k, or equal to k and the remaining_size is at least x, they return True, meaning it's possible to remove k edges to achieve the desired components.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, if the number of good_components is greater than k, that means there are more components with at least x vertices than the number of edges we can remove. But we have to remove exactly k edges, so we can create k+1 components. If the number of good_components is greater than k, that might not directly correspond to the number of components we can create by removing k edges.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Actually, in a tree, removing k edges will always result in k+1 connected components. So, if I can ensure that all of these k+1 components have at least x vertices, then that should satisfy the condition.

But the code seems to be checking if the number of good_components is greater than k, or equal to k and the remaining_size is at least x.

I'm a bit confused here.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=5, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

  ├─4

  └─5

If we remove the edge between 1 and 3, we get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, for x=2, it's possible.

For x=3, it's not possible because {1,2} has only 2 vertices.

Now, in the code, func_1 is performing a postorder traversal to count good_components and remaining_size.

Let's simulate func_1 for x=2.

Starting from vertex 0 (1):

Children: 1 (2), 2 (3)

Process children first.

For vertex 1 (2):

No children, so good_components=0, remaining_size=1

For vertex 2 (3):

Children: 3 (4), 4 (5)

Process them first.

For vertex 3 (4):

No children, good_components=0, remaining_size=1

For vertex 4 (5):

No children, good_components=0, remaining_size=1

Now, for vertex 2 (3):

For child 3 (4): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size: 1

For child 4 (5): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size: 1+1=2

Now, remaining_size=2 >=2, so good_components +=1 (from the subtree), and remaining_size=2

Wait, no, in the code, it's:

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components

if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1

else:

tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

So, for vertex 2 (3):

good_components += 0 (from child 3) + 0 (from child 4) =0

remaining_size += 1 (from child 3) +1 (from child 4) =2

Then, for vertex 0 (1):

good_components += 0 (from child 1) + 0 (from child 2) =0

remaining_size +=1 (from child 1) +2 (from child 2) =3

Then, check if good_components >k, which is 0 >1? No.

Check if good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x, which is 0==1? No.

So, func_3 returns False for x=2, but in reality, it's possible.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the example, when removing the edge between 1 and 3, we get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}.

For x=2, both components have at least 2 vertices.

But according to the code, func_3 returns False, which contradicts the expected result.

So, there must be a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Looking back at func_3:

def func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:

(good_components, remaining_size) = func_1(tree, 0, x)

if good_components > k:

return True

if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:

return True

return False

In the example, good_components=0, remaining_size=3.

0 >1? False

0==1? False

So, returns False, but it should be True for x=2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied func_1.

Let me re-simulate func_1 for x=2.

Starting from vertex 0 (1):

- Children: 1 (2), 2 (3)

Process child 1 (2):

- No children, good_components=0, remaining_size=1

Process child 2 (3):

- Children: 3 (4), 4 (5)

Process child 3 (4):

- No children, good_components=0, remaining_size=1

Process child 4 (5):

- No children, good_components=0, remaining_size=1

Now, for vertex 2 (3):

- good_components += 0 (from 3) + 0 (from 4) =0

- remaining_size +=1 (from 3) +1 (from 4) =2

- since remaining_size >=x (2>=2), good_components +=1, remaining_size=0

Wait, in the code, it's:

if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >=x:

tree.vertices[v].good_components +=1

else:

tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

So, for vertex 2 (3):

- remaining_size=2 >=2, so good_components +=1, and remaining_size=0

For vertex 0 (1):

- good_components +=0 (from child 1) +1 (from child 2, since its remaining_size was >=x)

- remaining_size +=1 (from child 1) +0 (from child 2) =1

So, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Now, in func_3:

1 >1? No

1==1 and 1>=2? No

So, returns False, but in reality, it's possible.

Hmm, seems like the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the way good_components is calculated is not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is flawed.

Let me think about another way to solve this problem.

Since the tree is a special graph with no cycles, perhaps I can use tree DP or some subtree properties.

I need to remove exactly k edges to get components with at least x vertices each.

An alternative approach could be to find all possible ways to remove k edges and check the sizes, but that's too slow for n up to 1e5.

So, binary search on x seems reasonable.

Now, for a given x, I need to check if I can remove k edges such that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

This sounds like I need to select k edges to remove such that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But how to efficiently check this?

One idea is to find the minimal number of edges whose removal ensures all components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is <=k.

But I need exactly k edges.

Wait, but the problem requires exactly k edges to be removed.

So, perhaps I need to find if there's a set of k edges whose removal results in all components having at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Another way is to consider that after removing k edges, there are k+1 components, each of size at least x, and the sum of the sizes is n.

So, (k+1)*x <=n.

So, a quick check is if (k+1)*x <=n, otherwise, it's impossible.

The code doesn't seem to include this check, which might be necessary.

Moreover, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is <=k.

But the problem requires exactly k edges to be removed, so it's not sufficient to remove <=k edges.

I need to remove exactly k edges.

This seems more complicated.

Maybe I can use the fact that in a tree, the number of components after removing edges is equal to the number of edges removed plus one.

So, if I remove k edges, I get k+1 components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices is n, which must be at least (k+1)*x.

Moreover, I need to choose which edges to remove to achieve this.

Perhaps I can find the smallest possible x such that the tree can be divided into at least k+1 components, each of size at least x.

But I need exactly k+1 components.

Wait, actually, since removing k edges always results in k+1 components, I just need to ensure that all of them have at least x vertices.

So, perhaps I can iterate over all possible x, from 1 to n, and check if after removing k edges, all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

But how?

Maybe I can think in terms of the minimal subtree sizes.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all remaining components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is <=k.

But since I need to remove exactly k edges, it's more restrictive.

I think the correct approach is:

- For a given x, find the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

- If this minimal number is <=k, then it's possible, and I can try a larger x.

- Otherwise, I need to try a smaller x.

But the problem requires removing exactly k edges, so I need to ensure that removing k edges achieves the desired component sizes.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a binary search on x, and for each x, compute the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

Then, if this minimal number is <=k, but I need to remove exactly k edges, so I need to ensure that removing k edges achieves the desired component sizes.

Wait, no, because removing more edges than necessary might split components further, which could violate the condition.

Wait, actually, in a tree, removing more edges will only split components further, so if removing m edges (m<=k) achieves the desired component sizes, then removing k edges can still achieve it by removing m edges and then removing k-m edges within the components, which won't violate the size constraints since the components are already at least x.

Wait, no, removing additional edges within components can split them further, but since the original components already have at least x vertices, splitting them further into smaller components with at least x vertices is still acceptable, as long as all resulting components have at least x vertices.

So, if I can achieve the desired component sizes by removing m edges where m<=k, then I can remove k edges by removing m edges to achieve the desired components and then removing k-m edges within the components without violating the size constraints.

Hence, it's sufficient to check if the minimal number of edges to remove to achieve all components having at least x vertices is <=k.

Therefore, the binary search approach seems correct.

Now, in the code, func_3 seems to be checking this, but in the example, it's not working as expected.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in how good_components and remaining_size are calculated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a tree, and I want to remove edges to maximize x, such that each component has at least x vertices.

I can think of it as finding a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

This is equivalent to finding a way to select k edges whose removal results in components with at least x vertices each.

So, in func_3, they are trying to count the number of components that have at least x vertices.

But perhaps their counting is incorrect.

Let me look again at func_1.

def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):

stack = [(s, False)]

while stack:

(v, postorder) = stack.pop()

if not postorder:

stack.append((v, True))

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

stack.append((u, False))

if postorder:

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components

if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >=x:

tree.vertices[v].good_components +=1

else:

tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

Wait, in this function, they are performing a postorder traversal to calculate good_components and remaining_size for each node.

For each node v, good_components is the sum of good_components of its children, plus one if its remaining_size >=x.

remaining_size of v is the sum of remaining_sizes of its children that don't have remaining_size >=x, plus one for v itself.

This seems correct for counting the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices.

Then, in func_3, they check if good_components >k or good_components==k and remaining_size >=x.

In the example, for x=2:

- good_components=1 (the component {3,4,5} has at least 2 vertices)

- remaining_size=2 ({1,2} has 2 vertices)

- So, good_components==1 and remaining_size>=2, which should return True.

But earlier, I thought it would return False, but actually, in the simulation:

For vertex 2 (3):

- children: 3 (4), 4 (5)

- For child 3 (4): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 4 (5): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1+1=2

- Since remaining_size=2 >=2, good_components +=1, remaining_size=0

For vertex 0 (1):

- children:1 (2), 2 (3)

- For child 1 (2): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 2 (3): good_components +=1 (from child 2), and remaining_size +=0

- So, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Then, in func_3:

- good_components==1 and remaining_size=1 <2, so returns False

But according to the problem, it should return True for x=2.

So, there is a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the remaining_size for vertex 0 (1).

Let me check again.

For vertex 2 (3):

- children:3 (4),4 (5)

- For child 3 (4): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 4 (5): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1+1=2

- Since remaining_size=2 >=2, good_components +=1, remaining_size=0

For vertex 0 (1):

- children:1 (2),2 (3)

- For child 1 (2): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 2 (3): good_components +=1 (from child 2), and remaining_size +=0

- So, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Then, in func_3:

- good_components==1 and remaining_size=1 <2, so returns False

But in reality, it's possible to remove the edge between 1 and 3, resulting in two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Perhaps the issue is in how remaining_size is calculated.

In func_1, when a child's remaining_size >=x, it's considered a good component and added to good_components, and its remaining_size is not added to the parent's remaining_size.

Otherwise, its remaining_size is added to the parent's remaining_size.

So, in this case, for vertex 0 (1):

- child 1 (2): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- child 2 (3): remaining_size=0 (since it was set to 0 in vertex 2), and good_components +=1

- So, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Then, the condition in func_3 is good_components==1 and remaining_size>=2, which is False.

But it should be True.

Perhaps the remaining_size for vertex 2 (3) should be 2, not 0.

Wait, in func_1, if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >=x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components +=1, else tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

So, for vertex 2 (3), remaining_size=0, since it was set to 0 after considering the good_component.

But perhaps this is incorrect.

Maybe remaining_size should be the sum of the sizes of all subtrees that are not good components.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I define remaining_size as the size of the subtree excluding the good components.

Then, for vertex 2 (3), since its subtree can be a good component (remaining_size=2 >=2), so its remaining_size is set to 0.

Then, for vertex 0 (1), remaining_size=1 (itself) +1 (from child 1)=2

Then, good_components=1 (from child 2), remaining_size=2 >=2, so it should return True.

But according to the code, it's returning False.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in func_3.

Wait, in func_3, it's:

if good_components >k:

return True

elif good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x:

return True

else:

return False

In the example, good_components==1 and remaining_size=2 >=2, so it should return True.

But according to my earlier simulation, remaining_size=1 <2, so it returns False.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me simulate again.

For vertex 3 (4):

- no children, remaining_size=1

For vertex 4 (5):

- no children, remaining_size=1

For vertex 2 (3):

- children:3 (4),4 (5)

- For child 3 (4): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 4 (5): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1+1=2

- Since remaining_size=2 >=2, good_components +=1, remaining_size=0

For vertex 1 (2):

- no children, remaining_size=1

For vertex 0 (1):

- children:1 (2),2 (3)

- For child 1 (2): remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 2 (3): good_components +=1, remaining_size +=0

- So, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Hence, good_components==1 and remaining_size=1 <2, so returns False.

But according to the problem, it should return True for x=2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Perhaps the issue is that the remaining_size for vertex 0 (1) should include itself.

Wait, in func_1, each node starts with subtree_size=1, which includes itself.

So, for vertex 0 (1):

- remaining_size =1 (itself) +1 (from child 1)=2

- good_components=1 (from child 2)

Then, in func_3, good_components==1 and remaining_size=2 >=2, so it should return True.

But according to the code, it's returning False.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at func_1:

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components

if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >=x:

tree.vertices[v].good_components +=1

else:

tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

So, for vertex 0 (1):

- good_components +=0 (from child 1) +0 (from child 2)=0

- Then, for child 1: remaining_size=1 <2, so add to remaining_size:1

- For child 2: remaining_size=0 <2, so add to remaining_size:1+0=1

- So, remaining_size=1

- Then, since remaining_size=1 <2, don't add to good_components

Wait, perhaps I missed that.

Wait, for vertex 2 (3):

- good_components +=0 (from child 3) +0 (from child 4)=0

- For child 3: remaining_size=1 <2, add to remaining_size:1

- For child 4: remaining_size=1 <2, add to remaining_size:1+1=2

- Since remaining_size=2 >=2, good_components +=1, remaining_size=0

For vertex 0 (1):

- good_components +=0 (from child 1) +1 (from child 2)=1

- For child 1: remaining_size=1 <2, add to remaining_size:1

- For child 2: remaining_size=0 <2, add to remaining_size:1+0=1

- So, remaining_size=1

Hence, good_components=1, remaining_size=1

Then, in func_3:

1 >1? No

1==1 and 1>=2? 1<2, so False

But according to the problem, it should be True.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Perhaps the issue is that the remaining_size for vertex 0 should be considered as the entire tree's size, which is 5.

Wait, in func_1, each node starts with subtree_size=1, and accumulates the remaining_size from its children.

Wait, perhaps I need to set the initial remaining_size to subtree_size.

Let me check the initialization.

In the Tree class, when creating TreeNode, subtree_size=1.

Then, in root_tree_non_recursive, it sets subtree_size correctly by summing up children's subtree_size.

So, subtree_size is correct.

But in func_1, remaining_size is initialized to 1, and then updated based on children.

Wait, perhaps remaining_size should be subtree_size minus the sum of the sizes of the good_components.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at another approach.

I found that the code is incorrect based on the example.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}}\]
