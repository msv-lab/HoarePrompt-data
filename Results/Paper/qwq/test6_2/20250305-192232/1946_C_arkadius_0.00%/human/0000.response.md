Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

Okay, so trees are special because they're connected graphs with no cycles, and removing any edge will split them into exactly two connected components. That's a crucial property here.

Given that, if I remove k edges, the tree will be split into k+1 connected components. Each of these components must have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the number of components that have fewer vertices, because x is limited by the smallest component. So, I should aim to have as many large components as possible.

But since I have to remove exactly k edges, leading to k+1 components, I need to ensure that none of these components is smaller than x.

This sounds like a binary search problem on x, where for each candidate x, I check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Yes, binary search seems appropriate here because the possible values of x range from 1 to n, and I can check for each x whether it's feasible.

So, I'll set up a binary search where the lower bound is 1 and the upper bound is n.

In each iteration, I'll pick a mid value and check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least mid vertices.

If it is possible, I'll try to increase mid by moving the lower bound up. If not, I'll decrease the upper bound.

Now, the key part is implementing the feasibility check for a given x.

Given that it's a tree, there's a unique path between any two vertices, and removing an edge will split the tree into two subtrees.

I need a way to select k edges to remove such that each resulting subtree has at least x vertices.

One approach is to consider the sizes of subtrees. If I can find a way to partition the tree into k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges, then x is feasible.

To do this efficiently, I need an algorithm that can compute the subtree sizes and decide which edges to remove.

I think a good way is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) from the root and calculate the size of each subtree.

Let's consider rooting the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say vertex 0.

Then, I can perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

Once I have the subtree sizes, I need to decide which edges to remove.

I need to remove edges such that the resulting components all have at least x vertices.

One idea is to remove edges that connect a subtree of size at least x to the rest of the tree.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges, and ensure that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to maximize x, meaning I want the smallest number of components, each as large as possible.

Since removing an edge increases the number of components by one, I need to remove exactly k edges to get k+1 components.

But I need to ensure that none of these components is smaller than x.

So, for a given x, I need to find if there's a way to remove k edges such that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Alternatively, I can think about the minimum number of edges I need to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

If that minimum number is less than or equal to k, then x is feasible.

Wait, but I have to remove exactly k edges, not at most k.

So, it's a bit more constrained.

I need to remove exactly k edges and ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit more delicate.

Maybe I can compute the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and then check if this number is equal to k.

But I need to make sure that removing exactly k edges achieves this, not more or less.

Hmm.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Root the tree at an arbitrary vertex.

- Compute the size of each subtree.

- Then, try to find a set of k edges to remove such that no resulting component has fewer than x vertices.

To implement this, I can think of dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Alternatively, since it's a tree, I can consider the heavy-light decomposition or similar techniques, but that might be overkill.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that in a tree, removing edges to create components is equivalent to partitioning the tree into k+1 subtrees.

I need to choose k edges to remove such that each of the k+1 resulting subtrees has at least x vertices.

So, I need to select k edges such that no subtree on either side of the edge has fewer than x vertices.

Wait, but in a tree, removing an edge splits the tree into two parts: the subtree rooted at one end and the rest of the tree.

So, for each edge, I can look at the subtree size on one side and check if it's at least x and the remaining tree is also at least x.

But I need to ensure that for all k edges I remove, this condition holds.

Moreover, I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components still have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Root the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say vertex 0.

2. Compute the size of each subtree.

3. For a given x, try to count the maximum number of edges I can remove such that each resulting component has at least x vertices.

4. If this maximum number is at least k, then x is feasible.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges, not at least k.

So, perhaps I need to count the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and check if this number is less than or equal to k.

But actually, I need to remove exactly k edges, so it's not just a matter of minimum or maximum.

I think the correct approach is to find the maximum x such that I can remove k edges and all components have at least x vertices.

So, for each x, I need to check if there exists a set of k edges whose removal results in components all having at least x vertices.

This sounds like it could be done using a binary search on x, and for each x, checking if I can remove k edges to satisfy the condition.

Now, to implement the feasibility check for a given x, I need an efficient way to determine if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

Given that it's a tree, I can think of removing edges that connect subtrees of size at least x.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the tree will be split into k+1 components, each of size at least x, by removing k edges.

So, the total number of vertices is n, and if each component has at least x vertices, then the maximum number of components is floor(n / x).

But since I have to remove exactly k edges, leading to k+1 components, I need to ensure that k+1 <= floor(n / x).

Wait, that's an interesting point.

So, the number of components after removing k edges is k+1.

Each component must have at least x vertices, so k+1 <= floor(n / x).

This gives me a necessary condition: k+1 <= floor(n / x).

But I need to maximize x, so I can set x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But this is just a upper bound. I need to check if it's actually possible to remove k edges to achieve this.

Because the tree structure might not allow it, even if the inequality holds.

So, while floor(n / (k+1)) gives me an upper bound, I need to verify if it's achievable given the tree structure.

Hence, I still need to implement the binary search approach.

Now, to implement the feasibility check for a given x, I need to find if I can remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

One way to approach this is to consider that I need to preserve certain edges that connect parts of the tree that are too small to be separated.

Wait, perhaps another angle: consider that I need to remove edges that connect subtrees of size at least x to the rest of the tree.

So, for each edge, if both sides have at least x vertices, then I can potentially remove that edge.

But I need to remove exactly k such edges.

Wait, but in reality, when I remove an edge, I split the tree into two parts. I need to ensure that both parts have at least x vertices.

So, for an edge connecting u and v, if the subtree size rooted at u is greater than or equal to x and the remaining tree size is greater than or equal to x, then I can remove that edge.

Similarly, if the subtree size rooted at v is greater than or equal to x and the remaining tree size is greater than or equal to x, then I can remove that edge.

Wait, but in a tree, removing an edge u-v will create two trees: one rooted at u and the other rooted at v, each containing some subtrees.

So, for each edge u-v, if the subtree size rooted at u is >= x and the remaining tree size (which is n - subtree_size(u)) >= x, then I can remove that edge.

Similarly, if the subtree size rooted at v is >= x and the remaining tree size is >= x, then I can remove that edge.

But since u and v are connected by an edge, only one of these conditions will hold for a given edge, depending on which side is considered the subtree.

Wait, actually, in a tree, for any edge, removing it will create two trees: one rooted at u and the other rooted at v, assuming we've rooted the tree at some vertex.

So, if I root the tree at vertex 0, then for any edge u-v, where u is the parent of v, removing that edge will separate the subtree rooted at v from the rest of the tree.

So, the subtree rooted at v has size subtree_size(v), and the remaining tree has size n - subtree_size(v).

Therefore, I can remove that edge only if both subtree_size(v) >= x and n - subtree_size(v) >= x.

Similarly, if v is the parent of u, then I can remove the edge only if subtree_size(u) >= x and n - subtree_size(u) >= x.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar.

Looking at the code, it defines a Tree class with vertices, each having edges, children, subtree sizes, parents, etc.

It also has functions func_1, func_2, func_3, func_4, and func_5.

Func_5 seems to be the main function that reads input, builds the tree, roots it, and then calls func_4 to perform the binary search on x.

Func_4 performs the binary search between 1 and n, and for each mid value, it calls func_3 to check feasibility.

Func_3 calls func_1 to compute some values.

Func_1 seems to be performing a postorder traversal using a stack to calculate some good_components and remaining_size.

Similarly, func_2 seems to be a recursive version of the same thing.

But I need to understand what good_components and remaining_size represent.

In func_1, good_components seems to count the number of subtrees that have size >= x, and remaining_size accumulates the sizes of subtrees that are smaller than x.

Then, in func_3, if good_components > k, or good_components == k and remaining_size >= x, it returns True.

Wait, let's think about this.

If good_components > k, that means I have more than k subtrees that are >= x, which might not directly correspond to removing k edges.

I need to think differently.

Actually, in the problem, removing k edges results in k+1 components.

So, if I can have k+1 components each with at least x vertices by removing k edges, then x is feasible.

But in func_3, it seems to be checking if the number of good_components (which are components with size >= x) is greater than k, or equal to k with the remaining size >= x.

I'm not entirely sure if this logic is correct.

Let me think about the example provided.

In the first example:

5 vertices, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

   ├─4

   └─5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with size >=2.

So, for x=2, it's feasible.

For x=3, is it feasible?

If I remove one edge, say between 1 and 3, I get components of size 2 and 3.

But 2 < 3, so it's not feasible for x=3.

Another option: remove edge between 3 and 4.

Then components are {1,2,3,5} and {4}.

{4} has size 1 < 3, so not feasible.

Similarly, removing edge between 3 and 5:

Components {1,2,3,4} and {5}, sizes 4 and 1, again 1 < 3.

So, for x=3, it's not possible with k=1.

Hence, the maximum x is 2.

The code seems to correctly handle this case.

But I need to generalize this logic.

In func_1, it performs a postorder traversal, counting good_components and accumulating remaining_size.

I think good_components counts the number of subtrees that have size >= x, and remaining_size accumulates the sizes of subtrees that are smaller than x.

Then, if good_components > k, it means I have more than k subtrees that are >= x, which might be okay, but I need to make sure that the remaining_size is also >= x if good_components == k.

Wait, but in the example above, for x=2, good_components=2 (since both {1,2} and {3,4,5} have size >=2), and k=1.

According to func_3, if good_components > k, return True.

But in this case, good_components=2 > k=1, so it returns True.

Similarly, for x=3, good_components=1 (only {3,4,5} has size >=3), and remaining_size=2 (from {1,2}).

Since good_components == k=1 and remaining_size >= x=3 is False, it returns False, which is correct.

So, perhaps this logic works.

Let me think about another example.

Consider n=2, k=1.

Only one edge between 1 and 2.

Removing that edge results in two components of size 1.

So, for x=1, it's feasible.

For x=2, not feasible because both components have size 1 < 2.

So, maximum x is 1.

According to the code, for x=1, good_components=0, remaining_size=2.

Since good_components=0 <= k=1, and remaining_size >= x=1, it should return True.

Wait, but in func_3, it checks if good_components > k or (good_components == k and remaining_size >= x).

In this case, good_components=0 <= k=1, and remaining_size=2 >=1, so it should return True.

Wait, but according to the code, it would return False because good_components=0 < k=1, and remaining_size >=x is True, but the condition is good_components > k or (good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x).

So, it would return False in this case, which is incorrect because x=1 should be feasible.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how good_components and remaining_size are calculated.

In this case, for x=1:

- Start at root 0, with subtree_size=2.

- It has one child, vertex 1.

- subtree_size(1)=1.

- Since 1 >=1, good_components=1.

- remaining_size=1 (from vertex 0 itself).

- So, good_components=1 > k=1? No.

- good_components=1 ==k=1 and remaining_size=1 >=x=1? Yes.

- So, it returns True, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, good_components=1 (from vertex 1), and remaining_size=1 (from vertex 0).

Hence, good_components ==k=1 and remaining_size >=x=1, so it returns True.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case: n=6, k=1.

A straight line tree: 1-2-3-4-5-6.

Removing one edge will result in two components.

To maximize x, we can remove an edge such that the components are as balanced as possible.

For example, removing edge between 3 and 4:

Components {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both of size 3.

So, x=3 is achievable.

Is there a way to achieve x=4?

No, because removing any one edge will result in one component with 5 vertices and one with 1 vertex, or two components with 4 and 2 vertices, etc., but none with both components having at least 4 vertices.

Hence, x=3 is the maximum.

According to the code, for x=3:

- good_components would be 2 (both components have size >=3).

- k=1.

- So, good_components > k? 2 >1, True.

Hence, it returns True for x=3.

For x=4:

- good_components=0 (no component has size >=4).

- remaining_size=6.

- good_components > k? 0 >1? No.

- good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x? 0==1? No.

- So, returns False.

Hence, the maximum x is 3, which matches the expected answer.

Another test case: n=3, k=1.

Tree: 1-2-3.

Removing one edge:

- Remove edge between 1 and 2: components {1} and {2,3}, sizes 1 and 2.

- Remove edge between 2 and 3: components {1,2} and {3}, sizes 2 and 1.

For x=1: both options have components >=1, so x=1 is feasible.

For x=2: only if we remove edge between 1 and 2, component {2,3} has size 2, and {1} has size 1 <2. So, not feasible.

For x=3: not feasible.

Hence, maximum x is 2.

According to the code:

For x=2:

- good_components=1 (only {2,3} or {1,2} has size >=2).

- remaining_size=1.

- good_components > k? 1 >1? No.

- good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x? 1==1 and 1>=2? No.

- So, returns False.

Wait, but x=2 should be feasible.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

In this case, when removing edge between 1 and 2, components are {1} and {2,3}.

{1} has size 1 <2, so it's not feasible for x=2.

Similarly, removing edge between 2 and 3 results in {1,2} and {3}.

{3} has size 1 <2.

Hence, for x=2, it's not feasible, because no matter which edge I remove, one of the components will have size <2.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, func_3 should return False for x=2, which is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=5, k=1, x=2 was feasible, but in this n=3, k=1, x=2 is not feasible.

Is that correct?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

In n=3, k=1, x=2 is not feasible because whichever edge I remove, one of the components will have size 1, which is less than 2.

Hence, the maximum x is 1.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for n=2, k=1, the answer is 1.

For n=3, k=1, perhaps the answer is 1 as well.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, for n=3, k=1, the answer is 1.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3, k=1, the output is 1.

But according to the code, for x=1:

- good_components=0 (no subtree has size >=1, since all subtrees have size >=1, but according to the implementation, it might count differently).

Wait, perhaps I need to look into the code more carefully.

Looking back at func_1:

It performs a postorder traversal, and for each node, it accumulates good_components and remaining_size.

Specifically, for each child, it adds the child's good_components to the parent's good_components.

If the child's remaining_size >=x, it adds 1 to good_components.

Else, it adds the child's remaining_size to the parent's remaining_size.

Then, finally, it returns the good_components and remaining_size for the root.

Wait, perhaps I need to see the actual implementation.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):

stack = [(s, False)]

while stack:

(v, postorder) = stack.pop()

if not postorder:

stack.append((v, True))

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

stack.append((u, False))

if postorder:

for u in tree.vertices[v].children:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components

if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:

tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1

else:

tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size

return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

So, in postorder, for each child u of v:

- If u's remaining_size >=x, then increment good_components.

- Else, add u's remaining_size to v's remaining_size.

Then, for v itself, it's remaining_size is initially 1.

Hence, it seems that good_components counts the number of subtrees that have size >=x, and remaining_size accumulates the sizes of subtrees that are smaller than x.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=3, k=1:

Let's say the tree is 1-2-3, rooted at 1.

Subtree sizes:

- 1: 3

- 2: 2

- 3: 1

For x=2:

- At node 3: remaining_size=1, good_components=0 (since 1 <2).

- At node 2: has child 3.

- Since 3's remaining_size=1 <2, so remaining_size=1+1=2.

- Then, remaining_size=2 >=2, so good_components=1.

- At node 1: has child 2.

- 2's remaining_size=2 >=2, so good_components=1.

- Hence, total good_components=1, remaining_size=1.

Then, func_3 checks if good_components > k or (good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x).

Here, good_components=1 ==k=1, and remaining_size=1 <x=2, so returns False.

Hence, x=2 is not feasible, which is correct.

For x=1:

- At node 3: remaining_size=1, good_components=1 (since 1 >=1).

- At node 2: has child 3.

- 3's remaining_size=1 >=1, so good_components=1.

- At node 1: has child 2.

- 2's remaining_size=1 >=1, so good_components=1.

- Hence, total good_components=1, remaining_size=1.

- good_components ==k=1 and remaining_size >=x=1, so returns True.

Hence, x=1 is feasible.

So, the code seems to handle this correctly.

Another test case: n=6, k=2.

A straight line tree: 1-2-3-4-5-6.

Removing two edges.

Possible removals:

- Remove edges between 2 and 3, and between 4 and 5.

- Components: {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}, all with size 2.

- So, x=2 is feasible.

- Can x=3 be feasible?

- To achieve x=3, need to have all components with at least 3 vertices.

- Removing two edges, possible splits:

- Remove edges between 3 and 4, and between 5 and 6.

- Components: {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, both with size 3.

- So, x=3 is feasible.

- Can x=4 be feasible?

- Removing two edges, possible splits:

- Remove edges between 2 and 3, and between 5 and 6.

- Components: {1,2}, {3,4,5}, {6}.

- {6} has size 1 <4.

- Not feasible.

- Another option: remove edges between 3 and 4, and between 4 and 5.

- Components: {1,2,3}, {4}, {5,6}.

- {4} has size 1 <4.

- Not feasible.

- So, x=3 is the maximum.

According to the code, for x=3:

- good_components=2 (two components with size >=3).

- k=2.

- good_components ==k=2 and remaining_size=0 >=x=3? remaining_size=0.

- Wait, let's see.

In this case, for x=3:

- At node 6: remaining_size=1, good_components=0.

- At node 5: has child 6.

- 6's remaining_size=1 <3, so remaining_size=1+1=2.

- 2 <3, so good_components=0.

- At node 4: has child 5.

- 5's remaining_size=2 <3, so remaining_size=1+2=3.

- 3 >=3, so good_components=1.

- At node 3: has child 4.

- 4's remaining_size=3 >=3, so good_components=1.

- At node 2: has child 3.

- 3's remaining_size=3 >=3, so good_components=1.

- At node 1: has child 2.

- 2's remaining_size=1 <3, so remaining_size=1+1=2.

- Then, good_components=1 (from node 2's good_components).

- So, total good_components=1, remaining_size=2.

- good_components ==k=2? 1 !=2, and remaining_size >=x=3? 2 <3.

- So, returns False.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, for x=3, it should be feasible.

Hmm, seems like there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I need to look more carefully at how good_components and remaining_size are calculated.

Looking back at the code:

In func_1, for each node, it accumulates good_components and remaining_size based on its children.

Specifically, for each child u:

- If u's remaining_size >=x, then increment good_components.

- Else, add u's remaining_size to the parent's remaining_size.

Additionally, the parent's remaining_size starts at 1 (its own vertex).

So, in the above example:

n=6, k=2, x=3.

Let's root at node 1.

Subtree sizes:

- 1:6

- 2:5

- 3:4

- 4:3

- 5:2

- 6:1

Processing in postorder:

Start with node 6:

- remaining_size=1, good_components=0.

Node 5:

- has child 6.

- 6's remaining_size=1 <3, so remaining_size=1+1=2.

- 2 <3, so good_components=0.

Node 4:

- has child 5.

- 5's remaining_size=2 <3, so remaining_size=1+2=3.

- 3 >=3, so good_components=1.

Node 3:

- has child 4.

- 4's remaining_size=3 >=3, so good_components=1.

Node 2:

- has child 3.

- 3's remaining_size=3 >=3, so good_components=1.

Node 1:

- has child 2.

- 2's remaining_size=1 <3, so remaining_size=1+1=2.

- good_components=1 (from child 2's good_components).

Hence, total good_components=1, remaining_size=2.

Since good_components ==k=2 and remaining_size >=x=3? 1 !=2, and 2 <3, so returns False.

But according to the earlier reasoning, for x=3, it should be feasible by removing two edges to get two components of size 3.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps good_components counts the number of subtrees that have size >=x and are separated by removing an edge.

But in this case, good_components=1, which seems insufficient.

Wait, maybe the logic in func_3 is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that good_components should count the number of edges that can be removed such that both sides have at least x vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the entire approach.

An alternative approach could be to count the number of edges that can be removed such that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

Then, if the number of such removable edges is at least k, and after removing k such edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices, then x is feasible.

But this seems complicated.

Another idea: for a given x, find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

Then, check if this minimal number is <=k.

But in the problem, I have to remove exactly k edges, not at most k.

So, it's not sufficient to check if the minimal number is <=k; I need exactly k.

This makes it more tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and also compute the maximal number of such edges.

Then, check if k is within this range.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in a tree, the number of components after removing edges is equal to the number of edges removed plus one.

Each removal increases the number of components by one.

I need to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

So, n must be at least (k+1)*x.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, an initial check is n >= (k+1)*x.

But I need to maximize x, so x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But I need to check if it's possible to remove k edges to achieve this.

The code seems to perform a binary search on x and uses func_3 to check feasibility.

In func_3, it checks if good_components > k or (good_components ==k and remaining_size >=x).

But in the earlier example, for n=6, k=2, x=3, good_components=1 <k=2, and remaining_size=2 <x=3, so it returns False, but according to the problem, x=3 should be achievable.

Hence, perhaps the logic in func_3 is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that good_components should be equal to k+1.

Because removing k edges results in k+
