Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers. For example, if n is 12, the numbers become 1 to 9 as they are, 10 becomes 1+0=1, 11 becomes 1+1=2, and 12 becomes 1+2=3. Adding them up gives 51, which matches the example.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have multiple test cases, up to 10,000 of them, and for each test case, n can be up to 200,000. That sounds like a lot, and with the time limit being only 0.5 seconds per test, I need an efficient solution.

Brute force approach would be to iterate from 1 to n, calculate the sum of digits for each number, and add them up. But with n up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000, that would be too slow. I need a smarter way to compute the sum without iterating through each number individually for large n.

Let me think about the properties of the sum of digits. The sum of digits of a number is equivalent to the number modulo 9, except when the number is divisible by 9, in which case the sum is 9. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.

Wait, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help calculate the sum of digit sums from 1 to n efficiently.

Let me consider how the sum of digits works. For numbers from 1 to 9, the sum is just the number itself. From 10 to 19, it's 1 + digits from 0 to 9, which is 1*10 + (0+1+2+...+9). Similarly, from 20 to 29, it's 2*10 + (0+1+2+...+9), and so on.

Wait, maybe I can generalize this. For numbers from a to b, where a and b have the same number of digits, I can calculate the sum of digits based on their place values.

But considering the constraints, I need something faster. Maybe precomputing some values or finding a mathematical formula.

Let me try to find a formula for the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

First, I need to consider the number of digits in n. Let's denote d as the number of digits in n.

For numbers with fewer digits than n, I can calculate the sum easily.

For numbers with the same number of digits as n, I need to handle them separately.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of digit dp or some combinatorial approach to calculate the sum efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a precomputed prefix sum that I can use.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be trying to precompute the sum of digit sums up to a certain value.

Let's analyze the given program step by step.

The function func_1() is defined, which seems to be the main function to solve the problem.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, it reads t integers, n, and stores them in a list called numbers.

Next, it creates a list called values with max(numbers) + 1 elements, initialized to 0.

It also creates a list called sum_values with the same length, initialized to 0.

It initializes a variable total to 0.

Then, it loops from 0 to 9, sets values[i] to i, adds i to total, and sets sum_values[i] to total.

So, for i from 0 to 9, values[i] is i, and sum_values[i] is the cumulative sum up to i.

Then, it loops from 10 to n inclusive.

Wait, but n is a list of numbers, so I think there's an issue here.

Looking closer, n is a list of numbers from the input, and it's trying to set the loop from 10 to n + 1, but n is a list, not a single value.

This seems problematic.

Ah, wait, in the loop, it's using n as the maximum value in numbers, since it's initializing values and sum_values with max(numbers) + 1.

So, it's precomputing the sum of digit sums up to the maximum n among all test cases.

That makes sense for efficiency, so it doesn't have to compute it multiple times for different test cases.

Now, in the loop from 10 to n inclusive, it converts i to a string, takes the last character and converts it back to an integer, which is the last digit.

Then, it takes the remainder by removing the last digit.

Then, it sets values[i] to values[last] + values[remainder].

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Because values[last] is the sum of digits of the last digit, which is just the last digit itself since it's less than 10.

And values[remainder] is the sum of digits of the remaining number.

So, in essence, it's trying to compute the sum of digits of i by adding the sum of digits of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remaining number.

But this seems recursive, and it might work, but I need to verify if this is correct.

Then, it calculates sum_total as values[i] + sum_values[i - 1], which seems to be accumulating the sum of digit sums up to i.

Finally, it sets sum_values[i] to sum_total.

After precomputing all these values, it loops through each n in numbers and prints sum_values[n].

So, the idea is to precompute the sum of digit sums up to the maximum n across all test cases, and then for each test case, just output the precomputed sum for that n.

This should be efficient enough given the time constraints, as the precomputation is done only once.

But I need to check if the precomputation is correct.

Looking back at the precomputation loop, I'm a bit suspicious about how it calculates values[i] as values[last] + values[remainder].

Let's take an example.

Suppose i = 12.

Last digit is 2, remainder is 1.

values[2] = 2, values[1] = 1.

So, values[12] = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the sum of digits of 12.

Another example, i = 234.

Last digit is 4, remainder is 23.

values[4] = 4, values[23] = ?

To compute values[23], it would look at last digit 3, remainder 2.

values[3] = 3, values[2] = 2.

So, values[23] = 3 + 2 = 5.

Then, values[234] = 4 + values[23] = 4 + 5 = 9, which is correct for the sum of digits of 234.

So, this seems to be working correctly.

Therefore, the precomputation of values[i] seems correct.

Now, for sum_values[i], it's the cumulative sum of values up to i.

So, sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i].

This is a straightforward cumulative sum calculation, which should be correct.

Therefore, the overall approach seems correct.

Given that, I can conclude that the provided program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
