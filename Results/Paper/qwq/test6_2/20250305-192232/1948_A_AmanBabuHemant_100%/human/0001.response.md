Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character "special." From the example given, in the string "AAABAACC," there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - only has a neighbor to the right, which is 'A'. So, it's equal to its only neighbor. Does that make it special? According to the definition, it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which in this case is the only neighbor. So, yes.

- Position 2: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' on the left and 'A' on the right. It's equal to both neighbors, so it's not special.

- Position 3: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' and 'B'. It's equal to only the left neighbor, so it's special.

- Position 4: 'B' - neighbors are 'A' and 'A'. It's not equal to either neighbor, so it's not special.

- Position 5: 'A' - neighbors are 'B' and 'A'. It's equal to the right neighbor, so it's special.

- Position 6: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' and 'C'. It's equal to the left neighbor, so it's special.

- Position 7: 'C' - neighbors are 'A' and 'C'. It's equal to the right neighbor, so it's special.

- Position 8: 'C' - only has a left neighbor 'C'. So, it's equal to its only neighbor, making it special.

Okay, that matches the example. So, special characters are those that are equal to exactly one of their neighbors.

Now, I need to build such a string for a given n, where the string has exactly n special characters. The string should be composed of uppercase letters, and its length should be at most 200.

First, think about the minimal string length required for a given n. Since each special character contributes to the count, I need to arrange the characters such that exactly n characters are special.

Let me consider small values of n to see if I can find a pattern or a general approach.

**Case 1: n = 1**

Is it possible to have a string with exactly 1 special character?

- If I have a string like "A", it has only one character, which has no neighbors, so it's not special. So, n=1 is impossible here.

- If I have "AA", both 'A's have neighbors equal to themselves, but since they have two equal neighbors, they are not special.

- If I have "AB", 'A' is special (only one neighbor 'B', which is different), and 'B' is special (only one neighbor 'A', which is different). So, both are special, totaling 2, which is more than n=1.

- If I have "ABA", 'A' at position 1 is special (neighbor 'B' is different), 'B' is not special (neighbors 'A' and 'A', different), 'A' at position 3 is special. So, two special characters again.

It seems hard to have an odd number of special characters because characters tend to make pairs.

Wait, in "AB", both are special, totaling 2. In "AAA", let's see:

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'A' on the right, equal, so not special.

- 'A' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'A', both equal, so not special.

- 'A' at pos3: neighbor 'A' on the left, equal, so not special.

So, no special characters.

In "AAB":

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'A', equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'B', equal to one, special.

- 'B' at pos3: neighbor 'A', different, special.

Total special characters: 2.

Again, even number.

In "AAAB":

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'A', equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'A', both equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos3: neighbors 'A' and 'B', equal to one, special.

- 'B' at pos4: neighbor 'A', different, special.

Total special characters: 2.

Still even.

In "AAABB":

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'A', equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'A', both equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos3: neighbors 'A' and 'B', equal to one, special.

- 'B' at pos4: neighbors 'A' and 'B', different, special.

- 'B' at pos5: neighbor 'B', equal, not special.

Total special characters: 2.

Still even.

In "AABBC":

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'A', equal, not special.

- 'A' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'B', equal to one, special.

- 'B' at pos3: neighbors 'A' and 'B', different, special.

- 'B' at pos4: neighbors 'B' and 'C', equal to one, special.

- 'C' at pos5: neighbor 'B', different, special.

Total special characters: 4.

Even again.

Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. It seems that special characters come in pairs. Is that always the case?

Let me try to think of a string where the number of special characters is odd.

Suppose I have "AB":

- 'A' is special.

- 'B' is special.

Total: 2.

"ABC":

- 'A' is special (neighbor 'B', different).

- 'B' is not special (neighbors 'A' and 'C', different).

- 'C' is special (neighbor 'B', different).

Total: 2.

Again, even.

"In ABBA":

- 'A' at pos1: neighbor 'B', different, special.

- 'B' at pos2: neighbors 'A' and 'B', different, special.

- 'B' at pos3: neighbors 'B' and 'A', equal to one, special.

- 'A' at pos4: neighbor 'B', different, special.

Total: 4.

Even.

Wait, in "ABBA":

- 'A' at pos1: 'B' (different), special.

- 'B' at pos2: 'A' (different) and 'B' (equal), so equal to exactly one neighbor, special.

- 'B' at pos3: 'B' (equal) and 'A' (different), so equal to exactly one neighbor, special.

- 'A' at pos4: 'B' (different), special.

Total: 4.

Even.

Wait, in "ABAB":

- 'A' at pos1: 'B' (different), special.

- 'B' at pos2: 'A' (different) and 'A' (different), so equal to zero neighbors, not special.

- 'A' at pos3: 'B' (different) and 'B' (different), so equal to zero neighbors, not special.

- 'B' at pos4: 'A' (different), special.

Total: 2.

Even.

In "ABAC":

- 'A' at pos1: 'B' (different), special.

- 'B' at pos2: 'A' (different) and 'A' (different), not special.

- 'A' at pos3: 'B' (different) and 'C' (different), not special.

- 'C' at pos4: 'A' (different), special.

Total: 2.

Even.

It's consistently coming out even. Is it possible to have an odd number of special characters?

Let me consider a single character string, like "A". As I saw earlier, it has no special characters, which is even (0 is even).

Is there any string where the number of special characters is odd?

Wait, in the earlier examples, it's always even. Maybe it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.

Let me think about why that might be.

Each time a character is special, it's because it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Consider that for a character to be special, it must be equal to one neighbor and different from the other.

So, in a string, each special character contributes to this count, but perhaps there's a pairing going on.

Wait, maybe it's related to the handshaking lemma in graph theory, where each edge is counted twice.

But here, it's about characters and their neighbors.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a string S = s1 s2 s3 ... sn.

Each special character si (2 <= i <= n-1) is equal to exactly one of s(i-1) or s(i+1).

For the endpoints, s1 is special if s1 == s2, and sn is special if sn == s(n-1).

Wait, for endpoints, since they only have one neighbor, being equal to that neighbor makes them special.

For internal characters, being equal to exactly one neighbor makes them special.

So, for s1:

- If s1 == s2, then s1 is special.

- If s1 != s2, then s1 is not special.

Similarly, for sn:

- If sn == s(n-1), then sn is special.

- If sn != s(n-1), then sn is not special.

For internal characters si (1 < i < n):

- If si == s(i-1) XOR si == s(i+1), then si is special.

Wait, in terms of XOR:

If (si == s(i-1)) XOR (si == s(i+1)), then si is special.

Because XOR is true if exactly one condition is true.

So, si is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Now, considering this, perhaps there's a way to ensure that the total number of special characters is even.

Or maybe it's always even.

Wait, perhaps it's always even.

Let me consider the total number of special characters as the sum over all i of whether si is special.

So, total_special = sum over i of ( (si == s(i-1)) XOR (si == s(i+1)) )

But, perhaps I can think of this in terms of differences.

Wait, maybe think in terms of runs of identical characters.

In a string, there are runs of identical characters, separated by points where the character changes.

For example, in "AAABAACC":

- "AAAA" (run of A, length 4)

- "B" (run of B, length 1)

- "AA" (run of A, length 2)

- "CC" (run of C, length 2)

Now, in such a string, the special characters are those at the boundaries between different runs.

Wait, let's see:

- In "AAABAACC":

- Positions 1 to 4: 'A'

- Position 5: 'B'

- Positions 6 to 7: 'A'

- Positions 8 to 9: 'C'

So, the transitions are between these runs.

Special characters are those that are equal to exactly one neighbor.

So, in a run of length k, the characters at the ends are special if they are different from the neighboring character outside the run.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of run lengths.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have runs of characters, each run having a certain length.

Letâ€™s denote the lengths of the runs as l1, l2, l3, ..., lm, where m is the number of runs.

Then, for each run except the first and last:

- The first character of the run is special if l1 > 1 and the previous run's character is different.

- The last character of the run is special if ln > 1 and the next run's character is different.

Wait, perhaps it's getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each transition between different characters contributes to two special characters: the one at the end of the first run and the one at the beginning of the next run.

Wait, for example, in "AAABBB":

- 'A's: positions 1,2,3

- 'B's: positions 4,5,6

Then, position 3: 'A' != 'B', so 'A' at pos3 is special.

Position 4: 'B' != 'A', so 'B' at pos4 is special.

So, two special characters at the transition.

Similarly, in "AABBA":

- 'A's: pos1,2

- 'B's: pos3,4

- 'A': pos5

So, pos2: 'A' != 'B', special.

Pos3: 'B' != 'A', special.

Pos4: 'B' == 'A'? No, 'B' != 'A', but wait, pos4 and pos5: 'B' and 'A', so 'B' at pos4 is special.

Wait, pos4: 'B' != 'A', so 'B' is special.

Pos5: 'A' != 'B', so 'A' is special.

Wait, but according to the earlier definition, in "AABBA":

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A' on the right, not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A' on the left, != 'B' on the right, so equal to one neighbor, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' on the left, == 'B' on the right, special.

- Pos4: 'B' == 'B' on the left, != 'A' on the right, special.

- Pos5: 'A' != 'B' on the left, no right neighbor, so special.

Total special characters: pos2, pos3, pos4, pos5 -> 4.

Even again.

So, every time there's a transition between different characters, it creates two special characters: the last of the first run and the first of the second run.

Unless it's at the end of the string.

Wait, in "AABBA":

- Pos2: special.

- Pos3: special.

- Pos4: special.

- Pos5: special.

So, four special characters.

In "AABB":

- Pos2: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: 2.

Again, even.

In "AB":

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: 2.

Even.

In "ABC":

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', so not special.

- Pos3: 'C' != 'B', special.

Total: 2.

Even.

Wait, in "ABC":

Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', so not special.

Pos3: 'C' != 'B', special.

Total: 2.

Even.

In "ABCD":

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

- Pos3: 'C' != 'B' and 'C' != 'D', not special.

- Pos4: 'D' != 'C', special.

Total: 2.

Even.

Wait, in "ABC":

- Pos1: special.

- Pos2: not special.

- Pos3: special.

Total: 2.

Even.

In "ABCD":

- Pos1: special.

- Pos2: not special.

- Pos3: not special.

- Pos4: special.

Total: 2.

Even.

In "ABCDE":

- Pos1: special.

- Pos2: not special.

- Pos3: not special.

- Pos4: not special.

- Pos5: special.

Total: 2.

Even.

Wait, in "ABCDE", n=5:

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'C', not special.

- Pos3: 'C' != 'B' and 'C' != 'D', not special.

- Pos4: 'D' != 'C' and 'D' != 'E', not special.

- Pos5: 'E' != 'D', special.

Total special characters: pos1 and pos5 -> 2.

Even.

Wait, but n=5 is odd, but total special is 2, which is even.

So, in all these cases, the number of special characters is even.

Is there any string where the number of special characters is odd?

Let me try to construct one.

Suppose I have a string with only one character, like "A".

- No special characters (0, which is even).

String with two characters, "AA":

- No special characters (0, even).

"AB":

- Two special characters (even).

"ABA":

- Two special characters (even).

"ABAC":

- Two special characters (even).

"ABAB":

- Two special characters (even).

"ABC":

- Two special characters (even).

It seems consistently even.

Maybe it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.

If that's the case, then for odd n, there is no such string, and for even n, there is.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

3

6

1

2

Output:

YES

AAABAACC

NO

YES

MM

So, for n=6, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.

For n=1, "NO"

For n=2, "MM" has two special characters.

Wait, "MM" has two characters, both 'M'.

- Pos1: 'M' == 'M', not special.

- Pos2: 'M' == 'M', not special.

So, no special characters, which is 0, not 2.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe "MM" is not a good example for n=2.

Wait, in the example, for n=2, it's "MM", but in this string:

- Pos1: 'M' == 'M', not special.

- Pos2: 'M' == 'M', not special.

Total special characters: 0, which is not 2.

So, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, maybe "AB" for n=2.

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: 2.

Yes, that works.

So, "AB" is a valid string for n=2.

Similarly, "ABC" has two special characters (pos1 and pos3).

But in the example, for n=2, it's "MM", which actually has 0 special characters.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the output for n=2 should be "AB" or something similar, not "MM".

Wait, maybe it's a typo in the example.

Moving on, assuming that for even n, it's possible, and for odd n, it's not.

So, in the program, it checks if n is odd, then prints 'NO', else prints 'YES' and a string with n special characters.

Now, I need to see if the given program achieves this.

Looking at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

So, it checks if n is odd, prints 'NO'.

If n is even, it creates a string s by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times.

Then, if the length of s is less than 200, it prints 'YES' and s, else 'NO'.

First, does this string s have exactly n special characters?

Let's see for n=6.

s = 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAABAAB'

Now, let's count the special characters:

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' == 'A' (wait, no.

Wait, in 'AAB':

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' != 'B', so equal to one neighbor, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' == 'A' (wait, 'B' is followed by 'A', which is different.

Wait, in 'AAB':

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' != 'B', so equal to one neighbor, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', so equal to zero neighbors, not special.

Wait, so in 'AAB', there's only one special character.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=6, it creates 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAABAAB', which has length 9.

Let's count special characters in 'AABAABAAB':

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' == 'A' (wait, 'B' is followed by 'A', which is different, and preceded by 'A', which is different, so equal to zero neighbors, not special.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct this.

In 'AAB':

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' != 'B', so equal to one neighbor, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A' (assuming the next 'A' in the next 'AAB'), but actually, in 'AABAABAAB', pos3 is 'B', followed by 'A' (different), preceded by 'A' (different), so not special.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider 'AAB' as a unit.

But in reality, in 'AAB AAB AAB', with spaces for clarity, but in reality, it's concatenated.

So, 'AAB AAB AAB' without spaces: 'AABAABAAB'.

Now, let's count special characters:

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' == 'A' (wait, 'B' is followed by 'A' (different), preceded by 'A' (different), so not special.

Wait, perhaps I need to write code to count special characters to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to construct the string.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect in choosing 'AAB' * (n//2).

Because, as I saw, 'AAB' has only one special character, not two.

Wait, in 'AAB':

- Pos1: 'A' == 'A', not special.

- Pos2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' != 'B', so equal to one neighbor, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A' (assuming next character is 'A' from the next 'AAB'), but in reality, in 'AABAABAAB', pos3 is 'B', followed by 'A' (different), preceded by 'A' (different), so not special.

Wait, perhaps in 'AAB', there's only one special character.

So, 'AAB' * 3 would have three such units, each contributing one special character, totaling three, which is for n=3, but n=6 would require six special characters.

So, this seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the intention was to have two special characters per 'AAB'.

But from the above, it seems only one per 'AAB'.

So, maybe the multiplication factor is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the string 'AB' has two special characters, as shown earlier.

So, for n=2, 'AB' is valid.

For n=4, 'ABAB' has four special characters.

Wait, in 'ABAB':

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos4: 'B' != 'A', special.

Wait, that's three special characters.

Wait, no:

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos4: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: pos1, pos3, pos4 -> three special characters.

Wait, which is odd, but earlier I thought it was even.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in 'ABAB':

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos4: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: three special characters.

But earlier, I thought it was two.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

So, in 'ABAB', there are three special characters.

Wait, but according to the earlier pattern, it's odd, which contradicts my initial assumption.

Wait, but according to the problem, in "AAABAACC", there are six special characters, which is even.

Wait, perhaps it's possible to have an odd number of special characters.

In "ABAB":

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos4: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: three special characters.

So, odd.

But according to the program, it would only attempt to build strings for even n.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in assuming that only even n are possible.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', and for n=6, it's 'YES'.

But in "ABAB", n=3, which is 'NO' according to the program, but it seems possible.

Wait, but in "ABAB", n=3, which is odd, but according to the program, it should be 'NO', but perhaps it's possible.

So, maybe the program is incorrect in assuming that only even n are possible.

But in the earlier examples, it seemed that n is always even, but "ABAB" shows n=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a string, the number of special characters can be odd.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in always printing 'NO' for odd n.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', and for n=2, it's 'YES'.

But according to "ABAB", n=3 is possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem's example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that the number of special characters is even only when the string is circular, but here the string is linear.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's a linear string with endpoints.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a general pattern.

Let me consider constructing a string for n=3.

"ABAB" has three special characters, as shown.

So, for n=3, "ABAB" is a valid string.

Similarly, for n=6, "AAABAACC" has six special characters.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in assuming that only even n are possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps the number of special characters is always even, but in "ABAB", it's three, which is odd.

Wait, but in "ABAB", it's three, which contradicts that.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted "ABAB".

Let's recount:

- Pos1: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos2: 'B' != 'A' and 'B' != 'A', not special.

- Pos3: 'A' != 'B', special.

- Pos4: 'B' != 'A', special.

Total: pos1, pos3, pos4 -> three special characters.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, for n=6, "AAABAACC" has six special characters.

But in "ABAB", n=3, which is odd.

So, perhaps it's possible to have both even and odd n.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

So, perhaps it's possible to have both even and odd n.

Then, why does the program only allow even n?

Perhaps the program is incorrect.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

"Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string."

So, for n=1, it's 'NO', but for n=3, it's 'YES'.

But according to the program, it would print 'NO' for n=3.

But according to "ABAB", n=3 is possible.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
