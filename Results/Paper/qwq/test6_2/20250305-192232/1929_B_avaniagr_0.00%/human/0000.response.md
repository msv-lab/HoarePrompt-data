Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two main types of diagonals: those that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and those that run from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a grid of size n, there are a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. This includes all possible diagonals of different lengths.

For example, in a 3x3 grid:

- There are 3 diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right:

- One with just one cell (corner cells)

- One with two cells

- One with three cells

- Similarly, there are 3 diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left:

- One with just one cell (opposite corners)

- One with two cells

- One with three cells

- So in total, 6 diagonals, which matches 4*3 - 2 = 10, wait, that doesn't seem right. Hold on, maybe I'm missing some diagonals.

Actually, in a 3x3 grid, there are more diagonals than just the main ones. Every cell can be part of multiple diagonals depending on the slope. But in standard grid diagonal counting, for grids, diagonals are usually considered with slopes of 1 and -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify how many diagonals there are in total for an n x n grid.

After a quick search, I find that in a square grid, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2. This includes all possible diagonals of different lengths.

So, for n=3, 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals, which matches the sample input where k can be up to 10.

Now, the problem is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to select cells to color so that they cover as many diagonals as possible, maximizing the coverage per cell.

First, I should understand how many diagonals a single cell can be part of. In a grid, each cell lies on exactly two diagonals: one running from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left.

Therefore, each cell can help cover two diagonals.

If I color one cell, it covers two diagonals. So, for k diagonals, maybe I can just divide k by 2 to get the number of cells needed. But wait, that might not always be the case because some diagonals intersect and share cells.

I need to think about how to maximize the number of unique diagonals covered by each cell.

In the sample input, when n=3 and k=4, the output is 2. That means coloring two cells covers four diagonals.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=10, which is all diagonals, it takes 6 cells.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, the output is 6, which is n^2, meaning all cells are colored. Is that necessary?

Wait, n=3, n^2=9, but the output is 6 for k=10. So not all cells need to be colored to cover all diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a more efficient way to cover the diagonals.

Let me consider the properties of the grid and the diagonals.

In an n x n grid, the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) has n cells, and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) has n cells.

Other diagonals have fewer cells, depending on their position.

To minimize the number of cells colored, I need to select cells that cover as many diagonals as possible.

Perhaps selecting cells that are at the intersection of unique diagonals would help.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of covering all required diagonals with the fewest cells.

This sounds similar to a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but since n can be up to 10^8, that's not feasible.

I need a more efficient approach.

Maybe I can categorize the diagonals based on their slopes and positions.

In a grid, diagonals with the same slope are parallel.

So, there are two types of diagonals: those with positive slope (top-left to bottom-right) and those with negative slope (top-right to bottom-left).

Each positive diagonal can be identified by its sum of row and column indices (i + j), and each negative diagonal by their difference (i - j).

For positive diagonals, the sum i + j ranges from 0 to 2n-2.

Similarly, for negative diagonals, the difference i - j ranges from -(n-1) to n-1.

So, there are 2n - 1 positive diagonals and 2n - 1 negative diagonals, totaling 4n - 2 diagonals.

Now, the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Since each cell covers exactly one positive and one negative diagonal, I need to select cells that cover as many unique diagonals as possible.

If I select a cell, it covers one positive and one negative diagonal.

So, the maximum number of new diagonals covered by a new cell is two, provided that those diagonals haven't been covered yet.

Therefore, in the best case, each new cell covers two new diagonals.

So, if k is less than or equal to 2 times the number of cells, it seems straightforward.

But when k is larger, I need to see how many cells are required to cover k diagonals.

Wait, more formally, the problem can be modeled as follows:

- There are 4n - 2 diagonals: 2n - 1 positive and 2n - 1 negative.

- Each cell covers exactly one positive and one negative diagonal.

- We need to select a set of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one cell colored.

Our goal is to minimize the number of cells selected.

This seems similar to a bipartite graph where one partition is the positive diagonals and the other is the negative diagonals, and cells are edges connecting them.

Wait, actually, it's a bipartite graph where one set is the positive diagonals and the other is the negative diagonals, and cells are the intersections connecting a positive diagonal to a negative diagonal.

In this setup, selecting a cell covers both the positive and negative diagonals it belongs to.

So, the problem reduces to covering at least k diagonals with the fewest cells.

This sounds like a hitting set problem, where we need to hit at least k diagonals with the fewest cells.

But hitting set is NP-hard, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this given the structure.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

Case 1: k is small, say k=1.

Then, coloring any single cell will cover two diagonals, which is more than k=1. So, the minimum number of cells needed is 1.

Wait, but k is the number of diagonals that must have at least one colored cell.

So, if k=1, coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is sufficient, so minimum cells is 1.

Case 2: k=2.

Coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which satisfies k=2.

So, minimum cells is still 1.

Case 3: k=3.

Coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which is insufficient.

Coloring a second cell can cover two more diagonals, but there might be overlap.

If the second cell is chosen such that it covers two new diagonals not covered by the first cell, then total diagonals covered are 4.

So, for k=3, minimum cells needed is 2.

Wait, but in the first sample input, n=3 and k=4, output is 2.

Which aligns with this.

So, in general, if each new cell covers two new diagonals, then the number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But is this always possible?

Wait, perhaps not, because there might be dependencies between diagonals.

For example, in a small grid, some diagonals might share cells.

So, maybe in some cases, adding a new cell doesn't cover two new diagonals.

Let me consider n=2.

For n=2, there are 4 cells and 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

If k=3, then ceil(3/2)=2 cells should be sufficient.

Indeed, coloring two cells can cover up to 4 diagonals, which is more than k=3.

Similarly, for k=4, ceil(4/2)=2 cells are needed.

But in the sample input, for n=2 and k=3, the output is 2.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2 and k=3 is not present, but n=2 and k=3 should require 2 cells.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2 and k=3 is not present, but n=2 and k=2 is not in the sample either.

Wait, in the sample input provided:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Outputs:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

Wait, but n=2 and k=3 is not in the sample input.

Wait, in the last test case, n=2 and k=3, output is 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

2 3

Output:

2

So, for n=2 and k=3, output is 2.

Which aligns with ceil(3/2)=2.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=4, output is 2, which is ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, output is 6, which is n^2=9, but it's 6.

Wait, n=3, n^2=9, but for k=10, which is all 10 diagonals, it's 6 cells.

Wait, but 3x3 grid has 10 diagonals, and coloring 6 cells covers all diagonals.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps in a 3x3 grid, to cover all 10 diagonals, you need to color 6 cells.

Is there a better way to calculate this?

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

In a 3x3 grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is indeed 6.

Wait, but how?

Let me try to visualize it.

In a 3x3 grid, there are 2 main diagonals: one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left.

Then, there are diagonals one cell away from these main diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to categorize the diagonals based on their lengths.

In a 3x3 grid:

- Positive diagonals:

- i+j=0: one cell

- i+j=1: two cells

- i+j=2: three cells

- i+j=3: two cells

- i+j=4: one cell

- Negative diagonals:

- i-j=-2: one cell

- i-j=-1: two cells

- i-j=0: three cells

- i-j=1: two cells

- i-j=2: one cell

So, total 5 positive and 5 negative diagonals, totaling 10.

Now, to cover all 10 diagonals, I need to select cells that cover all these diagonals.

If I select cells from different diagonals, making sure that each selected cell covers new diagonals not yet covered.

But in practice, it's tricky because cells overlap diagonals.

Perhaps in this specific case, selecting cells from different diagonals in a way that minimizes overlap.

Wait, maybe I should look for a pattern or formula.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- n=3, k=4 → 2 cells

- n=3, k=3 → 2 cells

- n=3, k=10 → 6 cells

- n=3, k=9 → 5 cells

- n=4, k=7 → 4 cells

- n=7, k=11 → 6 cells

- n=2, k=3 → 2 cells

From these, it seems that for small k, ceil(k/2) works, but for larger k, it's more involved.

Looking at n=3 and k=10, output is 6.

Similarly, for k=9, it's 5.

Wait, 9 diagonals require 5 cells, while 10 require 6.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=7, it's 4 cells.

Wait, for n=4, 4*4 - 2 = 14 diagonals.

So, for k=7, it's 4 cells.

Similarly, for n=7 and k=11, it's 6 cells.

I need to find a general formula that fits all these cases.

Perhaps there are different scenarios based on the value of k relative to n.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

If I color m cells, the maximum number of diagonals covered is 2m.

But this is only achievable if each cell covers two new diagonals not covered by previous cells.

However, in reality, there might be overlaps.

Wait, perhaps for small k, ceil(k/2) works, but for larger k, it's more complex.

Looking at n=3 and k=10, which is all diagonals, it takes 6 cells.

But n=3, n^2=9, so coloring all cells would cover all diagonals, but apparently, coloring 6 cells is sufficient.

So, there must be a way to select 6 cells that cover all 10 diagonals.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=9, it's 5 cells.

So, perhaps there is a relationship between n and k that determines the number of cells needed.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of diagonals that must be covered beyond the initial 2m diagonals covered by m cells.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the total number of diagonals and how many can be covered efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a threshold where, for k up to a certain value, ceil(k/2) cells are sufficient, but beyond that, it requires more cells to cover the remaining diagonals.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



This code seems to handle different cases based on the value of k relative to 4n - 3.

Let me try to understand this.

It computes:

(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)

Which can be broken down as:

- If k < 4n - 3, then ceil(k/2)

- If k >= 4n - 3, then 2n

- Plus 1 if k == 4n - 2

Wait, let's verify this with sample inputs.

For n=3 and k=4:

4 < 4*3 - 3 = 9, so ceil(4/2)=2, which matches the sample output.

For n=3 and k=10:

10 >= 4*3 - 3 = 9, so 2*3=6, which matches the sample output.

For n=3 and k=9:

9 >= 4*3 - 3 = 9, so 2*3=6, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3 and k=9, the output is 5.

But according to this formula, it would be 6.

But in the sample, it's 5.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let's look back at the code:

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

So, for n=3 and k=9:

4*3 - 3 = 9, so k >= 9, so 2*3=6, plus (k == 4*3 - 2)=1, so total 6+1=7.

But the sample output is 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Looking back:

Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Output:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

So, for n=3 and k=9, output is 5.

But according to the formula, it's 7.

This suggests that the formula in the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the formula.

Let's evaluate it step by step for n=3 and k=9:

(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4*n - 3) + 2*n * (k >= 4*n - 3) + (k == 4*n - 2)

k=9, 4*n - 3=9

So, k >= 9, so k < 9 is False (0), k >=9 is True (1), and k==4*n-2=4*3-2=10, which is False (0).

So, it's (9//2 + 9%2)*0 + 2*3*1 + 0 = 0 + 6 + 0 =6.

But the sample output for n=3 and k=9 is 5, not 6.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=10:

k=10, 4*n-3=9, k>=9 is True, k==4*n-2=10 is True.

So, (10//2 +10%2)*0 + 2*3*1 +1 =0+6+1=7.

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6, not 7.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 6, but according to the sample, it's 6.

Wait, no, the sample input for n=3 and k=10 is 6, and for n=3 and k=9 is 5.

But according to the formula, for k=10, it's 7, but sample is 6.

So, the formula seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the code:

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

So, for k >=4n-3, it's 2n + (k==4n-2).

But in the sample, for k=9 (which is 4n-3), it's 2n=6, but output is 5.

For k=10 (which is 4n-2), it's 2n +1=7, but sample output is 6.

So, it's not matching.

Therefore, the formula in the code seems incorrect based on the sample inputs.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
