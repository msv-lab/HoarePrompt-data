Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each organized in a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making a total of 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take up 1x1 cells, and others take up 2x2 cells. The 2x2 icons occupy a square of 4 cells, and each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible. So, I need to figure out how to arrange x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons on as few screens as possible, given the constraints of the grid size.

First, I need to understand the grid and how the icons can be placed. Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which looks like this:

```

Row 1: 1 2 3

Row 2: 4 5 6

Row 3: 7 8 9

Row 4: 10 11 12

Row 5: 13 14 15

```

The 2x2 icons need to be placed in such a way that they cover a 2-row by 2-column square. Given that the grid is 5 rows by 3 columns, I need to see how many 2x2 squares can fit into this grid.

Let's visualize the possible positions for 2x2 icons:

- Starting at cell 1: covers cells 1,2,4,5

- Starting at cell 2: covers cells 2,3,5,6

- Starting at cell 4: covers cells 4,5,7,8

- Starting at cell 5: covers cells 5,6,8,9

- Starting at cell 7: covers cells 7,8,10,11

- Starting at cell 8: covers cells 8,9,11,12

- Starting at cell 10: covers cells 10,11,13,14

- Starting at cell 11: covers cells 11,12,14,15

So, there are 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons on a single screen.

Now, each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. But it's not just about the total number of cells; it's about how they can be arranged without overlapping.

First, let's calculate the total number of cells available per screen: 5 rows * 3 columns = 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, and each 1x1 uses 1 cell. So, for y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, the total cells used would be 4y + x.

However, since the 2x2 icons have specific placement constraints, we need to make sure that their placements don't overlap and that the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining spaces.

I need to minimize the number of screens used, so I should try to maximize the number of icons placed on each screen.

Let me think about how many 2x2 icons can fit on a single screen without overlapping.

From the possible positions above, we can see that placing one 2x2 icon can block the placement of others. For example, placing an icon starting at cell 1 (covering 1,2,4,5) would prevent placing another icon starting at cell 2 or cell 4.

Let's see:

- If I place an icon at cell 1, it covers 1,2,4,5.

- Then, I can place another icon at cell 7, covering 7,8,10,11.

- And another at cell 10, covering 10,11,13,14.

- But wait, cell 10 overlaps with the previous icon at cells 10 and 11.

So, placing at cell 1 and cell 7 would cover cells 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14.

Then, I can place another 2x2 icon at cell 13, covering 13,14,15.

Wait, but cell 13 and 14 are already covered by the icon at cell 10. So, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different positions for the 2x2 icons to maximize the number that can be placed on a single screen.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this without manually trying each placement.

Let me consider the total number of 2x2 positions available per screen, which is 8, but they overlap in such a way that not all can be used simultaneously.

I need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions.

Looking back at the positions:

- Position 1: 1,2,4,5

- Position 2: 2,3,5,6

- Position 4: 4,5,7,8

- Position 5: 5,6,8,9

- Position 7: 7,8,10,11

- Position 8: 8,9,11,12

- Position 10: 10,11,13,14

- Position 11: 11,12,14,15

I need to select a subset of these positions where no two positions overlap.

Looking at this, one possible non-overlapping set could be positions 1, 7, and 11.

- Position 1: 1,2,4,5

- Position 7: 7,8,10,11

- Position 11: 11,12,14,15

Wait, position 7 and position 11 both cover cell 11. So, they overlap. Hence, that's not possible.

Wait, position 11 covers cells 11,12,14,15. Position 7 covers 7,8,10,11. So, they overlap at cell 11.

So, perhaps positions 1, 7, and 12.

Wait, position 12 would be covering cells 12,13,14,15, but I don't see position 12 in the list. Wait, the positions are only up to position 11.

Maybe another approach: perhaps the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions is 3.

For example:

- Position 1: 1,2,4,5

- Position 7: 7,8,10,11

- Position 13: 13,14,15

Wait, but position 13 isn't listed. Wait, perhaps position 13 isn't available. Looking back, positions are up to 11.

Alternatively, maybe positions 1, 7, and 11, but as we saw, positions 7 and 11 overlap at cell 11.

So, maybe only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen.

For example:

- Position 1: 1,2,4,5

- Position 7: 7,8,10,11

That would leave cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15 free, except that position 7 overlaps with position 1 at cell 5 and 11.

Wait, position 7: 7,8,10,11. Position 1: 1,2,4,5. No overlap between these.

Wait, position 7 doesn't overlap with position 1. So, that's fine.

Then, position 11: 11,12,14,15. Position 7 covers 7,8,10,11. They overlap at cell 11.

So, positions 1 and 7 are non-overlapping.

Similarly, positions 1 and 11 overlap at cell 11.

Therefore, positions 1 and 7 are non-overlapping, and positions 1 and 11 overlap.

So, perhaps the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen is 2.

Therefore, per screen, we can place up to 2 2x2 icons.

Each such icon takes up 4 cells, so 2 icons take up 8 cells.

That leaves 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if we place only 1 2x2 icon, it takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if we place no 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

But the problem allows for both types of icons, and we need to minimize the number of screens used.

So, to minimize screens, we should maximize the number of icons per screen, preferably maximizing the number of 2x2 icons since they take up more space.

But from above, it seems that per screen, we can have either:

- 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons (total of 2 + 7 = 9 icons)

- 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons (total of 1 + 11 = 12 icons)

- Or 15 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize screens, we should aim for the configuration that allows the maximum number of icons per screen. Between the options above, placing 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons allows for 12 icons per screen, which is more than the other options.

Wait, but in the first option, 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons make 9 icons, which is less than 12.

Wait, but in that case, placing 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons allows for 12 icons per screen, which is better than placing 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

But perhaps there's a better way to arrange the icons to fit more on a single screen.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to place more than 1 2x2 icon without overlapping.

Wait, earlier I thought that only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 positions are possible per screen, but perhaps that's not accurate.

Let me try again.

Suppose I place a 2x2 icon at position 1: covers 1,2,4,5.

Then, I can place another 2x2 icon at position 7: covers 7,8,10,11.

Now, are there any other positions available?

Position 13 would cover 13,14,15, but position 13 isn't available since the grid only goes up to cell 15.

Wait, perhaps position 13 isn't a valid starting position.

Looking back, the positions are:

- Position 1: 1,2,4,5

- Position 2: 2,3,5,6

- Position 4: 4,5,7,8

- Position 5: 5,6,8,9

- Position 7: 7,8,10,11

- Position 8: 8,9,11,12

- Position 10: 10,11,13,14

- Position 11: 11,12,14,15

From these, positions 1 and 7 don't overlap.

Can I place a third 2x2 icon?

If I try position 11: 11,12,14,15, which overlaps with position 7 at cell 11.

So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, position 10: 10,11,13,14, which overlaps with position 7 at cell 11.

So, seems like only two non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen.

Therefore, per screen, maximum of two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Each such icon takes 4 cells, so total 8 cells used.

Remaining cells: 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons, but that seems unlikely because 4 cells are used by the 2x2 icon, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Wait, 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, zero 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, up to two per screen, and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

But, in terms of total icons per screen, placing two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons gives a total of nine icons, while placing one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons gives twelve icons, and placing only 1x1 icons gives fifteen icons.

So, actually, placing only 1x1 icons allows more icons per screen, but since there are both types of icons, I need to account for the 2x2 icons first.

Wait, but the goal is to minimize the number of screens, so I need to maximize the number of icons per screen.

Given that, perhaps placing as many 2x2 icons as possible without exceeding the screen capacity is the way to go.

Wait, but from above, per screen, I can have up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling nine icons, or one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons, totaling twelve icons, or just fifteen 1x1 icons.

So, in terms of total icons per screen, the maximum is fifteen when only 1x1 icons are placed.

But, if there are 2x2 icons, they take up more space, reducing the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed.

So, perhaps it's better to place as few 2x2 icons per screen as possible to maximize the number of 1x1 icons per screen.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, no, the goal is to minimize the number of screens.

So, to minimize screens, I need to maximize the number of icons per screen.

Given that, placing one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons allows for twelve icons per screen, which is more than placing two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons (total nine icons).

But placing only 1x1 icons allows fifteen icons per screen, which is the maximum.

However, if there are 2x2 icons, they must be placed first.

So, perhaps the strategy is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible in pairs on each screen, and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

Wait, but earlier I saw that only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping, using eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, place one 2x2 icon per screen, using four cells, and place eleven 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

In the first case, per screen: 2x2 icons: 2, 1x1 icons: 7, total icons: 9

In the second case: 2x2 icons: 1, 1x1 icons: 11, total icons: 12

In the third case: 2x2 icons: 0, 1x1 icons: 15, total icons: 15

So, to maximize the number of icons per screen, it's better to place one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons, totaling twelve icons per screen.

This seems better than placing two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, which only gives nine icons per screen.

Wait, but why is that?

Is there a better way to arrange the icons?

Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me try to think differently.

Each screen has fifteen cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes four cells.

So, theoretically, the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen would be floor(15/4) = 3.

But, due to the grid structure, only two non-overlapping 2x2 positions are possible, as previously determined.

Hence, only two 2x2 icons per screen.

So, per screen:

- 2x2 icons: 2 (using 8 cells)

- 1x1 icons: 7 (using 7 cells)

Total icons: 9

Alternatively:

- 2x2 icons: 1 (using 4 cells)

- 1x1 icons: 11 (using 11 cells)

Total icons: 12

- 2x2 icons: 0

- 1x1 icons: 15

Total icons: 15

So, placing one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons allows for more icons per screen.

Hence, to minimize screens, it's better to place one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons per screen whenever possible.

But, if there are more 2x2 icons, I might need to place two per screen.

Wait, perhaps I need to balance the number of 2x2 icons with the number of 1x1 icons to maximize the icons per screen.

Let me consider the total number of cells used per screen.

If I place two 2x2 icons, that's 8 cells used, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If I place one 2x2 icon, that's 4 cells used, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If I place zero 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Given that, placing one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons uses all 15 cells (4 + 11 = 15).

Similarly, placing two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons uses all 15 cells (8 + 7 = 15).

So, in both cases, the screen is fully utilized.

But, placing one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons allows for more total icons per screen (12 vs. 9).

Hence, to minimize screens, it's better to place one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons per screen.

But, if there are more 2x2 icons, I might need to place two per screen.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the total cells needed.

Total cells needed: 4y + x

Total cells available per screen: 15

So, the minimum number of screens required would be ceil((4y + x)/15)

But, this doesn't account for the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.

Because, even if the total cells needed are less than or equal to 15, if the 2x2 icons can't be placed due to overlapping issues, it might require more screens.

However, in practice, since we can arrange the icons optimally, perhaps ceil((4y + x)/15) is sufficient.

But, considering the grid structure and the placement constraints of 2x2 icons, it might not always be possible to achieve this.

Hence, perhaps we need a better approach.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Place as many 2x2 icons as possible, each on separate screens if needed.

2. For each screen that has one 2x2 icon, place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining cells.

3. For screens with two 2x2 icons, place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining cells.

4. Finally, place the remaining 1x1 icons on additional screens.

But this seems too simplistic and may not lead to the minimal number of screens.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to maximize the number of 1x1 icons per screen when possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of 2x2 icons and how they fit into the screens.

Given that per screen, I can place up to two 2x2 icons without overlapping.

So, the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y/2)

Then, the remaining cells on these screens can be used for some 1x1 icons.

Each screen with two 2x2 icons has 15 - 8 = 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

Each screen with one 2x2 icon has 15 - 4 = 11 cells left for 1x1 icons.

So, if I have ceil(y/2) screens for the 2x2 icons, the total number of cells available for 1x1 icons on these screens is:

- If y is even: (y/2)*7

- If y is odd: (floor(y/2))*7 + 11

Because, for each pair of 2x2 icons, there are 7 cells left, and if y is odd, there's one screen with one 2x2 icon and 11 cells left.

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed are:

x - (cells left for 1x1 icons on screens with 2x2 icons)

If this is positive, then additional screens are needed for these remaining 1x1 icons.

The number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - left_cells)/15)

Where left_cells is the total cells left for 1x1 icons on screens with 2x2 icons.

But, we need to make sure that left_cells doesn't exceed the actual number of 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it step by step.

Let me formalize this.

Let s = ceil(y/2)

This is the number of screens needed to place all y 2x2 icons.

Then, the total number of cells left for 1x1 icons on these s screens is:

If y is even: s * 7

If y is odd: (s - 1) * 7 + 11

Because, for y even, all s screens have two 2x2 icons and 7 cells left.

For y odd, s - 1 screens have two 2x2 icons and 7 cells left, and one screen has one 2x2 icon and 11 cells left.

So, total left_cells = (s - 1) * 7 + 11 if y is odd, else s * 7

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - left_cells

If x - left_cells > 0, then additional screens are needed: ceil((x - left_cells)/15)

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - left_cells)/15)

But, we need to make sure that left_cells doesn't exceed x.

If left_cells >= x, then no additional screens are needed.

Wait, but in the calculation above, left_cells might be greater than x, in which case, remaining 1x1 icons are zero.

Hence, we need to take the maximum of zero for remaining 1x1 icons.

Let me try to formalize this with an example.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

1 1

So, x = 1, y = 1

Then, s = ceil(1/2) = 1

Since y is odd, left_cells = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

Then, remaining 1x1 icons = 1 - 11 = -10, which should be taken as zero.

Hence, total screens = 1 + ceil((-10)/15) = 1 + 0 = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

7 2

y = 2, which is even

s = ceil(2/2) = 1

left_cells = 1 * 7 = 7

remaining 1x1 icons = 7 - 7 = 0

total screens = 1 + ceil(0/15) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

12 4

y = 4, which is even

s = ceil(4/2) = 2

left_cells = 2 * 7 = 14

remaining 1x1 icons = 12 - 14 = -2, taken as 0

total screens = 2 + ceil(-2/15) = 2 + 0 = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

0 3

y = 3, which is odd

s = ceil(3/2) = 2

left_cells = (2 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 1 * 7 + 11 = 18

remaining 1x1 icons = 0 - 18 = -18, taken as 0

total screens = 2 + ceil(-18/15) = 2 + 0 = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Seems consistent.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

So, in code, I need to implement this logic.

Given that, let's look at the provided program and see if it matches this logic.

The provided program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b * 2

if t % 5 == 0:

t = t // 5

else:

t = t // 5 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

Let's see what this code is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it calculates t = b * 2

Then, if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, t = b * 2

Then, if t % 5 == 0, t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1

So, t is being set to ceil(b*2 / 5)

But, why b*2?

I'm not sure about this step.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a, then t remains the same

else, t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0, t = t + t2 // 15

else, t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

Finally, it prints t.

This seems overly complicated and not matching the logic I derived earlier.

In my earlier logic, s = ceil(y / 2)

Then, left_cells = (s - 1) * 7 + 11 if y is odd, else s * 7

Then, remaining 1x1 icons = x - left_cells

If remaining > 0, additional screens = ceil(remaining / 15)

Total screens = s + additional screens

But in the code, it's calculating t = ceil(b * 2 / 5), which is unclear.

Perhaps there's a different approach being taken here.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, and I just don't understand it.

Let me try to see if the code matches the sample inputs.

Take the first test case: 1 1

b = 1

t = 1 * 2 = 2

2 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 1 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 15 - 4 = 11

if 11 >= 1, which is true, so t remains 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 7 2

b = 2

t = 2 * 2 = 4

4 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 1 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7

if 7 >= 7, which is true, so t remains 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 12 4

b = 4

t = 4 * 2 = 8

8 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 1 + 1 = 2

t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 30 - 16 = 14

if 14 >= 12, which is true, so t remains 2

print t = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 0 3

b = 3

t = 3 * 2 = 6

6 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 1 + 1 = 2

t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 30 - 12 = 18

if 18 >= 0, which is true, so t remains 2

print t = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 1 0

b = 0

t = 0 * 2 = 0

0 % 5 == 0 -> yes, so t = 0 // 5 = 0

t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0

if 0 >= 1, which is false

so t2 = 1 - 0 = 1

1 % 15 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 8 1

b = 1

t = 1 * 2 = 2

2 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 1 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 15 - 4 = 11

if 11 >= 8, which is true, so t remains 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 0 0

b = 0

t = 0 * 2 = 0

0 % 5 == 0 -> yes, so t = 0 // 5 = 0

t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0

if 0 >= 0, which is true, so t remains 0

print t = 0

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 2 0

b = 0

t = 0 * 2 = 0

0 % 5 == 0 -> yes, so t = 0 // 5 = 0

t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0

if 0 >= 2, which is false

so t2 = 2 - 0 = 2

2 % 15 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 15 0

b = 0

t = 0 * 2 = 0

0 % 5 == 0 -> yes, so t = 0 // 5 = 0

t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0

if 0 >= 15, which is false

so t2 = 15 - 0 = 15

15 % 15 == 0 -> yes, so t = 0 + 15 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1

print t = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 8 2

b = 2

t = 2 * 2 = 4

4 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 0 + 1 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7

if 7 >= 8, which is false

so t2 = 8 - 7 = 1

1 % 15 == 0 -> no, so t = 1 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

print t = 2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 0 9

b = 9

t = 9 * 2 = 18

18 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 3 + 1 = 4

t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 60 - 36 = 24

if 24 >= 0, which is true, so t remains 4

print t = 4

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should be 5.

Wait, but in the sample output, for 0 9, it's 5.

But according to this code, it calculates t = 4.

Hmm, seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, let's see:

b = 9

t = 9 * 2 = 18

18 % 5 == 0 -> no, so t = 18 // 5 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 60 - 36 = 24

if 24 >= 0, which is true, so t remains 4

But sample output is 5.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it matched.

Maybe there's an error in this specific case.

Let me apply my earlier logic to this test case: 0 9

y = 9

s = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

left_cells = (5 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 4 * 7 + 11 = 28 + 11 = 39

remaining 1x1 icons = 0 - 39 = -39, which is 0

total screens = 5 + ceil(-39/15) = 5 + 0 = 5

Which matches the sample output.

But the code outputs 4, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect for this test case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
