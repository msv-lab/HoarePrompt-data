Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i. The Kraken attacks these ships k times, alternating between the first and the last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the lineup. I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. After each attack, if a ship's durability reaches zero, it's removed, which might change which ships are first and last.

This seems like a simulation problem, but simulating each attack one by one could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15. That's way too big for a straightforward simulation.

I need a smarter way to handle this. Let's think about it.

If I can process multiple attacks at once, that would be better. For example, if I can determine how many attacks it takes to sink the first and last ships simultaneously, I can handle those attacks in one go.

Let's consider that in each cycle of two attacks (one on the first and one on the last), the Kraken reduces the durability of both ships by 1 each. So, in two attacks, both ships lose 1 durability each.

I can think in terms of these cycles. Let's define a cycle as two attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last ship.

In each cycle, the first and last ships each lose 1 durability, provided they are still afloat.

If I can process multiple such cycles at once, that would save time.

Let's consider the durabilities of the first and last ships as a pair. In each cycle, both are reduced by 1, until one of them sinks.

Suppose the first ship has durability a[l] and the last has a[r]. The number of cycles I can perform where both ships are reduced by 1 is equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r].

Wait, not exactly. Since each cycle consists of two attacks, but only one durability is reduced per attack, actually, in each cycle, each of the first and last ships loses 1 durability.

But no, wait. In each cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship. So, in one cycle, each of the first and last ships loses 1 durability.

So, if I have a[l] and a[r], the number of cycles I can perform where both ships are reduced by 1 is min(a[l], a[r]).

Wait, no. If I have a[l] = 5 and a[r] = 3, then I can perform 3 cycles where both ships lose 1 durability each. After that, the last ship has sunk, and only the first ship has 2 durability left.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- In each cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship.

- So, in one cycle, both ships lose 1 durability.

- So, the number of cycles where both ships are reduced is min(a[l], a[r]).

- After that, one of the ships might have remaining durability.

- For example, if a[l] = 5 and a[r] = 3, after 3 cycles, a[l] = 2, a[r] = 0.

- So, the last ship has sunk, and the first ship still has 2 durability left.

- Then, the Kraken continues attacking the first ship until it sinks or k attacks are used up.

So, in this case, after 3 cycles (6 attacks), a[l] = 2, a[r] = 0.

Then, the Kraken continues attacking the first ship for the remaining k - 6 attacks, reducing its durability further.

So, in general, I can process as many cycles as min(a[l], a[r]), then handle the remaining attacks on the remaining ship, if any.

But wait, there might be multiple ships in between. I need to handle the ships in the middle as well.

Wait, no. The ships in the middle are only affected if the first and last ships are sunk, revealing the next ships as the new first and last.

So, I need to iteratively handle the first and last ships, removing them when their durability reaches zero.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me try to think of it in terms of two pointers: one starting from the left (first ship) and one from the right (last ship).

I'll maintain two pointers, l and r, starting from 0 and n-1, respectively.

I'll also keep track of the number of attacks performed.

In each step, I'll determine how many attacks I can perform on the current first and last ships before one of them sinks.

Let me denote the durability of the current first ship as a[l] and the last as a[r].

The number of attacks that can be performed on both ships before one sinks is m = min(a[l], a[r]).

Since each cycle consists of two attacks (one on the first and one on the last), the number of cycles I can perform is m, using 2*m attacks.

But wait, each cycle is two attacks: one on the first and one on the last.

Wait, no. The problem says the Kraken attacks in sequence: first, last, first, last, and so on.

So, in k attacks, the number of times the first ship is attacked is ceil(k/2), and the last ship is attacked floor(k/2) times, or something like that.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

If k is the total number of attacks, and the Kraken alternates between the first and last ships, then the first ship is attacked ceil(k/2) times, and the last ship is attacked floor(k/2) times.

Wait, let's see:

- If k is even: first, last, first, last, ..., first, last.

- So, first ship is attacked k/2 times, last ship is attacked k/2 times.

- If k is odd: first, last, first, last, ..., first.

- So, first ship is attacked (k+1)/2 times, last ship is attacked (k-1)/2 times.

So, in general, the first ship is attacked ceil(k/2) times, and the last ship is attacked floor(k/2) times.

But this might not be directly useful, because the ships can sink in between attacks.

I need a way to efficiently simulate the process without iterating attack by attack.

Let me consider processing in phases.

In each phase, I determine how many attacks can be performed before one of the current first or last ships sinks.

Let's define:

- Let l be the current first ship index.

- Let r be the current last ship index.

- Let a[l] be the durability of the first ship.

- Let a[r] be the durability of the last ship.

- Let k be the remaining attacks.

In each phase:

- Determine the number of attacks that can be performed before one of the ships sinks.

- If a[l] <= a[r], then the first ship will sink after a[l] attacks.

- In these a[l] attacks, the first ship will be attacked ceil(a[l]/2) times, and the last ship will be attacked floor(a[l]/2) times.

- Wait, no. The attacks are alternating between first and last.

- So, in a[l] attacks, the first ship is attacked ceil(a[l]/2) times, and the last ship is attacked floor(a[l]/2) times.

- But, after a[l] attacks, the first ship's durability will be a[l] - ceil(a[l]/2).

- Wait, no. Wait, the first ship is attacked ceil(a[l]/2) times, so its durability decreases by ceil(a[l]/2).

- Similarly, the last ship is attacked floor(a[l]/2) times.

- But I need to make sure that the first ship's durability becomes zero or less.

- Wait, maybe this approach is too convoluted.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have a queue of ships, with their durabilities.

I need to process attacks in sequence: first ship, last ship, first ship, last ship, and so on.

I need to keep track of which ship is currently the first and which is the last, and update their durabilities accordingly.

But with large n and large k, I need an efficient way to do this.

An idea: use two pointers, l and r, to represent the current first and last ships.

In each step, determine how many attacks can be performed before one of them sinks.

Suppose I have a[l] and a[r].

The number of attacks that can be performed before one of them sinks is m = min(a[l], a[r]).

Wait, no. Since attacks are alternating between first and last, I need to consider how many attacks can be performed on both before one sinks.

Wait, perhaps m = 2 * min(a[l], a[r]).

Because for each min(a[l], a[r]) cycles, each ship loses min(a[l], a[r]) durability.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think in terms of pairs of attacks.

Each pair consists of one attack on the first ship and one on the last ship.

So, in each pair, both ships lose 1 durability.

Therefore, the number of pairs that can be performed before one of them sinks is min(a[l], a[r]).

After that, one of the ships will have sunk, and the other may still have some durability left.

So, I can process m = min(a[l], a[r]) pairs, which use up 2*m attacks.

Then, if a[l] > m, the first ship still has a[l] - m durability left.

Similarly, if a[r] > m, the last ship has a[r] - m durability left.

But wait, since in m pairs, both ships lose m durability each.

So, after m pairs, a[l] becomes a[l] - m, and a[r] becomes a[r] - m.

If a[l] - m == 0, the first ship sinks, and l increases by 1.

Similarly, if a[r] - m == 0, the last ship sinks, and r decreases by 1.

Then, repeat the process with the new first and last ships.

This seems efficient because in each step, I can process a block of attacks in O(1) time, and I have O(n) ships, so overall O(n) time per test case.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, this should be acceptable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize l = 0, r = n - 1.

While l < r and k >= 2:

- m = min(a[l], a[r])

- attacks needed to reduce both ships by m is 2*m attacks.

- If 2*m <= k:

- Perform 2*m attacks: a[l] -= m, a[r] -= m, k -= 2*m.

- If a[l] == 0, l += 1.

- If a[r] == 0, r -= 1.

- Else (2*m > k):

- Need to handle the remaining k attacks.

- Determine how many attacks are left: k.

- The number of pairs is k // 2.

- So, both ships lose k // 2 durability.

- The remaining attack is k % 2.

- If k % 2 == 1, the first ship is attacked one more time.

- So, a[l] -= (k // 2 + k % 1)

- a[r] -= (k // 2)

- Then, check if a[l] <= 0 or a[r] <= 0 and handle accordingly.

After processing all attacks, count the number of ships that have a[i] <= 0.

Wait, no. The problem says that when a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the lineup.

So, the ships that have been sunk are those that have a[i] == 0.

But actually, in the process, once a ship sinks, it's removed, meaning l increases or r decreases.

So, the ships that have been processed and removed are those with indices from l to r, exclusive.

Wait, no.

Actually, as l increases and r decreases, the ships from l to r are the remaining ships.

So, the sunk ships are those that were at positions before l and after r.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

Initially, l = 0, r = n - 1.

As ships sink, l increases and r decreases.

So, the ships that have been sunk are those with indices less than l and greater than r.

Therefore, the number of sunk ships is l (from 0 to l-1) plus (n - 1 - r).

Because ships from 0 to l-1 have been sunk from the front, and ships from r+1 to n-1 have been sunk from the back.

Wait, no.

Wait, as l increases, ships from l=0 to l=current l-1 have been sunk from the front.

Similarly, as r decreases, ships from r=current r+1 to n-1 have been sunk from the back.

So, total sunk ships are l (front) + (n - 1 - r) (back).

But need to be careful when l > r, meaning all ships have been sunk.

But in the loop, we stop when l >= r or k <= 0.

After the loop, if l > r, all ships have been sunk.

Else, we need to check if the remaining k attacks can sink the remaining ships.

Wait, no. In the loop, we process as many full cycles as possible, then handle the remaining k attacks.

But in the earlier step, I considered handling the remaining k attacks when 2*m > k.

But perhaps I need to adjust that.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Initialize l = 0, r = n - 1.

While l < r and k >= 2:

- m = min(a[l], a[r])

- if 2*m <= k:

- a[l] -= m

- a[r] -= m

- k -= 2*m

- if a[l] == 0:

- l += 1

- if a[r] == 0:

- r -= 1

- else:

- # remaining k attacks

- attacks_first = (k + 1) // 2

- attacks_last = k // 2

- a[l] -= attacks_first

- a[r] -= attacks_last

- if a[l] <= 0:

- l += 1

- if a[r] <= 0:

- r -= 1

- break  # No more attacks

After the loop:

- If l > r, all ships have been sunk.

- Else, check if the remaining k attacks can sink the last remaining ship.

Wait, in the else clause, after handling the remaining k attacks, we break, assuming no more attacks are left.

But perhaps I need to check if l == r after handling the remaining attacks.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Let me try to think differently.

In the loop:

- While l < r and k >= 2:

- m = min(a[l], a[r])

- if 2*m <= k:

- a[l] -= m

- a[r] -= m

- k -= 2*m

- if a[l] == 0:

- l += 1

- if a[r] == 0:

- r -= 1

- else:

- # remaining k attacks

- attacks_first = (k + 1) // 2

- attacks_last = k // 2

- a[l] -= attacks_first

- a[r] -= attacks_last

- if a[l] <= 0:

- l += 1

- if a[r] <= 0:

- r -= 1

- break  # No more attacks

After the loop:

- If l < r:

- All ships from l to r are still afloat.

- Else:

- All ships have been sunk.

So, the number of sunk ships is l (sunk from the front) plus (n - 1 - r) (sunk from the back).

But need to handle the case when l == r separately.

Because if l == r and k > a[l], then the last ship is sunk.

So, after the loop, if l == r and k >= a[l], then l += 1.

Finally, the number of sunk ships is l + (n - 1 - r).

Wait, no. Ships sunk from the front are l, and from the back are n - 1 - r.

So, total sunk ships are l + (n - 1 - r).

But need to make sure that when l > r, all ships are sunk.

Also, need to handle the case when l == r and k >= a[l], then l += 1, meaning one more ship is sunk.

So, in code:

- After the loop, if l == r and k >= a[l], then l += 1

- Then, sunk ships = l + (n - r - 1)

Let me test this logic with the first example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step by step:

Initialize l=0, r=3

Loop:

m = min(1,3) = 1

2*1 = 2 <= 5: yes

a[0] -=1 (0), a[3]-=1 (2), k -=2 (3)

a[0] ==0, l +=1 -> l=1

Now l=1, r=3

m = min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 <=3: no

So, remaining k=3

attacks_first = (3+1)//2 =2

attacks_last =3//2=1

a[1]-=2 (0), a[3]-=1 (1)

a[1]<=0, l +=1 -> l=2

a[3]>0, r=3

Break

Now, l=2, r=3

Check if l == r: no

Sunk ships: l + (n-1 -r) =2 + (3 -3)=2

Which matches the example.

Another example: n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Follow similar steps:

First loop:

m=min(1,3)=1

2*1=2 <=6: yes

a[0]-=1 (0), a[3]-=1 (2), k=4

l +=1 -> l=1

Now l=1, r=3

m=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 <=4: yes

a[1]-=2 (0), a[3]-=2 (0), k=0

l +=1 -> l=2

r -=1 -> r=2

Now l=2, r=2, k=0

Sunk ships: l + (n-1 -r)=2 + (3 -2)=1 +1=2

Wait, but according to the example, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, in the second step:

After first loop:

a=[0,2,4,1], l=1, r=3, k=5

Then:

m=min(2,1)=1

2*1=2 <=5: yes

a[1]-=1 (1), a[3]-=1 (0), k=3

if a[1]>0, l remains 1

a[3]==0, r -=1 -> r=2

Now, l=1, r=2, k=3

m=min(1,4)=1

2*1=2 <=3: yes

a[1]-=1 (0), a[2]-=1 (3), k=1

a[1]==0, l +=1 -> l=2

a[2]>0, r remains 2

Now, l=2, r=2, k=1

Since l == r and k=1 >= a[2]=3: no

So, sunk ships: l + (n-1 -r)=2 + (3-2)=1 +1=2

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the first step:

Initial a=[1,2,4,3], l=0, r=3, k=6

First attack: a[0]=0, k=5

l +=1, l=1

Now a=[0,2,4,2], l=1, r=3, k=5

Second attack: a[3]=2-1=1, k=4

Third attack: a[1]=2-1=1, k=3

Fourth attack: a[3]=1-1=0, k=2

r -=1, r=2

Now a=[0,1,4,0], l=1, r=2, k=2

Fifth attack: a[1]=1-1=0, k=1

l +=1, l=2

Sixth attack: a[2]=4-1=3, k=0

Now, l=2, r=2, a=[0,0,3,0]

Sunk ships: indices 0,1,3 -> 3 ships

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had sunk ships = l + (n-1 -r)=2 + (3-2)=2

So, it's incorrect.

I need to adjust my calculation.

Perhaps the number of sunk ships is l + (n - r -1)

In this case, l=2, r=2, n=4

sunk ships =2 + (4 -2 -1)=2 +1=3

Which matches the sample.

So, my earlier calculation was wrong.

Okay, so the correct formula is l + (n - r -1)

Let me confirm with another sample.

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Process:

l=0, r=4

m=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 <=20: yes

a[0]-=2 (0), a[4]-=2 (0), k=16

l +=1, r -=1

Now l=1, r=3, a=[0,7,1,8,0], k=16

m=min(7,8)=7

2*7=14 <=16: yes

a[1]-=7 (0), a[3]-=7 (1), k=2

l +=1, r remains 3

Now l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,1,1,0], k=2

m=min(1,1)=1

2*1=2 <=2: yes

a[2]-=1 (0), a[3]-=1 (0), k=0

l +=1, r -=1

Now l=3, r=2

Since l > r, all ships have been sunk.

sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)=3 + (5 -2 -1)=3 +2=5

Which matches the sample.

Another sample: n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

l=0, r=1

m=min(3,2)=2

2*2=4 >2: so remaining k=2

attacks_first=(2+1)//2=1

attacks_last=2//2=1

a[0]-=1 (2), a[1]-=1(1), k=0

a[0]>0, a[1]>0, l and r remain same

sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)=0 + (2 -1 -1)=0 +0=0

Which matches the sample.

Another sample: n=2, k=7, a=[5,2]

l=0, r=1

m=min(5,2)=2

2*2=4 <=7: yes

a[0]-=2 (3), a[1]-=2(0), k=3

r -=1 -> r=0

Now l=0, r=0, a=[3,0], k=3

Since l == r, check if k >= a[l]=3

Yes, so l +=1

Now l=1, r=0

sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)=1 + (2 -0 -1)=1 +1=2

Which matches the sample.

Looks like the logic is correct.

So, in code, I need to:

- Read t

- For each test case:

- Read n, k

- Read a as list of integers

- Initialize l=0, r=n-1

- While l < r and k >=2:

- m = min(a[l], a[r])

- if 2*m <=k:

- a[l] -=m

- a[r] -=m

- k -=2*m

- if a[l]==0:

- l +=1

- if a[r]==0:

- r -=1

- else:

- attacks_first = (k +1)//2

- attacks_last = k//2

- a[l] -= attacks_first

- a[r] -= attacks_last

- if a[l] <=0:

- l +=1

- if a[r] <=0:

- r -=1

- break

- After loop:

- if l <= r and k >0:

- if l == r:

- if k >= a[l]:

- l +=1

- Finally, sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)

- Print the number of sunk ships.

I need to make sure that I handle the cases where l > r or k <=0 appropriately.

Also, need to handle the case when n=1 separately, but in the loop above, it should be covered.

Let me test with n=1, k=1, a=[1]

Initialize l=0, r=0

Loop: l < r is false, so skip loop

Check if l <= r and k >0: yes

Check if l == r and k >= a[l]: yes, l +=1

sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)=1 + (1 -0 -1)=1 +0=1

Which is correct.

Another test: n=1, k=0, a=[1]

Skip loop

Check if l <= r and k >0: no

sunk ships = l + (n - r -1)=0 + (1 -0 -1)=0 +0=0

Correct.

Another test: n=1, k=2, a=[1]

Loop:

l=0, r=0

l <= r and k >0: yes

l == r and k >= a[l]: yes, l +=1

sunk ships =1 + (1 -0 -1)=1 +0=1

Correct.

Seems solid.

Now, implement this logic in code.

I need to make sure that the code is efficient, as n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so overall time should be acceptable.

Also, need to read input efficiently.

In Python, reading input with sys.stdin.readline might be faster.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Implement the function as described.

I think this should work.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ships are sunk after a series of attacks by the Kraken. The Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ships in a line, reducing their durability until they are sunk.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of ships (`n`), the number of attacks (`k`), and the durability of each ship (`a`).

2. **Simulate Attacks Efficiently**:
   - Use two pointers (`l` and `r`) to track the current first and last ships.
   - In each step, calculate the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`m = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - Determine if the Kraken can perform a full cycle of attacks (reducing each of the first and last ships by `m` durability) without exceeding the remaining attacks (`k`).
   - Adjust the durability of the ships and the number of remaining attacks accordingly.
   - Move the pointers inward as ships are sunk.

3. **Handle Remaining Attacks**:
   - If there are remaining attacks after processing full cycles, handle them by calculating how many attacks are applied to the first and last ships.
   - Adjust the durability of the ships and move the pointers if any ship is sunk.

4. **Calculate Sunk Ships**:
   - After processing all attacks, calculate the number of sunk ships as the sum of ships sunk from the front and the back.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    while T:
        T -= 1
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        ans = 0
        while l < r and k >= 2:
            m = min(a[l], a[r])
            if 2 * m <= k:
                a[l] -= m
                a[r] -= m
                k -= 2 * m
                if a[l] == 0:
                    l += 1
                if a[r] == 0:
                    r -= 1
            else:
                attacks_first = (k + 1) // 2
                attacks_last = k // 2
                a[l] -= attacks_first
                a[r] -= attacks_last
                if a[l] <= 0:
                    l += 1
                if a[r] <= 0:
                    r -= 1
                break
        if l <= r and k > 0:
            if l == r:
                if k >= a[l]:
                    l += 1
        ans = l + (n - r - 1)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Read input values for the number of test cases, ships, attacks, and durability.
- **Simulate Attacks**: Use a while loop to process attacks in cycles, reducing durability of the first and last ships efficiently.
- **Handle Remaining Attacks**: If attacks are left after processing full cycles, handle them to sink any additional ships.
- **Calculate Sunk Ships**: Sum the ships sunk from the front and the back to get the total number of sunk ships.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.
