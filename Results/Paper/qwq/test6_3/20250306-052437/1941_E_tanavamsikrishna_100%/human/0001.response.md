Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Bernard is always late when visiting Rudolf because he has to cross a river on a ferry. Rudolf wants to help by building bridges across the river to make it easier for Bernard.

The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell has a depth value, and the depths on the first and last columns are always zero because those are the banks of the river.

Rudolf can build bridges on consecutive rows of the river, specifically k bridges on k consecutive rows. For each bridge, he needs to install supports in certain columns to ensure the bridge is stable. The supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.

The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1. The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have a grid of size n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The depth values are given for each cell, and we need to build k bridges on k consecutive rows. For each bridge, we need to decide where to place the supports to minimize the total cost.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding Bridge Construction:**

   - For each row where a bridge is built, we must place supports in the first column (j=1) and the last column (j=m).
   - Additionally, we can place supports in any columns in between, but the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d. The distance between supports in columns j1 and j2 is |j1 - j2| - 1.

2. **Cost Calculation:**

   - The cost of placing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.
   - We need to minimize the total cost for building k bridges on k consecutive rows.

3. **Approach:**

   - We need to find the minimum cost for each row to build a bridge, considering the support placement constraints.
   - Then, since the bridges are built on k consecutive rows, we need to find the minimum sum of costs for any k consecutive rows.

Let's think about how to compute the minimum cost for a single row first.

**Single Row Minimum Cost:**

Given a row with m columns, we need to place supports in column 1 and m, and possibly some columns in between, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

Let's define dp[j] as the minimum cost to place supports from column 1 to column j, inclusive.

- dp[0] = 0 (since column 1 is always included)
- dp[1] = a[i,1] + 1 (cost of placing support in column 1)
- dp[j] for j from 2 to m-1:
  - We can place a support in column j, which costs a[i,j] + 1, and the last support before j must be in a column between j - d and j - 1.
  - Or, we can choose not to place a support in column j, which means the last support was in some column before j, but we need to ensure that the distance between supports does not exceed d.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Another way to look at it is to consider that we need to place supports such that every column is either a support or is within d columns of a support.

Given that, we can model this as finding a minimum cost set of supports that cover the entire row with the given constraints.

But dynamic programming seems like a good fit here.

Let's try to define dp[j] as the minimum cost to place supports up to and including column j.

Base cases:

- dp[0] = 0 (no columns)
- dp[1] = a[i,1] + 1 (must place support in column 1)

For dp[j], j from 2 to m:

- We must place a support in column j, which costs a[i,j] + 1, and the previous support can be in any column from j - d to j - 1.
- Or, if j - 1 is within d columns of the last support before j - d, we might not need to place a support in j, but this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the columns and decide whether to place a support or not, keeping track of the last support's position.

But that might be too slow for large m.

Looking back at the reference solution, it seems to have a function func_1 that computes the minimum cost for a single row.

Let's examine func_1:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

This seems to be using a sliding window minimum approach with a heap to keep track of the minimum cost in the previous d columns.

Let me try to understand this.

- Initialize row[0] = 1 (since a[i,1] = 0, so 0 + 1 = 1)

- For columns 1 to d-1, set row[i] = row[i] + 2. Wait, why +2? a[i,j] + 1, but a[i,j] is given, so this seems off.

Wait, perhaps the row is being modified in place.

Wait, maybe I need to look at this differently.

Let's consider that row[i] represents the cumulative cost up to column i.

Then, for each column i, the cost is the minimum of:

- The cost of placing a support in column i, which is a[i,j] + 1, plus the minimum cost up to column j - d <= k <= j - 1.

This seems similar to a dynamic programming approach where dp[j] = a[i,j] + 1 + min(dp[k] for k in range(max(0, j - d), j))

To optimize this, we can use a sliding window minimum over the last d columns.

The reference solution seems to be using a heap to keep track of the minimum in the last d columns.

However, using a heap might not be the most efficient, as we need to ensure that we're only considering the last d columns.

A better approach might be to use a deque to maintain the indices of dp values in the last d columns, with the front of the deque having the smallest dp value.

But let's see what the reference solution is doing.

It sets row[0] = 1, which makes sense because a[i,1] = 0, so cost is 1.

Then, for columns 1 to d-1, it sets row[i] = row[i] + 2.

Wait, but a[i,j] can be any value, so this seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the code.

Looking again, it seems that func_1 is intended to compute the minimum cost for a single row with the given constraints.

Given that, perhaps it's implementing a dynamic programming approach with a sliding window minimum.

The heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost in the previous d columns.

Let me try to understand the code step by step.

1. row[0] = 1 # since a[i,1] = 0, so cost is 1

2. For i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

Wait, why +2? a[i,j] + 1, but a[i,j] is given, so this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the row is being modified in place to store the cumulative cost.

Wait, maybe I need to see the input row.

In func_2, rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

So, rows contain the a[i,j] values.

Then, costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]

So, func_1 is applied to each row to compute the cost for that row.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

This seems to be incorrect because:

- row[0] is set to 1, which is a[i,1] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1, correct.

- For i in range(1, d), row[i] = row[i] + 2. Why +2? a[i,j] + 1, which is row[i] + 1, not +2.

This seems like a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to set row[i] = a[i,j] + 1, but it's being set to row[i] + 2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the row is being modified in place to store the cumulative cost.

Let's consider that row[i] is being updated to store the minimum cost to reach column i.

Then, for i from d to len(row)-1, it's updating row[i] based on the minimum in the previous d columns.

But the heap is being used to keep track of the minimum in the last d columns.

However, the way it's implemented seems flawed because:

- It pops elements from the heap that are older than d columns, which seems correct.

- Then, it takes the smallest element from the heap and adds it to row[i] + 1.

But, according to the dynamic programming approach, it should be:

dp[i] = a[i,j] + 1 + min(dp[k] for k in range(max(0, i - d), i))

So, row[i] should be a[i,j] + 1 + min(previous d dp values)

But in the code, it's setting row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e[0] is the minimum dp value in the last d columns.

This seems incorrect because row[i] is being added again, which is a[i,j], so it's effectively:

dp[i] = min(dp[k] for k in range(max(0, i - d), i)) + a[i,j] + row[i] + 1

But row[i] is a[i,j], so it's adding a[i,j] twice.

This doesn't make sense.

Therefore, the func_1 implementation is flawed.

A correct implementation should be:

- Initialize dp[0] = a[i,1] + 1

- For each column j from 1 to m-1:

dp[j] = a[i,j] + 1 + min(dp[k] for k in range(max(0, j - d), j))

- Finally, dp[m-1] is the cost for this row.

To optimize, we can use a sliding window minimum, perhaps with a deque.

So, the reference solution is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
