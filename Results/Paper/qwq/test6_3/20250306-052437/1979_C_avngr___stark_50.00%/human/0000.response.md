Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount x_i on each outcome. The goal is to distribute my bets in such a way that no matter which outcome wins, the money I get back is more than the total amount I bet.

Let me try to rephrase that to make sure I understand. I have to choose bets x1, x2, ..., xn such that for every i from 1 to n, the product of ki and xi is greater than the sum of all xj's. And all xi should be positive integers.

So, for each possible winning outcome, the reward should be greater than the total bet.

First, I need to check if such a distribution exists. If it doesn't, I should output -1. If it does, I need to find and output one possible set of xi's that satisfy the condition.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 3

k = [3, 2, 7]

One possible solution is x = [27, 41, 12]

Total bet: 27 + 41 + 12 = 80

If first outcome wins: 3*27 = 81 > 80

If second outcome wins: 2*41 = 82 > 80

If third outcome wins: 7*12 = 84 > 80

So, this satisfies the condition.

In the second test case:

n = 2

k = [3, 3]

x = [1, 1]

Total bet: 1 + 1 = 2

If first outcome wins: 3*1 = 3 > 2

If second outcome wins: 3*1 = 3 > 2

Good.

In the third test case:

n = 5

k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The output is -1, meaning it's impossible to find such x's.

Wait, why is that? Let's think about it.

If all k_i are equal, say k, then for the condition to hold, for each i:

k * x_i > sum of all x_j's

But sum of all x_j's includes x_i.

So, k * x_i > sum x_j

But sum x_j = sum_{j≠i} x_j + x_i

So, k * x_i > sum_{j≠i} x_j + x_i

Which implies (k - 1) * x_i > sum_{j≠i} x_j

If all k_i are equal, and we set all x_i equal to some value, say x, then:

(k - 1) * x > (n - 1) * x

So, (k - 1) * x > (n - 1) * x

Which implies (k - 1) > (n - 1), since x is positive.

So, k > n

In this third test case, k = 5 and n = 5, so 5 > 5 is false. Hence, it's impossible, and output is -1.

Got it.

So, generalizing, for a solution to exist, for each i:

k_i > (sum_{j≠i} x_j) / x_i + 1

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be using some mathematical approach involving least common multiples and greatest common divisors.

Let me try to understand the program.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the list of k_i's

- Initialize m to 1

- Compute m as the product of all k_i's

- Then, for each i, compute c_i as m divided by k_i

- Compute the greatest common divisor (hcf) of all c_i's

- Divide each c_i by this hcf to get the minimal possible x_i's

- Check if the sum of these c_i's is less than m / hcf

- If yes, output the c_i's; else, output -1

Wait, in the code, it says:

if sum(c) >= m / hcf:

print(-1)

else:

print the c's

But according to the problem, the sum of bets should be strictly less than the reward for each outcome.

So, let's see.

Each c_i is m / k_i

And hcf is the greatest common divisor of all c_i's

Then, c_i = (m / k_i) / hcf

And sum(c) should be strictly less than m / hcf

Wait, but in the first test case:

k = [3,2,7]

m = 3*2*7 = 42

c = [42/3, 42/2, 42/7] = [14,21,6]

hcf = gcd of [14,21,6]

gcd of 14 and 21 is 7, gcd of 7 and 6 is 1

So hcf =1

Then c = [14,21,6]

sum(c) = 14+21+6=41

m/hcf =42/1=42

41 < 42, so output [14,21,6]

But in the example, it's outputting [27,41,12]

Hmm, different numbers but still satisfying the condition.

So, is there more than one solution?

Yes, the problem says "if there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them"

So, [14,21,6] is also a valid solution, but the example shows [27,41,12]

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first test case, the output is 27 41 12, sum is 80, m/hcf is 42/1=42, but 80 >=42, which seems to contradict the condition in the code.

Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the logic better.

Let me look at the function func_1, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers.

So, in the code, hcf is the GCD of all c_i's, where c_i = m / k_i

Then, each x_i is c_i / hcf

The condition is sum(c) < m / hcf

But in the first test case, sum(c) =14+21+6=41, m/hcf=42/1=42, 41 <42, so it should output [14,21,6], but the example output is [27,41,12]

Wait, perhaps I need to scale up the x_i's to match the example.

Wait, in the code, it's outputting c_i's divided by hcf, but in the example, it's outputting different numbers.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Let me try to compute it step by step for the first test case.

n=3

k=[3,2,7]

m=3*2*7=42

c=[42/3,42/2,42/7]=[14,21,6]

hcf=func_1([14,21,6])

GCD of 14 and 21 is 7, GCD of 7 and 6 is 1

So hcf=1

Then, x_i = c_i / hcf = [14,21,6]

Sum(x_i)=14+21+6=41

m/hcf=42/1=42

41 <42, so output [14,21,6]

But in the example, it's outputting [27,41,12], which sums to 80, which is less than 81,82,84 respectively.

So, both [14,21,6] and [27,41,12] are valid solutions.

So, the code seems to be outputting a valid solution, but not necessarily the same as in the example.

Does that mean the code is correct?

Wait, but according to the problem, if a solution exists, there is always a solution with x_i <=10^9, and it's acceptable to output any such solution.

So, as long as the output satisfies the condition, it's acceptable.

Hence, outputting [14,21,6] would also be acceptable, since 3*14=42>41, 2*21=42>41, 7*6=42>41.

Wait, but in the example, it's outputting [27,41,12], which sums to 80, and the rewards are 81,82,84, which are all greater than 80.

So, both solutions are correct.

Hence, the code seems to be correct.

But wait, in the code, it's using integer division for c_i = int(m / k_i)

In Python 3, / performs floating-point division, but since m is an integer and k_i is an integer, m / k_i is a float, and then int() truncates it to an integer.

But in Python, when m is divisible by k_i, it should be fine.

Wait, but in the first test case, 42 / 3 =14.0, int(14.0)=14, which is correct.

But what if m is not divisible by k_i?

Wait, according to the problem, m is the product of all k_i's, so m should be divisible by each k_i, hence m / k_i should be an integer.

Wait, m is initialized to 1 and multiplied by each k_i, so m is the product of all k_i's.

Hence, m is divisible by each k_i, so c_i = m / k_i is an integer.

Hence, int(m / k_i) is safe.

Then, hcf is computed as the GCD of all c_i's.

Then, each x_i is c_i / hcf

Since c_i is divisible by hcf, x_i is an integer.

Then, the condition is sum(c_i) < m / hcf

If this condition holds, output the x_i's; else, output -1

Wait, but in the first test case, sum(c_i)=41 <42, which holds, so output [14,21,6]

But the example output is [27,41,12], which also satisfies the condition.

So, both are valid.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But in the third test case:

n=5

k=[5,5,5,5,5]

m=5^5=3125

c=[3125/5,3125/5,3125/5,3125/5,3125/5]=[625,625,625,625,625]

hcf=func_1([625,625,625,625,625])=625

x_i=625/625=1 for all i

sum(x_i)=5

m/hcf=3125/625=5

5 >=5, so output -1

Which matches the example output.

Good.

In the fourth test case:

n=6

k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

m=7*9*3*17*9*13= unknown, but let's assume it's some large number.

Compute c_i = m / k_i

Then hcf = GCD of all c_i's

Then x_i = c_i / hcf

Sum(x_i) < m / hcf

If this holds, output x_i's; else, -1

In the example, it's outputting some numbers, so presumably, sum(x_i) < m / hcf

In the fifth test case:

n=3

k=[6,3,2]

m=6*3*2=36

c=[36/6,36/3,36/2]=[6,12,18]

hcf=func_1([6,12,18])

GCD of 6 and 12 is 6, GCD of 6 and 18 is 6

hcf=6

x_i=[6/6,12/6,18/6]=[1,2,3]

sum(x_i)=6

m/hcf=36/6=6

6 >=6, so output -1

Which matches the example output.

In the sixth test case:

n=5

k=[9,4,6,8,3]

m=9*4*6*8*3= unknown, but let's compute it.

9*4=36

36*6=216

216*8=1728

1728*3=5184

c=[5184/9,5184/4,5184/6,5184/8,5184/3]=[576,1296,864,648,1728]

hcf=func_1([576,1296,864,648,1728])

Compute GCD of these numbers.

GCD of 576 and 1296 is 144

GCD of 144 and 864 is 144

GCD of 144 and 648 is 72

GCD of 72 and 1728 is 72

hcf=72

x_i=[576/72,1296/72,864/72,648/72,1728/72]=[8,18,12,9,24]

sum(x_i)=8+18+12+9+24=71

m/hcf=5184/72=72

71 <72, so output [8,18,12,9,24]

Which matches the example output.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for all the provided test cases.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's try to understand the logic behind it.

The idea seems to be to assign x_i proportional to m / k_i, where m is the product of all k_i's.

Then, to minimize the x_i's, divide them by their GCD.

Finally, check if the sum of these minimal x_i's is less than m / hcf.

If yes, then this is a valid solution.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Is this always correct?

Let's consider the general case.

Let m = product of all k_i's

Let c_i = m / k_i

Then, hcf = GCD of all c_i's

Let x_i = c_i / hcf

We need to check if sum(x_i) < m / hcf

If yes, output x_i's; else, -1

Why does this work?

First, note that m is divisible by each k_i, since m is the product of all k_i's.

Hence, c_i is an integer.

Also, hcf divides each c_i, so x_i is an integer.

Now, for the condition to hold:

For each i, k_i * x_i > sum_{j=1 to n} x_j

But in the code, it's checking sum(x_i) < m / hcf

And m / hcf = (product of all k_i) / hcf

Wait, is this correct?

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to see this.

Let's consider that x_i = c_i / hcf = (m / k_i) / hcf

Then, k_i * x_i = m / hcf

So, for the condition, we need m / hcf > sum(x_j) for all i

But since this must hold for all i, and m / hcf is the same for all i, we just need to check that m / hcf > sum(x_j)

Hence, the condition in the code seems correct.

If sum(x_i) < m / hcf, then for each i, k_i * x_i = m / hcf > sum(x_j), which satisfies the condition.

Hence, the code is correct.

But in the first test case, the example output is [27,41,12], sum=80, m/hcf=42, but 80 >=42, which seems contradictory.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, sum(x_i)=41 <42, so it should output [14,21,6], which sums to 41.

But the example output is [27,41,12], which sums to 80, which is still less than the m/hcf scaled up.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand that there are multiple solutions, and the code is outputting one minimal solution, while the example is showing another valid solution.

Perhaps the problem allows for multiple solutions, and the code is correctly outputting one of them.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that, regardless of which outcome wins, the reward received is strictly greater than the total coins bet. If such a distribution is possible, we output the amounts to bet on each outcome; otherwise, we output -1.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases and, for each test case, read the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.
2. **Compute Product of Multipliers**: Calculate the product of all multipliers to serve as a base for calculating individual bets.
3. **Calculate Individual Bets**: For each outcome, compute an initial bet by dividing the total product by the respective multiplier.
4. **Simplify Bets**: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial bets and divide each initial bet by this GCD to get the minimal possible integer bets.
5. **Check Condition**: Verify if the sum of these minimal bets is strictly less than the total product divided by the GCD. If yes, output the minimal bets; otherwise, output -1.

### Solution Code

```python
from math import gcd

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m *= k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(m // k[i])
    hcf = func_1(c)
    x = [ci // hcf for ci in c]
    if sum(x) < m // hcf:
        print(' '.join(map(str, x)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Parsing**: We read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, we read `n` (number of outcomes) and the list of multipliers `k`.
2. **Compute Product of Multipliers**: We calculate `m` as the product of all `k_i`, which helps in determining the initial bets.
3. **Calculate Individual Bets**: We compute `c_i` for each outcome as `m / k_i`, which gives the initial bet amounts.
4. **Simplify Bets**: We find the GCD of all `c_i` and divide each `c_i` by this GCD to get the smallest possible integer bets `x_i`.
5. **Check Condition**: We check if the sum of `x_i` is strictly less than `m / hcf`. If it is, we output the bets `x_i`; otherwise, we output -1, indicating no valid distribution exists.

This approach ensures that the bets are minimized while satisfying the problem's condition, making it efficient and straightforward.
