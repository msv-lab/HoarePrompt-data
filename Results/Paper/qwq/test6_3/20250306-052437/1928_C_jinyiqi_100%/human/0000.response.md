Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this physical education lesson where students line up and are assigned numbers based on a specific pattern involving a parameter k, where k > 1. The pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. The first k positions are numbered 1 through k, and the next k-2 positions are numbered k-1 down to 2. Then this pattern repeats.

For example, if k=3, the pattern would be: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,...

Given that Vasya remembers his position in the line (n) and the number he was assigned (x), I need to find out how many natural numbers k (greater than 1) satisfy these conditions.

The input consists of multiple test cases, each with n and x, and I need to output the count of such k for each test case.

First, I need to understand the pattern of numbering based on k.

Let's take k=3 as an example:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...

Numbers:   1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,...

So, the pattern repeats every 2*3 - 2 = 4 positions: 1,2,3,2.

Similarly, for k=4:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...

Numbers:   1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,...

Pattern repeats every 6 positions: 1,2,3,4,3,2.

Given n and x, I need to find all k >1 such that the n-th position is assigned the number x.

I need to find all k >1 where the n-th position in the repeating pattern corresponds to x.

First, I need to understand how to determine the number at position n for a given k.

The pattern repeats every 2k -2 positions.

So, the number at position n is determined by the position of n within its respective block of 2k-2.

Let me find a way to map n to its corresponding number in the pattern.

Let block_size = 2k -2

Then, the block number is floor((n-1)/block_size) 

And the position within the block is (n-1) mod block_size +1

Within each block, the first k positions are 1 to k, and the next k-2 positions are k-1 down to 2.

So, for a given k, to find the number at position n:

Compute position = (n-1) mod (2k -2) +1

If position <= k, number = position

Else, number = 2k - position

Wait, let's verify that.

For k=3:

block_size = 4

Positions in block: 1,2,3,2

So, for position=1: number=1

position=2: number=2

position=3: number=3

position=4: number=2

So, indeed, for position <=k, number=position

For position >k, number=2k - position

For k=3: 2*3 -4 = 2, which matches.

Similarly, for k=4:

block_size=6

Positions:1,2,3,4,3,2

position=1:1

position=2:2

position=3:3

position=4:4

position=5:2*4 -5=3

position=6:2*4 -6=2

Yes, that seems correct.

So, general formula:

number = position if position <=k else 2k - position

Given n and x, I need to find all k >1 where:

if position = (n-1) mod (2k -2) +1

then,

if position <=k, number=position

else, number=2k -position

and this number should be equal to x.

Additionally, k >1.

I need to find all integers k >1 that satisfy this condition.

Since n and x are given, I need to solve for k.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can rearrange the equations to solve for k.

First, let's denote m = (n-1) mod (2k -2)

Then, position = m +1

If position <=k, then x = position => x = m +1 => m = x -1

Else, x = 2k -position => x = 2k - (m +1) => m = 2k - x -1

So, two cases:

Case 1: position <=k => m = x -1

Case 2: position >k => m = 2k - x -1

But m = (n-1) mod (2k -2), which means 0 <= m < 2k -2

So, for both cases, m must satisfy 0 <= m < 2k -2

Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: m = x -1

Then, 0 <= x -1 < 2k -2 => 1 <= x < 2k -1

Also, since position <=k, m = x -1 < k

So, x -1 < k => k > x -1

But k >1, so k >= max(2, x)

Also, since m < 2k -2, x -1 < 2k -2 => x +1 < 2k => k > (x +1)/2

Combining with k >= max(2, x), we have k >= max(2, ceil((x+1)/2))

Also, since m = x -1, and m = (n-1) mod (2k -2), we have:

(n-1) mod (2k -2) = x -1

Which means (n-1) - (x -1) is divisible by (2k -2)

So, (n -x) is divisible by (2k -2)

Thus, 2k -2 divides (n -x)

So, 2k -2 is a divisor of (n -x)

Hence, 2k -2 <= |n -x|

But since n >x (given 1 <=x <n), n -x >=1

So, 2k -2 <= n -x

Thus, k <= (n -x +2)/2

Combining with k >= max(2, ceil((x+1)/2)), we have:

max(2, ceil((x+1)/2)) <= k <= floor((n -x +2)/2)

And k must be an integer in this range.

Similarly, since 2k -2 divides (n -x), we can write:

2k -2 divides (n -x)

So, for each divisor d of (n -x), we can set 2k -2 = d

Then, k = (d +2)/2

But d must be even because 2k -2 is even (since 2k is even and -2 is even, their difference is even).

Wait, 2k -2 = 2(k -1), which is always even.

So, d must be even.

Then, k = (d +2)/2 = k -1 = d/2 => k = d/2 +1

Also, since k must be integer, d must be even.

So, for each even divisor d of (n -x), compute k = (d +2)/2, and check if it satisfies the conditions.

Similarly, for Case 2: position >k

Then, m = 2k - x -1

And 0 <= m < 2k -2 => 0 <= 2k - x -1 < 2k -2

From 0 <= 2k - x -1, we have 2k - x -1 >=0 => 2k >= x +1 => k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

From 2k - x -1 < 2k -2, which simplifies to -x -1 < -2 => x +1 >2 => x >1

But x >=1, so this is always true for x >=2

Wait, x can be 1, but in this case, position >k implies x >=2, but x=1 is possible only in case 1.

Wait, no, x can be 1 in both cases, but in case 2, x >=2 is required.

Wait, let's see.

In case 2: position >k, number = 2k - position =x

If position >k, then position = m +1 >k, where m = 2k - x -1

So, m +1 >k => 2k - x -1 +1 >k => 2k -x >k => k >x

So, in this case, k >x

Also, m = 2k - x -1 >=0 => 2k - x -1 >=0 => k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

And m < 2k -2 => 2k - x -1 < 2k -2 => -x -1 < -2 => x +1 >2 => x >1

So, for case 2 to be possible, x >1

Hence, when x >1, we have two cases to consider.

When x=1, only case 1 is possible.

Wait, but in case 2, x >=2, so for x=1, only case 1 is possible.

So, in summary:

- For x=1: only case 1 applies.

- For x >=2: both case 1 and case 2 apply.

Now, in case 1: m = x -1

Then, (n-1) mod (2k -2) = x -1

Which implies that (n -1 - (x -1)) is divisible by (2k -2)

So, (n -x) is divisible by (2k -2)

Hence, 2k -2 divides (n -x)

Similarly, in case 2: m = 2k - x -1

Then, (n-1) mod (2k -2) = 2k - x -1

Which implies that (n -1) - (2k - x -1) is divisible by (2k -2)

Simplify: n -1 -2k +x +1 = n -2k +x

So, n -2k +x is divisible by (2k -2)

Hence, n +x -2k is divisible by (2k -2)

Or, n +x -2k = t*(2k -2), for some integer t.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since m = 2k - x -1, and m = (n-1) mod (2k -2), we have:

n -1 = q*(2k -2) + m = q*(2k -2) + 2k - x -1

Then, n -1 = q*(2k -2) + 2k - x -1

Simplify: n -1 = 2k*(q +1) -2q - x -1

Then, n -1 + x +1 -2k*(q +1) = -2q

So, n +x -2k*(q +1) = -2q

This seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me consider that in case 2, position >k, so position = m +1 >k, which implies m >=k

But m = 2k - x -1 >=k => 2k - x -1 >=k => k >= x +1

So, k >= x +1

Also, from earlier, k >x, so k >= x +1

Combining with m < 2k -2, which is 2k - x -1 < 2k -2 => -x -1 < -2 => x +1 >2 => x >1

Which is already covered since x >=2 in this case.

So, for case 2, k >= x +1, and k <= (n -x)/2 +1

Wait, from 2k -2 divides n -x in case 1, and 2k -2 divides n +x -2 in case 2.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that.

In case 1: 2k -2 divides n -x

In case 2: 2k -2 divides n +x -2

So, for both cases, 2k -2 divides either n -x or n +x -2.

Hence, for each divisor d of n -x or n +x -2, we can set 2k -2 = d, solve for k, and check if k satisfies the conditions.

But we need to make sure that k >1 and k satisfies the constraints for each case.

So, the plan is:

- Compute the divisors of n -x and n +x -2.

- For each divisor d of n -x, set 2k -2 = d, so k = (d +2)/2

- Check if k >= max(2, ceil((x +1)/2)) and k <= floor((n -x +2)/2)

- Similarly, for each divisor d of n +x -2, set 2k -2 = d, so k = (d +2)/2

- Check if k >= x +1 and k <= floor((n +x -2)/2)

Wait, no.

Wait, in case 2, 2k -2 divides n +x -2

And k >= x +1

So, for divisors of n +x -2, set 2k -2 = d, k = (d +2)/2, and check k >= x +1

Similarly, for divisors of n -x, set 2k -2 = d, k = (d +2)/2, and check k >= max(2, ceil((x +1)/2))

Then, collect all such k from both cases and remove duplicates, since k might appear in both cases.

Finally, count the number of such k.

Wait, but we need to make sure that for each k, it satisfies at least one of the cases.

So, perhaps it's better to collect all possible k from both cases and then take the union.

Also, need to make sure that k is integer and greater than 1.

Let me think about the sample input.

Sample Input:

5

10 2

3 1

76 4

100 99

1000000000 500000000

Sample Output:

4

1

9

0

1

Let's verify for the first test case: n=10, x=2

Possible k: 2,3,5,6

Let's check for k=2:

block_size=2*2-2=2

positions:1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2

numbers:1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2

n=10, number=2, which matches x=2

k=3:

block_size=4

positions:1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2

numbers:1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2

n=10, number=2, matches x=2

k=5:

block_size=8

positions:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2

numbers:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2

n=10, number=2, matches x=2

k=6:

block_size=10

positions:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2

numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2

n=10, number=2, matches x=2

So, all these k satisfy the condition.

Now, let's see how to generalize this.

I need to find all k >1 such that either:

- (n -x) is divisible by (2k -2), and k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

- or (n +x -2) is divisible by (2k -2), and k >= x +1

Then, k = (d +2)/2, where d is a divisor of either (n -x) or (n +x -2)

But need to make sure that k is integer, and k >1.

Also, need to ensure that for each k, it satisfies at least one of the cases.

Hence, the approach is:

- Find all divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2)

- For each divisor d of (n -x), compute k = (d +2)/2

- Check if k >= max(2, ceil((x +1)/2)) and k is integer

- For each divisor d of (n +x -2), compute k = (d +2)/2

- Check if k >= x +1 and k is integer

- Collect all such k and remove duplicates

- Output the count of such k

Also, need to handle the cases where n -x or n +x -2 is zero or negative.

Wait, n >x, so n -x >=1

n +x -2 can be less than or equal to zero if n +x -2 <=0, but given n >x >=1, n +x -2 >=1 +1 -2 =0

So, n +x -2 >=0

Hence, need to handle the case when n +x -2 ==0, which implies n=1 and x=1, but n >x, so n >=2 and x >=1, hence n +x -2 >=1.

Wait, n >=2 and x >=1, so n +x -2 >=1 +2 -2=1

Wait, if n=2 and x=1, n +x -2=1

If n=3 and x=1, n +x -2=2, etc.

Hence, n +x -2 >=1

So, no need to worry about non-positive values.

Now, in the code provided:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

output = []

if (n + x -2) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n + x -2)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

if (n - x) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n - x)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

output = list(set(output))

print(len(output))

def func_1(x):

output1 = []

output2 = []

for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) +1):

if x % i ==0:

output1.append(i)

output2.append(int(x /i))

output1.reverse()

return output2 + output1

So, func_1(x) returns all divisors of x in ascending order.

In the main loop:

For each test case with n and x:

Initialize an empty list output

If (n + x -2) % 2 ==0:

Get the divisors of (n + x -2), store in sep

For each divisor s in sep:

if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x:

append (s +2)/2 to output

If (n -x) %2 ==0:

Get the divisors of (n -x), store in sep

For each divisor s in sep:

if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x:

append (s +2)/2 to output

Convert output to a set to remove duplicates, then back to list

Print the length of output

So, it seems that the code is trying to collect all possible k from both cases where (n +x -2) is divisible by (2k -2) and (n -x) is divisible by (2k -2), under certain conditions.

But I need to verify if this aligns with my earlier reasoning.

From earlier:

For case 1: 2k -2 divides (n -x), and k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

For case 2: 2k -2 divides (n +x -2), and k >= x +1

In the code:

It checks if (n +x -2) %2 ==0, then gets divisors of (n +x -2), and for each divisor s, if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x, append (s +2)/2 to output

Similarly, if (n -x) %2 ==0, gets divisors of (n -x), and for each divisor s, if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x, append (s +2)/2 to output

Then, removes duplicates and counts the number of such k.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, for case 1: 2k -2 divides (n -x), so d =2k -2 is a divisor of (n -x), hence for each divisor d of (n -x), k = (d +2)/2

Similarly, for case 2: 2k -2 divides (n +x -2), so d =2k -2 is a divisor of (n +x -2), hence k = (d +2)/2

Then, the conditions are:

- For case 1: k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

- For case 2: k >= x +1

In the code, for both cases, it appends k=(s +2)/2 to output if (s +2) %2 ==0 and (s +2)/2 >=x

Wait, that's not exactly matching my conditions.

In case 1, the condition should be k >= ceil((x +1)/2)), not k >=x

In case 2, it should be k >=x +1

But in the code, it's appending if (s +2)/2 >=x, which is equivalent to k >=x

Wait, that might not be precise.

Let me see.

For case 1: k >= ceil((x +1)/2)

For case 2: k >= x +1

But in the code, it's appending if k >=x

Which is weaker than case 2's condition.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the condition k >=x is sufficient because for case 1, ceil((x +1)/2) <=x for x >=1

Wait, ceil((x +1)/2) <=x for x >=1

Wait, no.

For x=1: ceil(2/2)=1 <=1

x=2: ceil(3/2)=2 <=2

x=3: ceil(4/2)=2 <=3

x=4: ceil(5/2)=3 <=4

So, ceil((x +1)/2) <=x for x >=1

Hence, k >=x would cover both cases.

But in case 2, k >=x +1, which is stronger than
