Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of length n, where each element is between 1 and 10^9, and exactly k out of its n cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{x-1}. So, for example, if n=4, the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: a1, a2, a3, a4

- x=2: a2, a3, a4, a1

- x=3: a3, a4, a1, a2

- x=4: a4, a1, a2, a3

I need exactly k of these shifts to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. For n=2, k=2:

   - Array: [1, 1]

   - Cyclic shifts:

     - [1, 1] (sorted)

     - [1, 1] (sorted)

   - Both shifts are sorted, so k=2.

2. For n=3, k=1:

   - Array: [69420, 69, 420]

   - Cyclic shifts:

     - [69420, 69, 420] (not sorted)

     - [69, 420, 69420] (sorted)

     - [420, 69420, 69] (not sorted)

   - Only one sorted shift, so k=1.

3. For n=3, k=2:

   - Output: -1

   - Meaning, no such array exists.

So, for some values of n and k, there exists an array that satisfies the condition, and for others, it doesn't.

I need to find a general way to construct such an array for any given n and k, or determine that it's impossible.

Let me think about the properties of the array that make certain cyclic shifts sorted.

First, if k = n, meaning all cyclic shifts must be sorted, then the array must be constant. Because if any element changes, some shifts will not be sorted. For example, in [1,1], all shifts are [1,1], which is sorted. But if I have [1,2], the shifts are [1,2] and [2,1], where [2,1] is not sorted. So, for k=n, setting all elements to the same value works.

Wait, but the problem allows duplicates. So, if I set all elements to be equal, then all cyclic shifts will be sorted, since they are all non-decreasing.

So, for k=n, [1,1,1,...,1] is a valid array.

Now, what about k=1?

In the second example, for n=3, k=1, the array [69420,69,420] has only one sorted cyclic shift.

How does this work?

Let's see:

- [69420,69,420]: 69420 > 69, so not sorted.

- [69,420,69420]: 69 <= 420 <= 69420, so sorted.

- [420,69420,69]: 420 <= 69420 but 69420 > 69, so not sorted.

Hence, only one sorted shift.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me consider the array as a circular sequence. I need exactly k starting points where the sequence is non-decreasing all the way around.

Wait, in the circular sequence, if I have a non-decreasing sequence that wraps around, I need to ensure that only k specific starting points result in a sorted sequence.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the number of possible sorted cyclic shifts.

Suppose I have an array that is non-decreasing everywhere except for one drop.

For example, [1,2,3,4,1]. Here, from 4 to 1, there's a drop.

In this array, the cyclic shifts that are sorted are only those that don't include the drop in their sequence.

Wait, in this example:

- Shifts:

  - [1,2,3,4,1] (sorted until 4>1)

  - [2,3,4,1,1] (3>1)

  - [3,4,1,1,2] (4>1)

  - [4,1,1,2,3] (1<=1<=2<=3<=4, sorted)

  - [1,1,2,3,4] (sorted)

So, in this case, two shifts are sorted: the last two.

Wait, but according to the problem, for k=2, in n=3, it's impossible. So, maybe this approach doesn't generalize well.

Let me try to find a general condition for k.

Perhaps, for k=1, I need an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted, meaning that the array is not sorted in general, but there's exactly one way to arrange it circularly that makes it sorted.

Similarly, for k=2, maybe there's no such array for n=3, but there might be for other n.

Wait, in the example, for n=3, k=2, it's impossible, hence -1.

So, perhaps there are specific relationships between n and k that determine whether such an array exists.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal values of k.

- For k=0: no cyclic shifts are sorted. But since n >=1, and for n=1, the single shift is [a1], which is sorted. So, k=0 is impossible for n>=1.

- For k=1: need exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

- For k=n: all cyclic shifts are sorted, which is achievable by setting all elements equal.

- For k=n-1: need exactly n-1 sorted cyclic shifts. This seems tricky because if n-1 shifts are sorted, the remaining one might also be sorted depending on the array.

Wait, perhaps for k=n-1, it's impossible because if n-1 shifts are sorted, the last one likely is also sorted, making k=n.

Wait, but for n=2, k=1:

- If n=2, k=1: is it possible?

Let's see:

- Array [1,2]: shifts [1,2] (sorted) and [2,1] (not sorted). So, k=1.

- Array [2,1]: shifts [2,1] (not sorted) and [1,2] (sorted). Still k=1.

- Array [1,1]: k=2.

So, for n=2, k=1 is possible.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=3, k=2, it's impossible.

So, maybe for different n, different k are possible.

Let me think about how to construct an array for general k.

One approach is to fix k and try to arrange the array such that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical relationship between n and k that determines the possibility.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and k.

Suppose n and k have a GCD d. Maybe the number of sorted shifts relates to d.

Wait, for n=3, k=3, d=3.

n=3, k=1, d=1.

n=2, k=2, d=2.

n=2, k=1, d=1.

In the examples, for n=3, k=2, d=1, seems impossible.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, perhaps if k divides n, or something like that.

Wait, in the first example, n=2, k=2, d=2.

Second example, n=3, k=1, d=1.

Third example, n=3, k=2, d=1, but it's impossible.

So, GCD doesn't seem directly related.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the number of times the array cycles through its sorted shifts.

Wait, maybe it's related to the number of rotations that make the array sorted.

In sorted array, all rotations might not be sorted, depending on the array.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of local minima or something.

Wait, perhaps consider the array as a circular sequence and find the number of starting points where the sequence is non-decreasing.

For example, in a circular array, find the number of positions i where a_i <= a_{i+1} <= ... <= a_{i+n-1} (indices wrap around).

I need exactly k such positions.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider some small n and see what k values are possible.

For n=1:

- Only one shift: [a1], which is always sorted.

- So, k=1 is possible.

- No other k possible.

For n=2:

- Possible k values: 1, 2.

- As shown in the example, k=1 is possible with [1,2], which has one sorted shift [1,2] and one unsorted [2,1].

- k=2 is possible with [1,1], both shifts are [1,1].

- k=0 is impossible, as n=2 >=1, and at least one shift is sorted.

For n=3:

- Possible k values: 1, 3.

- From the example, k=1 is possible with [69420,69,420].

- k=3 would require all shifts to be sorted, which is possible by setting all elements equal.

- k=2 is impossible, as given in the example.

For n=4:

- Possible k values: 1, 2, 4.

- Wait, need to check.

- For k=1: perhaps [1,2,3,4], which has only one sorted shift [1,2,3,4], and others like [2,3,4,1], [3,4,1,2], [4,1,2,3], which are not sorted if 4 > 1.

- For k=2: not sure, need to see if it's possible.

- For k=4: all elements equal.

- Maybe for n=4, k=2 is possible.

Wait, need to think.

Wait, perhaps for n=4, k=2 is possible.

For example, array [1,2,3,1].

- Shifts:

  - [1,2,3,1]: 1<=2<=3>=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,3,1,1]: 2<=3>=1>=1 (not sorted)

  - [3,1,1,2]: 3>=1<=1<=2 (not sorted)

  - [1,1,2,3]: 1<=1<=2<=3 (sorted)

Wait, only one sorted shift here.

Not enough.

Another try: [1,2,2,1].

- Shifts:

  - [1,2,2,1]: 1<=2<=2>=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,2,1,1]: 2<=2<=1<=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,1,1,2]: 2>=1<=1<=2 (not sorted)

  - [1,1,2,2]: 1<=1<=2<=2 (sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Hmm.

Maybe k=2 is not possible for n=4.

Wait, but in n=2, k=1 is possible.

Wait, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible.

But in n=2, k=1 is possible.

In n=3, k=1 and k=3 are possible.

In n=4, maybe only k=1 and k=4 are possible.

Wait, but in n=2, k=2 is possible with all elements equal.

Wait, perhaps when k divides n.

Wait, in n=2, k=1 and k=2, where both divide n.

In n=3, k=1 and k=3, both divide n.

In n=4, k=1,2,4 divide n.

But in the problem, for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Wait, but 2 divides 4, but for n=4, maybe k=2 is possible.

Wait, I need to see.

Wait, perhaps it's when k divides n and n/k is the number of times the pattern repeats.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array that is sorted, then all its cyclic shifts are sorted only if the array is constant.

Wait, no. If the array is strictly increasing, then only one shift is sorted.

Wait, in a strictly increasing array, only one shift is sorted.

For example, [1,2,3,4]: only [1,2,3,4] is sorted.

Similarly, [1,2,3]: only [1,2,3] is sorted.

So, for strictly increasing arrays, k=1.

For constant arrays, k=n.

If there are duplicates, but not all equal, k could be between 1 and n.

Wait, in the example, for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

So, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible for any n.

But in n=2, k=1 and k=2 are possible.

In n=3, only k=1 and k=3 are possible.

Similarly, in n=4, perhaps only k=1 and k=4 are possible.

Wait, but in n=4, maybe k=2 is possible.

Let me try to construct an array for n=4, k=2.

Suppose [1,2,1,2].

- Shifts:

  - [1,2,1,2]: 1<=2>=1<=2 (not sorted)

  - [2,1,2,1]: 2>=1<=2>=1 (not sorted)

  - [1,2,1,2]: same as first, not sorted

  - [2,1,2,1]: same as second, not sorted

No sorted shifts here.

Another try: [1,1,2,2].

- Shifts:

  - [1,1,2,2]: sorted

  - [1,2,2,1]: 1<=2<=2>=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,2,1,1]: sorted

  - [2,1,1,2]: 2>=1<=1<=2 (not sorted)

So, two sorted shifts: [1,1,2,2] and [2,2,1,1].

Hence, k=2 is possible for n=4.

So, for n=4, k=2 is possible with [1,1,2,2].

Interesting.

So, perhaps for n divisible by k, it's possible.

In this case, n=4, k=2, 2 divides 4.

Similarly, n=3, k=1, 1 divides 3.

n=3, k=2, 2 does not divide 3, and it's impossible.

n=4, k=2, 2 divides 4, and it's possible.

n=2, k=1, 1 divides 2.

n=2, k=2, 2 divides 2.

So, maybe the condition is that k divides n.

Let me check for n=5, k=1: possible with [1,2,3,4,5], only one sorted shift.

n=5, k=5: [1,1,1,1,1], all sorted.

n=5, k=2: 2 does not divide 5, so should be impossible.

Similarly, n=6, k=3: 3 divides 6, should be possible.

For example, [1,1,2,2,3,3].

- Shifts:

  - [1,1,2,2,3,3]: sorted

  - [1,2,2,3,3,1]: 1<=2<=2<=3<=3>=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,2,3,3,1,1]: sorted

  - [2,3,3,1,1,2]: 2<=3<=3>=1<=2 (not sorted)

  - [3,3,1,1,2,2]: sorted

  - [3,1,1,2,2,3]: 3>=1<=1<=2<=2>=3 (not sorted)

So, three sorted shifts: k=3.

Hence, for n=6, k=3 is possible.

Similarly, n=6, k=2: 2 divides 6.

Let's try to construct an array for n=6, k=2.

Perhaps [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Wait, that gave k=3.

Another try: [1,1,2,2,2,2].

- Shifts:

  - [1,1,2,2,2,2]: sorted

  - [1,2,2,2,2,1]: 1<=2<=2<=2<=2>=1 (not sorted)

  - [2,2,2,2,1,1]: sorted

  - [2,2,2,1,1,2]: 2<=2<=2>=1<=1>=2 (not sorted)

  - [2,2,1,1,2,2]: 2<=2>=1<=1>=2<=2 (not sorted)

  - [2,1,1,2,2,2]: 2>=1<=1<=2<=2>=2 (not sorted)

So, two sorted shifts: [1,1,2,2,2,2] and [2,2,2,2,1,1].

Hence, k=2 is possible for n=6.

So, it seems that when k divides n, it's possible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

And when k does not divide n, it's impossible.

Wait, but in n=3, k=1: 1 divides 3, and it's possible.

n=3, k=2: 2 does not divide 3, and it's impossible.

n=4, k=2: 2 divides 4, and it's possible.

n=6, k=3: 3 divides 6, possible.

n=6, k=2: 2 divides 6, possible.

n=5, k=2: 2 does not divide 5, impossible.

So, perhaps the condition is that k divides n.

Is this always true?

Wait, for n=4, k=2: 2 divides 4, possible.

n=4, k=1: 1 divides 4, possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for n=4, k=1 is possible, which divides n.

Wait, but in n=3, k=1 is possible, which divides n.

Wait, but in n=4, k=1 is possible, but according to the pattern, maybe it's more specific.

Wait, perhaps only when k divides n and n/k is even or something.

Wait, n=4, k=2: n/k=2, which is even.

n=6, k=3: n/k=2, even.

n=6, k=2: n/k=3, which is odd.

Wait, but in n=6, k=2, n/k=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

Wait, maybe it's always possible when k divides n.

Wait, but in n=5, k=1: 1 divides 5, possible.

n=5, k=5: 5 divides 5, possible.

n=5, k=2: 2 does not divide 5, impossible.

So, perhaps the general condition is that k divides n.

But in n=4, k=2: 2 divides 4, possible.

n=4, k=1: 1 divides 4, possible.

Wait, but in n=3, k=1: 1 divides 3, possible.

n=3, k=2: 2 does not divide 3, impossible.

n=4, k=1: possible.

Wait, perhaps for k=1, it's always possible, regardless of whether k divides n.

Wait, but k=1 divides n for n>=1.

Wait, maybe it's that k divides n, and k>=1.

Wait, but for k=1, it's always possible.

For k=n, it's always possible.

For other k, it's possible only if k divides n.

Wait, but in n=4, k=2: possible.

n=6, k=2: possible.

n=6, k=3: possible.

n=5, k=2: impossible.

So, seems consistent with k dividing n.

Now, how to construct such an array when k divides n.

Let me think.

If k divides n, then n/k is an integer, say m.

So, m = n/k.

We can divide the array into k equal parts, each of size m.

Then, arrange the parts in such a way that only k specific shifts are sorted.

Wait, perhaps assign each block of m elements a certain value, decreasing or increasing appropriately.

Wait, perhaps assign the same value to each block, but with different values between blocks.

Wait, for example, in n=4, k=2, m=2.

Set [1,1,2,2].

Then, shifts:

- [1,1,2,2]: sorted

- [1,2,2,1]: not sorted

- [2,2,1,1]: sorted

- [2,1,1,2]: not sorted

So, exactly k=2 sorted shifts.

Similarly, in n=6, k=3, m=2.

Set [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3]: sorted

- [1,2,2,3,3,1]: not sorted

- [2,2,3,3,1,1]: sorted

- [2,3,3,1,1,2]: not sorted

- [3,3,1,1,2,2]: sorted

- [3,1,1,2,2,3]: not sorted

Hence, exactly k=3 sorted shifts.

Similarly, for n=6, k=2, m=3.

Set [1,1,1,2,2,2].

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2]: sorted

- [1,1,2,2,2,1]: not sorted

- [1,2,2,2,1,1]: not sorted

- [2,2,2,1,1,1]: sorted

- [2,2,1,1,1,2]: not sorted

- [2,1,1,1,2,2]: not sorted

So, exactly k=2 sorted shifts.

Wait, but according to earlier, for n=6, k=2, m=3.

So, it works.

Similarly, for n=4, k=1, m=4.

Set [1,2,3,4].

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4]: sorted

- [2,3,4,1]: not sorted

- [3,4,1,2]: not sorted

- [4,1,2,3]: not sorted

Hence, k=1.

So, it seems that setting the array to have m equal elements and then increasing for the next block works.

Wait, in n=4, k=1, m=4, set [1,2,3,4], which is strictly increasing, and only one sorted shift.

Similarly, in n=3, k=1, m=3, set [1,2,3], only one sorted shift.

In n=2, k=1, m=2, set [1,2], only one sorted shift.

In n=2, k=2, m=1, set [1,1], both shifts sorted.

In n=4, k=2, m=2, set [1,1,2,2], two sorted shifts.

In n=6
