Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find an array of length n such that exactly k of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{x-1}. So, essentially, it's like rotating the array x-1 times to the left.

For example, if n=4 and k=2, and the array is [1,2,3,3], the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1,2,3,3] (sorted)

- x=2: [2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- x=3: [3,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- x=4: [3,1,2,3] (not sorted)

So, only one cyclic shift is sorted, which doesn't match k=2 in this case.

I need to find an array where exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

Let's think about some basic cases.

Case 1: k = n

If k = n, that means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. For all cyclic shifts to be sorted, the array must be constant, i.e., all elements are equal. Because if any element is smaller than the previous one in a cyclic shift, it would break the sorted order.

For example, array [1,1,1,1] has all cyclic shifts sorted because each shift is still [1,1,1,1], which is sorted.

So, for k = n, setting all elements to the same value should work.

Case 2: k = 1

If k = 1, only one cyclic shift is sorted. I need to find an array where only one of its cyclic shifts is sorted, and the rest are not.

Looking at the example in the problem, for n=3 and k=1, the array [69420, 69, 420] has only one sorted cyclic shift: [69,420,69420].

I need to see if I can generalize this.

Perhaps, for k=1, I can set the array in such a way that only the original array is sorted, and all other shifts are not sorted.

Wait, but in the example, it's not the original array that's sorted; it's the second shift.

So, maybe I need to set the array so that only one specific shift is sorted.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array that is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,...,n]. Then, all its cyclic shifts would not be sorted except for the original one. So, k=1.

Wait, but in this case, shifting it by one would give [2,3,...,n,1], which is not sorted. Shifting by two would give [3,...,n,1,2], still not sorted, and so on. So, only the original array is sorted.

But in the problem's example, k=1, and the array provided has one specific shift that is sorted, which is not necessarily the original array.

So, perhaps I can set the array such that only one particular shift is sorted.

Alternatively, maybe for k=1, I can set the array to be strictly increasing, which would have only one sorted cyclic shift.

But in the example, it's not strictly increasing, but still only one shift is sorted.

I need to find a general way to construct such arrays for k=1.

Case 3: k=0

If k=0, that means no cyclic shift is sorted. So, I need an array where none of its cyclic shifts are sorted.

For example, for n=3, an array like [2,1,3] has shifts:

- [2,1,3] (not sorted)

- [1,3,2] (not sorted)

- [3,2,1] (sorted)

Wait, no, [3,2,1] is sorted in descending order, but the problem asks for non-decreasing order. So, [3,2,1] is not sorted.

Wait, the problem says "sorted", which typically means non-decreasing.

So, [3,2,1] is not sorted.

Hence, in this case, no cyclic shift is sorted, which would correspond to k=0.

But according to the problem, k is at least 1, since 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

Wait, no, looking back, it says 1 ≤ k ≤ n, so k=0 is not possible as per the constraints.

Hence, I don't need to worry about k=0.

Case 4: k >1

For k >1, I need arrays where more than one cyclic shift is sorted.

I need to find a way to construct such arrays.

Looking at the example where n=2 and k=2, the array [1,1] has both cyclic shifts sorted.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=2, does such an array exist?

Wait, the problem says for n=3 and k=2, output -1, meaning no such array exists.

So, in some cases, it's impossible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

I need to find a way to determine when it's possible and construct such an array when it is possible.

Let me try to find a general approach.

First, for k = n, as I thought earlier, setting all elements equal should work.

For k = 1, setting the array to be strictly increasing should work, as only the original array is sorted, and all other shifts are not sorted.

Wait, but in the problem's example for n=3 and k=1, the array is [69420,69,420], which is not strictly increasing, but still only one shift is sorted.

So, maybe there are multiple ways to achieve k=1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula to construct such arrays for any k.

Let me think about the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

Suppose I have an array a1, a2, ..., an.

A cyclic shift x is sorted if a_x <= a_{x+1} <= ... <= a_n <= a1 <= ... <= a_{x-1}.

In other words, the array must be non-decreasing in the shifted order.

I need exactly k such x's.

I need to find an array where exactly k values of x satisfy this condition.

I wonder if there's a relationship between the number of sorted cyclic shifts and some property of the array.

Perhaps considering the array as a circular list, and looking for points where the array "resets" or something.

Alternatively, maybe considering the number of local minima or something similar.

Wait, perhaps thinking in terms of the number of times the array wraps around.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the array as a circular list and look for the number of starting points where the list is non-decreasing.

I need exactly k such starting points.

Let me consider that in a sorted array, any starting point would make it sorted, so k=n.

If the array has a single "increase", like [1,2,1,1,...,1], then only certain shifts would be sorted.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the differences between consecutive elements in the circular array.

Let me define d_i = a_{i+1} - a_i for i=1 to n-1, and d_n = a1 - a_n.

If all d_i >=0, then the array is sorted in its original cyclic shift.

For other shifts, similar conditions apply.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as sorted for a particular shift if the differences in the shifted order are all non-negative.

This seems a bit messy.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix an array and compute for each x from 1 to n whether the x-th cyclic shift is sorted.

I need exactly k of these to be true.

I need to find an array where exactly k shifts satisfy the sorted condition.

I need a way to count, for a given array, how many cyclic shifts are sorted.

Is there a pattern or a formula that can help me determine this count directly, without checking each shift individually?

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for arrays where the elements are in a specific order to achieve exactly k sorted shifts.

Let me consider small values of n and see what arrays satisfy for different k.

For n=2:

Possible k: 1 or 2.

- k=2: [1,1], [2,2], etc., all elements equal.

- k=1: [1,2], [2,1], but [1,2] has two sorted shifts: [1,2] and [2,1] (if 2>=1), but in this case, [2,1] is not sorted, so only one shift is sorted.

Wait, no, [1,2] has shifts [1,2] (sorted) and [2,1] (not sorted), so k=1.

Similarly, [2,1] has shifts [2,1] (not sorted) and [1,2] (sorted), so k=1.

So, for n=2 and k=1, arrays like [1,2] or [2,1] work.

For n=3 and k=1:

The example given is [69420,69,420], with only one sorted shift.

So, seems possible.

For n=3 and k=2:

The problem says -1, meaning no such array exists.

So, for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

I need to find a general rule for when such an array exists.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me consider that for k=1, it's possible for n=2 and n=3.

For k=2 and n=2, it's possible ([1,1]).

For k=2 and n=3, it's impossible.

Is there a general formula for possible k given n?

Let me consider that in a circular array, the number of sorted shifts corresponds to the number of starting points where the array is non-decreasing in the circular sense.

I need to find an array where exactly k starting points satisfy this condition.

I need to find a way to construct such arrays or determine when it's impossible.

Perhaps I can look for arrays where the elements are in a specific order to maximize or minimize the number of sorted shifts.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical relationship between n and k that determines possibility.

Let me consider that if the array is strictly increasing, only one shift is sorted (the original array).

If the array is constant, all shifts are sorted (k=n).

If the array has a single "wrap-around", like [1,2,1], then only one shift is sorted.

Wait, for [1,2,1], shifts are:

- [1,2,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [1,1,2] (sorted)

Wait, so two shifts are sorted: [1,2,1] and [1,1,2].

But according to the problem, for n=3 and k=2, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe this array doesn't count because [1,1,2] is sorted, but [2,1,1] is not.

So, k=2.

But according to the problem, for n=3 and k=2, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem's example, for n=3 and k=1, they provided [69420,69,420], with only one sorted shift.

For n=3 and k=2, they say -1.

But in my example, [1,2,1] has two sorted shifts: [1,2,1] and [1,1,2].

So, perhaps for some arrays, k=2 is possible for n=3.

But according to the problem, for n=3 and k=2, output is -1.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Let me check again.

Array [1,2,1]:

- Shift 1: [1,2,1] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,1,2] (sorted)

So, k=2.

But the problem says for n=3 and k=2, output is -1.

So, perhaps my array [1,2,1] is invalid for some reason.

Wait, maybe the problem considers arrays with duplicates differently.

Wait, in my array [1,2,1], all elements are >=1, which is fine.

Wait, perhaps the problem has additional constraints that make some k impossible for certain n.

Alternatively, perhaps my understanding is incorrect, and for n=3, k=2 is indeed impossible.

Looking back at the problem's example, for n=3 and k=2, output is -1.

So, despite my earlier array [1,2,1] seeming to have k=2, the problem says it's impossible.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem counts the number of distinct sorted shifts differently.

Wait, perhaps in the problem's context, for n=3 and k=2, no array satisfies the condition.

So, perhaps my earlier array [1,2,1] is invalid for some reason.

Alternatively, maybe I need to ensure that the array elements are distinct, but the problem allows duplicates.

Wait, the problem says 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, so duplicates are allowed.

So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where exactly k starting points have the property that the array is non-decreasing in the cyclic shift starting from that point.

I need to construct such an array.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the array having a certain number of "increasing" segments.

Alternatively, maybe there's a group theory or number theory aspect here related to cyclic shifts.

Wait, perhaps considering the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and k.

Wait, for example, for n=2 and k=2, GCD(2,2)=2.

For n=3 and k=1, GCD(3,1)=1.

For n=3 and k=2, GCD(3,2)=1.

But in this case, for GCD(n,k)=1, it doesn't necessarily correspond to the possibility of having exactly k sorted shifts.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of cyclic groups and how shifts cycle through the array.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the number of sorted shifts divides n in some way.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of rotations that make the array sorted, which might have something to do with the number of times the array wraps around.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I fix k and n, and I want to find an array where exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

I can try to construct such an array by ensuring that only k specific shifts satisfy the sorted condition.

One way to do this is to set the array such that it's sorted for exactly k shifts and not sorted for the remaining n-k shifts.

This might involve carefully choosing the values so that only specific shifts result in a non-decreasing sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between k and n where such an array can only exist if k divides n or something similar.

Wait, perhaps considering that the number of sorted shifts must divide n.

For example, for n=2 and k=2, 2 divides 2.

For n=3 and k=1, 1 divides 3.

For n=3 and k=2, 2 does not divide 3, and according to the problem, it's impossible.

So, maybe in general, such an array exists only if k divides n.

Is that the case?

Let me check for n=4 and k=2.

Does k=2 divide n=4? Yes.

So, is there an array for n=4 and k=2?

Let's try [1,2,2,1].

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

Wait, this gives three sorted shifts, which is more than k=2.

So, not suitable.

Another attempt: [1,2,3,2].

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,2] (not sorted)

- [2,3,2,1] (not sorted)

- [3,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,3] (not sorted)

No sorted shifts, which is not k=2.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2].

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

So, two sorted shifts: [1,1,2,2] and [2,2,1,1].

This matches k=2.

So, for n=4 and k=2, such an array exists.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=4, set all elements equal: [1,1,1,1], which has all shifts sorted.

For n=4 and k=1, can I find an array with only one sorted shift?

Let's try [1,2,3,4].

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, so k=1.

So, for n=4, k=1,2,4 are possible.

k=3 is not possible, because if k=3, then n-k=1, meaning only one shift is not sorted.

But if three shifts are sorted, the fourth must also be sorted, because in a circular array, if three shifts are sorted, the fourth one must also be sorted.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose three shifts are sorted.

Then, considering that sorted shifts correspond to certain starting points, perhaps the fourth one must also be sorted.

I need to verify this.

Suppose we have an array where three cyclic shifts are sorted.

Let's denote the array as a1, a2, a3, a4.

Suppose shifts x=1, x=2, x=3 are sorted.

Then:

- [a1, a2, a3, a4] is sorted

- [a2, a3, a4, a1] is sorted

- [a3, a4, a1, a2] is sorted

From [a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4 <= a1], which implies a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4 <= a1.

From a4 <= a1 and a1 <= a4, so a1 = a4.

Similarly, from [a2 <= a3 <= a4 <= a1 <= a2], but since a1 = a4, a2 <= a3 <= a4 = a1 <= a2, so a2 <= a3 <= a1 = a4 <= a2, which implies a2 = a3 = a1 = a4.

So, all elements must be equal, meaning k=4.

Hence, for n=4, k=3 is impossible.

So, only k=1,2,4 are possible.

This aligns with the idea that k must be a divisor of n.

In this case, divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.

Similarly, for n=3, divisors are 1,3, which matches the problem's example where k=2 is impossible.

For n=2, divisors are 1,2, which matches the problem's examples.

Hence, perhaps such an array exists only when k divides n.

Is this always the case?

Let's check for n=6.

Possible k: 1,2,3,6.

Let's try k=3.

n=6, k=3.

Need an array with exactly 3 sorted cyclic shifts.

Let's try [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,3,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

So, three sorted shifts: [1,1,2,2,3,3], [2,2,3,3,1,1], [3,3,1,1,2,2].

This matches k=3.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=2, which is not a divisor of n, is it possible?

Let's try [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4,5,6] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,5,6,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,5,6,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,5,6,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- [5,6,1,2,3,4] (not sorted)

- [6,1,2,3,4,5] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which is k=1.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Earlier, this gave k=3.

Let's try [1,2,1,2,3,3].

Shifts:

- [1,2,1,2,3,3] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,3,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,2,1,2,3] (not sorted)

No sorted shifts, which is k=0, not k=2.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,3,4,4].

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,3,4,4] (sorted)

- [1,2,3,4,4,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,4,4,1,1] (sorted)

- [3,4,4,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,4,1,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- [4,1,1,2,3,4] (not sorted)

So, two sorted shifts: [1,1,2,3,4,4] and [2,3,4,4,1,1].

This matches k=2.

So, for n=6 and k=2, which is not a divisor of n, an array exists with exactly k=2 sorted shifts.

Wait, but according to my earlier hypothesis, k must divide n for such an array to exist, but in this case, k=2 divides n=6.

Wait, 2 does divide 6, since 6/2=3.

So, k=2 is a divisor of n=6.

Wait, but in the earlier n=3 and k=2, which doesn't
