Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a game where I'm at point 0 on a straight line, and there are n monsters each with some health a_i and positions x_i. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 per bullet. After that, any monster with health <=0 dies, and the remaining monsters move one step closer to me. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose. The question is whether I can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, targeting any monster any number of times, as long as the total doesn't exceed k.

2. Monsters with health <=0 die.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

4. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

My goal is to ensure that all monsters are eliminated before any of them reaches point 0.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to allocate my bullets each second to maximize the reduction of monsters' health, considering their positions and movement.

Let me think about how the monsters move. Each second, they move one step closer. So, a monster at position x_i will take |x_i| seconds to reach me if I don't shoot it at all. But I can shoot it to reduce its health.

Wait, but I can shoot multiple bullets at a monster in one second. So, if a monster has health a_i, I need to shoot it a_i times to eliminate it.

But I have a limit of k bullets per second. So, I need to distribute these k bullets among the monsters in a way that allows me to eliminate all of them before they reach me.

I need to consider the time each monster would take to reach me if I don't shoot it, and prioritize shooting the ones that are closer first, because they have less time before they reach me.

But it's not that simple, because some monsters may have higher health and be farther away. I need to find a balance.

Maybe I should sort the monsters based on their distance from me, and then see how many bullets I need to allocate to each over time.

Let me consider sorting the monsters by their distance from me, i.e., by |x_i|, in ascending order.

So, the monsters closest to me should be handled first, because they pose the earliest threat.

Then, for each monster, I need to ensure that I allocate enough bullets to it before it reaches me.

Given that monsters move closer by 1 each second, a monster at distance d will take d seconds to reach me.

Therefore, for a monster at distance d with health h, I need to allocate h bullets to it before d seconds pass.

But since I can shoot up to k bullets per second, I need to make sure that over d seconds, I allocate at least h bullets to this monster.

Wait, but in d seconds, I can allocate up to k*d bullets in total, but I need to make sure that at least h of those bullets are allocated to this monster.

But there are other monsters as well, so I need to consider the total bullets allocated to all monsters.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think of it in terms of the total bullets needed per second.

Let me think differently. Suppose I simulate the game second by second.

Each second:

- I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters.

- Monsters with health <=0 die.

- Remaining monsters move one step closer.

- If any monster is at position 0, I lose.

But simulating second by second would be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^4.

I need a smarter way to determine if it's possible to eliminate all monsters without any reaching me.

Let me consider the constraints.

Each monster has a time limit: the time it takes to reach me, which is |x_i| seconds.

In those |x_i| seconds, I need to allocate at least a_i bullets to the monster to eliminate it.

But I have to do this for all monsters, while respecting the k bullets per second limit.

This sounds like a scheduling problem, where I need to schedule bullet allocations to monsters within their time constraints.

I recall that in scheduling problems, we often sort jobs by their deadlines and try to meet them.

Similarly, here, I can think of each monster as a job with a deadline of |x_i| seconds and a requirement of a_i bullets.

I need to schedule the bullet allocations such that the total bullets allocated to each monster reach at least a_i before their deadline.

To optimize this, I should prioritize monsters with earlier deadlines, i.e., those closer to me.

So, I can sort the monsters based on their distance from me in ascending order.

Then, I can iterate through them in order of increasing distance, and for each monster, ensure that I have allocated enough bullets to it before its deadline.

Wait, but I need to consider that while shooting bullets at one monster, I might also be shooting at others in the same second.

This seems complex. Maybe I can think in terms of the total bullets needed up to each deadline.

Let me try this approach:

- Sort the monsters based on their distance from me in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable to keep track of the total bullets used so far.

- For each monster in this order:

- Calculate the time until it reaches me (|x_i|).

- Calculate the total bullets needed up to this time: the sum of a_j for all monsters with distance <= |x_i|.

- Calculate the maximum possible bullets I can allocate up to this time: k * time.

- If the total bullets needed exceeds the maximum possible bullets up to that time, it's impossible.

- Otherwise, update the total bullets used.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize it:

1. Sort the monsters based on |x_i| in ascending order.

2. Initialize total_bullets_used = 0.

3. For each monster in this sorted order:

a. time = |x_i|

b. total_health_up_to_this_time = sum of a_j for all monsters with |x_j| <= time

c. max_bullets_available = k * time

d. If total_health_up_to_this_time > max_bullets_available, then it's impossible.

e. Else, set total_bullets_used = total_health_up_to_this_time

4. If all monsters satisfy this condition, then it's possible.

This seems correct because for each monster, by the time it reaches me, I should have allocated at least its required health in bullets.

And since I'm considering the cumulative health required up to each time step, and comparing it with the maximum bullets I can allocate up to that time, it should work.

Let me check this with the first example:

Example 1:

3 2

1 2 3

-1 2 3

So, n=3, k=2

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=-1, |x|=1

Monster 2: a=2, x=2, |x|=2

Monster 3: a=3, x=3, |x|=3

Sort by |x_i|: Monster 1 (1), Monster 2 (2), Monster 3 (3)

Iterate through them:

Monster 1:

time=1

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 (only Monster 1)

max_bullets_available = 2*1 = 2

1 <= 2, so okay.

total_bullets_used = 1

Monster 2:

time=2

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 = 3

max_bullets_available = 2*2 = 4

3 <= 4, okay.

total_bullets_used = 3

Monster 3:

time=3

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

max_bullets_available = 2*3 = 6

6 <= 6, okay.

total_bullets_used = 6

All conditions satisfied, so it's possible. The answer is YES, which matches the example.

Example 2:

-1 1

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=-1, |x|=1

Monster 2: a=1, x=1, |x|=1

Sort by |x_i|: Monster 1 (1), Monster 2 (1)

Iterate through them:

Monster 1:

time=1

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 1 = 2

max_bullets_available = 1*1 = 1

2 > 1, impossible.

So, answer is NO, which matches the example.

Example 3:

4 10

3 4 2 5

-3 -2 1 3

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=3, x=-3, |x|=3

Sort by |x_i|: Monster 3 (1), Monster 2 (2), Monster 1 (3), Monster 4 (3)

Iterate through them:

Monster 3:

time=1

total_health_up_to_this_time = 2

max_bullets_available = 10*1 = 10

2 <= 10, okay.

total_bullets_used = 2

Monster 2:

time=2

total_health_up_to_this_time = 2 + 4 = 6

max_bullets_available = 10*2 = 20

6 <= 20, okay.

total_bullets_used = 6

Monster 1:

time=3

total_health_up_to_this_time = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9

max_bullets_available = 10*3 = 30

9 <= 30, okay.

total_bullets_used = 9

Monster 4:

time=3

total_health_up_to_this_time = 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 14

max_bullets_available = 10*3 = 30

14 <= 30, okay.

total_bullets_used = 14

All conditions satisfied, so YES, matches the example.

Example 4:

5 3

2 1 3 2 5

-3 -2 3 4 5

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=2, x=-3, |x|=3

Monster 2: a=1, x=-2, |x|=2

Monster 3: a=3, x=3, |x|=3

Monster 4: a=2, x=4, |x|=4

Monster 5: a=5, x=5, |x|=5

Sort by |x_i|: Monster 2 (2), Monster 1 (3), Monster 3 (3), Monster 4 (4), Monster 5 (5)

Iterate through them:

Monster 2:

time=2

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1

max_bullets_available = 3*2 = 6

1 <= 6, okay.

total_bullets_used = 1

Monster 1:

time=3

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 = 3

max_bullets_available = 3*3 = 9

3 <= 9, okay.

total_bullets_used = 3

Monster 3:

time=3

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

max_bullets_available = 3*3 = 9

6 <= 9, okay.

total_bullets_used = 6

Monster 4:

time=4

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8

max_bullets_available = 3*4 = 12

8 <= 12, okay.

total_bullets_used = 8

Monster 5:

time=5

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 13

max_bullets_available = 3*5 = 15

13 <= 15, okay.

total_bullets_used = 13

All conditions satisfied, so YES, matches the example.

Example 5:

2 1

1 2

1 2

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=1, |x|=1

Monster 2: a=2, x=2, |x|=2

Sort by |x_i|: Monster 1 (1), Monster 2 (2)

Iterate through them:

Monster 1:

time=1

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1

max_bullets_available = 1*1 = 1

1 <= 1, okay.

total_bullets_used = 1

Monster 2:

time=2

total_health_up_to_this_time = 1 + 2 = 3

max_bullets_available = 1*2 = 2

3 > 2, impossible.

So, answer is NO, matches the example.

Great, this approach seems to work for all the examples.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 3*10^4

- n <= 3*10^5 per test case

- sum of n over all t <= 3*10^5

- a_i <= 10^9

- x_i are distinct, -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0

Time limit is probably tight, so I need an O(n log n) solution.

Let's think about the implementation.

First, for each test case:

- Read n and k

- Read array a of size n

- Read array x of size n

- Pair each a_i with its |x_i|, sort the pairs based on |x_i| ascending

- Initialize total_bullets_used = 0

- Iterate through the sorted pairs:

- For each monster, calculate time = |x_i|

- Accumulate total_health_up_to_this_time += a_i

- Calculate max_bullets_available = k * time

- If total_health_up_to_this_time > max_bullets_available, print NO

- Else, continue

- If all monsters satisfy the condition, print YES

This seems straightforward.

Edge cases to consider:

- All monsters are at the same distance: need to ensure that the cumulative health doesn't exceed the available bullets up to that time.

- One monster very close with high health: need to ensure that k * time >= health

- k is very large: in this case, I can allocate a lot of bullets, probably can handle any health

- k is 1, monsters have health >1: need to see if the time allows for allocating enough bullets

- Negative and positive positions: since we take |x_i|, direction doesn't matter

- x_i are unique, so no two monsters at the same position

Let me think about the implementation details.

I need to sort the monsters based on |x_i|. Since x_i are distinct, no need to worry about ties.

I can zip a and x, take absolute values of x, sort the pairs by |x| ascending.

Then, iterate through the sorted list, keep a running sum of a_i, and check against k * time at each step.

Since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^4, but sum of n over all t is <= 3*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

Implementing this in Python, I need to read input efficiently.

I can read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them accordingly.

Let me sketch a rough plan for the code:

- Read all input at once using sys.stdin.read()

- Split the input into tokens

- Use an index to track the current position in the token list

- For each test case:

- Read t

- For each of the t test cases:

- Read n and k

- Read the next n tokens as a list of integers for a

- Read the next n tokens as a list of integers for x

- Compute |x_i| for each x_i

- Zip a and |x|, sort by |x| ascending

- Initialize total_bullets_used = 0

- Iterate through the sorted pairs:

- For each (a_i, |x_i|):

- total_bullets_used += a_i

- if total_bullets_used > k * |x_i|:

- print 'NO'

- break

- Else, after all monsters are checked, print 'YES'

I need to make sure that the sorting is stable if there are ties, but since x_i are unique, it's not an issue.

Also, need to handle large inputs efficiently, so using built-in sort and list operations should be fine.

Let me think about possible optimizations.

Since sum of n over all t is 3*10^5, and sorting is n log n, it should be acceptable.

No need for further optimizations.

Now, let's think about the given code and see if it matches this logic.

Looking at the given code:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_1()

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = list(map(int, input().split()))

monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))

bullets_used = 0

can_survive = True

for (pos, health) in monsters:

distance = abs(pos)

total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health

if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:

can_survive = False

break

bullets_used += health

print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')

This seems to match the logic I derived.

It reads t, then for each test case, reads n and k, then arrays a and x.

It zips x and a, sorts them based on abs(x) ascending.

Then, initializes bullets_used = 0 and can_survive = True.

Then, iterates through the sorted monsters:

For each monster, gets pos and health.

Calculates distance = abs(pos)

Calculates total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health

Checks if total_bullets_needed > distance * k, if so, sets can_survive = False and breaks.

Else, adds health to bullets_used.

Finally, prints 'YES' if can_survive else 'NO'

This seems correct.

Wait, but in my earlier logic, I have total_bullets_up_to_this_time = sum of a_j for all monsters with |x_j| <= |x_i|

But in this code, total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health

Wait, is this equivalent?

Let's see.

bullets_used starts at 0.

For each monster, in order of increasing |x_i|, it adds health to bullets_used.

So, total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health

Wait, bullets_used is the sum of health of all previous monsters.

So, total_bullets_needed = sum of health of previous monsters + current monster's health.

But in my earlier logic, total_health_up_to_this_time is sum of a_j for all monsters with |x_j| <= |x_i|

Which is the same as sum of health of all monsters up to and including the current one.

So, yes, it's the same.

Hence, the condition total_bullets_needed > distance * k is equivalent to total_health_up_to_this_time > k * time.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches our character in a game. The game mechanics involve shooting bullets at monsters to reduce their health and monsters moving closer to our character each second.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are positioned at point 0 on a straight line.
   - There are `n` monsters, each with health `a_i` and initial positions `x_i`.
   - Each second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets at any monsters.
   - After shooting, monsters with health <= 0 die.
   - Remaining monsters move one step closer to us.
   - If any monster reaches point 0, we lose.

2. **Strategy:**
   - We need to ensure that we allocate enough bullets to each monster before they reach us.
   - Monsters closer to us pose an earlier threat, so we should handle them first.
   - For each monster, calculate the time it takes to reach us (`|x_i|` seconds).
   - Ensure that the cumulative bullets allocated to all monsters up to that time does not exceed the available bullets (`k * time`).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Sort the monsters based on their distance from us (`|x_i|`) in ascending order.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of monsters and maintain a running total of the bullets needed.
   - For each monster, check if the total bullets needed up to that time is less than or equal to the bullets available (`k * time`).
   - If at any point the needed bullets exceed the available bullets, it is impossible to survive.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        x = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum bullets per second).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Read the health array `a` and position array `x`.
   - Zip `x` and `a`, and sort the pairs based on `|x_i|` in ascending order.
   - Initialize `bullets_used` to 0 and set `can_survive` to True.
   - Iterate through the sorted monsters:
     - Calculate the distance (`|x_i|`).
     - Calculate the total bullets needed up to this monster.
     - If the total bullets needed exceed the available bullets (`k * distance`), set `can_survive` to False and break.
     - Otherwise, add the health of the current monster to `bullets_used`.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Print 'YES' if all monsters can be eliminated before reaching us, otherwise 'NO'.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of surviving all monster attacks with the given constraints.
