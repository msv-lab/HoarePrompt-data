Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take 1x1 cells and others take 2x2 cells (which would be 4 cells). The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 15 cells. A 1x1 icon takes one cell, and a 2x2 icon takes four cells. Importantly, each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and the icons can't overlap.

So, for each test case, I'm given the number of 1x1 icons (x) and the number of 2x2 icons (y), and I need to figure out the least number of screens required to fit all these icons without exceeding the screen's cell capacity.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to first account for the larger icons, the 2x2 ones, since they take up more space. So, I should try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens first, and then see where the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining spaces.

Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so theoretically, each screen can hold up to 3 such icons because 3*4=12, and 12 is less than or equal to 15. However, I need to consider how these icons are placed on the grid. Since the screen is 5x3, let's visualize it:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, the positions are A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, and so on up to C5.

A 2x2 icon would occupy, for example, A1, B1, A2, B2. Similarly, positions could be C1, C2, C3, C4, etc., but I need to make sure that the 2x2 icons don't overlap and that they fit within the grid's boundaries.

Wait, but the problem says that each screen is a 5x3 grid, but it doesn't specify the orientation. Does it matter whether the rows are horizontal or vertical? In standard grids, rows are horizontal, so row 1 would be A1, B1, C1, and so on.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I don't need to worry about the exact placement, just the total cell usage.

Let's consider that each screen has 15 cells, and the total space required is x*1 + y*4 cells. So, total space needed is x + 4y cells.

Now, the minimum number of screens would be the ceiling of (x + 4y)/15. But wait, it's not that simple because of the way 2x2 icons must be placed. They have to be in positions where their 2x2 block fits without overlapping screen boundaries.

Moreover, there might be constraints on how the 1x1 icons can be placed around the 2x2 icons to maximize space usage.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

1 1

Output: 1

So, x=1, y=1. Total cells needed: 1 + 4*1 = 5 cells. Since each screen has 15 cells, one screen should be more than enough. And indeed, the output is 1.

Another test case:

7 2

Output: 1

Total cells needed: 7*1 + 2*4 = 7 + 8 = 15 cells. Exactly one screen.

Another one:

12 4

Output: 2

Total cells needed: 12 + 16 = 28 cells. Since one screen has 15 cells, two screens have 30 cells, which can fit 28 cells.

Wait, but is it possible to arrange 12 1x1 and 4 2x2 icons on two screens? Let's see.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and they can't overlap. In a 5x3 grid, the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 3, as 3*4=12, and 12 < 15.

But in the third test case, y=4, which would require at least two screens because 3 icons per screen, so 2 screens can hold 6 icons, but y=4 is less than that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, y=4 means 4 2x2 icons, each taking 4 cells, so total 16 cells. Plus x=12, which is 12 cells. So total 28 cells.

Each screen has 15 cells, so mathematically, 2 screens have 30 cells, which can accommodate 28 cells.

But perhaps there's a constraint on how the icons are placed. Maybe not all combinations are possible due to the grid layout.

Let me think differently. Maybe the approach is to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, and then see where the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.

Each 2x2 icon occupies a 2x2 block. In a 5x3 grid, you can fit at most 3 2x2 icons without overlapping:

- Top-left: A1, B1, A2, B2

- Top-middle: C1, C2, C3, C4

- Bottom-right: B4, C4, B5, C5

Wait, but in a 5x3 grid, can we really fit 3 non-overlapping 2x2 icons? Let's map it out.

Screen layout:

A1 B1 C1

A2 B2 C2

A3 B3 C3

A4 B4 C4

A5 B5 C5

So, placing a 2x2 icon in the top-left: A1, B1, A2, B2

Another in the top-middle: C1, C2, C3, C4

And another in the bottom-right: B4, C4, B5, C5

Wait, but C4 is being used by both the top-middle and bottom-right 2x2 icons, which would cause overlap. So, they can't be placed like that.

Alternatively, perhaps only 2 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

For example:

- Top-left: A1, B1, A2, B2

- Bottom-right: B4, C4, B5, C5

That way, no overlap.

Similarly, in another arrangement, maybe:

- Top-middle: C1, C2, C3, C4

- Bottom-left: A4, A5, B4, B5

But then, A4 and B4 are used by both icons, causing overlap.

So, perhaps only 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons per screen are possible.

Therefore, per screen, maximum 2 2x2 icons can be placed.

Given that, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens required just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, for the 1x1 icons, each screen has remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so 2 2x2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons per screen.

If y is even, then exact number of screens for y is y/2, and remaining cells per screen are 7.

If y is odd, then number of screens for y is y//2 + 1, and in that screen, 4 cells are used by one 2x2 icon, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, total screens needed would be the screens required for y, plus any additional screens needed for the remaining x 1x1 icons that couldn't fit in the screens used for y.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2)

- Then, calculate the remaining cells available in those screens after placing the 2x2 icons.

- If y is even, each of these screens has 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

- If y is odd, one screen has 11 cells left (since it has only one 2x2 icon), and the others have 7 cells each.

- Then, see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in these remaining cells.

- If the total remaining cells across the screens for y are enough to accommodate x 1x1 icons, then the total screens needed are just the screens for y.

- If not, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)

- Hence, total screens = screens for y + additional screens for remaining 1x1 icons

Let me try to formalize this.

Let screen_y = ceil(y / 2)

Then, if y is even:

total_remaining_cells = screen_y * 7

else:

total_remaining_cells = (screen_y - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, if x <= total_remaining_cells:

total_screens = screen_y

else:

additional_x = x - total_remaining_cells

additional_screens = ceil(additional_x / 15)

total_screens = screen_y + additional_screens

Wait, but each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

Wait, no, in the additional screens, since there are no 2x2 icons, each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, the formula seems correct.

Let me test this with the sample input.

First test case:

x=1, y=1

screen_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

since y is odd:

total_remaining_cells = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

x=1 <= 11, so total_screens = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

x=7, y=2

screen_y = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

y is even, so total_remaining_cells = 1 * 7 = 7

x=7 <= 7, so total_screens = 1

Matches the sample.

Third test case:

x=12, y=4

screen_y = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

y is even, total_remaining_cells = 2 * 7 = 14

x=12 <= 14, so total_screens = 2

Matches the sample.

Fourth test case:

x=0, y=3

screen_y = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

y is odd, total_remaining_cells = (2 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18

x=0 <= 18, so total_screens = 2

Matches the sample.

Fifth test case:

x=1, y=0

screen_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

y is even, total_remaining_cells = 0 * 7 = 0

x=1 > 0, so additional_x = 1 - 0 = 1

additional_screens = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

total_screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches the sample.

Sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

screen_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

y is odd, total_remaining_cells = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 + 11 = 11

x=8 <= 11, so total_screens = 1

Matches the sample.

Seventh test case:

x=0, y=0

screen_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

total_remaining_cells = 0 * 7 = 0

x=0 <= 0, so total_screens = 0

Matches the sample.

Eighth test case:

x=2, y=0

screen_y = 0

total_remaining_cells = 0

x=2 > 0, so additional_x = 2 - 0 = 2

additional_screens = ceil(2 / 15) = 1

total_screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches the sample.

Ninth test case:

x=15, y=0

screen_y = 0

total_remaining_cells = 0

x=15 > 0, additional_x = 15 - 0 = 15

additional_screens = ceil(15 / 15) = 1

total_screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches the sample.

Tenth test case:

x=8, y=2

screen_y = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

y is even, total_remaining_cells = 1 * 7 = 7

x=8 > 7, so additional_x = 8 - 7 = 1

additional_screens = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

total_screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Matches the sample.

Eleventh test case:

x=0, y=9

screen_y = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

y is odd, total_remaining_cells = (5 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 4 * 7 + 11 = 28 + 11 = 39

x=0 <= 39, so total_screens = 5

Matches the sample.

Okay, so this logic seems to work for the sample inputs.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

result = []

for _ in range(n):

(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))

space_x = x * 1

space_y = y * 4

total_space = space_y + space_x

if y % 2 == 0:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2

else:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

if space_x <= remaining_cells:

result.append(screen_require_for_y)

else:

extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells

if extra_space % 15 == 0:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15

else:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1

result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)

print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

It calculates space_x = x * 1 and space_y = y * 4, which is the space required for 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

Then, total_space = space_y + space_x, which is the total cells needed.

Then, it calculates screen_require_for_y based on whether y is even or odd.

If y is even, screen_require_for_y = y // 2

Else, screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

This matches our earlier calculation for ceil(y / 2).

Then, it calculates remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

Wait a minute, in our earlier approach, when y is even, remaining_cells = screen_require_for_y * 7, and when y is odd, remaining_cells = (screen_require_for_y - 1) * 7 + 11.

But in this program, remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

Let's see if this is equivalent.

For y even:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2 = y / 2

remaining_cells = 15 * (y / 2) - 4 * y = (15/2)*y - 4*y = (7.5y - 4y) = 3.5y

But in our earlier approach, remaining_cells = 7 * (y / 2) = 3.5y

Wait, that doesn't match. Our earlier approach had remaining_cells = 7 per screen for even y, which would be 7 * (y / 2) = 3.5y.

But in the program, remaining_cells = 15 * (y / 2) - 4 * y = 3.5y.

Wait, but in our earlier example with y=2, screen_require_for_y=1, remaining_cells=7, which matches 15*1 - 4*2 = 15 - 8 = 7.

Similarly, for y=4, screen_require_for_y=2, remaining_cells=15*2 - 16 = 30 - 16 = 14, which matches 7 per screen.

For y=1 (odd):

screen_require_for_y=1, remaining_cells=15*1 - 4*1=11, which matches our earlier calculation.

For y=3 (odd):

screen_require_for_y=2, remaining_cells=15*2 - 12=18, which again matches our earlier calculation.

So, remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y seems correct.

Then, it checks if space_x <= remaining_cells. If yes, then the total screens needed are just screen_require_for_y.

If not, then it calculates extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells, and then extra_screen = ceil(extra_space / 15), and total screens = extra_screen + screen_require_for_y.

This seems to align with our earlier approach.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's check with one of the sample inputs.

Take the third test case: x=12, y=4

space_x=12, space_y=16

screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 = 2

remaining_cells = 15*2 - 16 = 30 - 16 = 14

space_x=12 <=14, so total screens=2, which matches the sample.

Another test case: x=8, y=2

space_x=8, space_y=8

screen_require_for_y=2//2=1

remaining_cells=15*1 - 8=7

space_x=8 >7, so extra_space=8-7=1

extra_screen=ceil(1/15)=1

total_screens=1+1=2, but wait, in the sample, for x=8, y=2, the output is 1.

Wait, hold on, in the sample, for x=8, y=1, output is 1, and for x=8, y=2, output is 2.

Wait, in the sample input, the tenth test case is x=8, y=2, output is 2, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but in our earlier manual calculation, for x=8, y=2, screen_require_for_y=1, remaining_cells=7, x=8 >7, so extra_screen=1, total_screens=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

So, it's correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=9

screen_require_for_y=5

remaining_cells=15*5 - 36=75-36=39

x=0 <=39, so total_screens=5, which matches the sample output of 5.

Seems correct.

Edge cases:

- x=0, y=0: screen_require_for_y=0, remaining_cells=0, x=0<=0, total_screens=0, matches sample.

- x=1, y=0: screen_require_for_y=0, remaining_cells=0, x=1>0, extra_screen=1, total_screens=1, matches sample.

- x=15, y=0: similar to above, total_screens=1, matches sample.

- x=0, y=1: screen_require_for_y=1, remaining_cells=15-4=11, x=0<=11, total_screens=1.

- x=15, y=1: screen_require_for_y=1, remaining_cells=15-4=11, x=15>11, extra_space=4, extra_screen=1, total_screens=2.

- x=14, y=1: remaining_cells=11, x=14>11, extra_space=3, extra_screen=1, total_screens=2.

- x=7, y=2: remaining_cells=7, x=7<=7, total_screens=1, matches sample.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{see explanation}} \]

**Correctness: True**
