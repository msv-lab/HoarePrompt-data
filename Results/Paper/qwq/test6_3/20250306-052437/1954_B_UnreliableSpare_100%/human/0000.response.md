Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a beautiful array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. Or output -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and replace a[i] with a[i-1].

So, in other words, if the elements on both sides of an element are equal, I can change that element to match them. The goal is to make all elements equal using such operations.

Now, the task is to make the array not beautiful by removing the least number of elements possible. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should output -1.

Let's look at the examples to understand better.

First test case:

3

2 2 2

Output: -1

Explanation: It's impossible to make it not beautiful because no matter how many elements you remove, all remaining elements are the same, and you can still make them all equal using the operation.

Second test case:

5

1 2 1 2 1

Output: 1

Explanation: By removing one element, for example, the fifth element, the array becomes [1, 2, 1, 2], which is not beautiful.

Third test case:

1

1

Output: -1

Explanation: It's impossible to make it not beautiful because there's only one element.

Fourth test case:

7

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output: 3

Explanation: By removing the first three elements, the array becomes [5, 3, 3, 3], which is not beautiful.

From these examples, it seems that if all elements are already equal, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, hence -1. Otherwise, I need to find a way to disrupt the array so that it's no longer possible to make all elements equal using the given operation.

Let me think about the properties of a beautiful array. If all elements are already equal, it's beautiful, and removing any number of elements won't change that, as the remaining elements are still all equal. So, for such arrays, the answer is -1.

If not all elements are equal, then I need to see how to make it not beautiful. The operation allows changing an element in the middle if its neighbors are equal. So, if I can disrupt the array such that no sequence of operations can make all elements equal, then it's not beautiful.

One way to think about this is to break the array into segments where all elements are equal. If there are multiple such segments, then perhaps by removing certain elements, I can prevent the array from being made uniform.

Wait, but in the second test case, the array is [1,2,1,2,1]. If I remove the fifth element, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful because you can't make all elements equal. Why is that?

Let's see:

- Original array: [1,2,1,2,1]

- After removing the fifth element: [1,2,1,2]

Now, possible operations:

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1, so replace a[2]=2 with a[1]=1. The array becomes [1,1,1,2]. Then, choose i=4: a[3]=1, a[5]=nothing (since it's out of bounds), so no operation can be performed. The array is not all equal.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that after the operation, the array is [1,1,1,2], which is not all equal. But according to the problem, the operation is to make all elements equal, so in this case, after the operation, it's still not all equal.

Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the explanation. Let me read it again.

"In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5, for example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2]. Let's check if it is beautiful. Two operations are available:

- Choose i=2: the array becomes [1,1,1,2]. No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same.

- Choose i=3: the array becomes [1,2,2,2]. No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same.

Thus, the array [1,2,1,2] is not beautiful."

So, in this case, even after performing the operation, the array cannot be made fully equal. Hence, it's not beautiful.

So, the idea is that in the modified array, no sequence of operations can make all elements equal.

In the original array [1,2,1,2,1], if I don't remove any element, it's beautiful because I can perform operations to make all elements equal.

But after removing one element, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful because no sequence of operations can make all elements equal.

So, I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no sequence of operations can make the array beautiful.

Now, I need to find a general approach for any given beautiful array.

First, I need to understand the condition for an array to be not beautiful.

An array is not beautiful if there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal.

Given that the operation is to replace a[i] with a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], for 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

So, in other words, if there are segments where elements are equal, I can propagate those values to make larger segments equal.

But if there are conflicting values that cannot be made equal, then the array is not beautiful.

So, in the modified array, after removing some elements, if there are at least two different values that cannot be made equal through operations, then the array is not beautiful.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it is to see if the array can be reduced to all elements being equal by performing the allowed operations.

If I can't make all elements equal, then it's not beautiful.

But in the problem, the given array is beautiful, meaning that it is possible to make all elements equal by performing such operations.

I need to make it not beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

So, I need to remove elements in such a way that it becomes impossible to make all remaining elements equal using those operations.

Looking back at the examples:

- All elements equal: cannot make it not beautiful by removing elements.

- Mixed elements: by removing certain elements, I can disrupt the possibility of making all elements equal.

I need to find a way to identify the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt the possibility of making all elements equal.

One approach could be to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array cannot have all elements made equal through the operations.

But this seems vague. Let's think differently.

Perhaps, I can look for the minimal number of elements to remove to break all possible paths of equal elements.

Wait, maybe think in terms of groups of equal elements.

Let's consider the array as a sequence of groups where each group has the same value.

For example:

[1,2,1,2,1]: groups [1], [2], [1], [2], [1]

[3,3,3,5,3,3,3]: groups [3,3,3], [5], [3,3,3]

In the first case, removing the fifth element breaks it into [1,2,1,2], which has groups [1], [2], [1], [2]. There are multiple groups with different values, and no operation can make all equal.

In the second case, removing the first three elements leaves [5,3,3,3], which has groups [5], [3,3,3]. Again, multiple groups with different values.

So, perhaps, the idea is to remove elements to ensure that there are at least two different values in the array, and these values cannot be made equal through operations.

But wait, in the first test case, all elements are equal, so removing any number won't help because the remaining array still has all elements equal.

In other test cases, where there are multiple values, removing some elements can lead to a situation where the remaining array cannot be made uniform.

I need to find the minimal number of elements to remove to achieve that.

Another way to think about it is to remove elements such that the remaining array has at least two different values, and there is no way to make them equal through operations.

But this seems too vague. Let's think about the structure of the array.

Let's consider that in a beautiful array, you can perform operations to make all elements equal.

So, in the modified array, to make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that it's impossible to make all elements equal through operations.

Perhaps, if I can ensure that there are at least two different values that cannot be propagated to the entire array, then it's not beautiful.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of connectivity.

Imagine the array as a graph where elements connected if they are equal and adjacent, and operations allow propagating values through these connections.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can understand the logic behind it.

The code is:

if __name__ == '__main__':

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

flag = True

for i in range(1, n):

if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:

flag = False

break

ans = Decimal('Infinity')

(val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == val:

cnt += 1

else:

ans = min(ans, cnt)

cnt = 0

ans = min(ans, cnt)

if flag:

print(-1)

else:

print(ans)

So, first, it checks if all elements are equal. If they are, it prints -1, which makes sense because you can't make it not beautiful by removing elements.

Then, it initializes ans to infinity.

It sets val to arr[0] and cnt to 0.

Then, it iterates through the array:

if arr[i] == val:

cnt +=1

else:

ans = min(ans, cnt)

cnt = 0

Finally, ans = min(ans, cnt)

Then, if flag is False, it prints ans.

So, it seems to be finding the minimum length of consecutive segments where arr[i] == val.

Wait, val is set to arr[0], so it's finding the minimum length of consecutive arr[0]'s.

Wait, but in the second test case:

arr = [1,2,1,2,1]

val = 1

So, cnt increases for positions 0,2,4, so cnt=3

Then ans = min(ans,3)

But in the code, it seems to be finding the minimum cnt of consecutive val's.

Wait, but in the second test case, ans would be 3, but the output is 1.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, in the code, it's finding the minimum cnt where arr[i] == val.

In the second test case:

arr = [1,2,1,2,1]

val = 1

cnt increases for i=0,2,4: cnt=3

Then, ans = min(ans,3)

But in the end, ans is 3, but the output is 1.

So, perhaps this code is incorrect.

Wait, but the explanation says to output 1, but according to this code, it would output 3.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that in the second test case, removing one element makes it not beautiful.

But according to this code, it's outputting 3, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but maybe I'm misreading it.

Wait, the code is finding the minimum length of consecutive val's.

Wait, no, it's finding the minimum length of consecutive val's in one pass.

Wait, but in the second test case, val=1, and cnt=3 (positions 0,2,4), so ans=3.

But according to the problem, removing one element is enough to make it not beautiful.

So, perhaps this code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, the idea is to remove elements to break all possible paths of equal values.

Wait, maybe think in terms of the minimal number of breaks needed to prevent the array from being made uniform.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a beautiful array. To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there is no way to make all elements equal using the operations.

Given that the operation allows changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], for 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

So, in other words, if I have a sequence where a[i-1] == a[i+1], I can set a[i] to that value.

This operation can be used to propagate values through the array.

So, in the original array, since it's beautiful, it's possible to make all elements equal by propagating values through such operations.

To make it not beautiful, I need to remove elements in such a way that this propagation is blocked, and it's impossible to make all elements equal.

One way to think about this is to remove elements that are critical for the propagation.

But which elements are critical?

Consider that if I have a sequence like a, b, a, b, a, then removing one 'a' might disrupt the propagation.

Wait, in the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], removing one '1' from the end makes it [1,2,1,2], which cannot be made uniform.

So, perhaps, in such alternating patterns, removing one element breaks the pattern.

But in the fourth test case, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing the first three '3's makes it [5,3,3,3], which cannot be made uniform.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is related to the minimal number of groups that need to be removed to disrupt the uniformity.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal frequency of any group.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a beautiful array. To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there is no way to make all elements equal.

Given that operations allow changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], for 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

This operation can be used to make sequences where equal values are connected.

So, perhaps, if I can disconnect the array into parts where equal values cannot be propagated across the entire array, then it's not beautiful.

Hence, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is the size of the smallest group that, when removed, disconnects the propagation.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of elements that, when removed, make sure that no single value can be propagated to cover the entire array.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix a value and try to see if I can make the entire array equal to that value by performing operations.

If I can do that for at least one value, then the array is beautiful.

To make it not beautiful, I need to remove elements such that for no value can the entire array be made equal to it.

So, I need to remove elements so that for every possible value, there is at least one element in the array that cannot be changed to that value through operations.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, all elements can be made equal by operations, meaning that through a series of replacements, I can make all elements the same.

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, it's impossible to make all elements equal through operations.

Perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is related to the minimal frequency of any value in the array.

Wait, but in the second test case, frequencies are:

1:3, 2:2

Removing one '1' makes it 1:2, 2:2, which cannot be made uniform.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, frequencies:

3:6, 5:1

Removing three '3's makes it 3:3, 5:1, which cannot be made uniform.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is the minimal frequency among all values.

But in the first test case, all elements are '2', frequency=3, and it's impossible to make it not beautiful, so output -1.

In the second test case, minimal frequency is 2 ('2'), but the output is 1.

So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal frequency among all values minus one.

In the second test case, minimal frequency among '1' and '2' is 2, minus one is 1, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, frequencies are 3:6, 5:1, minimal frequency is 1, minus one is 0, but the output is 3.

So, doesn't match.

Alternative idea: perhaps it's the size of the smallest group.

In the second test case, smallest group is '2' with frequency 2, so remove one to make it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, smallest group is '5' with frequency 1, but removing one doesn't make it not beautiful, as [3,3,3,5,3,3,3] minus one '5' gives [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the output is 3, which might correspond to removing three '3's to leave [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

So, perhaps, it's the size of the largest group.

But in the second test case, the largest group is '1' with frequency 3, and removing one is enough.

So, doesn't match.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a beautiful array. To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that after removal, there are at least two different values that cannot be made equal through operations.

In other words, the remaining array has at least two different values, and no sequence of operations can make them all equal.

Given that operations allow changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], for 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

So, perhaps, if I can remove elements such that there are multiple disconnected segments with different values, and no operation can connect them.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, all elements can be made equal by operations, meaning that through a series of replacements, I can propagate values to make the entire array uniform.

To make it not beautiful, I need to prevent this propagation.

One way to do this is to ensure that there are multiple distinct values that cannot be propagated to the entire array.

Perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal frequency of any value in the array.

But in the second test case, minimal frequency is 2, and removing one element is enough, which matches minimal frequency minus one.

But in the fourth test case, minimal frequency is 1, and removing one element doesn't make it not beautiful, so removing three elements is needed.

So, this doesn't hold.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, all elements are connected through equal values, allowing propagation.

To disconnect this, I need to remove elements that are critical for the connection.

This sounds like finding a minimal cut in a graph.

But I need to model the array as a graph.

Suppose I model the array as a graph where each element is a node, and there is an edge between nodes if they can be connected through operations.

But I need to define this more clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of runs of equal values.

For example, in [1,2,1,2,1], runs are [1],[2],[1],[2],[1]

In [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], runs are [3,3,3],[5],[3,3,3]

To make it not beautiful, I need to ensure that there are multiple runs with different values that cannot be made equal.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest run.

Wait, in the second test case, smallest run is size 1 for each, so removing one element is enough.

In the fourth test case, runs are size 3,1,3, so removing three elements (the entire run of '5') is needed.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, removing the single '5' leaves [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which is all '3's, which is still beautiful.

Wait, but according to the problem, removing the first three elements makes it [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, removing the single '5' leaves [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

So, perhaps, removing the first three '3's leaves [5,3,3,3], which has two runs: [5],[3,3,3]

In this case, can operations make all elements equal?

If I try to make all elements '5', I need to change the '3's to '5's.

But according to the operation, I can only change a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1].

In [5,3,3,3], for i=2, a[1]=5, a[3]=3, which are different, so I can't change a[2].

Similarly, for i=3, a[2]=3, a[4]=3, so I can change a[3] to a[2]=3, but it's already 3.

So, no change can be made, and the array remains [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Hence, removing the first three '3's makes it not beautiful.

So, in this case, the minimal number of elements to remove is 3.

But according to my earlier hypothesis, the size of the smallest run is 1 ('5'), but removing one '3' isn't enough, as [5,3,3,3,3,3,3] is still beautiful.

So, perhaps, it's not just the size of the smallest run, but something else.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, all elements can be made equal by operations, meaning that there is a path of equal values connecting the entire array.

To make it not beautiful, I need to break this connectivity.

So, perhaps, it's similar to finding the minimal number of nodes to remove to disconnect a graph.

In this case, it might be the minimal number of elements to remove to break the array into multiple parts where equal values cannot be propagated across the break.

But I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number of elements
