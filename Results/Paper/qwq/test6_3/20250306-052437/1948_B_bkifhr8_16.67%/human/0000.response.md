Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. Essentially, for any number >= 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the number. This can be done any number of times.

So, the question is, can I apply these operations in such a way that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order?

Let me look at the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

   - If I split 67: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   - In this case, the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

   - So, the answer is YES.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - If I split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

   - If I split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

   - If I split 5: it's less than 10, so no split

   - The array becomes: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

   - Which is not sorted: 1 <= 2 <= 2 <= 8 <= 5 is false because 8 > 5

   - Trying different splits:

     - Split 28 first: [12, 2, 8, 5]

     - Then split 12: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

     - Still, 2 <= 2 <= 8 <= 5 is false

     - Another approach: split 12 and 28, then check

   - It seems no matter how I split, I can't get a sorted array.

   - So, the answer is NO.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - No splitting needed since it's already sorted.

   - So, the answer is YES.

From these examples, I need to find a general way to determine if such a sorted array can be achieved.

Let me think about the possible approaches.

First approach: Try all possible sequences of splits and check if any sequence leads to a sorted array. However, this seems inefficient because the number of possible operations can be large, and since n can be up to 50, it's not feasible.

Second approach: Since the operations are about splitting numbers into digits and inserting them, perhaps I can consider the potential digits that each number can contribute and see if there's a way to arrange these digits to form a sorted array.

Wait, but it's not just about the digits; it's about the positions where they are inserted. The digits are inserted in the same position where the number was deleted.

So, for example, in [12, 3, 45, 67]:

- If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

- If I split 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

- If I split 67, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

In this case, splitting all possible numbers leads to a sorted array.

But in the second example, [12, 28, 5]:

- Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

- Split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

- Split 8: can't split since 8 < 10

- So, [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted.

- Alternatively, split 28 first: [12, 2, 8, 5]

- Then split 12: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], still not sorted.

- Another way: split 12 and 28, then arrange digits appropriately.

But in this case, it seems impossible to get a sorted array.

So, what's the general rule here?

I need to consider that splitting a number >=10 allows me to insert its digits in place, and I can do this operation multiple times.

I need to check if, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

One way to think about this is to consider the potential digits that each position can contribute and see if there's a way to choose which numbers to split such that the resulting array is sorted.

But this seems complicated.

Another way is to consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can only decrease the value at that position and the positions following it, since we're inserting smaller digits.

Wait, but in some cases, splitting can increase the number of elements, which might allow for a better arrangement.

But it's tricky to generalize.

Let me consider the following idea:

- For each number in the array, if it's >=10, I have the option to split it into its digits or leave it as is.

- So, for each such number, I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into digits.

- Then, I need to check all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting these numbers and see if any of these results in a sorted array.

But with n up to 50, and each element possibly being split or not, this could be exponential in the worst case, which is not practical.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fully split all possible numbers, i.e., split every number that is >=10 into its digits. Then, I can sort the resulting array and check if it's sorted.

Wait, but sorting the array would give me the smallest possible non-decreasing order, but I need to check if there's a way to arrange the splits to get a non-decreasing order without necessarily sorting the entire array.

No, actually, if I fully split all numbers into digits and then sort them, that would give me the smallest possible non-decreasing order. But I need to check if there's any sequence of splits that can lead to a non-decreasing order, not necessarily the sorted one.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the sorted version of the fully split array is the same as the original array after some operations.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let S be the original array.

Let's define a function split(x):

- If x < 10, return [x]

- Else, return the digits of x

For example, split(12) = [1, 2], split(5) = [5], split(28) = [2, 8]

Now, I can think of the operation as choosing to apply split to any a_i >=10, and replacing a_i with split(a_i) at that position.

I can perform this operation multiple times, each time choosing one a_i >=10 to split.

I need to check if there's a sequence of such operations that results in an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

An important observation is that splitting a number into digits can be done multiple times, but in practice, splitting a number >=10 into digits once is sufficient because splitting digits further won't change them (since digits are <10).

So, perhaps I can consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits is a one-time operation for that number, and then see if the resulting array can be sorted.

But even then, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits is equivalent to replacing that number with its digits, and then I can arrange these digits in any order to achieve a sorted array.

But no, because the digits are inserted in the same position where the number was deleted, so the relative order of the digits is preserved.

For example, splitting 12 in [12, 3, 45, 67] replaces 12 with [1, 2], so the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. Then, splitting 45 replaces 45 with [4, 5], resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Finally, splitting 67 replaces 67 with [6, 7], resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which is sorted.

In this case, it worked because splitting all numbers led to a sorted array.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5]:

- Split 12: [1, 2, 28, 5]

- Split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

- Cannot split 5

- The array is not sorted.

- Alternatively, split 28 first: [12, 2, 8, 5]

- Then split 12: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

- Still not sorted.

- It seems that no matter how I split, I can't get a sorted array.

So, in this case, the answer is NO.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no need to split anything.

So, the answer is YES.

From these observations, it seems that if I split all possible numbers into digits, and the resulting array is sorted, then the answer is YES.

But in the second example, even after splitting all possible numbers, the array isn't sorted.

Hence, the answer is NO.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting all possible numbers leads to a sorted array.

In the second example, it doesn't.

So, perhaps the general approach is to split all numbers >=10 into their digits and check if the resulting array is sorted.

But in the first example, splitting all numbers leads to a sorted array.

In the second example, it doesn't.

In the third example, no splitting is needed since it's already sorted.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the array is [15, 2, 34].

- Split 15: [1, 5, 2, 34]

- Split 34: [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]

- Which is not sorted: 1 <= 5 <= 2 <= 3 <= 4 is false because 5 > 2

- Alternatively, split 34 first: [15, 2, 3, 4]

- Then split 15: [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]

- Still not sorted: 1 <= 5 <= 2 <= 3 <= 4 is false

- It seems that no matter how I split, I can't get a sorted array.

So, in this case, the answer should be NO.

But if I split all possible numbers at once: [1, 5, 2, 3, 4], which is not sorted.

Hence, the answer is NO.

Another example: [23, 4, 56, 7]

- Split 23: [2, 3, 4, 56, 7]

- Split 56: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

- Which is sorted.

- So, the answer is YES.

In this case, splitting all possible numbers leads to a sorted array.

So, it seems that if splitting all possible numbers leads to a sorted array, then the answer is YES.

Otherwise, it's NO.

Therefore, perhaps the simplest approach is to split all possible numbers >=10 into their digits, concatenate all the elements in order, and check if the resulting array is sorted.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me try this approach with the earlier examples.

First example: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- Split 12: [1, 2]

- Keep 3 as is: [1, 2, 3]

- Split 45: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Split 67: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

- This is sorted: YES

Second example: [12, 28, 5]

- Split 12: [1, 2]

- Split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8]

- Keep 5 as is: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

- This is not sorted: NO

Third example: [0, 0]

- No splitting needed; already sorted: YES

Another example: [15, 2, 34]

- Split 15: [1, 5]

- Keep 2 as is: [1, 5, 2]

- Split 34: [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]

- Not sorted: NO

Another example: [23, 4, 56, 7]

- Split 23: [2, 3]

- Keep 4 as is: [2, 3, 4]

- Split 56: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

- Keep 7 as is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

- Sorted: YES

So, this approach seems to work for these cases.

Therefore, the plan is:

- For each number in the array, if it's >=10, split it into its digits; otherwise, keep it as is.

- Collect all these elements in order.

- Check if the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

- If it is, print YES; else, print NO.

This seems efficient because for n <= 50, and each number having at most 2 digits, the total number of elements after splitting is at most 100, which is manageable.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

a = list1[p - 1]

list1.pop(p - 1)

list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

list1.insert(p, a % 10)

if func_1(list1):

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

def func_1(lst):

sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

return lst == sorted_lst

Analysis of the program:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n and the list of n integers.

- Then, it iterates from the second element to the end of the list.

- For each element at position p, it checks if the previous element (p-1) is greater than the current element (p) and if the previous element is greater than 10.

- If both conditions are true, it splits the previous element into its tens and units digits and inserts them back into the list at the same position.

- After performing these operations, it calls func_1 to check if the list is sorted.

- func_1 sorts the list and checks if it's equal to the original list.

Issues with the program:

1. The program only performs the split operation once for each problematic pair where list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] > 10. It doesn't consider multiple splits or splitting different elements multiple times.

2. The program modifies the list by splitting only certain elements based on adjacent comparisons, which might not lead to a fully sorted list.

3. The check for sorting is done after performing these limited operations, which might not be sufficient to sort the list in all cases.

4. In the first example, [12, 3, 45, 67], splitting 12 would result in [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted. But the program might not split all possible elements.

5. In the second example, [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 leads to [1, 2, 28, 5], which isn't sorted, and splitting 28 leads to [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which isn't sorted either. The program might stop after one split operation.

6. The program doesn't ensure that all possible splits are performed or that the list is fully split where necessary.

7. The function func_1 simply checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version, which is correct, but the list may not be fully split to be sorted.

Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers >=10 into their digits. It only performs splits for specific conditions and doesn't ensure that all possible splits are considered or that the list is fully split to check for sorted order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
