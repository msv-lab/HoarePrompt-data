Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, I need to buy k tickets for my employees over n days, where each day the ticket price is a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying exactly k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

So, n=4 days, m=2 tickets per day, k=3 tickets to buy.

The prices are 8,6,4,2.

Now, according to the explanation, one optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1 → prices for remaining days become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2 → prices for remaining days become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3 → cost = 4, prices for remaining day become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4 → cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

Another way could be:

- Buy 2 on day 1 → cost = 16, prices for remaining days become [8,6,4] +2 = [10,8,6]

- Buy 1 on day 2 → cost = 10

Total cost = 16 + 10 = 26, which is worse.

So, buying later when prices are lower is better, but I have to consider the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, in the first approach, buying later is better because prices are lower, and by buying later, I don't increase the prices for future days.

But, if I delay buying, the prices might increase due to previous purchases.

I need to find a balance.

Let me think about the general strategy.

I need to buy k tickets, with at most m per day, and each purchase increases future prices by the number of tickets bought.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all j > i, the price a_j increases by x.

My total cost would be sum over i of (x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j))

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let s_i = sum of x_j for j < i, which is the total tickets bought before day i.

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}

So, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

And s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

Total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Given that sum of x_i = k, and x_i <= m for all i.

I need to minimize this total cost.

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

I need to decide how many tickets to buy each day, considering the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

This seems complex, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets. Let's say I buy on days d1, d2, ..., dt, with x1, x2, ..., xt tickets respectively.

Then, the cost on day d1 is x1 * a_{d1}

The cost on day d2 is x2 * (a_{d2} + x1)

The cost on day d3 is x3 * (a_{d3} + x1 + x2)

And so on.

So, total cost is:

sum over j from 1 to t of xj * (aj + sum over i < j of xi)

Which simplifies to:

sum over j of xj * aj + sum over j of xj * sum over i < j of xi

The first term is sum of xj * aj, and the second term is sum of xj * s_{j-1}, where s_{j-1} is the sum of x's before j.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me consider that the price increase is cumulative based on previous purchases.

So, the total price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, the cost is x_i * (a_i + sum of x_j for j < i)

I need to minimize the sum over all i of this expression, given that sum of x_i = k and x_i <= m.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem.

Let's think about dynamic programming.

Let dp[i][s] be the minimum cost to buy s tickets using the first i days.

Then, dp[i][s] = min over x in [0, m] of dp[i-1][s - x] + x * (a_i + (total tickets bought in previous days))

Wait, total tickets bought in previous days is s - x.

So, dp[i][s] = min over x in [0, m] of dp[i-1][s - x] + x * (a_i + (s - x))

But s - x is the total tickets bought in previous days.

Wait, but this seems off.

Let me try to define dp[i][t] where t is the total tickets bought so far.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the cumulative sum.

But dynamic programming might be too slow because n and k can be up to 3e5 and 1e9 respectively.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about the greedy approach.

Since the prices are increasing based on previous purchases, maybe it's best to buy on the days with the lowest prices, considering the price increases.

But it's not straightforward because buying on a day increases the prices for future days.

Perhaps I should sort the days by their original prices and try to buy as many as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

Wait, but the prices increase over time based on previous purchases.

Let me consider that the effective price for a ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

So, if I fix the days on which I buy tickets, the cost for each ticket on those days is a_i plus the total tickets bought on previous days.

I need to minimize the sum of these costs.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the order of buying days matters, and I should select a subset of days to buy tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But with the constraints on m and the price increases, it's not obvious.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some ideas.

First sample input:

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

Output: 10

As shown in the explanation, buying 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4 costs 4 + 6 = 10.

Another way, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 costs 16 + 10 = 26, which is worse.

So, buying on later days when prices are lower is better.

But, if I buy on day 4 only, which has the lowest price, but I can buy at most m=2 tickets on that day.

So, I can buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 2*2=4, and then I need to buy 1 more ticket.

If I buy it on day 3, the price on day 3 is 4 + 2 (from day 4 purchases) = 6, so 6*1=6.

Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10.

Wait, but in the explanation, they bought 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, which also totals 10.

So, same cost.

But according to their explanation, they bought 0 on day 1 and 2, then 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4.

Wait, but in terms of cost, it's the same.

So, perhaps the order doesn't matter, and what matters is which days you choose to buy on and how many tickets you buy on those days.

Wait, but the price increases are based on previous purchases.

Wait, no, the price increases are additive for all previous purchases.

Wait, no, the problem says: "If a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, the price on day j is a_j plus the sum of x_i for all i < j.

So, the total cost is sum over j of x_j * (a_j + sum over i < j of x_i)

This is equivalent to sum over j of x_j * a_j + (sum over i < j of x_i) * x_j

Which is sum over j of x_j * a_j + sum over i < j of x_i * x_j

So, total cost = sum over j of x_j * a_j + sum over all pairs (i,j) with i < j of x_i * x_j

This seems like a quadratic function in terms of x_j.

To minimize this, I need to consider that higher a_j and higher x_j * x_i terms contribute to the cost.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of choosing days to buy tickets, prioritizing days with lower a_j, but adjusted for the fact that buying on a day affects future prices.

Wait, perhaps I should select the days where the base price a_j is lowest, and buy as many tickets as possible on those days, considering the constraints.

But, buying on a day with a low a_j but early in the sequence might increase the prices for later days, which might have even lower a_j.

So, I need to balance between buying on days with low a_j and delaying purchases to days with potentially lower a_j, considering the price increases.

This is tricky.

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_j.

Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_j, considering the constraints on m and the price increases.

But, since the days are ordered, I need to consider the cumulative effect of price increases.

Wait, maybe I can select a subset of days to buy tickets, and determine how many tickets to buy on each selected day, in a way that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, say I buy on days d1, d2, ..., dt, and on each day I buy x_d1, x_d2, ..., x_dt tickets, with sum x_d1 + ... + x_dt = k, and x_di <= m for each i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_di * (a_di + sum over j < i of x_dj)

Because the price on day d_i is a_di plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days d_j < d_i.

I need to minimize this sum.

This seems like a complex optimization problem.

Maybe I can model it differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over all pairs of days (i,j) where i < j, of x_i * x_j, plus sum over j of x_j * a_j.

So, total cost = sum_j x_j * a_j + sum_{i<j} x_i * x_j

I need to minimize this, given that sum x_j = k and x_j <= m.

This seems like a quadratic optimization problem.

Perhaps I can consider the dual problem or find some mathematical insight to simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some greedy heuristic.

Let me think about the impact of buying on a particular day.

If I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * a_i plus x * sum of x_j for j < i.

Moreover, this purchase increases the price for all subsequent days by x.

So, for all j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

Therefore, buying on an earlier day increases the prices for later days, which might be costly if there are days with low a_j later on.

Hence, there is a trade-off between buying on a day with a low a_j and avoiding increasing the prices for future days.

This seems like a classic optimization problem where I need to balance immediate cost and future cost increases.

Perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, and determining how many tickets to buy on each selected day, to minimize the total cost.

But with n up to 3e5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_j.

Then, prioritize buying on days with lower a_j, but considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, but if I buy on a day with a low a_j, it increases the prices for future days, which might have even lower a_j.

So, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I should consider buying on the days with the lowest a_j + sum of x_l for l < j.

But sum of x_l for l < j is determined by previous decisions.

This seems recursive.

Perhaps dynamic programming is the way to go, but with n up to 3e5, standard DP might be too slow.

I need a linear or near-linear time solution.

Let me think about the constraints.

n can be up to 3e5, m up to 1e9, k up to min(n*m, 1e9).

So, n is large, but m and k can be up to 1e9, which suggests that I need an algorithm that doesn't iterate over k or m explicitly.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the total number of tickets I can buy is nm, which can be up to 3e14, which is too big to handle directly.

But k is up to 1e9, which is manageable.

Wait, but n is up to 3e5, and t is up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, which is manageable.

I need an O(n log n) solution or something similar.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_j.

- Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_j, considering the constraints on m and the price increases.

But, buying on a day with a low a_j increases the prices for future days, which might have even lower a_j.

So, it's not clear that sorting in increasing order of a_j is the best approach.

Wait, maybe sorting in decreasing order of a_j is better.

Let's consider that.

If I sort the days in decreasing order of a_j, then the days with higher a_j come first.

But, if I buy on days with higher a_j, the prices for future days are increased, which might affect days with lower a_j negatively.

This also seems suboptimal.

I need a different perspective.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, and determining how many tickets to buy on each selected day, in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increases.

This sounds similar to selecting a subset of days to make purchases, where each purchase affects future costs.

Maybe I can use a priority queue or some greedy selection based on some criteria.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the marginal cost of buying a ticket on a particular day.

The marginal cost of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i, plus the increase in price for all future days.

Wait, but this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Suppose I decide to buy x tickets on day i.

Then, the cost for those x tickets is x * (a_i + sum of x_j for j < i).

Additionally, for all future days j > i, the price increases by x.

So, the total cost is:

sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j) + sum over j > i of x_j * x_i

Wait, no.

Actually, the increase in price for future days is x_i per ticket bought on future days.

So, the total cost is:

sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j) + sum over i of x_i * sum over j > i of x_j

Which is equal to sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * sum over j != i of x_j

But this seems incorrect.

Wait, let's think again.

The price on day i is a_i plus sum over j < i of x_j.

So, the cost for buying x_i tickets on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j).

And, buying x_i tickets on day i increases the price for all j > i by x_i.

So, the total cost is indeed sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j).

Because the sum over j < i of x_j is the total tickets bought before day i, which increases the price on day i.

And, the x_i bought on day i increases the price for all j > i by x_i, but that is already accounted for in the sum over j > i of x_j * x_i.

But, in the total cost expression, it's already included in the sum over i of x_i * sum over j < i of x_j.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the double sum carefully.

Total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * sum over j < i of x_j

But, the increase in price for future days is already captured in the sum over j > i of x_i * x_j.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, and determining how many tickets to buy on each selected day, in a way that minimizes the total cost.

I need to find a way to minimize the sum of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j).

This seems complicated, but maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me consider that the total cost is equal to sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i < j of x_i * x_j.

This is equivalent to sum over i of x_i * a_i + (sum over all i of x_i)^2 - sum over i of x_i^2 / 2.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, sum over i of x_i * sum over j < i of x_j = sum over all pairs (i,j) with j < i of x_i * x_j.

This is equal to (sum over all i of x_i)^2 - sum over i of x_i^2, divided by 2.

Wait, no.

Actually, sum over i sum over j < i of x_i x_j = 0.5 * ((sum over i x_i)^2 - sum over i x_i^2)

Yes, that's correct.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + 0.5 * ((sum over i x_i)^2 - sum over i x_i^2)

Given that sum over i x_i = k.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + 0.5 * (k^2 - sum over i x_i^2)

This seems interesting.

But I'm not sure if this helps me minimize the total cost directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, say I buy on days d1, d2, ..., dt.

Let me sort these days in increasing order of a_di.

Then, the total cost would be sum over j of x_dj * (a_dj + sum over i < j of x_di)

This still seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for a fixed set of days, the optimal way to distribute the tickets is to buy as many as possible on the days with the lowest a_j, considering the price increases.

But, I'm going in circles here.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I decide to buy q days worth of tickets, where on each of these q days, I buy m tickets, except possibly on the last day where I buy the remaining tickets.

But, this might not be optimal because m could be larger than k, or q could be too large.

Wait, perhaps I need to determine the minimal number of days required to buy k tickets, given the m constraint.

Let me calculate q = ceil(k / m), which is the minimal number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Then, I need to choose q days where I buy m tickets each, except possibly on the last day where I buy k - (q-1)*m tickets.

Now, I need to choose which q days to select for buying tickets.

Given that, I need to choose q days, and on each of these days, buy a certain number of tickets, considering the price increases.

Wait, maybe I can select the q days with the lowest a_j, and buy m tickets on each, except possibly on the last day where I buy fewer.

But, selecting the q days with the lowest a_j might not be optimal because buying on days with lower a_j but early in the sequence could increase the prices for later days.

So, perhaps I need to select q days where the sum of a_j plus the interactions between the days is minimized.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix q, the number of days on which I buy tickets.

Then, on each of these q days, I buy x_qi tickets, with sum of x_qi = k, and x_qi <= m.

The total cost would be sum over the q days of x_qi * (a_qi + sum over previous selected days of x_qj)

This still seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting q days, sorting them, and then buying m tickets on each day, except possibly on the last day.

Then, the total cost would be sum over the q days of m * (a_qi + m * (i-1)), where i is the position in the sorted order.

Wait, no, because the price increases are cumulative based on previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the cumulative sum of m.

Let me try to consider that I buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and k - m*(q-1) on the last day.

Then, the total cost would be:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m * (a_di + m * (i-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_dq + m*(q-1))

Where d1 to dq are the days selected, sorted in increasing order of a_di.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose I select q days, d1 to dq, sorted such that a_d1 <= a_d2 <= ... <= a_dq.

Then, the total cost would be:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m * (a_di + m * (i-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_dq + m*(q-1))

Because:

- On day d1, buy m tickets at price a_d1 + 0 (since no previous purchases), total cost m * a_d1

- On day d2, buy m tickets at price a_d2 + m, total cost m * (a_d2 + m)

- ...

- On day dq, buy k - m*(q-1) tickets at price a_dq + m*(q-1), total cost (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_dq + m*(q-1))

So, total cost is:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m * (a_di + m * (i-1)) + (k - m*(q-1)) * (a_dq + m*(q-1))

Now, I need to choose q and the set of q days with the lowest possible total cost.

This seems manageable.

Let me see.

First, I need to choose q, the number of days to buy tickets, where q is at least ceil(k/m) and at most n.

But, actually, q can be from ceil(k/m) up to n, but higher q might not be beneficial.

Wait, but I need to choose q such that I can buy k tickets, which requires at least ceil(k/m) days.

But, perhaps I can choose more days to spread out the purchases and minimize the cost.

Wait, but buying on more days would increase the price for future days, which might not be desirable.

So, perhaps the optimal q is ceil(k/m), meaning buying m tickets per day for q-1 days, and the remaining on the last day.

This might be the way to go.

Let me test this with the first sample input.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

q = ceil(3/2) = 2

So, select q=2 days with the lowest a_j, which are days 4 and 3, with a=2 and a=4.

Sort them: 2,4

So, buy m=2 tickets on day 4 at price 2 + 0 = 2, total cost 4

Buy k - m*(q-1
