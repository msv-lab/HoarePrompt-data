Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example provided to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 tickets on day 1. Prices for remaining days become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 tickets on day 2. Prices for remaining days become [4,2]

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 4. Prices for remaining day become [3]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 6 in total.

Total cost is 4 + 6 = 10.

In the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8,6,4,2]

Since m=2 and k=8, I have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days.

Each day, I buy 2 tickets at the current price, and the price increases by 2 for the next days.

So, day 1: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16. New prices: [8,6,4,2] +2 => [10,8,6,4]

day 2: 2 tickets at 10 each, total 20. New prices: [10,8,6,4] +2 => [12,10,8,6]

day 3: 2 tickets at 12 each, total 24. New prices: [12,10,8,6] +2 => [14,12,10,8]

day 4: 2 tickets at 14 each, total 28.

Total cost: 16 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 88.

Wait, but the output for this case is 64, which is less than 88. So maybe there's a better strategy.

Wait, perhaps buying fewer tickets on some days can lead to lower overall costs because the price increases are additive.

Let me think differently.

I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum over the days of (number of tickets bought on that day multiplied by the price on that day), considering that the price increases by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the constraints.

But with n up to 3*10^5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let's consider that the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all days j < i where x_j tickets were bought.

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, more precisely, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

But this seems tricky to optimize directly.

Another way to look at it is that the total cost is the sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + S), where S is the sum of x_j for j < i.

This can be rewritten as sum over i of (x_i * a_i) + S * x_i.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of choosing which days to buy tickets, considering that the order of days matters because of the increasing prices.

Wait, perhaps I should consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest initial prices, but taking into account the impact on future prices.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the first test case, where n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2], and the optimal cost is 10.

In that case, buying 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4:

- Day 3: 1 ticket at 4, total 4

- Day 4: 2 tickets at 2 + 1 (since x=1 from previous day), so 3 each, total 6

- Overall: 4 + 6 = 10

Alternatively, buying 1 ticket on day 4 and 2 tickets on day 3:

- Day 3: 2 tickets at 4, total 8

- Day 4: 1 ticket at 2 + 2 (since x=2 from day 3), so 4, total 4

- Overall: 8 + 4 = 12, which is worse than 10.

So, the first approach is better.

Another approach: buy 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 1 on day 3, and 2 on day 4, as in the example.

Wait, maybe I can model this problem by considering the incremental cost.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on day i has a base cost of a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

So, the cost of the x-th ticket bought on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, more precisely, for a ticket bought on day i, its cost is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, for day i, if I buy x_i tickets, their individual costs are:

a_i + S, a_i + S +1, ..., a_i + S + x_i -1,

where S is the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, the total cost for day i is:

sum from t=0 to x_i-1 of (a_i + S + t) = x_i * (a_i + S) + (x_i * (x_i -1))/2

But this seems complicated to optimize directly.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that the price increases by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, the price per ticket is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

I need to choose x_i for each i such that sum x_i = k, and minimize the total cost.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using priority queues or some greedy approach.

I recall that in optimization problems where we have to choose when to perform an action with increasing costs, a greedy approach often works.

In this case, it might be beneficial to buy tickets on days where the initial price is lowest, considering the incremental increases.

But I need to take into account that buying on a particular day affects the prices on future days.

Wait, perhaps I should consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_i first, but only up to m tickets per day, and considering the increases in subsequent days.

But this might not always be optimal, as seen in the first example.

Wait, in the first example, buying on day 4 (a_i=2) after adjusting for the increases from previous days can be cheaper.

This is confusing.

Let me think about the general approach.

Suppose I have to buy k tickets, with at most m per day, and each day's price increases by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

I need to distribute the k tickets across the n days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

One idea is to prioritize buying tickets on days with the lowest adjusted prices, considering the increases due to previous purchases.

But since the increases depend on previous purchases, it's interdependent.

Maybe I can model this as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, with constraints on how many tickets can be bought each day, and considering the incremental increases.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider sorting the days based on their initial prices.

Suppose I sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Then, I can consider buying as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints on m per day and the increases on future days.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I need to "visit" each day to buy tickets.

Since each day can be used multiple times, but with increasing prices.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that for each ticket I buy, it's assigned to a specific day, with a specific price based on when it's bought.

This seems too fine-grained.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum over all tickets of their individual prices, which depend on the day they're bought and the number of tickets bought before that day.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I can model this problem using prefix sums or something similar.

Wait, here's an idea.

Let's sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Then, for the first few days, buy as many tickets as possible without exceeding m per day, always choosing the days with the lowest a_i.

But considering that buying on a day increases the prices on future days.

Wait, but if I buy on a day with low a_i, it increases the prices for future days, which might offset the benefit.

Alternatively, if I delay buying to a day with higher a_i, but the increases are lower because fewer tickets have been bought previously.

It's tricky to balance.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the set of days on which I buy tickets, and the number of tickets bought on each day.

Then, the total cost can be computed as sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of x_j)

This is equivalent to sum x_i * a_i + sum x_i * sum x_j for j < i

Which is sum x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j * x_i

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total sum.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem using prefix sums.

Let me define S_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

Then, the cost for day i is x_i * (a_i + S_{i-1})

So, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * S_{i-1}

Since S_{i-1} = sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j, and S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i

I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of S_{i-1} as the total tickets bought before day i, so the price per ticket on day i is a_i + S_{i-1}

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + S_{i-1})

And I need to have sum x_i = k, with x_i <= m for each i.

This seems to be a linear cost function, but with dependencies between the variables.

This might be solvable using some kind of priority queue or greedy approach.

Let me consider a greedy approach where I always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price.

But the current price on day i depends on the sum of x_j for j < i.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a priority queue of days, ordered by their current price, and buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price, updating the prices of the remaining days accordingly.

But with n up to 3*10^5, this would be too slow, as maintaining a priority queue with n elements for up to k purchases would be O(k log n), which is too slow for large k.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the problem can be divided into groups of days where I buy a certain number of tickets, considering the increases.

Wait, perhaps I can group the days into blocks where I buy a certain number of tickets, and compute the cost for each block.

But I'm not sure.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to sort the days and then select the first q days, where q is ceil(k/m).

Then, it computes the cost based on buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining tickets on the q-th day.

Wait, let's look at the code in detail.

The code reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read the array a of n integers

- Set m = min(m, k) to ensure m doesn't exceed k

- Sort the array a in ascending order

- Compute q = ceil(k / m)

- Take the first q days with the lowest a_i

- If n*m >=k, which is always true since k <= n*m, so this condition is redundant

- If n*m ==k, which is unlikely since k can be less than n*m, but in this case, it's set to min(n*m, 1e9)

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, k <= min(n*m, 1e9), so n*m can be up to 3e14, which is fine.

Then, it computes the cost based on buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining tickets on the q-th day.

Wait, in the code:

N = M[:q]

n = len(N)

if n * m ==k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu = k - (n -1)*m

cost = mu * w

n = len(N)

cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2) + n * m * mu

print(cost)

So, it's sorting the days by a_i in ascending order, and selecting the first q days, where q = ceil(k/m).

Then, it buys m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining tickets on the q-th day.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Suppose q = ceil(k/m).

Then, q is the smallest integer such that q*m >=k.

So, q-1*m <k, and q*m >=k.

Therefore, on the first q-1 days, buy m tickets each, and on the q-th day, buy mu = k - (q-1)*m tickets.

Now, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j <i.

So, for the first day, price is a_i.

For the second day, price is a_i + m.

For the third day, price is a_i + 2*m, and so on.

Wait, but in the code, it's sum(N), which is the sum of the first q days' a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

q = ceil(3/2) = 2

N = [2,4]

n=2

Since n*m=4 >=k=3, proceed.

n*m=4 !=k=3, so go to else:

w = N.pop() => w=4, N=[2]

mu =3 - (2-1)*2=3-2=1

cost =1*4=4

n=len(N)=1

cost +=1*2 +1*1*0 +1*2*1=2 +0 +2=4

Total cost=4+4=8, but in the example, it's 10.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the code, it's:

cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2) + n * m * mu

So, sum(N)=2

m=2, n=1, mu=1

m * sum(N) = 4

m * m * ((1-1)*1//2)=4*0=0

n * m * mu=2

So, cost=4+0+2=6

Plus the initial mu * w =1*4=4

Total cost=4+6=10, which matches the example.

Okay, so in this case, it works.

Let me see another test case.

Second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

q=ceil(8/2)=4

N=[2,4,6,8]

n=4

Since n*m=8==k=8

cost =2*(2+4+6+8) +2*2*(3)=2*20 +4*3=40+12=52

But the output is 64.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, let's compute it properly.

m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n-1)*n//2)

m=2, sum(N)=2+4+6+8=20

m*sum(N)=40

m*m*((n-1)*n//2)=4*(6)//2=4*3=12

Total cost=40+12=52, but the output is 64.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

if n*m ==k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2)

else:

...

So, for the second test case, n=4, m=2, k=8, n*m=8==k, so cost=2*20 +2*2*(6//2)=40+4*3=40+12=52, but the output is 64.

This suggests that the code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 64 for the second test case.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says "It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.", which is fine.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the formula in the code.

Let me try to understand how the formula works.

Suppose I select the first q days with the lowest a_i.

Then, I buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and mu=k - (q-1)*m tickets on the q-th day.

Now, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j <i.

So, for day 1: price = a_i

for day 2: price = a_i + m

for day 3: price = a_i + 2*m

...

for day q: price = a_i + (q-1)*m

Wait, but in the code, it's sum(N) and m*m*((n-1)*n//2), which seems to account for the increases.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the total cost as:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m * (N_i + (i-1)*m) + mu * (N_q + (q-1)*m)

But in the code, it's:

if n*m ==k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu =k - (n -1)*m

cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2) + n * m * mu

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the formula.

Let me consider that sum(N) is the sum of the first q days' a_i.

Then, m * sum(N) would be the cost if buying m tickets on each day, without considering the increases.

But in reality, the price increases by m for each previous day.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.

I think I need to find a better way to model the total cost.

Let me consider that the total cost is:

sum over i=1 to q of x_i * (a_i + S_{i-1}), where S_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j <i.

Given that x_i = m for i from 1 to q-1, and x_q = mu.

S_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

So, S_{i-1} = sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j = m*(i-1) for i from 1 to q.

Therefore, the cost for day i (i from 1 to q-1):

x_i * (a_i + S_{i-1}) = m * (a_i + m*(i-1))

And for day q:

x_q * (a_q + S_{q-1}) = mu * (a_q + m*(q-1))

So, total cost should be:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m*(a_i + m*(i-1)) + mu*(a_q + m*(q-1))

Which is:

m * sum_{i=1 to q-1} a_i + m^2 * sum_{i=1 to q-1} (i-1) + mu * a_q + mu * m * (q-1)

Now, sum_{i=1 to q-1} (i-1) = sum_{j=0 to q-2} j = (q-1)*(q-2)/2

So, total cost is:

m * sum_{i=1 to q-1} a_i + m^2 * (q-1)*(q-2)/2 + mu * a_q + mu * m * (q-1)

This seems different from what the code is doing.

In the code, it's:

if n*m ==k:

cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu =k - (n -1)*m

cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n -1)*n //2) + n * m * mu

Wait, in the else clause, it's sum(N) which is sum of the first q days, but in my derivation, it should be sum of the first q-1 days.

Also, the term m*m*((n-1)*n//2) seems to correspond to m^2*(q-1)*q/2, but in my derivation, it's m^2*(q-1)*(q-2)/2.

This suggests a mistake in the code's formula.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the cost of purchasing exactly k tickets over n days with varying ticket prices and constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day, while accounting for price increases due to previous purchases.

## Approach

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
    - Read the number of test cases, t.
    - For each test case, read the values of n, m, and k.
    - Read the array a, representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - **Sort the Prices**: Sort the ticket prices in ascending order to prioritize buying tickets on days with lower initial prices.
    - **Determine the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**: Calculate the minimum number of days required to buy k tickets, given the daily purchase limit m. This is computed as q = ceil(k / m).
    - **Select the Best q Days**: Choose the first q days with the lowest prices.
    - **Calculate the Total Cost**:
        - For the first q-1 days, buy m tickets each day.
        - For the q-th day, buy the remaining tickets (mu = k - (q-1)*m).
        - Compute the cost considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

3. **Price Calculation**:
    - The price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days.
    - Use the formula to compute the total cost based on the selected days and the number of tickets bought each day.

                    mu * (N[-1] + m * (q - 1)) + mu * m * (q - 1))
            # Adjust for the overlapping terms
            cost = m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * m * (q - 1) * (q - 2) // 2 + mu * N[-1] + mu * m * (q - 1)

## Explanation

- **Sorting the Prices**: By sorting the prices in ascending order, we ensure that we are prioritizing days with the lowest initial ticket prices.
- **Calculating the Number of Days (q)**: We determine the minimum number of days required to buy k tickets given the daily limit m.
- **Selecting the Best q Days**: We select the first q days from the sorted list, which have the lowest prices.
- **Cost Calculation**:
    - For the first q-1 days, we buy m tickets each day.
    - For the q-th day, we buy the remaining mu tickets.
    - The price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days.
    - We compute the total cost by summing up the costs for each day, considering the incremental price increases.

This approach ensures that we minimize the total cost by strategically choosing the days and quantities of tickets to purchase, taking into account the constraints and price increase rules.
