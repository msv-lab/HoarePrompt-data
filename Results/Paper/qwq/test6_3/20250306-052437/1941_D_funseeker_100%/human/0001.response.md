Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They're playing a game where they throw a ball to each other. The ball starts with player x, and there are m throws in total. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction, which can be clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown.

My task is to figure out which players could have the ball after m throws, based on the given distances and directions for each throw.

First, I need to understand the setup. The players are in a circle, so the concept of distance makes sense in both directions. For example, in a circle of 6 players, the clockwise distance from player 2 to player 5 is 3, and the counterclockwise distance is 3 as well, since 5 - 2 = 3.

Wait, in the problem statement, for n=7, the clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3, and counterclockwise is 4. So, in general, for any n, the clockwise distance from y1 to y2 is (y2 - y1) mod n, and the counterclockwise distance is (y1 - y2) mod n.

Okay, so for each throw, the player with the ball can throw it a distance r_i either clockwise, counterclockwise, or in both directions if the direction is unknown ('?').

I need to keep track of all possible positions the ball can be in after all m throws.

Let's think about how to model this.

One way is to keep a set of possible positions after each throw, updating it based on the throw's distance and direction.

Starting with the initial position x, which is player x.

Then, for each throw, for each current possible position, I apply the throw's distance in the specified directions.

If the direction is '0', only clockwise is possible.

If it's '1', only counterclockwise.

If it's '?', both directions are possible.

So, for each throw, I can compute the new possible positions based on the current possible positions and the throw's specifications.

Finally, after all throws, I need to collect all possible positions and output them in sorted order.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the positions are correctly calculated modulo n, since it's a circle.

Also, in the problem, player numbers are from 1 to n, but in programming, it's often easier to work with 0 to n-1 and then convert back to 1 to n.

But in the given code, it seems to be using 1 to n directly, which might lead to some off-by-one errors.

Let me check the code.

The function func_4() is where the main logic is.

It reads n, m, x.

Initial ans is set to {x}, which is correct.

Then, for each of m throws, it reads r and c.

It initializes a temporary set temp.

For each current position q in ans:

If c is '0' or '?', it adds (q + r) % n to temp.

If c is '1' or '?', it adds (q - r) % n to temp.

After processing all current positions, it sets ans to temp.

Finally, it checks if 0 is in ans, discards it, and adds n instead, because players are numbered from 1 to n, and 0 is equivalent to n in modulo n.

Then, it prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

Wait, but in the problem, player numbers are from 1 to n, so using modulo n might cause confusion because 0 corresponds to player n.

Let me see if this handling is correct.

Suppose n=6, x=2.

First throw: say r=2, c='?'

So, for q=2:

If '0' or '?', add (2+2)=4 %6=4

If '1' or '?', add (2-2)=0 %6=0, which corresponds to player 6.

So, temp={4,0}

Then, ans={4,0}, which is corrected to {4,6}.

This seems correct.

Another throw with r=2, c='?'

From q=4:

'0' or '?': 4+2=6 %6=0 -> player 6

'1' or '?': 4-2=2 %6=2 -> player 2

From q=6 (which is 0):

'0' or '?': 0+2=2 %6=2 -> player 2

'1' or '?': 0-2=-2 %6=4 -> player 4

So, temp={2,4}

Then, ans={2,4}

Another throw with r=2, c='?'

From q=2:

'0' or '?': 2+2=4 %6=4

'1' or '?': 2-2=0 %6=0 -> player 6

From q=4:

'0' or '?': 4+2=6 %6=0 -> player 6

'1' or '?': 4-2=2 %6=2 -> player 2

So, temp={2,4,6}

After correcting 0 to 6, ans={2,4,6}

Which matches the first test case's output.

So, this seems correct.

But I need to make sure that this approach works in general.

Is there any case where this might fail?

Let me think about negative numbers in modulo.

In Python, negative numbers modulo n give a result between 0 and n-1, so (q - r) % n is safe.

But in some programming languages, negative modulo might behave differently, but in Python, it's fine.

Also, the correction of 0 to n is necessary because players are numbered from 1 to n.

I need to ensure that 0 is never present in the final answer, which the code does by discarding 0 and adding n.

Let me consider another test case.

Suppose n=12, m=1, x=2

Throw: r=3, c='1'

So, only counterclockwise.

From q=2:

q - r = 2 - 3 = -1 %12=11

So, ans={11}

Which matches the second test case's output.

Another test case: n=10, m=7, x=4

Throws:

1. r=2, c='?'

2. r=9, c='1'

3. r=4, c='?'

4. r=7, c='0'

5. r=2, c='0'

6. r=8, c='1'

7. r=5, c='?'

I need to simulate this step by step.

Initial ans={4}

Throw 1: r=2, c='?'

From q=4:

q+2=6 %10=6

q-2=2 %10=2

temp={2,6}

ans={2,6}

Throw 2: r=9, c='1'

Only counterclockwise.

From q=2:

q - 9 = -7 %10=3

From q=6:

q - 9 = -3 %10=7

temp={3,7}

ans={3,7}

Throw 3: r=4, c='?'

From q=3:

q+4=7 %10=7

q-4=-1 %10=9

From q=7:

q+4=11 %10=1

q-4=3 %10=3

temp={1,3,7,9}

ans={1,3,7,9}

Throw 4: r=7, c='0'

Only clockwise.

From q=1:

q+7=8 %10=8

From q=3:

q+7=10 %10=0 ->10

From q=7:

q+7=14 %10=4

From q=9:

q+7=16 %10=6

temp={4,6,8,10}

ans={4,6,8,10}

Throw 5: r=2, c='0'

Only clockwise.

From q=4:

q+2=6 %10=6

From q=6:

q+2=8 %10=8

From q=8:

q+2=10 %10=0 ->10

From q=10:

q+2=12 %10=2

temp={2,6,8,10}

ans={2,6,8,10}

Throw 6: r=8, c='1'

Only counterclockwise.

From q=2:

q-8=-6 %10=4

From q=6:

q-8=-2 %10=8

From q=8:

q-8=0 %10=0 ->10

From q=10:

q-8=2 %10=2

temp={2,4,8,10}

ans={2,4,8,10}

Throw 7: r=5, c='?'

From q=2:

q+5=7 %10=7

q-5=-3 %10=7

From q=4:

q+5=9 %10=9

q-5=-1 %10=9

From q=8:

q+5=13 %10=3

q-5=3 %10=3

From q=10:

q+5=15 %10=5

q-5=5 %10=5

temp={3,5,7,9}

ans={3,5,7,9}

Which matches the third test case's output.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, m=3, x=1

Throws:

1. r=4, c='0'

2. r=4, c='?'

3. r=1, c='?'

Throw 1: r=4, c='0'

From q=1:

q+4=5 %5=0 ->5

temp={5}

ans={5}

Throw 2: r=4, c='?'

From q=5:

q+4=9 %5=4

q-4=1 %5=1

temp={1,4}

ans={1,4}

Throw 3: r=1, c='?'

From q=1:

q+1=2 %5=2

q-1=0 %5=0 ->5

From q=4:

q+1=5 %5=0 ->5

q-1=3 %5=3

temp={2,3,5}

ans={2,3,5}

Which matches the fourth test case's output.

Last test case: n=4, m=1, x=1

Throw: r=2, c='?'

From q=1:

q+2=3 %4=3

q-2=-1 %4=3

temp={3}

ans={3}

But the output is 3, which seems incorrect based on this simulation.

Wait, the output should be 3, meaning player 3 has the ball.

But according to the simulation, only player 3 has the ball.

Wait, but in the problem's sample input and output, for this test case, the output is:

1

3

So, it's saying only player 3 has the ball, which matches my simulation.

Hence, the code seems correct.

I need to check if there are any edge cases where this approach might fail.

Consider n=2, m=1, x=1

Throw: r=1, c='0'

Only clockwise: 1 + 1 = 2 %2=0 ->2

ans={2}

Which is correct.

Another case: n=2, m=2, x=1

Throws:

1. r=1, c='0'

2. r=1, c='0'

After first throw: ans={2}

After second throw: 2 + 1 = 3 %2=1

ans={1}

Which is correct.

Another edge case: n=3, m=2, x=1

Throws:

1. r=1, c='?'

2. r=1, c='?'

After first throw:

From q=1:

q+1=2 %3=2

q-1=0 %3=0 ->3

temp={2,3}

ans={2,3}

After second throw:

From q=2:

q+1=3 %3=0 ->3

q-1=1 %3=1

From q=3:

q+1=4 %3=1

q-1=2 %3=2

temp={1,2,3}

ans={1,2,3}

Which is correct.

Seems like the code handles these cases correctly.

Is there a case where the set becomes empty?

No, because for each throw, for each current position, at least one new position is added, depending on the direction.

Wait, if c is '0' or '1', only one direction is added.

So, it's possible that after some throws, the set becomes empty, but in the problem's constraints, it's guaranteed that at least one player can have the ball.

But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the ball is with some player after m throws.

Hence, the set won't be empty.

Also, in the code, it adds positions based on the directions, so it should be fine.

Another consideration is that n can be up to 1000, and m up to 1000, and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n*m over all test cases is at most 2*10^5, which is acceptable in terms of time constraints.

The code uses a loop over m throws, and for each throw, it processes the current set of possible positions, which in the worst case can be up to n positions.

So, overall time complexity is O(t * m * n), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Space complexity is O(n) for storing the sets, which is also fine.

I think the code is correct and handles all the cases properly.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
