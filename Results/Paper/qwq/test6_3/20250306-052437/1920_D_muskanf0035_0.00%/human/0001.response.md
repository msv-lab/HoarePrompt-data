Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Jayden has an array that starts empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. There are two types of operations:

1. Append an integer x to the end of the array.

2. Append x copies of the current array to itself.

After performing all these operations, he has some queries where he wants to know the k-th element of the final array.

First, I need to understand how the array evolves with these operations. Let's look at the first example in the problem:

Operations:

1. Append 1 to the array → array becomes [1]

2. Append 2 to the array → array becomes [1,2]

3. Append 1 copy of the current array to itself → array becomes [1,2,1,2]

4. Append 3 to the array → array becomes [1,2,1,2,3]

5. Append 3 copies of the current array to itself → array becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Queries:

- k=1: 1

- k=2: 2

- k=3: 1

- k=4: 2

- k=5: 3

- k=6: 1

- k=14: 3

- k=15: 1

- k=16: 2

- k=20: 3

So, the array can grow quite large, especially with operations that append multiple copies of itself.

Now, looking at the constraints:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 5000

- For each test case:

- Number of operations n ≤ 10^5

- Number of queries q ≤ 10^5

- Sum of n and q over all test cases ≤ 10^5

Given that n and q can be up to 10^5 and t up to 5000, but the sum of n and q over all test cases is ≤ 10^5, it's manageable.

But, if we try to simulate building the array for each operation, it could be problematic because the array can become very large, especially with operations that append x copies of the array, where x can be up to 10^9.

So, directly building the array is not feasible due to time and memory constraints.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let's think about what the operations are doing:

- Operation 1: Simply appends a single element to the array.

- Operation 2: Appends x copies of the current array to itself. This can potentially make the array much larger.

Given that, if I try to build the array step by step, it could be too slow and use too much memory, especially since x can be up to 10^9.

So, I need a way to handle these operations without actually building the entire array.

Let's consider tracking the length of the array after each operation instead of the array itself.

For operation 1, the length increases by 1.

For operation 2, the length increases by len(a) * x.

This way, I can keep track of the length of the array without storing the actual elements.

But for the queries, I need to find the k-th element in the final array.

Given that the array can be very large, I need a way to find the k-th element without constructing the entire array.

I need to find a pattern or a way to index into the array efficiently.

Let me consider how the array is built:

- Start with an empty array.

- After operation 1: [1], len=1

- After operation 2: [1,1,1], len=3 (if x=2, but in the example x=1, so [1,1])

Wait, no. In operation 2, it appends x copies of the current array to itself.

So, if a = [1], and x=1, then a becomes [1,1].

If a = [1,2], and x=1, then a becomes [1,2,1,2].

If a = [1,2,1,2,3], and x=3, then a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3].

So, it's like concatenating x times the current array to itself.

Wait, more precisely, a becomes a concatenated with x copies of a.

Wait, no. According to the problem:

"append x copies of array a to the end of array a"

So, a becomes a + a * x.

Wait, in Python, that would be a + [a[0], a[1], ..., a[-1]] * x.

But in the example, when a=[1,2], x=1, a becomes [1,2,1,2], which is a + [a], not a + a * x.

Wait, no. According to the problem:

"append x copies of array a to the end of array a. In other words, array a becomes [a, underbrace{a,...,a}_{x}]"

Wait, in Python list terms, it's like a.extend([a]*x), but that would make a list of lists.

But according to the example, it's flattening it.

Wait, in the example, when a=[1,2], x=1, a becomes [1,2,1,2], which is a + a.

If x=2, it would be a + a + a.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "append x copies of array a to the end of array a". So, it's concatenating x copies of a to the end of a.

So, in code, it's a += a * x.

Wait, but in the example, when x=1, a=[1,2] becomes [1,2,1,2], which is a + a.

When x=3, a=[1,2,1,2,3] becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is a + a + a.

So, yes, a += a * x.

Got it.

But building the array this way would be inefficient if x is large, because it would create very large arrays.

So, I need a way to handle this without building the entire array.

Let me think about how the array is constructed.

Let's consider that each operation can be represented as a transformation on the array.

For operation 1, it's just appending a single element.

For operation 2, it's appending x copies of the current array.

I need to find a way to represent the final array as a result of these operations, without actually constructing it.

One idea is to keep track of the structure of the array in terms of segments that are repeated.

For example, after operation 1: [1]

After operation 2 with x=1: [1,1,1]

Wait, but according to the example, it's [1,1], not [1,1,1].

Wait, no. In the first example, operation 2 with x=1 on [1,2] results in [1,2,1,2], which is a + a.

So, a += a * x.

Hence, for x=1, it's a += a.

For x=2, it's a += a * 2, and so on.

So, in general, operation 2 with x appends x copies of a to itself.

Now, the problem is that if x is large, say x=10^9, and a is large, building the array is impractical.

So, I need a way to represent the array in terms of its structure.

One approach is to keep track of the base elements and the repetition factors.

This seems similar to how we handle string expansions or fractal structures.

Another idea is to track the length of the array after each operation and, for queries, find out which part of the array the k-th element belongs to.

Given that, perhaps I can keep a list of segments, where each segment represents a part of the array that was added by an operation.

Wait, but operations are interleaved, and operation 2 depends on the current state of the array.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider building a list that represents the array, but instead of storing the actual elements, store segments that represent either single elements or repetitions of previous segments.

For example:

- Operation 1: append element 1 → [1]

- Operation 1: append element 2 → [1,2]

- Operation 2: append 1 copy of current array → [1,2,1,2]

- Operation 1: append element 3 → [1,2,1,2,3]

- Operation 2: append 3 copies of current array → [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

In this representation, operation 2 is effectively saying to repeat the current array x times and append it.

So, perhaps I can represent the array as a tree, where each node corresponds to an operation.

For operation 1, it's a leaf node with the element.

For operation 2, it's an internal node that repeats the subtree x times.

Then, to find the k-th element, I can traverse this tree and find which element corresponds to the k-th position.

But building such a tree explicitly would still be too slow for large x and large k.

I need a way to represent this implicitly.

Another idea is to keep track of the length of the array after each operation and, for operation 2, record that the array is repeated x times.

Then, for queries, given k, I can map k to the corresponding position in the base array before the repetition.

Wait, perhaps I can keep a list of (length, operation) pairs, where each operation is either adding an element or repeating the array.

Then, for each query, I can binary search on the cumulative lengths to find out which operation's part the k-th element belongs to.

But I need to handle the repetition properly.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the final length of the array and then, for each query, find out which part of the operations contributed to that position.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I keep track of the length of the array after each operation.

For operation 1, length += 1

For operation 2, length += length * x

Then, I can have a list of lengths after each operation.

But for queries, I need to find the k-th element in this final array.

Given that the array can be very large, I need a way to find the k-th element efficiently without constructing the array.

An idea is to work backwards from the final array to the initial operations to determine which element corresponds to k.

I can think of the array as being built by applying operations in sequence, and each operation can either add a single element or repeat the current array.

So, for a given k, I can find out in which part of the final array it lies and trace it back to the original operations.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me maintain a list of operations, where each operation is either:

- Type 1: add element x

- Type 2: repeat the current array x times

And keep track of the length of the array after each operation.

Then, for a query k, I can find the operation that covers the k-th position by checking the cumulative lengths.

If it's a type 1 operation, then k corresponds to that element.

If it's a type 2 operation, then k lies within the repeated part, and I need to map k back to the original array before the repetition.

Let me try to outline this in steps.

1. Initialize length = 0

2. For each operation:

a. If operation is type 1, add 1 to length

b. If operation is type 2, add (length * x) to length

3. For each query k:

a. Find the operation where the cumulative length first becomes >= k

b. If it's a type 1 operation, the k-th element is the element added in that operation

c. If it's a type 2 operation, map k back to the original array before the repetition and recurse

Wait, this seems similar to segment trees or binary indexed trees, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Let me try to see with the first example.

Operations:

1. Type 1, x=1 → length = 1, array = [1]

2. Type 1, x=2 → length = 2, array = [1,2]

3. Type 2, x=1 → length = 2 + 2*1 = 4, array = [1,2,1,2]

4. Type 1, x=3 → length = 5, array = [1,2,1,2,3]

5. Type 2, x=3 → length = 5 + 5*3 = 20, array = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Queries:

k=1: 1

k=2: 2

k=3: 1

k=4: 2

k=5: 3

k=6: 1

k=14: 3

k=15: 1

k=16: 2

k=20: 3

Let's try to find, for example, k=14.

After operation 5, length=20.

Operation 5 is type 2, x=3, so it appends 3 copies of the previous array (length=5), so it appends [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, the original array before operation 5 was [1,2,1,2,3]

After operation 5, it becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, positions 1 to 5: original array

Positions 6 to 10: copy 1

Positions 11 to 15: copy 2

Positions 16 to 20: copy 3

So, k=14 is in copy 3, position 14-15=9, which is position 14-15=9 in the original array, which is position 14-15=9-5=4 in the copy.

Wait, let's see:

Positions 1-5: original [1,2,1,2,3]

Positions 6-10: copy 1 [1,2,1,2,3]

Positions 11-15: copy 2 [1,2,1,2,3]

Positions 16-20: copy 3 [1,2,1,2,3]

So, k=14 is in copy 3, position 14-15=9, which corresponds to position 9 in the original array.

Wait, no.

Wait, positions 1-5: original

positions 6-10: copy 1

positions 11-15: copy 2

positions 16-20: copy 3

So, k=14 is in copy 3, position 14-15=9, which is position 9-5=4 in the copy.

Wait, no.

Wait, positions 1-5: original

positions 6-10: copy 1

positions 11-15: copy 2

positions 16-20: copy 3

So, k=14 is in copy 3, position 14-15=9, which is position 9-5=4 in the copy.

So, position 4 in the original array is 2.

But according to the example, k=14 is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the example, k=14 is 3, but according to my calculation, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm mapping the positions.

Let me think again.

After operation 5, the array is:

[1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, positions:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:2

13:1

14:2

15:3

16:1

17:2

18:1

19:2

20:3

So, k=14 is 2, but in the example output, it's 3.

Wait, no, in the example output, for k=14, it's 3.

Wait, but according to the array I constructed, k=14 should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the array.

Wait, in operation 5, it says to append x=3 copies of the current array.

Current array before operation 5 is [1,2,1,2,3]

So, appending 3 copies of [1,2,1,2,3] to itself.

So, after operation 5, a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Wait, but in the example, it shows a becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the problem description, for the first test case, after operation 5, a is:

[1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, it's appending 3 copies, making it 4 copies in total.

Wait, no, operation 2 is to append x copies of the current array to itself.

So, if a is [1,2,1,2,3], and x=3, then a becomes a + [1,2,1,2,3]*3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, yes, 4 sets of [1,2,1,2,3], totaling 20 elements.

So, k=14 is the 14th element in this array.

Looking at the positions:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:2

13:1

14:2

15:3

16:1

17:2

18:1

19:2

20:3

So, according to this, k=14 should be 2, but in the example output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, looking back at the problem's sample output, for the first test case, the output is:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3

Wait, for k=1 to 10:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:3

9:1

10:3

Wait, but according to my earlier array, positions 1-20 are:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:2

13:1

14:2

15:3

16:1

17:2

18:1

19:2

20:3

So, for k=8, it should be 1, but in the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the array is built.

Wait, in operation 5, it says to append x=3 copies of the current array.

So, if a is [1,2,1,2,3], then a += [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, the final a is [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

But in the problem description, it says:

After the fifth operation a = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

Wait, that's 20 elements, which would be 4 copies of [1,2,1,2,3].

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the problem description, it says:

"After the fifth operation a = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]"

So, that's 4 copies of [1,2,1,2,3], which would mean x=3 copies appended, making it 4 in total.

So, a += a * x, where x=3.

Hence, a becomes a + [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

But the problem says it's [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is 4 copies.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the operation.

Wait, the problem says:

"append x copies of array a to the end of array a"

So, a += a * x

Hence, if a = [1,2,1,2,3], and x=3, then a += [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

But the problem says it becomes [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], which is a + a * x = [1,2,1,2,3] + [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, it seems that a += a * x appends x copies of a to itself.

Hence, the final a has len(a) + x * len(a) elements.

Wait, but in the sample output, for k=8, it's 3, but according to my earlier mapping, it should be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the array construction.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions.

Let's list the array after operation 5:

[1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, positions:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:1

9:2

10:3

11:1

12:2

13:1

14:2

15:3

16:1

17:2

18:1

19:2

20:3

Wait, but in the sample output, for k=8, it's 3, but according to this, it should be 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the problem's sample output:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3

Wait, for k=1 to 10:

1:1

2:2

3:1

4:2

5:3

6:1

7:2

8:3

9:1

10:3

Wait, but according to the array I have:

positions 1-5: [1,2,1,2,3]

positions 6-10: [1,2,1,2,3]

positions 11-15: [1,2,1,2,3]

positions 16-20: [1,2,1,2,3]

So, k=8 should be the 8th element, which is 1, but the sample output says 3 for k=8.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the operation.

Wait, perhaps operation 2 appends x copies of the current array, but not including the original array.

Wait, the problem says:

"append x copies of array a to the end of array a"

So, it's a += [a] * x

Hence, a becomes a + a * x

So, in the first test case, after operation 5:

a = [1,2,1,2,3] + [1,2,1,2,3] * 3 = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]

So, positions
