Alright, I've got this problem to check if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description. The problem is about determining whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it's supposed to handle multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what a stair and a peak are according to the problem. A stair is defined as a sequence where a < b < c, meaning each digit is larger than the previous one. A peak is defined as a sequence where a < b > c, meaning the middle digit is larger than both the first and the third digits. Anything that doesn't fit these criteria should be classified as NONE.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This function seems to be designed to handle multiple test cases based on the input value `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits a, b, and c, and then checks the conditions for stair and peak as described.

Let's break down the program step by step to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**

   - The first input is `n`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits a, b, c using `map(int, input().split())`.

   This seems correct. It assumes that each test case is provided on a separate line with three space-separated digits.

2. **Condition Checks:**

   - It first checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c`. If this is true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If neither of these conditions is satisfied, it prints 'NONE'.

   Let's verify these conditions against the definitions:

   - For a stair: `a < b < c`. This matches the first condition.
   - For a peak: `a < b > c`. This matches the second condition.

   So, the conditions seem to correctly implement the definitions provided.

3. **Edge Cases:**

   - All digits equal: For example, a = b = c = 0. According to the conditions:
     - `a < b < c` is False.
     - `a < b and b > c` is False (since a = b and b = c).
     - Hence, it should print 'NONE', which is correct.
   - Other non-stair, non-peak cases:
     - a > b < c: For example, 3 2 1. This doesn't satisfy either condition, so 'NONE' is correct.
     - a < b == c: For example, 1 2 2. Not a stair or peak, so 'NONE' is correct.
     - a == b < c: For example, 2 2 3. Doesn't satisfy stair or peak conditions, so 'NONE' is correct.

   It seems the program handles these cases correctly.

4. **Multiple Test Cases:**

   - The program uses a loop to handle multiple test cases based on the input value `n`.
   - It reads `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading inputs and printing results for each test case.
   - This aligns with the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

5. **Input Validation:**

   - The problem states that inputs are valid, consisting of three digits between 0 and 9, inclusive.
   - Therefore, no additional validation is needed in the program.

6. **Output Format:**

   - The program prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

7. **Example Verification:**

   - Let's verify the program's output against the provided example:

     Input:

     7

     1 2 3

     3 2 1

     1 5 3

     3 4 1

     0 0 0

     4 1 7

     4 5 7

     Expected Output:

     STAIR

     NONE

     PEAK

     PEAK

     NONE

     NONE

     STAIR

     Let's see what the program would output for each test case:

     - 1 2 3: a < b < c → STAIR

     - 3 2 1: not a stair; a < b is False, so neither stair nor peak → NONE

     - 1 5 3: a < b and b > c → PEAK

     - 3 4 1: a < b and b > c → PEAK

     - 0 0 0: not stair or peak → NONE

     - 4 1 7: a < b is False, so neither → NONE

     - 4 5 7: a < b < c → STAIR

     This matches the expected output.

Given this analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It handles multiple test cases, correctly identifies stairs and peaks, and handles other cases appropriately.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
