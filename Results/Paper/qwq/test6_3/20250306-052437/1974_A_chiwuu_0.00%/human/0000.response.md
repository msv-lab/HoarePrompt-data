Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5x3=15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1 cells and others are 2x2 cells. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a square of four cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, obviously.

The task is to figure out the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons, given the numbers of each type of application.

First, I need to understand how to optimize the placement of these icons to minimize the number of screens used. Since 2x2 icons take up more space, I should try to place as many of them as possible on the screens first, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

Let me think about the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns, so:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four consecutive cells in a square. For example, cells 1,2,4,5 or cells 2,3,5,6, and so on. But given the grid's dimensions, not all arrangements might be possible. I need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Let's try to visualize or sketch this grid:

Let's draw the grid:

```

+---+---+---+

| 1 | 2 | 3 |

+---+---+---+

| 4 | 5 | 6 |

+---+---+---+

| 7 | 8 | 9 |

+---+---+---+

|10 |11 |12 |

+---+---+---+

|13|14 |15 |

+---+---+---+

```

Now, where can I place a 2x2 icon? Let's see:

- Top-left: cells 1,2,4,5

- Top-middle: cells 2,3,5,6

- Middle-left: cells 4,5,7,8

- Middle-middle: cells 5,6,8,9

- Bottom-left: cells 7,8,10,11

- Bottom-middle: cells 8,9,11,12

- Top-left again, but shifted: cells 10,11,13,14

- And so on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen without overlapping.

Looking at the grid, a 2x2 icon takes up a block of four cells. Given the screen is 5 rows by 3 columns, let's see how many such blocks can be placed.

If I place one 2x2 icon in the top-left corner (cells 1,2,4,5), then another one can be placed in the top-middle (cells 2,3,5,6), but that would overlap with the first one. So, I need to place them without overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of non-overlapping positions.

Let me see: in a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 squares can be placed?

Let's consider the positions:

- First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

- Second 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

- Third 2x2: cells 3,6,9,12

Wait, but placing them like this might not be possible due to overlapping or grid constraints.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total area and see how many icons can fit.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, for y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, total cells used would be 4y + x.

But, since each screen has 15 cells, the minimum number of screens needed would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But, it's not that simple because of the grid structure and the way 2x2 icons are placed.

For example, in the first test case:

x=1, y=1

So, total cells used: 4*1 + 1*1 = 5 cells.

But, according to the example, it's possible to fit them into one screen.

Similarly, in the second test case:

x=7, y=2

Total cells: 4*2 + 7*1 = 8 + 7 = 15 cells, which fits perfectly into one screen.

But in the third test case:

x=12, y=4

Total cells: 4*4 + 12*1 = 16 + 12 = 28 cells.

Each screen has 15 cells, so 28 / 15 = 1.866, which would round up to 2 screens.

But, we need to confirm if it's possible to arrange them in such a way that it fits into 2 screens.

Similarly, for x=0, y=3:

Total cells: 4*3 = 12 cells.

Which would fit into one screen, but according to the example, it's 2 screens.

Wait, that's interesting. So, perhaps there's a constraint in how the 2x2 icons are placed.

Looking back at the example outputs:

For x=0, y=3, output is 2 screens.

So, even though 4*3=12 cells, which is less than 15, it still requires 2 screens.

Probably because of the grid arrangement; maybe you can't place three 2x2 icons on a single screen due to overlapping or grid limitations.

Let me try to place three 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

Attempt to place them:

First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

Second 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

Third 2x2: cells 3,6,9,12

Wait, but cell 6 is used in both the first and third icons, which is overlapping.

Alternatively, try different positions.

First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

Second 2x2: cells 3,6,9,12

Third 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

This seems non-overlapping.

But, looking at cell 7: used in third icon.

Cell 8: used in third icon.

Cell 10: used in third icon.

Cell 11: used in third icon.

But, are there any overlaps?

Wait, in this arrangement:

- First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

- Second 2x2: cells 3,6,9,12

- Third 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

No overlaps, and all cells are used except cells 13,14,15.

So, it's possible to place three 2x2 icons on one screen, using cells 1-12, leaving cells 13-15 empty.

But according to the example, for x=0 and y=3, it's 2 screens.

Wait, maybe the icons can't overlap in a way that their cells are shared.

Or perhaps there's a different constraint.

Wait, perhaps the 2x2 icons must be placed in positions where their squares are intact, meaning their four cells are contiguous.

In the above arrangement, all three 2x2 icons are placed without overlapping, but perhaps the positions are not allowed due to grid limitations.

Let me try to visualize this.

If I place the first 2x2 in cells 1,2,4,5, that's the top-left corner.

Then, placing the second 2x2 in cells 3,6,9,12, which is the top-right, middle-right, and bottom-right.

Then, placing the third 2x2 in cells 7,8,10,11, which is the middle-left to bottom-left.

Visually, this seems okay, no overlaps.

But according to the example, it seems that placing three 2x2 icons requires two screens.

Maybe the arrangement isn't possible due to some overlapping or grid constraints that I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the icons are placed affects the available space for 1x1 icons.

But in this case, since x=0, only 2x2 icons are present.

Wait, perhaps the screen can only hold a certain number of 2x2 icons due to their positions.

Looking back at the note, it mentions that for x=0 and y=3, it's possible to fit them into two screens.

So, perhaps in one screen, only two 2x2 icons can be placed, and the third needs a separate screen.

Let me try to see.

If I place two 2x2 icons per screen, that would use 8 cells per screen, leaving 7 cells unused.

But that seems inefficient, but perhaps due to grid constraints, that's the maximum that can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the 2x2 icons cannot overlap, and their placements are constrained by the grid.

Given that, perhaps in a 5x3 grid, only two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

For example:

First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

Second 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

Now, if I try to place a third 2x2 icon, say in cells 3,6,9,12, but cell 9 is adjacent to cells 8 and 12, which are already used.

Wait, but in the previous arrangement, it seemed possible, but perhaps there's a restriction I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2x2 icons cannot share edges or something like that.

Given the confusion, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of screens based on the total cell requirement, but also considering the grid constraints for placing the 2x2 icons.

An alternative approach is to prioritize placing the 2x2 icons first, determining how many screens are needed just for them, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for x=0 and y=3, it's 2 screens, which aligns with needing two screens for three 2x2 icons.

Similarly, for x=1 and y=1, it's one screen.

Let me see:

For y 2x2 icons, each taking 4 cells, but due to grid constraints, only a certain number can be placed per screen.

From the example, it seems that per screen, a maximum of two 2x2 icons can be placed.

Because for y=3, it's two screens, implying two icons per screen.

Wait, two icons per screen would be 8 cells, and the screen has 15 cells.

But in the arrangement earlier, three icons can be placed without overlapping, using 12 cells.

But according to the example, it's two screens needed, so perhaps only two 2x2 icons per screen are allowed.

Maybe due to the way the icons are arranged, only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping or causing issues.

If that's the case, then the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y/2).

Then, for the x 1x1 icons, we need to see how many screens are needed beyond that.

Wait, but in the example where x=12 and y=4, the output is two screens.

So, y=4, ceil(4/2)=2 screens for the 2x2 icons.

Then, x=12, each screen has 15-8=7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

So, 12 icons need ceil(12/7)=2 screens.

Which matches the example output of two screens.

Similarly, for x=0 and y=3, ceil(3/2)=2 screens.

Again matches the example.

For x=1 and y=1, ceil(1/2)=1 screen, and 15-4=11 cells left for 1x1 icons, which can fit the additional x=1 icon.

So, this seems consistent.

Therefore, the approach is:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

2. Calculate the remaining cells available in these screens for 1x1 icons: remaining_cells = screens_y * 15 - y * 4

3. Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed in these screens: placed_x = min(x, remaining_cells)

4. Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens: remaining_x = x - placed_x

5. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining_x icons: screens_x = ceil(remaining_x / 15)

6. The total number of screens is screens_y + screens_x

But, in the earlier step, screens_y might already be accounting for some of the x icons, so we need to make sure not to double-count.

Wait, in the first step, screens_y is ceil(y / 2), assuming that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, each such screen can hold up to 15 - 8 = 7 1x1 icons.

Wait, 8 cells are used by two 2x2 icons, leaving 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen with two 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 7 1x1 icons.

If y is odd, then one screen will have only one 2x2 icon, leaving 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for screens_y = ceil(y / 2):

- If y is even, all screens have two 2x2 icons, each providing 7 slots for 1x1 icons.

- If y is odd, (screens_y - 1) screens have two 2x2 icons (7 slots each), and one screen has one 2x2 icon (11 slots).

So, total available slots for 1x1 icons is:

If y is even:

available_x = screens_y * 7

If y is odd:

available_x = (screens_y - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, if x <= available_x, then total screens needed is screens_y.

Else, need additional screens for the remaining x icons.

Remaining_x = x - available_x

Additional screens for remaining_x: screens_x = ceil(remaining_x / 15)

Total screens: screens_y + screens_x

This seems consistent with the examples.

Let's verify with the examples:

First test case: x=1, y=1

screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

Since y is odd:

available_x = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

x=1 <= 11, so total screens = 1

Second test case: x=7, y=2

screens_y = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

y even, available_x = 1 * 7 = 7

x=7 <= 7, so total screens = 1

Third test case: x=12, y=4

screens_y = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

y even, available_x = 2 * 7 = 14

x=12 <= 14, so total screens = 2

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

screens_y = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

y odd, available_x = (2 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18

x=0 <= 18, so total screens = 2

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0

screens_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

available_x = 0 * 7 = 0

x=1 > 0, so remaining_x = 1

screens_x = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

y odd, available_x = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

x=8 <= 11, so total screens = 1

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0

screens_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

available_x = 0 * 7 = 0

x=0 <= 0, so total screens = 0

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0

screens_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

available_x = 0 * 7 = 0

x=2 > 0, so remaining_x = 2

screens_x = ceil(2 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0

screens_y = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

available_x = 0 * 7 = 0

x=15 > 0, so remaining_x = 15

screens_x = ceil(15 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

screens_y = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

y even, available_x = 1 * 7 = 7

x=8 > 7, so remaining_x = 8 - 7 = 1

screens_x = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9

screens_y = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

y odd, available_x = (5 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 4 * 7 + 11 = 28 + 11 = 39

x=0 <= 39, so total screens = 5

This matches the sample outputs provided.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b * 2

if t % 5 == 0:

t = t // 5

else:

t = t // 5 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

Wait, this seems a bit different from what I thought.

Let's analyze it step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it sets t = b * 2

Wait, why b * 2?

Then, it checks if t % 5 == 0, then t = t // 5, else t = t // 5 + 1

This seems like it's calculating ceil(b * 2 / 5), because ceil division can be achieved by (num + denom - 1) // denom.

But here, it's doing t // 5 if t % 5 == 0, else t // 5 + 1, which is equivalent to ceil(b * 2 / 5).

But why b * 2?

Wait, perhaps the programmer thought that each 2x2 icon requires space equivalent to 2 cells in some arrangement.

But that doesn't make sense, because each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Alternatively, perhaps they are considering the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

But in my earlier reasoning, I had ceil(y / 2), because each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

But here, it's ceil(b * 2 / 5), which is different.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me try to understand.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

This is the available cells for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

Then, it checks if t1 >= a, meaning if the available cells can fit all the 1x1 icons, then t remains the same.

Else, calculate t2 = a - t1, which is the remaining 1x1 icons that need screens.

Then, if t2 % 15 == 0, add t2 // 15 to t, else add t2 // 15 + 1 to t.

This seems correct for the additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons.

But the initial calculation of t seems off.

In my approach, t should be ceil(y / 2).

But here, it's ceil(b * 2 / 5).

Wait, perhaps the programmer is considering the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons differently.

Let me see what ceil(b * 2 / 5) represents.

For y=3, ceil(3 * 2 / 5) = ceil(6 / 5) = 2, which matches the sample.

For y=4, ceil(8 / 5) = 2, which seems incorrect because in my approach, it's ceil(4 / 2) = 2, and in the sample, it's two screens.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, for y=4, screens_y=2, and available_x=2*7=14, which can hold x=12 icons, matching the sample.

But here, t = ceil(8 / 5) = 2

Then, t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 30 - 16 = 14

If x=12 <=14, then t=2, which matches.

Similarly, for y=3, t=ceil(6 / 5)=2

t1=2*15 -3*4=30-12=18

x=0<=18, t=2, matches the sample.

For y=1, t=ceil(2/5)=1

t1=1*15 -1*4=15-4=11

x=1<=11, t=1, matches.

For y=2, t=ceil(4/5)=1

t1=1*15 -2*4=15-8=7

x=7<=7, t=1, matches.

For y=9, t=ceil(18/5)=4

t1=4*15 -9*4=60-36=24

x=0<=24, t=4, but in the sample, it's 5.

Wait, but in the sample, for x=0 y=9, it's 5 screens.

But according to this calculation, t=ceil(18/5)=4, t1=4*15 -9*4=60-36=24

x=0<=24, t=4, but sample output is 5.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for y=9, x=0.

It outputs 4, but the correct answer is 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

According to my earlier approach:

screens_y = ceil(y / 2) = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

available_x = (5 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 4 * 7 + 11 = 28 + 11 = 39

x=0 <=39, so total screens =5

But according to the program:

t=ceil(9*2 /5)=ceil(18/5)=4

t1=4*15 -9*4=60-36=24

x=0<=24, so t=4

Which is incorrect, as per the sample.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
