Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We are given integers n and k, and we need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, we need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of a sequence of numbers is. The bitwise OR operation takes two numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. For example, 1 | 2 is 01 | 10 = 11, which is 3 in decimal.

So, if I have a sequence of numbers, their bitwise OR is the number obtained by OR-ing all of them together bit by bit.

Our goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of this OR result. In other words, we want as many bits as possible to be 1 in the final OR-ed value.

Given that, let's think about how to achieve this.

First, observe that the OR operation sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, we need to have as many bits as possible set to 1 in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

In other words, we want to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one number having that bit set.

Given that, a straightforward approach might be to distribute the bits among the numbers in such a way that each bit is set in at least one number, while ensuring that the sum of all numbers is k.

But we need to maximize the number of bits set in the OR, not necessarily maximize the OR value itself.

Wait, actually, maximizing the number of 1s in the OR is equivalent to maximizing the number of distinct bit positions that are set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

So, the strategy should be to have as many distinct bit positions set across the sequence as possible.

Given that, one might think of setting each number to have a unique bit set, but that might not be feasible because of the sum constraint.

Wait, but if I set each number to have a unique bit set, that would maximize the number of bits in the OR, but it might not be possible because the sum has to be exactly k, and the numbers have to be non-negative integers.

Moreover, if n is larger than the number of bits in k, there might be redundancies.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers, and I need their sum to be k.

I need to maximize the number of bits set in the OR of these numbers.

To maximize the number of bits set in the OR, I need to have as many distinct bits set across the numbers as possible.

In other words, I should try to have each number set a unique set of bits, as much as possible.

But, since the sum has to be exactly k, I need to distribute the bits in such a way that their sum is k.

Wait, maybe another way to look at it is to consider the binary representation of k.

Let's say k is represented as b_m b_{m-1} ... b_1 b_0 in binary.

To maximize the number of bits set in the OR, I need to have numbers in the sequence that cover as many of these bit positions as possible.

Wait, but actually, I can have numbers that set bits higher than those in k, as long as their sum is k.

Wait, no, because numbers are non-negative integers, and their sum is k.

So, the highest bit that can be set in any number is the highest bit in k.

Wait, actually, no, I can have numbers with higher bits set, as long as their sum is k.

But, in practice, if I have a number with a higher bit set, but the sum is k, it might not help in maximizing the OR, because the higher bits might not be set in the sum.

Wait, no, the OR is not related to the sum in that way.

The OR is about the bitwise OR of the numbers, not about the sum.

So, for example, if I have numbers that have high bits set, as long as at least one number has that bit set, it will be set in the OR.

But, I need to ensure that the sum is k.

So, perhaps, to maximize the number of bits in the OR, I should try to set as many bits as possible in at least one of the numbers.

Given that, a possible strategy is to distribute the bits of k across the n numbers as much as possible.

Wait, but bits are not independent; the sum has to be exactly k.

Wait, maybe another approach: since OR is about having at least one number with each bit set to 1, I should try to set different bits in different numbers.

But, since the numbers sum to k, I need to make sure that the sum of all numbers is k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the second test case: n=2, k=3.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2]: sum is 3, OR is 1|2=3, which has two 1s in binary.

- [3,0]: sum is 3, OR is 3|0=3, which also has two 1s.

- [1,1]: sum is 2, which is less than 3. Invalid.

- [2,1]: same as [1,2].

So, in this case, both [1,2] and [3,0] are valid and give the maximum number of 1s in the OR, which is 2.

Another test case: n=2, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: OR is 5|0=5, which is 101 in binary, has two 1s.

- [1,4]: OR is 1|4=5, which is 101, two 1s.

- [3,2]: OR is 3|2=3, which is 011, two 1s.

- [4,1]: OR is 4|1=5, which is 101, two 1s.

So, in this case, all these sequences have OR with two 1s.

But is there a sequence with OR having more than two 1s?

Let's see: [a,b] such that a+b=5, and a|b has more than two 1s.

Is that possible?

Let's see: suppose a=3 (011), b=2 (010), a|b=011, which is two 1s.

a=5 (101), b=0 (000), a|b=101, two 1s.

a=4 (100), b=1 (001), a|b=101, two 1s.

a=1 (001), b=4 (100), a|b=101, two 1s.

a=2 (010), b=3 (011), a|b=011, two 1s.

So, in this case, it seems that the maximum number of 1s in the OR is two.

Hence, any of these sequences are acceptable.

Now, looking at the fourth test case: n=6, k=51.

One possible sequence is [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51, and OR is 3|1|1|32|2|12 = 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12.

Let's compute that step by step:

3 is 00011

1 is 00001

1 is 00001

32 is 100000

2 is 00010

12 is 01100

OR-ing all these: 101111, which is 47, which has five 1s in binary.

Is this the maximum?

Let's see if we can get more than five 1s.

Another sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,46], sum is 51.

OR is 1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |46.

46 is 101110.

So, OR is 101111, same as before, five 1s.

Another sequence: [31,1,1,1,1,6], sum is 31+1+1+1+1+6=41, which is less than 51.

Invalid.

Wait, need to sum to exactly 51.

Another sequence: [31,1,1,1,1,15], sum is 31+1+1+1+1+15=50, still less.

Another sequence: [31,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but n=6, can't have more than 6 numbers.

Wait, n=6.

So, perhaps [31,1,1,1,1,6], sum is 31+1+1+1+1+6=41, still less than 51.

Wait, 31 is 11111, which OR with 1 and 6 (0110) would be 11111 | 00001 | 00110 = 11111, which is 31, which has five 1s.

Same as before.

Another sequence: [15,15,15,15,1,0], sum is 15+15+15+15+1+0=61, which is more than 51.

Invalid.

Wait, perhaps [15,15,15,15,1,-14], but negative numbers are not allowed.

Wait, non-negative integers, so can't have negative numbers.

So, seems like [3,1,1,32,2,12] is a valid sequence with OR having five 1s, and it's the maximum possible.

Now, looking at the program provided:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

arr = []

if n > 1:

counter = func_1(k)

arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)

arr.append(k - arr[-1])

for _ in range(n - 2):

arr.append(0)

print(*arr)

else:

print(k)

def func_1(n):

if n == 0:

return -1

position = 0

while n != 0:

n >>= 1

position += 1

return position - 1

So, this program handles t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

If n > 1, it calls func_1(k) to get some counter, then appends 2**counter -1 to arr, and then appends k - arr[-1], and then appends 0 for the remaining n-2 numbers.

If n == 1, it just prints k.

Now, let's understand func_1.

func_1(n) returns the position of the highest set bit in n, 0-based.

For example, func_1(5) = 2, since 5 is 101, highest bit at position 2.

func_1(3) = 1, since 3 is 11, highest bit at position 1.

func_1(1) = 0.

func_1(0) = -1.

Wait, but in the code, func_1 is used to compute counter, which is then used to compute 2**counter -1.

So, for k=5, counter=2, 2**2 -1 = 3.

Then arr.append(3), and arr.append(k - 3) = 2.

So, arr = [3,2], which is one of the possible solutions for n=2, k=5.

Similarly, for k=3, counter=1, 2**1 -1=1, arr.append(1), arr.append(2), so arr=[1,2], which is correct.

For k=51, n=6, counter=func_1(51)=5 (since 51=110011, highest bit at position 5), so 2**5 -1=31, arr.append(31), arr.append(51-31)=20, and then append 0 four times.

So, arr=[31,20,0,0,0,0].

Wait, but in the example, it's [3,1,1,32,2,12], which also sums to 51 and has OR with five 1s.

But according to this program, it would output [31,20,0,0,0,0].

Let's check the OR of [31,20,0,0,0,0].

31 is 11111

20 is 10100

0 is 00000

OR: 11111 | 10100 | 00000 = 11111, which is 31, which has five 1s.

Same as the example's OR of 101111, which is 47, which also has five 1s.

So, both sequences achieve the same number of 1s in the OR.

Hence, both are acceptable solutions.

So, the program seems to be producing a correct sequence.

Now, let's see if this approach is always correct.

Let's try n=2, k=1.

According to the program:

counter = func_1(1) = 0

arr.append(2**0 -1) = 0

arr.append(1 - 0) =1

So, arr=[0,1]

Check: sum is 0+1=1, OR is 0|1=1, which has one 1 in binary. That's correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=1.

arr.append(2**0 -1)=0

arr.append(1 -0)=1

Then append 0 for n-2=1 time, so arr=[0,1,0]

Sum is 0+1+0=1, OR is 0|1|0=1, which has one 1 in binary. Correct.

Another test case: n=4, k=1.

arr.append(2**0 -1)=0

arr.append(1 -0)=1

Then append 0 for n-2=2 times, so arr=[0,1,0,0]

Sum is 1, OR is 1, which is correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=5.

Just print 5. OR is 101, which has two 1s. Correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=2.

counter = func_1(2)=1

arr.append(2**1 -1)=1

arr.append(2 -1)=1

So, arr=[1,1]

Sum is 2, OR is 1|1=1, which has one 1 in binary.

Is there a better sequence? [2,0]: sum is 2, OR is 2|0=2, which is 10 in binary, one 1.

So, both sequences have OR with one 1, which is the maximum possible.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=3, k=3.

counter = func_1(3)=1

arr.append(2**1 -1)=1

arr.append(3 -1)=2

Then append 0 for n-2=1 time, so arr=[1,2,0]

Sum is 3, OR is 1|2|0=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Is there a better sequence? [3,0,0]: sum is 3, OR is 3|0|0=3, two 1s.

Same as above.

Another sequence: [1,1,1]: sum is 3, OR is 1|1|1=1, which is one 1 in binary.

Worse than the previous ones.

Hence, the program's output is better.

Hence, correct.

Another test case: n=2, k=6.

counter = func_1(6)=2

arr.append(2**2 -1)=3

arr.append(6 -3)=3

So, arr=[3,3]

Sum is 6, OR is 3|3=3, which is 11 in binary, two 1s.

Another sequence: [1,5]: OR is 1|5=5, which is 101 in binary, two 1s.

Another sequence: [6,0]: OR is 6|0=6, which is 110 in binary, two 1s.

All achieve the same number of 1s in OR.

Hence, correct.

Seems like the program is producing correct sequences for various test cases.

But, is this approach always optimal?

Let's try to understand what the program is doing.

It computes counter as the position of the highest set bit in k.

Then, it sets the first number to be 2^counter -1, which is a number with the first counter bits set to 1.

Then, it sets the second number to be k - (2^counter -1).

And sets the remaining numbers to 0.

Now, the OR of these numbers would be the OR of (2^counter -1) and (k - (2^counter -1)) and 0s.

Since OR with 0 doesn't change the value, the OR is effectively (2^counter -1) | (k - (2^counter -1)).

We need to see if this maximizes the number of 1s in the OR.

Let's see what (2^counter -1) looks like.

2^counter is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to k.

Wait, no, func_1(k) returns the position of the highest set bit in k, so 2^counter is the value of the highest set bit in k.

So, 2^counter -1 is a number with all bits set up to (but not including) the highest set bit of k.

For example, if k=5 (101), counter=2, 2^2 -1=3 (011).

Then, k - (2^counter -1) = 5 - 3 = 2 (010).

OR of 3 and 2 is 3|2=3 (011), which has two 1s.

Is this the maximum possible?

Another sequence: [5,0], OR is 5|0=5 (101), which has two 1s.

Another sequence: [1,4], OR is 1|4=5 (101), two 1s.

Another sequence: [3,2], OR is 3|2=3 (011), two 1s.

So, in this case, all these sequences have OR with two 1s, which is the maximum possible.

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

Another example: k=7, n=2.

counter = func_1(7)=2 (since 7 is 111, highest bit at position 2)

2^2 -1=3 (011)

k - 3=4 (100)

OR is 3|4=7 (111), which has three 1s.

Is this the maximum?

Another sequence: [7,0], OR is 7|0=7 (111), three 1s.

Another sequence: [1,6], OR is 1|6=7 (111), three 1s.

Another sequence: [3,4], OR is 3|4=7 (111), three 1s.

So, again, the program's approach achieves the maximum.

Another example: k=8, n=2.

counter=func_1(8)=3 (since 8 is 1000)

2^3 -1=7 (0111)

k -7=1 (0001)

OR is 7|1=7 (0111), which has three 1s.

Is there a better sequence?

[8,0]: OR is 8|0=8 (1000), one 1.

[4,4]: OR is 4|4=4 (0100), one 1.

[2,6]: OR is 2|6=6 (0110), two 1s.

[1,7]: OR is 1|7=7 (0111), three 1s.

[3,5]: OR is 3|5=7 (0111), three 1s.

So, the program's output [7,1] has OR with three 1s, which is better than [8,0] which has only one 1 in OR.

Hence, the program's approach seems better.

Wait, but in this case, [7,1] has OR with three 1s, while [3,5] also has OR with three 1s.

But the program only outputs [7,1].

Is [7,1] acceptable? Yes, because it maximizes the number of 1s in OR.

Hence, correct.

Another example: k=9, n=2.

counter=func_1(9)=3 (since 9 is 1001)

2^3 -1=7 (0111)

k-7=2 (0010)

OR is 7|2=7 (0111), three 1s.

Another sequence: [9,0], OR is 9|0=9 (1001), two 1s.

Another sequence: [1,8], OR is 1|8=9 (1001), two 1s.

Another sequence: [3,6], OR is 3|6=7 (0111), three 1s.

So, again, the program's approach achieves the better OR.

Hence, it seems that the program's approach is correct.

But, let's think about why this approach works.

The idea seems to be to set the first number to have the lowest possible bits set, up to the highest set bit in k minus one, and then set the second number to be the remainder.

This way, the OR will have the bits set from both numbers.

In the case where k has consecutive low bits set, this approach still works.

For example, k=7 (111), counter=2, 2^2 -1=3 (011), k-3=4 (100), OR=7 (111).

Another example: k=15 (1111), counter=3, 2^3 -1=7 (0111), k-7=8 (1000), OR=15 (1111).

Seems consistent.

Even for k=16 (10000), counter=4, 2^4 -1=15 (01111), k-15=1 (00001), OR=15|1=15 (01111), four 1s.

Another sequence: [16,0], OR=16|0=16 (10000), one 1.

Another sequence: [8,8], OR=8|8=8 (1000), one 1.

Another sequence: [1,15], OR=1|15=15 (01111), four 1s.

So, again, the program's approach is better.

Hence, it seems that this approach maximizes the number of 1s in the OR.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

## Approach

1. **Bitwise OR Maximization**: The bitwise OR of a set of numbers sets a bit in the result to 1 if at least one number in the set has that bit set to 1. To maximize the number of 1s in this OR operation, we need to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one number having those bits set.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For `n = 1`, the only possible sequence is `[k]`.
   - For `n > 1`, we aim to set the first number to have the lowest possible bits set up to the highest set bit in `k` minus one, and the second number to be the remainder of `k`. The remaining numbers in the sequence are set to 0.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function determines the position of the highest set bit in `k`, which helps in constructing the first number of the sequence.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
  3. If `n == 1`, directly print `k` as the sole element of the sequence.
  4. If `n > 1`:
     - Determine the position of the highest set bit in `k` using `func_1`.
     - Create the first element of the sequence as `(2 ** counter) - 1`, which sets the lowest `counter` bits to 1.
     - Set the second element to `k - arr[0]`.
     - Set the remaining `n-2` elements to 0.
  5. Print the sequence for each test case.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Computes the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
  - Returns `-1` if `n` is 0.
  - Uses bit shifting to determine the position.

This approach ensures that the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while summing to `k`.

            arr.append(0)

    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

  2. For each test case, read `n` and `k`.

     - Determine the position of the highest set bit in `k` using `func_1`.
     - Create the first element of the sequence as `(2 ** counter) - 1`, which sets the lowest `counter` bits to 1.
     - Set the second element to `k - arr[0]`.
     - Set the remaining `n-2` elements to 0.
  5. Print the sequence for each test case.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Computes the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
  - Returns `-1` if `n` is 0.
  - Uses bit shifting to determine the position.

This approach ensures that the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while summing to `k`.

  1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
  3. If `n == 1`, directly print `k` as the sole element of the sequence.
  4. If `n > 1`:
     - Determine the position of the highest set bit in `k` using `func_1`.
     - Create the first element of the sequence as `(2 ** counter) - 1`, which sets the lowest `counter` bits to 1.
     - Set the second element to `k - arr[0]`.
     - Set the remaining `n-2` elements to 0.
  5. Print the sequence for each test case.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Computes the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
  - Returns `-1` if `n` is 0.
  - Uses bit shifting to determine the position.

This approach ensures that the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while summing to `k`.

## Final Solution Code

To solve this problem, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Approach

1. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The bitwise OR of a set of numbers sets a bit in the result to 1 if at least one number in the set has that bit set to 1.
   - To maximize the number of 1s in this OR operation, we need to cover as many bit positions as possible with at least one number having those bits set.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For `n = 1`, the only possible sequence is `[k]`.
   - For `n > 1`, set the first number to have the lowest possible bits set up to the highest set bit in `k` minus one, and the second number to be the remainder of `k`. The remaining numbers in the sequence are set to 0.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Determines the position of the highest set bit in `k`, which helps in constructing the first number of the sequence.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
