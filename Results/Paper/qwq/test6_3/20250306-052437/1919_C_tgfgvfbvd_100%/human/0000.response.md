Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array has to be in either s or t, but they don't have to be contiguous. A subsequence means that I can pick elements in their original order, skipping some if I want.

The penalty for a subsequence b is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, if b = [1, 3, 2], then p(b) = 1 because 3 < 2. Makes sense.

My goal is to split the array into s and t such that the sum of their penalties, p(s) + p(t), is minimized. I need to find the minimum possible penalty.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a penalty in a subsequence. The penalty counts the number of decreases in the subsequence. So, for s and t separately, I want to minimize the number of times a element is followed by a smaller one.

Wait, but minimizing p(s) + p(t) means minimizing the total number of decreases across both subsequences. But the problem seems to be about minimizing the increases instead, because in the example, for the first test case, with a = [1,2,3,4,5], the output is 3, which is the number of increases in one subsequence.

Wait, no. In the first test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5], and the output is 3. If I take s = [2,4,5] and t = [1,3], then p(s) = 2 (2<4,4<5) and p(t) = 1 (1<3), so p(s)+p(t)=3.

But if I think about it differently, in a strictly increasing subsequence, p(s) would be len(s)-1, since every element is less than the next one.

So, in the first test case, if I take s = [1,2,3,4,5], which is strictly increasing, then p(s) = 4, and t is empty, p(t) = 0, so total penalty is 4. But the output is 3, which is less than 4, so it's better to split the sequence.

Hmm, so splitting can help reduce the total penalty by distributing the increases across multiple subsequences.

Wait, but in the second test case, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], output is 1. So, with s = [8,3,1] and t = [2,1,7,4,3], p(s) = 0 (since 8>3>1) and p(t) = 1 (maybe from 1<7).

So, in this case, splitting helps because if I take the entire array as one subsequence, there would be more increases.

Wait, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

If s = [8,3,1], which is decreasing, so p(s) = 0.

t = [2,1,7,4,3], which has one increase: 1<7.

So, total penalty is 0 + 1 = 1.

If I didn't split, and took s = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], then p(s) would be the number of times an element is less than the next one.

Looking at s: 8<2? No, 2<3? Yes, 3<1? No, 1<1? No, 1<7? Yes, 7<4? No, 4<3? No.

So, p(s) = 2 (2<3 and 1<7).

So, by splitting, I reduced the penalty from 2 to 1.

In the third test case, a = [3,3,3,3,3], output is 0.

If I take s = [] and t = [3,3,3,3,3], then p(t) = 0, since no element is less than the next one.

Similarly, any subsequence that is non-decreasing will have p(s) equal to the number of increases in s.

Wait, but in this case, since all elements are equal, any subsequence will have p(s) = 0.

So, the minimal penalty is 0, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, n=1, a=[1], output is 0.

Well, with only one element, p(s) is 0 regardless.

In the fifth test case, a=[2,1], output is 0.

If s=[2], t=[1], p(s)=0, p(t)=0.

Alternatively, s=[2,1], p(s)=0.

So, minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that splitting the sequence can help reduce the total penalty by avoiding increases in individual subsequences.

So, the strategy is to split the sequence into two subsequences such that each subsequence has as few increases as possible.

Alternatively, since p(s) counts the number of increases in s, to minimize p(s)+p(t), I need to maximize the number of decreases in s and t combined.

Wait, no. Because p(s) counts increases, so minimizing p(s)+p(t) means minimizing the total number of increases in both subsequences.

To minimize the total number of increases, I should maximize the number of decreases, because each decrease doesn't contribute to the penalty.

So, perhaps I should split the sequence into two decreasing subsequences.

Wait, but in the first test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5], which is increasing, so it's hard to make decreasing subsequences.

In that case, splitting it into two subsequences, each as decreasing as possible, would minimize the increases.

For example, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], then p(s) = 2 (1<3,3<5), p(t) = 1 (2<4), total penalty 3.

Alternatively, s = [1,2,3], t = [4,5], p(s)=2, p(t)=1, total penalty 3.

Same as in the example.

Is there a better way? What if I split s = [1,3], t = [2,4,5], p(s)=1, p(t)=2, total penalty 3.

No improvement.

Alternatively, s = [1,4], t = [2,3,5], p(s)=1, p(t)=2, total penalty 3.

Same.

Seems like 3 is the minimal penalty for the first test case.

In the second test case, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], output is 1.

In this array, there are some increases and decreases.

By splitting into s = [8,3,1] and t = [2,1,7,4,3], p(s)=0, p(t)=1.

Alternatively, s = [8,2,1], t = [3,1,7,4,3], p(s)=0, p(t)=1.

Same penalty.

Is there a way to get a lower penalty, like 0? If I can split such that both s and t are non-increasing, but that might not be possible.

Wait, in the third test case, a = [3,3,3,3,3], output is 0, which makes sense because the array is non-decreasing, and I can put it all in one subsequence with p(s)=0.

In the fifth test case, a = [2,1], output is 0. I can put s=[2], t=[1], both non-increasing.

So, the minimal penalty is 0.

From this, I think the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times an element is less than the next one, minus the maximum number of such increases that can be assigned to one subsequence.

Wait, that seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two subsequences, s and t.

Each increase in s or t contributes to the penalty.

So, to minimize the total penalty, I need to distribute the increases between s and t in such a way that the total number of increases is minimized.

Alternatively, since each increase must be in either s or t, and I can choose which subsequence to put each increase in, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the minimal number of increases that cannot be eliminated by splitting.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to split the array such that in each subsequence, the number of increases is minimized.

One approach could be to build two decreasing subsequences.

Because in a decreasing subsequence, there are no increases.

Wait, in a decreasing subsequence, p(s) = 0, since no b_i < b_{i+1}.

So, if I can split the array into two decreasing subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

But that might not always be possible.

In the first test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5], it's impossible to split into two decreasing subsequences because each subsequence would have to be decreasing, but the entire sequence is increasing.

In that case, I have to accept some increases.

Similarly, in the second test case, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], I can make s = [8,3,1] and t = [2,1,7,4,3], where s is decreasing, so p(s)=0, and t has one increase (1<7), so p(t)=1, total penalty 1.

Is this the minimal possible?

Yes, because if I try to make t decreasing, I have to deal with 2<7, which is an increase.

So, I have to put 7 in a subsequence where it's not increasing.

Wait, no, I can put 7 in a different subsequence.

Wait, s = [8,2,1,1,3], t = [3,7,4,3], p(s)=0, p(t)=1 (3<7).

Same total penalty.

Alternatively, s = [8,3,7], t = [2,1,1,4,3], p(s)=0, p(t)=1.

Still same.

Seems like 1 is the minimal penalty.

In the third test case, a = [3,3,3,3,3], I can put all elements in one subsequence, say s = [3,3,3,3,3], p(s)=0, t = [], p(t)=0, total penalty 0.

In the fourth test case, n=1, a=[1], I can put it in s or t, p(s)=0 or p(t)=0, total penalty 0.

In the fifth test case, a=[2,1], I can put s=[2], t=[1], p(s)=0, p(t)=0, total penalty 0.

Alternatively, s=[2,1], p(s)=0, total penalty 0.

So, in general, I need to split the array into two subsequences such that each subsequence is as decreasing as possible.

But it's not always possible to make both subsequences decreasing, especially if there are increasing elements.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of increases that I have to accept across both subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as finding a maximum number of decreases that can be assigned to one subsequence.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array and decide for each element whether to put it in s or t.

I want to minimize the total number of increases in s and t.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to maximize the number of decreases in s and t combined.

Because each decrease doesn't contribute to the penalty.

So, the more decreases I have, the fewer increases I have to account for.

Wait, but in reality, the total number of potential increases is fixed based on the array.

Wait, no.

Actually, the total number of positions where a_i < a_{i+1} is fixed.

But when I split the array into s and t, each such position where a_i < a_{i+1} must be assigned to either s or t, depending on which subsequence a_i and a_{i+1} are in.

Wait, not necessarily.

If a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences, then the increase doesn't contribute to p(s) or p(t).

Only if a_i and a_{i+1} are both in the same subsequence and a_i < a_{i+1}, does it contribute to p(s) or p(t).

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to maximize the number of increases that are split between s and t, meaning a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences.

Wait, yes.

If a_i < a_{i+1}, and a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences, then it doesn't contribute to p(s) + p(t).

If a_i < a_{i+1} and a_i and a_{i+1} are in the same subsequence, then it does contribute to p(s) + p(t).

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), I should maximize the number of increases where a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences.

In other words, for each position where a_i < a_{i+1}, I should try to assign a_i and a_{i+1} to different subsequences.

Similarly, for positions where a_i >= a_{i+1}, I can assign a_i and a_{i+1} to the same subsequence without increasing the penalty.

So, the strategy is:

- For each i from 1 to n-1, if a_i < a_{i+1}, assign a_i and a_{i+1} to different subsequences.

- If a_i >= a_{i+1}, assign a_i and a_{i+1} to the same subsequence.

This way, the number of increases in s and t is minimized.

But, since s and t are subsequences, I need to ensure that the order is maintained.

Wait, but assigning a_i and a_{i+1} to different subsequences might not be straightforward because subsequences need to maintain the original order.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a graph where nodes are elements of the array, and edges represent the constraint that two elements must be in different subsequences if a_i < a_{i+1}.

This sounds like a graph coloring problem, where I have to color the elements with two colors (s and t), such that if a_i < a_{i+1}, the colors are different.

Then, the minimal penalty would be equal to the number of times a_i < a_{i+1} and a_i and a_{i+1} are in the same subsequence.

But if I can color the elements such that whenever a_i < a_{i+1}, a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) would be zero.

However, this might not always be possible, especially if there are cycles in the constraints.

Wait, but since the array is linear, there are no cycles, so two-coloring should always be possible.

Wait, but in practice, because the array is linear, I can always split it into two subsequences such that a_i < a_{i+1} implies a_i and a_{i+1} are in different subsequences.

But is that always possible?

Let's consider an example.

Take a = [1,2,3,4,5].

Here, 1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5.

So, I need to assign 1 and 2 to different subsequences, 2 and 3 to different subsequences, and so on.

This forms a chain: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5, where each consecutive pair is connected and must be in different subsequences.

So, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], p(s)=2 (1<3,3<5), p(t)=1 (2<4), total penalty 3.

Wait, but according to the two-coloring approach, I should have p(s) + p(t) = 0.

What's going wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the two-coloring approach.

In two-coloring, if I have a chain like 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5, where each node is connected to the next, I can color them alternately: s, t, s, t, s.

So, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4].

In s, 1 < 3 < 5, so p(s) = 2.

In t, 2 < 4, so p(t) = 1.

Total penalty is 3.

But according to the two-coloring, I thought it should be zero.

Wait, no, two-coloring ensures that connected nodes have different colors, but it doesn't ensure that there are no increases within each subsequence.

In fact, in this case, within s, there are increases, and within t, there are increases, but the connected pairs are in different subsequences.

Wait, but in this approach, the connected pairs are in different subsequences, which means that the increases are split between s and t, but the increases within s and t are still counted.

So, perhaps two-coloring gives a way to split the sequence, but it doesn't necessarily minimize p(s) + p(t) to zero.

In fact, in this case, it's impossible to have p(s) + p(t) = 0 because the sequence is strictly increasing.

If I try to make both s and t decreasing, I can't because the entire sequence is increasing.

For example, if I take s = [1,2,3,4,5], p(s) = 4.

Or s = [1,3,5], p(s) = 2, t = [2,4], p(t) = 1.

Alternatively, s = [1,3], t = [2,4,5], p(s) = 1, p(t) = 2.

Total penalty is still 3.

Seems like I can't do better than 3 in this case.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increases that cannot be split between the two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of increases minus the maximum number of increases that can be assigned to one subsequence.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two "channels" to assign the elements to, s and t.

I want to assign elements to s and t such that the total number of increases in s and t is minimized.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to maximize the number of increases that are split between s and t.

In other words, for each increase a_i < a_{i+1}, I want to assign a_i to one subsequence and a_{i+1} to the other subsequence.

This way, that particular increase doesn't contribute to p(s) + p(t).

So, the minimal penalty would be equal to the number of increases that cannot be split, meaning that despite trying to split increases between s and t, some increases have to be within the same subsequence.

This sounds similar to graph coloring, where connections represent constraints that must be in different subsequences.

In graph theory, a bipartite graph can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

In this case, the graph would be a path where each edge represents a < constraint between consecutive elements.

So, if I color the graph with two colors, s and t, then the number of increases within s and t would be minimized.

In the first test case, with a = [1,2,3,4,5], the graph is a path with all edges representing < constraints.

So, coloring alternately should minimize the increases within each subsequence.

As we saw, s = [1,3,5], p(s) = 2, t = [2,4], p(t) = 1, total penalty 3.

Is this the minimal possible?

Yes, because if I try any other splitting, the total penalty won't go below 3.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increases minus the number of times I can split the increases between s and t.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of increases minus the number of a_i < a_{i+1} where a_i and a_{i+1} are assigned to different subsequences.

In the two-coloring approach, the number of a_i < a_{i+1} where a_i and a_{i+1} are assigned to different subsequences is maximized.

In the first test case, with s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], the increases split are 1<3, 3<5 in s, and 2<4 in t.

But the original increases were 1<2,2<3,3<4,4<5.

So, 1<2 split into s and t, 2<3 split into t and s, 3<4 split into s and t, 4<5 split into t and s.

Wait, in this assignment:

s = [1,3,5]

t = [2,4]

So, 1 < 2: 1 in s, 2 in t -> split

2 < 3: 2 in t, 3 in s -> split

3 < 4: 3 in s, 4 in t -> split

4 < 5: 4 in t, 5 in s -> split

Wait, so all increases are split between s and t.

Then why is p(s) + p(t) = 3?

Because within s, 1 < 3 < 5 are increases, and within t, 2 < 4 is an increase.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, since all increases are split between s and t, the penalty should be zero.

But that's not the case.

So, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps p(s) + p(t) counts the number of increases within each subsequence, not the number of splits.

So, even if I split the increases between s and t, the increases within s and t are still counted.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, in the first test case, with s = [1,3,5], p(s) = 2 (1<3 and 3<5), t = [2,4], p(t) = 1 (2<4), total penalty 3.

But if all increases are split between s and t, why is the penalty not zero?

Because p(s) + p(t) counts the number of increases within each subsequence, not the splits.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two "queues" s and t.

I process the array from left to right, assigning each element to s or t.

I want to minimize the total number of increases within s and t.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I should try to assign elements such that within each subsequence, the number of increases is minimized.

One way to do this is to assign elements to the subsequence where the last element is as large as possible, to minimize the number of increases.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning each element to the subsequence where it can be appended without creating an increase, or with the least increase possible.

This sounds similar to finding the minimal number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, in fact, it is.

The problem is equivalent to finding a partition of the array into two subsequences, minimizing the sum of the number of increases in each subsequence.

This is similar to covering the array with two subsequences, where each subsequence has as few increases as possible.

Alternatively, it's equivalent to finding two threads to process the elements, where each thread processes its subsequence, and the total number of increases across both threads is minimized.

To minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to maximize the number of decreases in s and t combined.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of runs where elements are decreasing.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

But I need to cover the array with two subsequences and minimize the total number of increases in both.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix one subsequence, s, and assign elements to s such that s is as decreasing as possible.

Then, assign the remaining elements to t, and minimize p(t).

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the array, and j indicates which subsequence the i-th element is assigned to (j=0 for s, j=1 for t).

Then, dp[i][j] would be the minimal p(s) + p(t) for the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to subsequence j.

Wait, but p(s) and p(t) are defined based on the entire subsequence, not just the prefix.

This might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can maintain the last element assigned to s and t, and keep track of the number of increases in each.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize last_s = -infinity, last_t = -infinity, and penalty_s = 0, penalty_t = 0.

Iterate through the array from left to right.

For each element a_i, decide whether to assign it to s or t.

If assigned to s:

- If a_i > last_s, then penalty_s += 1.

- Update last_s = a_i.

Similarly, if assigned to t:

- If a_i > last_t, then penalty_t += 1.

- Update last_t = a_i.

Choose the assignment that minimizes the total penalty p(s) + p(t).

Wait, this seems promising.

So, at each step, I have two choices: assign a_i to s or to t.

If I assign a_i to s:

- If a_i > last_s, then p(s) increases by 1.

- Update last_s to a_i.

Similarly for t.

I need to choose the assignment that minimizes the total penalty up to the current step.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where the state is (current position, last_s, last_t).

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to implement this.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal total penalty up to each position, considering the last elements of s and t.

But it's getting complicated.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me look back at the examples.

In the first test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5], output is 3.

As I saw earlier, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], p(s)=2, p(t)=1, total penalty 3.

Is there a pattern here?

In s, the increases are 1<3 and 3<5, so p(s)=2.

In t, 2<4, so p(t)=1.

Total penalty is 3.

Is there a formula that can compute this directly?

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the total number of increases minus the maximum number of non-overlapping increases that can be split between s and t.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of increases that cannot be split.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have two "queues" s and t, and I process the array from left to right.

At each step, I choose to assign the current element to the queue where it causes the least increase in penalty.

Specifically, if I assign a_i to s:

- If a_i > last_s, then p(s) increases by 1.

- Else, p(s) remains the same.

Similarly for t.

I choose the queue where p(s) or p(t) increases the least.

This seems greedy and might work.

Let me try this with the first test case.

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize s and t empty, last_s = -infinity, last_t = -infinity, p_s = 0, p_t = 0.

Process a_1 = 1:

- Assign to s: 1 > -infinity, p_s +=1, last_s =1.

- Assign to t: 1 > -infinity, p_t +=1, last_t=1.

Choose to assign to s or t, both have p=1.

Let's assign to s.

s = [1], t = []

p_s =0, since s is single element.

Wait, no, p(s) is the number of i where s_i < s_{i+1}.

For a single element, p(s)=0.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, p(s) is the number of times s_i < s_{i+1}.

So, for s = [1], p(s)=0.

Similarly for t.

So, initially, p_s =0, p_t=0, last_s=1, last_t=-infinity.

Next, a_2=2.

Assign to s:

- 2 >1, so p_s +=1, s=[1,2], p_s=1.

Assign to t:

- 2 > -infinity, so p_t +=1, t=[2], p_t=0.

Wait, p(t) for t=[2] is 0, since it's a single element.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, p(t) is the number of i where t_i < t_{i+1}.

For t=[2], no such i, so p(t)=0.

Similarly, for s=[1,2], p(s)=1 (1<2).

So, choosing to assign a_2 to t would keep p(t)=0, while assigning to s would make p(s)=1.

So, better to assign to t.

So, assign a_2 to t.

Now, s=[1], p_s=0, t=[2], p_t=0.

Next, a_3=3.

Assign to s:

- 3 >1, so p_s +=1, s=[1,3], p_s=1.

Assign to t:

- 3 >2, so p_t +=1, t=[2,3], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to s, since p_s=1 is same as assigning to t.

Let's assign to s.

s=[1,3], p_s=1, t=[2], p_t=0.

Next, a_4=4.

Assign to s:

- 4 >3, p_s +=1, s=[1,3,4], p_s=2.

Assign to t:

- 4 >2, p_t +=1, t=[2,4], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to t, since p_t=1 is less than p_s=2.

So, assign to t.

s=[1,3], p_s=1, t=[2,4], p_t=1.

Next, a_5=5.

Assign to s:

- 5 >3, p_s +=1, s=[1,3,5], p_s=2.

Assign to t:

- 5 >4, p_t +=1, t=[2,4,5], p_t=2.

Choose to assign to s, since p_s=2 is same as assigning to t.

Let's assign to s.

s=[1,3,5], p_s=2, t=[2,4], p_t=1.

Total penalty p_s + p_t =3.

Which matches the earlier example.

So, this greedy approach seems to work.

The approach is:

- Maintain two subsequences, s and t.

- For each element a_i, assign it to the subsequence where the penalty increase is minimal.

- Specifically, assign a_i to s if p_s + (1 if a_i > last_s else 0) is less than or equal to p_t + (1 if a_i > last_t else 0), otherwise assign to t.

- Update the last element of the chosen subsequence and the penalty accordingly.

This seems to work for the first test case.

Let me try it on the second test case.

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s and t empty, p_s=0, p_t=0, last_s=-infinity, last_t=-infinity.

Process a_1=8.

Assign to s:

- 8 > -infinity, p_s +=1, s=[8], p_s=0.

Wait, p(s) is the number of i where s_i < s_{i+1}.

For s=[8], p(s)=0.

Similarly for t.

So, p_s=0, p_t=0.

Let's assign to s.

s=[8], p_s=0, last_s=8, t=[], p_t=0, last_t=-infinity.

Next, a_2=2.

Assign to s:

- 2 >8? No, so p_s remains 0, s=[8,2], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

- 2 > -infinity, p_t +=1, t=[2], p_t=0.

So, both options have p=0.

Let's assign to t.

s=[8], p_s=0, t=[2], p_t=0, last_t=2.

Next, a_3=3.

Assign to s:

- 3 >8? No, p_s remains 0, s=[8,3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

- 3 >2, p_t +=1, t=[2,3], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to s, since p_s=0 is better than p_t=1.

So, assign to s.

s=[8,3], p_s=0, t=[2], p_t=0.

Next, a_4=1.

Assign to s:

- 1 >3? No, p_s remains 0, s=[8,3,1], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

- 1 >2? No, p_t remains 0, t=[2,1], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, let's assign to s.

s=[8,3,1], p_s=0, t=[2], p_t=0.

Next, a_5=1.

Assign to s:

- 1 >1? No, p_s remains 0, s=[8,3,1,1], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-1 >2? No, p_t remains 0, t=[2,1,1], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, assign to s.

s=[8,3,1,1], p_s=0, t=[2], p_t=0.

Next, a_6=7.

Assign to s:

-7 >1, p_s +=1, s=[8,3,1,1,7], p_s=1.

Assign to t:

-7 >2, p_t +=1, t=[2,1,1,7], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to t, since p_t=1 is same as p_s=1.

Let's assign to t.

s=[8,3,1,1], p_s=0, t=[2,1,1,7], p_t=1.

Next, a_7=4.

Assign to s:

-4 >1, p_s +=1, s=[8,3,1,1,4], p_s=1.

Assign to t:

-4 >7? No, p_t remains 1, t=[2,1,1,7,4], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to t, since p_t=1 is same as p_s=1.

Assign to t.

s=[8,3,1,1], p_s=0, t=[2,1,1,7,4], p_t=1.

Next, a_8=3.

Assign to s:

-3 >1, p_s +=1, s=[8,3,1,1,3], p_s=1.

Assign to t:

-3 >4? No, p_t remains 1, t=[2,1,1,7,4,3], p_t=1.

Choose to assign to t, since p_t=1 is same as p_s=1.

Assign to t.

s=[8,3,1,1], p_s=0, t=[2,1,1,7,4,3], p_t=1.

Total penalty p_s + p_t =1.

Which matches the second test case.

Seems correct.

Let me try the third test case.

a = [3,3,3,3,3]

Initialize s and t empty, p_s=0, p_t=0, last_s=-infinity, last_t=-infinity.

Process a_1=3.

Assign to s:

-3 > -infinity, p_s +=1, s=[3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-3 > -infinity, p_t +=1, t=[3], p_t=0.

Assign to s.

s=[3], p_s=0, last_s=3, t=[], p_t=0, last_t=-infinity.

Next, a_2=3.

Assign to s:

-3 >3? No, p_s remains 0, s=[3,3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-3 > -infinity, p_t +=1, t=[3], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, assign to s.

s=[3,3], p_s=0, t=[3], p_t=0.

Next, a_3=3.

Assign to s:

-3 >3? No, p_s remains 0, s=[3,3,3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-3 >3? No, p_t remains 0, t=[3,3], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, assign to s.

s=[3,3,3], p_s=0, t=[3], p_t=0.

Next, a_4=3.

Assign to s:

-3 >3? No, p_s remains 0, s=[3,3,3,3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-3 >3? No, p_t remains 0, t=[3,3,3], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, assign to s.

s=[3,3,3,3], p_s=0, t=[3], p_t=0.

Next, a_5=3.

Assign to s:

-3 >3? No, p_s remains 0, s=[3,3,3,3,3], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-3 >3? No, p_t remains 0, t=[3,3,3,3], p_t=0.

Both options have p=0, assign to s.

s=[3,3,3,3,3], p_s=0, t=[3], p_t=0.

Total penalty p_s + p_t =0.

Which matches the third test case.

Good.

Fourth test case, n=1, a=[1].

Assign to s: s=[1], p_s=0.

Assign to t: t=[1], p_t=0.

Either way, penalty=0.

Fifth test case, a=[2,1].

Assign to s:

-2 > -infinity, p_s +=1, s=[2], p_s=0.

-1 >2? No, p_s remains 0, s=[2,1], p_s=0.

Assign to t:

-2 > -infinity, p_t +=1, t=[2], p_t=0.

-1 >2? No, p_t remains 0, t=[2,1], p_t=0.

So, p_s + p_t =0.

Which matches the fifth test case.

Seems correct.

So, the greedy approach seems to work.

Now, let's look at the given code.

def func():
for _ in range(int(input())):
n = int(input())
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
(a, b) = (float('inf'), float('inf'))
c = 0
for x in range(n):
if a > b:
(a, b) = (b, a)
if l[x] <= a:
a = l[x]
elif l[x] <= b:
b = l[x]
else:
a = l[x]
c += 1
print(c)

Let's see what this code is doing.

It reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array l.

It initializes a and b to infinity, and c to 0.

Then, for each element in l:

- If a > b, swap a and b.

- If l[x] <= a, set a = l[x].

- Else if l[x] <= b, set b = l[x].

- Else, set a = l[x] and c +=1.

Finally, it prints c.

Wait, this seems familiar.

This looks like the algorithm to find the minimal number of increases in a single subsequence.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to maintain two decreasing subsequences.

Let me see.

Initialize a and b to infinity.

For each element in l:

- Keep track of the smallest ending of two decreasing subsequences.

- If l[x] <= a, set a = l[x].

- Else if l[x] <= b, set b = l[x].

- Else, increment c and set a = l[x].

This is a standard algorithm to find the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

In this case, it's trying to cover the array with two decreasing subsequences.

Wait, but in our problem, we need to split the array into two subsequences and minimize p(s) + p(t), which is equivalent to the total number of increases in both subsequences.

Is this equivalent to covering the array with two decreasing subsequences and counting the number of increases in them?

Wait, in decreasing subsequences, there are no increases, so p(s) + p(t) would be zero.

But in reality, it's not always possible to split into two decreasing subsequences.

In such cases, the algorithm seems to be counting the number of times it has to start a new subsequence beyond the two.

But in our problem, we are only allowed to split into two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I need to interpret it differently.

In the standard patience sorting algorithm, the number of piles corresponds to the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

But in our case, we have two subsequences, and we want to minimize the total number of increases in both.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to finding the minimal number of increasing subsequences minus 1, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two decreasing subsequences, s and t.

Then, p(s) + p(t) would be zero, which is ideal.

But if I can't split the entire array into two decreasing subsequences, I have to accept some increases.

Each time I have to start a new subsequence beyond the two, I have to count the increases in that subsequence.

Wait, but in the given code, it's initializing a and b to infinity, and trying to assign each element to the lowest possible ending sub
