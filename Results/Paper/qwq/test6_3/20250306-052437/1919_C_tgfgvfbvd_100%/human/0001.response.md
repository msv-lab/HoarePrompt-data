Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array has to be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called penalty. The penalty for a sequence b is the number of indices where b_i < b_{i+1}. So, basically, for each subsequence, I count how many times a number is followed by a larger number. The total penalty is the sum of penalties from both s and t. I need to find the minimum possible total penalty by splitting the array optimally.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, s and t are both subsequences of the original array a, and together they include all elements of a.

The goal is to split the array into s and t in such a way that the sum of their penalties is minimized.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

5

1 2 3 4 5

One possible split is s = [2,4,5] and t = [1,3]. The penalty for s is 2 (2<4 and 4<5) and for t is 1 (1<3), so total penalty is 3.

Is there a better split that gives a lower total penalty? What if I split s = [1,2,3] and t = [4,5]? Then p(s) = 2 (1<2 and 2<3) and p(t) = 1 (4<5), total penalty is still 3. Doesn't seem better.

Another split: s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4]. For s, p(s) = 2 (1<3 and 3<5), for t, p(t) = 1 (2<4), total penalty is 3 again.

Hmm, seems like 3 is the best I can do here.

In the second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

One possible split is s = [8,3,1] and t = [2,1,7,4,3]. Penalty for s is 0 (no increasing pairs), for t is 1 (2<7), total penalty is 1.

Is there a better split? Let's try s = [8,2,1] and t = [3,1,7,4,3]. Penalty for s is 0, for t is 1 (3<7), total still 1. Not better.

Another split: s = [8,1,1] and t = [2,3,7,4,3]. Penalty for s is 0, for t is 1 (2<3), total is 1 again.

Seems like 1 is the minimal penalty here.

Third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

All elements are equal. If I split s = [] and t = [3,3,3,3,3], penalty is 0 + 0 = 0.

Any split where one subsequence is non-decreasing will have penalty 0 for that subsequence.

So, minimal penalty is 0.

Fourth test case:

1

1

Only one element. Split s = [1], t = []. Penalty is 0 + 0 = 0.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Possible split s = [2], t = [1]. Penalty 0 + 0 = 0.

Another split s = [2,1], t = []. Penalty 0 (since 2 > 1, no increasing pair).

So, minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal penalty is achieved when we split the array in such a way that each subsequence is as non-increasing as possible.

Wait, in the first test case, s = [2,4,5] has p(s) = 2, which is increasing. But in the second test case, s = [8,3,1] has p(s) = 0, which is non-increasing.

So, maybe the idea is to make one subsequence non-increasing and the other can handle the rest.

But in the first test case, s = [2,4,5] is increasing, and t = [1,3] has one increasing pair.

Alternatively, if I make s non-increasing and t non-increasing, then p(s) + p(t) would be zero, but that's not possible in the first test case.

Wait, in the first test case, is it possible to split into two non-increasing subsequences?

Let's try: s = [1,2,3], t = [4,5]. But s is increasing, so p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1.

Alternatively, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]. s is increasing, p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1.

Wait, maybe it's not possible to split into two non-increasing subsequences in the first test case.

Wait, s = [5], t = [1,2,3,4]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 3, total penalty 3.

Another split: s = [1,3], t = [2,4,5]. p(s) = 1 (1<3), p(t) = 2 (2<4 and 4<5), total penalty 3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increasing subsequences needed to split the array minus 1.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Let me think differently.

The penalty p(b) counts the number of times an element is followed by a larger one in the subsequence b.

So, p(b) counts the number of increasing pairs in b.

Our goal is to split the array into two subsequences s and t and minimize p(s) + p(t).

I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs across both subsequences.

I recall that in sequence splitting problems, sometimes it's useful to think in terms of Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) or Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS).

In particular, I think this might relate to decomposing the sequence into a minimal number of decreasing subsequences.

Wait, in the first test case, the LIS is 5, which is the entire sequence. So, if I split into two decreasing subsequences, I need to see how that affects the penalty.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is related to the size of the LIS minus 1.

In the first test case, LIS is 5, so minimal penalty would be 5 - 1 = 4, but in the example, it's 3. So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the size of the LIS minus 1, but in the second test case, LIS is 4 (e.g., 2,3,7,4), so 4 - 1 = 3, but the minimal penalty is 1, which doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe it's different.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I assign elements to s and t in such a way that I try to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

One way to do this is to assign elements to s and t alternately, trying to keep each subsequence as non-increasing as possible.

Wait, but in the first test case, if I assign 1 to s, then 2 to t, 3 to s, 4 to t, 5 to s, then s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total penalty 3.

Alternatively, assign 1 to s, 2 to t, 3 to s, 4 to t, 5 to s, same as above.

Alternatively, assign 1 to s, 2 to s, 3 to t, 4 to t, 5 to t. Then s = [1,2], p(s) = 1, t = [3,4,5], p(t) = 2, total penalty 3 again.

Seems like 3 is the minimal.

But is there a better way?

Wait, maybe I can use some greedy approach.

Let me consider processing the array from left to right, and for each element, decide whether to put it in s or t.

I want to minimize the number of increasing pairs in s and t combined.

One idea is to always try to put the current element in the subsequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

Wait, perhaps more specifically, try to put it in the subsequence where it doesn't create a new increasing pair, or where it replaces previous elements to minimize increasing pairs.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two sequences, s and t.

I want to minimize p(s) + p(t), where p(b) is the number of increasing pairs in b.

I can think of p(b) as the number of times an element in b is followed by a larger one.

So, p(b) is equal to the number of increasing pairs in b.

Therefore, p(s) + p(t) is equal to the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

I need to minimize this total.

Now, the total number of increasing pairs in s and t is equal to the total number of increasing pairs in the original array, minus the number of increasing pairs that are split between s and t.

Wait, actually, that might not be directly helpful.

Let me consider that the total number of increasing pairs in the original array is fixed.

Wait, no, the original array doesn't have pairs; it's the subsequences s and t that have pairs within themselves.

I need to minimize the sum of p(s) and p(t), which is the total number of increasing pairs within s and within t.

I need to distribute the elements into s and t such that the total number of increasing pairs within s and t is minimized.

This seems similar to partitioning the array into two subsequences where each subsequence has as few increasing pairs as possible.

Alternatively, I can think of it as partitioning the array into two sequences, and minimizing the sum of the number of increasing adjacent pairs in each sequence.

Wait, but it's not adjacent pairs; it's any pair where i < j and b_i < b_j in the subsequence.

So, it's the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence.

Minimizing the sum of increasing pairs in s and t.

I recall that in the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, there's a relationship between the length of the longest increasing subsequence and the number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the sequence.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of covering the sequence with decreasing subsequences.

If I can cover the sequence with k decreasing subsequences, then the total number of increasing pairs would be minimized.

But in this problem, I'm allowed to split the sequence into two subsequences, s and t, each of which can be decreasing to minimize increasing pairs.

Wait, but in the first test case, splitting into two decreasing subsequences doesn't seem to give the minimal penalty.

Wait, in the first test case, if I split into two decreasing subsequences, what would that look like?

For example, s = [5,4,3], t = [2,1]. But the original array is [1,2,3,4,5]. Wait, I can't have s = [5,4,3] because the original array is in increasing order.

Wait, to form s = [5,4,3], I'd need the elements in that order in the original array, which I don't.

So, perhaps I need to think in terms of assigning elements to s and t in a way that each subsequence is as non-increasing as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

In the first test case, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover [1,2,3,4,5] is 5, because each element is larger than the previous one, so each element must be in its own decreasing subsequence to avoid increasing pairs.

Wait, if I have s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4], then s has p(s) = 2 (1<3 and 3<5), t has p(t) = 1 (2<4), total penalty 3.

If I have s = [1,2,3,4,5] and t = [], p(s) = 4, p(t) = 0, total penalty 4.

If I have s = [5], t = [1,2,3,4], p(s) = 0, p(t) = 3, total penalty 3.

If I have s = [1,3], t = [2,4,5], p(s) = 1, p(t) = 2, total penalty 3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal.

But according to the problem, the minimal penalty is 3.

Wait, but in the second test case, with array [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], the minimal penalty is 1.

If I try to cover this array with two decreasing subsequences, can I do it?

Let's see:

s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3]

s is decreasing: 8 > 3 > 1

t is not decreasing: 2 < 1 < 7 > 4 > 3

In t, there is an increasing pair: 1 < 7, so p(t) = 1

p(s) = 0, p(t) = 1, total penalty = 1

Is there a way to make both s and t decreasing? Probably not, because there are increasing pairs in the array.

Wait, in t, 1 < 7 is an increasing pair, so p(t) = 1.

If I try to assign s = [8,2,1], t = [3,1,7,4,3]

s is not decreasing because 2 > 1, but 8 > 2 < 1 is not strictly decreasing; wait, 8 > 2 > 1 is decreasing.

t is [3,1,7,4,3]: 3 > 1 < 7 > 4 > 3, which has 1 < 7, so p(t) = 1

Total penalty is still 0 + 1 = 1

Same as before.

Another split: s = [8,3,1,1,3], t = [2,7,4]

s is not fully decreasing: 8 > 3 > 1 > 1 > 3 (wait, 1 < 3 is an increasing pair)

Wait, in s, 1 < 3 is an increasing pair, so p(s) = 1

t is [2,7,4], which has 2 < 7, so p(t) = 1

Total penalty is 1 + 1 = 2, which is worse than the previous split.

So, the minimal penalty is indeed 1.

From this, it seems that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided in the two subsequences.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need an O(n log n) solution or something similar.

Let me think about the algorithm provided.

The given code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

(a, b) = (float('inf'), float('inf'))

c = 0

for x in range(n):

if a > b:

(a, b) = (b, a)

if l[x] <= a:

a = l[x]

elif l[x] <= b:

b = l[x]

else:

a = l[x]

c += 1

print(c)

So, it reads t, then for each test case, reads n and the array l.

It initializes a and b to infinity.

Then iterates through the array, and for each element l[x], it does:

- if a > b, swap a and b

- if l[x] <= a, set a = l[x]

- elif l[x] <= b, set b = l[x]

- else, set a = l[x] and c += 1

Finally, it prints c.

So, what is this algorithm trying to do?

It seems to maintain two variables, a and b, which represent something like the smallest elements in two subsequences.

But I need to understand what a and b represent.

Let's consider the first test case:

l = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize a = inf, b = inf

for x=0, l[0]=1

a > b? inf > inf? No

l[0] <= a: 1 <= inf, so a = 1

for x=1, l[1]=2

a > b? 1 > inf? No

l[1] <= a? 2 <= 1? No

l[1] <= b? 2 <= inf? Yes, so b = 2

for x=2, l[2]=3

a > b? 1 > 2? No

l[2] <= a? 3 <= 1? No

l[2] <= b? 3 <= 2? No

Else, a = 3, c +=1 → c=1

for x=3, l[3]=4

a > b? 3 > 2? Yes, swap a and b → a=2, b=3

l[3] <= a? 4 <= 2? No

l[3] <= b? 4 <= 3? No

Else, a = 4, c +=1 → c=2

for x=4, l[4]=5

a > b? 4 > 3? Yes, swap a and b → a=3, b=4

l[4] <= a? 5 <= 3? No

l[4] <= b? 5 <= 4? No

Else, a = 5, c +=1 → c=3

Then, print c=3, which matches the first test case.

Let's see the second test case:

l = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize a=inf, b=inf

x=0, l[0]=8

a > b? inf > inf? No

l[0] <= a? 8 <= inf? Yes, so a=8

x=1, l[1]=2

a > b? 8 > inf? Yes, swap a and b → a=inf, b=8

l[1] <= a? 2 <= inf? Yes, so a=2

x=2, l[2]=3

a > b? 2 > 8? No

l[2] <= a? 3 <= 2? No

l[2] <= b? 3 <= 8? Yes, so b=3

x=3, l[3]=1

a > b? 2 > 3? No

l[3] <= a? 1 <= 2? Yes, so a=1

x=4, l[4]=1

a > b? 1 > 3? No

l[4] <= a? 1 <= 1? Yes, so a=1

x=5, l[5]=7

a > b? 1 > 3? No

l[5] <= a? 7 <= 1? No

l[5] <= b? 7 <= 3? No

Else, a=7, c +=1 → c=1

x=6, l[6]=4

a > b? 7 > 3? Yes, swap a and b → a=3, b=7

l[6] <= a? 4 <= 3? No

l[6] <= b? 4 <= 7? Yes, so b=4

x=7, l[7]=3

a > b? 3 > 4? No

l[7] <= a? 3 <= 3? Yes, so a=3

End of loop, print c=1, which matches the second test case.

Similarly, I can check the other test cases and see that the code produces the correct output.

So, it seems that the code is correct.

But I need to understand why this algorithm works.

It seems that a and b are maintaining some kind of minimal elements for two subsequences.

When a new element comes in, if it's less than or equal to a, assign it to that subsequence and update a.

If it's less than or equal to b, assign it to the other subsequence and update b.

If it's larger than both, create a new subsequence starting with this element and increment c.

But in the context of the problem, c represents the number of subsequences needed beyond the first two.

Wait, but in the code, c is incremented only when l[x] > both a and b, and then a is set to l[x].

But in the first test case, c=3, which matches the minimal penalty.

In the second test case, c=1, which matches the minimal penalty.

So, it seems that c is calculating the minimal penalty.

But why?

Let me think about it in terms of the number of increasing subsequences needed.

In the first test case, to achieve minimal penalty, we need to split into three subsequences.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=5 and array [1,2,3,4,5], if we split into three subsequences, say s1=[1,3,5], s2=[2,4], s3=[].

But in the code, c=3, which might indicate that three subsequences are needed.

Wait, but the problem allows splitting into only two subsequences.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

In the code, c is incremented when a new subsequence needs to be started because the current element is larger than both a and b.

So, c represents the number of times we had to start a new subsequence beyond the first two.

But in the problem, we are only splitting into two subsequences, s and t.

So, perhaps c represents the number of increasing pairs that must be present in the two subsequences.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the algorithm again.

The algorithm maintains two variables, a and b, initialized to infinity.

It iterates through the array, and for each element l[x]:

- If a > b, swap a and b. This ensures that a <= b.

- If l[x] <= a, set a = l[x]. This means assigning l[x] to the subsequence represented by a.

- Else if l[x] <= b, set b = l[x]. This means assigning l[x] to the subsequence represented by b.

- Else, set a = l[x] and c +=1. This means starting a new subsequence with l[x] and incrementing the penalty.

At the end, it prints c, which is the number of times a new subsequence had to be started because the current element was larger than both a and b.

In the context of the problem, this seems to correspond to the minimal penalty.

But I need to confirm this.

I recall that in the standard problem of partitioning an array into the minimum number of decreasing subsequences, the minimal number of subsequences needed is equal to the size of the longest increasing subsequence.

This is a classic application of the pigeonhole principle.

In that problem, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But in this problem, we are only allowed to split into two subsequences, and we need to minimize the sum of p(s) and p(t), which is the number of increasing pairs in s and t.

Wait, perhaps there's a connection.

If we split the array into two decreasing subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) would be zero, but that's only possible if the array can be partitioned into two decreasing subsequences.

If not, then we have to accept some increasing pairs.

In the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5], it's not possible to partition into two decreasing subsequences, because any partition will have at least one increasing pair.

Similarly, in the second test case, [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], it is possible to partition into two subsequences where one has no increasing pairs and the other has one increasing pair.

So, perhaps c represents the minimal number of additional subsequences needed beyond two to cover the array with decreasing subsequences.

Wait, but in the code, c is incremented when a new subsequence has to be started because the current element is larger than both a and b.

So, c represents the number of times we had to start a new decreasing subsequence beyond the first two.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3,4,5], we need 5 decreasing subsequences (each element in its own subsequence), so c=3 beyond the first two.

In the second test case, with [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], we can partition into two decreasing subsequences with one increasing pair, so c=1.

Wait, but in the standard problem, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

In the first test case, the longest increasing subsequence is of length 5, so we need 5 decreasing subsequences to cover the array.

In the second test case, the longest increasing subsequence is of length 4 (e.g., 2,3,7,4), so we need 4 decreasing subsequences.

But in the code, c=1 for the second test case, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps c is not counting the number of subsequences beyond two, but something else.

Let me think differently.

Maybe c represents the number of times we had to start a new subsequence, which corresponds to the number of increasing sequences that couldn't be placed in the existing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps c is equal to the minimal number of increasing subsequences in some sense.

But I'm getting tangled up.

Let me look back at the code.

The code maintains a and b, which seem to represent the smallest ending elements of two decreasing subsequences.

By keeping a and b as the smallest possible ending elements, the algorithm tries to minimize the number of new subsequences needed.

When a new element comes in, if it's smaller than or equal to a, it can be appended to the subsequence ending with a, and a is updated to this smaller value.

Similarly for b.

If it's larger than both, a new subsequence has to be started with this element, and c is incremented.

In this way, c counts the number of times a new subsequence had to be started because the current element is larger than the smallest ending elements of the existing subsequences.

This seems similar to the patience sorting algorithm for finding the length of the LIS.

In patience sorting, you play cards into piles, and when a new card is larger than all current piles, you start a new pile.

The number of piles gives the length of the LIS.

But in this problem, c is counting the number of piles beyond the first two.

Wait, perhaps c is equal to the length of the LIS minus 2.

In the first test case, LIS is 5, c=3, which matches 5 - 2 = 3.

In the second test case, LIS is 4, c=1, which matches 4 - 3 =1.

Wait, 4 - 3 =1, but earlier I thought LIS is 4, c=1, which seems consistent with c = LIS - 3.

Wait, perhaps c = LIS - 2.

In the first test case, LIS=5, c=3, which is 5-2=3.

In the second test case, LIS=4, c=1, which is 4-3=1. Wait, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps c = LIS - 2, but in the second test case, LIS=4, c=1, which would be 4-3=1.

Wait, maybe c = ceil(LIS / 2) - 1 or something.

I need to find a general formula.

Alternatively, perhaps c is equal to the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array minus 1.

In the first test case, to cover [1,2,3,4,5] with increasing subsequences, you need 1 subsequence, so c=1-1=0, but in the code, c=3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

I must be misunderstanding.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps c represents the number of times we had to start a new subsequence because the current element cannot be placed in the existing decreasing subsequences.

In other words, c counts the number of such forced new subsequences, which correlates with the minimal penalty.

Given that the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs, and considering the time constraints for large n, this algorithm might be an efficient way to compute the minimal penalty.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See explanation}} \]

**Correctness: True**
