Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not exist two distinct indices i and j (where i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Okay, so I need to make sure that for any pair of positions i and j, it's not the case that the element at position i divides the element at position j and simultaneously the next element after i divides the next element after j.

Let me try to understand this with an example. In the first test case, n=4, and the output is [4,1,2,3]. Let's check if this satisfies the condition.

Let's consider all possible pairs of indices (i,j):

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4, p_2=1; 4 does not divide 1, so this pair is fine.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4, p_3=2; 4 divides 2? No, 2 divides 4, but not the other way around. So, this is fine.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4, p_4=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1, p_3=2; 1 divides 2, but p_3=2 and p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3. So, this is fine.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1, p_4=3; 1 divides 3, but p_3=2 and p_5 doesn't exist since n=4. Wait, the condition is for i and j less than n, so i and j can be from 1 to 3. So, i=2, j=3 is valid, but i=2, j=4 is not because j=4 would require p_5, which doesn't exist. So, perhaps I need to consider only i and j from 1 to n-1.

Wait, the problem says "1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j", so i and j can be from 1 to n-1, and they must be distinct.

So, for n=4, possible pairs are:

- (1,2)

- (1,3)

- (2,3)

Let's check these:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4, p_2=1; 4 does not divide 1. Good.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4, p_3=2; 4 does not divide 2 (since 2 divides 4). Wait, but 4 doesn't divide 2, that's correct.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1, p_3=2; 1 divides 2, but p_3=2 and p_4=3; 2 does not divide 3. So, this is fine.

Hence, the permutation [4,1,2,3] satisfies the condition.

In the second test case, n=3, and the output is [1,2,3]. Let's check:

Possible pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1, p_2=2; 1 divides 2, and p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3. Good.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1, p_3=3; 1 divides 3, but p_2=2 and p_4 doesn't exist. Wait, j=3 would require p_4, but n=3, so j can only go up to n-1=2. So, perhaps in this case, j can only be up to n-1.

Wait, the problem says "1 ≤ i, j < n", so j can be up to n-1.

So, for n=3, pairs are:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1, p_2=2; 1 divides 2, and p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3. Good.

Hence, [1,2,3] is valid.

Now, looking at the program provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

print(a)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls func_1(). func_1() reads n, creates a list a from 1 to n, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based), and prints the list.

Let's see what this does for n=4:

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

a[::2] is [1,3], reversed is [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3]. But according to this code, it would output [3,2,1,4]. Is [3,2,1,4] a valid permutation?

Let's check:

Possible pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3, p_2=2; 3 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=3, p_3=1; 3 divides 1? No, 1 divides 3.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=1; 2 does not divide 1.

So, it seems valid. But is this always the case?

Let's try n=5:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] => [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Is this valid?

Possible pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5, p_2=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5, p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

So, seems valid.

Another example: n=3

a = [1,2,3]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] => [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So, a becomes [3,2,1]

Is this valid?

Possible pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=3, p_2=2; 3 does not divide 2.

Hence, valid.

So, it seems that this approach is working for the small values I tested.

But is this always correct? Let's think about a larger n, say n=6.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] => [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check for validity:

Possible pairs (i,j):

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5, p_2=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5, p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

Seems valid.

Another permutation for n=6 could be [6,1,2,3,4,5], which is what the code would output if it reverses every other element.

Wait, for n=6:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] => [1,3,5,6][::-1] = [6,5,3,1]

Wait, no. a[::2] for n=6 is indices 0,2,4, which are elements [1,3,5], reversed to [5,3,1], so a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6].

Seems consistent.

But is there a general proof that this method works?

Let's try to see a pattern or a reason why reversing every other element would avoid the condition.

Suppose we have n elements, and we reverse the elements at even indices (0-based), so a[0], a[2], a[4], etc., are reversed.

Let's consider two indices i and j, with i < j, and both less than n-1.

We need to ensure that either p_i does not divide p_j, or p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

Given the way the permutation is constructed, it's not immediately obvious why this would hold for all n.

Perhaps there's a better way to construct the permutation to ensure the condition is met.

One simple approach is to place the largest number first, followed by 1, and then the remaining numbers in order. For example, for n=4, [4,1,2,3], which matches the first test case.

Similarly, for n=5, [5,1,2,3,4].

This seems to work because the first element is the largest, and it only divides itself, but since j cannot be equal to i, p_j cannot be equal to p_i, so p_i doesn't divide p_j.

Wait, but in this arrangement, p_1 is n, and p_2 is 1.

Then, for any other i, p_i is at least 2, and p_{i+1} is at least 2 as well.

So, if we choose i=1 and j=some other index, p_1=n divides p_j only if p_j is a multiple of n, but since p_j is between 1 and n, the only multiple is n itself, but j cannot be equal to i.

Hence, p_j cannot be n, so n does not divide p_j.

Therefore, the condition is satisfied for i=1 and any j≠1.

For other i and j, p_i is at least 2, p_j is at least 2, and p_{i+1} is at least 2, p_{j+1} is at least 2.

So, we need to ensure that for i≠j, p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} does not hold.

Given that p_i and p_j are distinct numbers from 2 to n, and same for p_{i+1} and p_{j+1}, it's not immediately clear if this condition holds in general for this arrangement.

Perhaps this isn't the best approach.

Looking back at the code provided, it reverses every other element.

For n=4: [1,2,3,4] -> [5,2,3,4] (wait, n=4 example earlier was [4,1,2,3], but in code it's different.

Wait, in the code, for n=4, a = [1,2,3,4], a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1], so a becomes [3,2,1,4].

But in the example, it's [4,1,2,3]. So, the code is not matching the example output.

Does that mean the code is incorrect?

Wait, perhaps there are multiple valid permutations, so [3,2,1,4] could be valid, as could [4,1,2,3].

But if the code produces [3,2,1,4], which seems valid, then it's okay.

But in the first test case, the example output is [4,1,2,3], whereas the code produces [3,2,1,4]. Both are valid, so it's fine.

So, multiple permutations can be valid.

Now, does the code always produce a valid permutation?

From the small test cases I checked, it seems to work.

But to be sure, let's think about n=2.

n=2: a = [1,2], a[::2] = [1][::-1] = [1], so a becomes [1,2]. Is [1,2] valid?

Possible pairs: i=1, j=2: p_1=1 divides p_2=2, and p_2=2 divides p_3, but p_3 doesn't exist since n=2. Wait, but j < n, so j=2 is allowed only if n >=3. Wait, the problem says 3 <= n <= 10^5, but in the code, n can be 2.

Wait, the problem states 3 <= n <= 10^5, but in the code, it reads n from input without checking, assuming n >=3.

But in the problem statement, it says 3 <= n <= 10^5, so perhaps the code is fine.

But in the example, n=3 and n=4 are given.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 3 <= n <= 10^5, but in the code, it doesn't have any checks for n >=3.

But since the problem guarantees n >=3, it's fine.

Another thing is that the code uses list slicing a[::2] which selects elements at even indices (0-based), and reverses them.

So, for n=4: [1,2,3,4] -> [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]

Seems like it's reversing the elements at even indices.

Is there a pattern or mathematical justification for why this would satisfy the condition?

Let's think about the condition again: there should not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 <= i, j < n, i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In other words, for any two positions i and j, if p_i divides p_j, then p_{i+1} should not divide p_{j+1}.

So, perhaps by reversing every other element, we're disrupting any potential divisibility patterns that could lead to such pairs.

But this is not a rigorous proof.

Alternatively, maybe this rearrangement ensures that the elements are sufficiently shuffled so that no such pairs exist.

But to be sure, perhaps I should look for a counterexample where this method fails.

Let's try n=6:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So, a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Now, check for pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5, p_2=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5, p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5, p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2, p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_3=3 does not divide p_5=1.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3, p_4=4; 3 does not divide 4.

All pairs satisfy the condition.

Another test case: n=7

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7][::-1] = [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7, p_2=2; 7 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7, p_3=5; 7 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7, p_4=4; 7 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7, p_5=3; 7 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7, p_6=6; 7 does not divide 6.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2, p_3=5; 2 does not divide 5.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=2, p_4=4; 2 divides 4, but p_3=5 does not divide p_5=3.

- i=2, j=5: p_2=2, p_5=3; 2 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=6: p_2=2, p_6=6; 2 divides 6, but p_3=5 does not divide p_7=1.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=5, p_4=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=3, j=5: p_3=5, p_5=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=3, j=6: p_3=5, p_6=6; 5 does not divide 6.

- i=4, j=5: p_4=4, p_5=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=4, j=6: p_4=4, p_6=6; 4 does not divide 6.

- i=5, j=6: p_5=3, p_6=6; 3 divides 6, but p_6=6 and p_7=1; 6 does not divide 1.

All pairs satisfy the condition.

Seems like this method works for n=7.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let's think about the positions.

By reversing every other element, we're essentially pairing up elements in a certain way.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe this rearrangement helps in breaking any potential divisibility chains.

But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure why this works.

Perhaps there's a better way to construct the permutation to ensure the condition is met.

Another approach could be to place the largest number first, followed by 1, and then the remaining numbers in increasing order, as in the example for n=4: [4,1,2,3].

In this arrangement, the first element is n, which only divides itself, but since j cannot be equal to i, p_j cannot be n, so the condition is satisfied for i=1.

For other i and j, since p_i and p_j are from 1 to n-1, and p_{i+1} and p_{j+1} are also from 1 to n, we need to ensure that no pair satisfies both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

This seems plausible, but again, not a rigorous proof.

Alternatively, perhaps arranging the permutation in decreasing order could work.

For n=4: [4,3,2,1]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4, p_2=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4, p_3=2; 4 divides 2, and p_2=3 does not divide p_4=1.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=3, p_3=2; 3 does not divide 2.

Seems valid.

Another arrangement: [n, n-1, ..., 1]

For n=5: [5,4,3,2,1]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=5, p_2=4; 5 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=5, p_3=3; 5 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=5, p_4=2; 5 does not divide 2.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=4, p_3=3; 4 does not divide 3.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=4, p_4=2; 4 divides 2, and p_3=3 does not divide p_5=1.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=3, p_4=2; 3 does not divide 2.

Seems valid.

So, arranging in decreasing order seems to work as well.

But the code provided doesn't do that. It reverses every other element.

Is there a difference?

Both seem to work.

Perhaps multiple solutions exist for each n.

Given that, as long as the code produces a valid permutation, it's correct.

But to ensure that the code always produces a valid permutation, I need to be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a case where the code fails.

Let's try n=8:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7][::-1] = [7,5,3,1]

So, a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=7, p_2=2; 7 does not divide 2.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=7, p_3=5; 7 does not divide 5.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=7, p_4=4; 7 does not divide 4.

- i=1, j=5: p_1=7, p_5=3; 7 does not divide 3.

- i=1, j=6: p_1=7, p_6=6; 7 does not divide 6.

- i=1, j=7: p_1=7, p_7=1; 7 divides 1.

But p_2=2 and p_8=8; 2 divides 8.

Oh, so for i=1, j=7: p_i=7 divides p_j=1, and p_{i+1}=2 divides p_{j+1}=8.

So, this violates the condition.

Hence, [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8] is invalid for n=8.

But according to the code, for n=8, it would output [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8], which is invalid.

So, the code is incorrect for n=8.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
