Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

First, I need to understand the preferences:

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent with just one person.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My task is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to these preferences, and if it's impossible, output -1.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to handle the introverts since they have the strictest requirement. Each introvert needs their own tent. So, the number of tents required for introverts is simply 'a'.

Next, extroverts need tents with exactly three people, and they must be with two others. So, for each extrovert, we need to have two other people (which can be universals or other extroverts) in the same tent.

Wait, but if an extrovert is in a tent, the tent must have exactly three people, and one of them is the extrovert, so the other two must be either universals or extroverts.

But if I have multiple extroverts, can they share tents with each other and universals?

Let me think. If I have three extroverts, they can all be in one tent, satisfying each other's requirement, since each would have two others in the tent.

Similarly, if I have, say, two extroverts and one universal in a tent, that would also satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

But what if I have extroverts that can't be fully accommodated in tents of three?

For example, if I have one extrovert left without two others to share the tent, that would be a problem, and I should return -1 in that case.

Now, universals are flexible. They can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

So, they can fill in the gaps in tents with extroverts or be on their own.

My goal is to minimize the number of tents, so I should try to maximize the number of people in each tent, where possible.

So, I should try to fill the tents with three people as much as possible, especially for extroverts.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents, each with one introvert.

Then, for extroverts and universals, I need to form groups of three for the extroverts.

Each extrovert needs two others in their tent.

So, the total number of 'spots' needed for extroverts is 2 * b, because each extrovert needs two companions.

These companions can be either universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts need to be in a tent with two others, but those others can be extroverts or universals.

But if I have multiple extroverts sharing a tent, that might work.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of forming groups of three for extroverts.

Each group of three can contain:

- Three extroverts

- Two extroverts and one universal

- One extrovert and two universals

In all these cases, the extrovert's requirement is satisfied.

So, I need to form as many groups of three as possible, prioritizing extroverts to be grouped together to minimize the number of tents.

Wait, but actually, since extroverts need to be with two others, and universals are flexible, I should aim to group extroverts together as much as possible to minimize the number of tents.

Let me think about the number of extroverts and universals.

Let's denote:

- e = number of extroverts

- u = number of universals

I need to form groups of three for the extroverts, and the remaining universals can be placed in tents as needed.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is ceil((e + u) / 3).

But, there's a catch: for extroverts, each tent they are in must have exactly three people.

So, I need to make sure that all extroverts are placed in tents with exactly three people.

If I have extroverts that can't be placed in a tent with exactly three people, it's impossible, and I should return -1.

Wait, but if I have extroverts that are left without two companions, it's impossible.

So, perhaps I need to check if u >= 2*e - 3*floor(e/3).

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each extrovert needs two companions, and these companions can be either universals or other extroverts.

So, the total number of companions needed is 2*e.

Now, extroverts can provide companionship to each other.

Each tent can have up to two extroverts providing companionship to each other.

Wait, no.

Actually, in a tent with three people, one extrovert needs two companions, and those companions can be extroverts or universals.

But if I have two extroverts in a tent, they can each provide one companion to the other, so they need one more companion to satisfy both of their requirements.

So, in a tent with two extroverts and one universal, each extrovert has their two companions.

Similarly, in a tent with one extrovert and two universals, the extrovert has their two companions.

And in a tent with three extroverts, each extrovert has their two companions.

So, in all these cases, the extroverts' requirements are satisfied.

Now, the universals are flexible; they can be in any tent configuration.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three people.

Therefore, I should try to group as many extroverts and universals as possible into tents of three.

Let me consider the total number of people that need to be placed in tents: e + u.

I need to divide them into groups of up to three, but with the constraint that extroverts must be in groups of exactly three.

Wait, not exactly three, but their tent must have exactly three people.

So, the tent has exactly three people if it contains at least one extrovert.

For tents without extroverts, universals can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

But, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three people.

So, I should aim to have as many tents as possible with three people, especially those containing extroverts.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have e extroverts and u universals.

Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly three people.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 1), but with each tent having exactly three people.

Wait, that's not accurate.

Wait, each tent that contains extroverts must have exactly three people.

So, if I have e extroverts, and each tent with extroverts has exactly three people, then the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 1), but considering that each tent can take up to three people.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of tents required to accommodate e extroverts, each requiring two companions.

Let me consider that each tent that contains extroverts must have exactly three people, and at least one extrovert.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 1), but with the constraint that each tent has exactly three people.

Wait, that seems off.

Maybe I should think about how many companions are needed for extroverts.

Each extrovert needs two companions.

So, total companions needed: 2*e.

These companions can be provided by universals or by other extroverts.

But, extroverts can provide companionship to each other.

So, if two extroverts are in the same tent, they provide one companion to each other, so they still need one more companion each, which can be a universal.

Wait, in a tent with two extroverts and one universal, each extrovert has their two companions (the other extrovert and the universal).

Similarly, in a tent with one extrovert and two universals, the extrovert has their two companions (the two universals).

In a tent with three extroverts, each extrovert has their two companions (the other two extroverts).

So, in all these cases, the extroverts' requirements are satisfied.

Now, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three people.

So, I should try to form as many tents with three people as possible,优先考虑包含 extroverts.

Let me consider the total number of people that need to be placed in tents: e + u.

I need to divide them into tents of up to three people, with the constraint that any tent containing at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Tents without extroverts can have one, two, or three universals.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three people,优先包含 extroverts.

Let me try to calculate the minimum number of tents needed.

First, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents.

Then, for extroverts and universals:

I need to form groups of three for the extroverts.

Each group of three can contain:

- Three extroverts

- Two extroverts and one universal

- One extrovert and two universals

- Three universals (but this doesn't help with extroverts' requirements)

Wait, but tents without extroverts can have one, two, or three universals.

So, my priority should be to satisfy the extroverts' requirements first.

So, I need to make sure that all extroverts are placed in tents with exactly three people.

Let me think in terms of the number of tents needed for extroverts.

Each tent that contains at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, I need to distribute the extroverts into tents, each containing at least one extrovert and exactly three people.

My goal is to minimize the number of such tents, which means maximizing the number of extroverts per tent.

So, the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 1), but considering that each tent can take up to three extroverts.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a tent with three extroverts, I can place up to three extroverts.

In a tent with two extroverts and one universal, I can place two extroverts.

In a tent with one extrovert and two universals, I can place one extrovert.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 3).

But, I need to make sure that there are enough universals to fill in the tents if needed.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have e extroverts, and I want to place them in tents of three, the number of tents needed is ceil(e / 3).

But, in some tents, I might need to use universals to fill in.

Specifically:

- If I have e % 3 == 0, then I can have all tents with three extroverts.

- If e % 3 == 1, then I need one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

- If e % 3 == 2, then I need one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

So, in general, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(e / 3), but with the condition that:

- If e % 3 == 0, no additional universals are needed.

- If e % 3 == 1, I need at least two universals for that tent.

- If e % 3 == 2, I need at least one universal for that tent.

Therefore, the total number of tents for extroverts is ceil(e / 3), but I need to make sure that there are enough universals to cover the remainder.

So, if e % 3 == 1, I need at least two universals.

If e % 3 == 2, I need at least one universal.

If I don't have enough universals, it's impossible, and I should return -1.

After allocating tents for extroverts, I can allocate the remaining universals into tents of up to three people.

The number of additional tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((u - required Universals for extroverts) / 3).

Wait, more precisely:

After allocating the required universals for extroverts, the remaining universals can be placed into tents of up to three people.

So, the total number of tents needed is:

- Tents for introverts: a

- Tents for extroverts: ceil(e / 3), with the condition that there are enough universals for the remainder.

- Tents for remaining universals: ceil((u - required universals for extroverts) / 3)

But, to minimize the number of tents, perhaps I can optimize the allocation.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I aim to minimize the number of tents by maximizing the number of tents with three people.

So, perhaps the total number of tents is a + ceil((e + u) / 3), but with the condition that for extroverts, their tents must have exactly three people, and the remaining universals can be in tents of up to three.

Wait, perhaps it's better to separate the allocation.

First, allocate tents for introverts: a tents.

Then, for extroverts and universals:

- Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts: ceil(e / 3)

- Calculate the required universals for these tents:

- If e % 3 == 0, no additional universals needed.

- If e % 3 == 1, need two universals.

- If e % 3 == 2, need one universal.

- Check if there are enough universals for this.

- Then, the remaining universals are u - required universals for extroverts.

- The number of tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((u - required universals for extroverts) / 3)

- The total number of tents is a + ceil(e / 3) + ceil((u - required universals for extroverts) / 3)

But I think there might be a better way.

Let me consider that the tents for extroverts must have exactly three people, and the remaining universals can be in tents of up to three people.

So, the total number of tents is a (for introverts) plus the number of tents for extroverts plus the number of tents for the remaining universals.

But perhaps there is a way to combine some allocations to minimize the total number of tents.

Wait, but to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents with three people.

So, I should maximize the number of tents that contain three people, including both extroverts and universals.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to form as many tents as possible with three people, consisting of extroverts and universals, making sure that any tent with at least one extrovert has exactly three people.

So, I can prioritize forming tents with three extroverts, then tents with two extroverts and one universal, then tents with one extrovert and two universals, and finally tents with three universals.

This way, I can minimize the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Let me formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. Allocate 'a' tents for introverts, each with one introvert.

2. For extroverts and universals:

a. While there are at least three extroverts left:

- Create a tent with three extroverts.

- e = e - 3

b. While there are at least two extroverts and at least one universal left:

- Create a tent with two extroverts and one universal.

- e = e - 2

- u = u - 1

c. While there is at least one extrovert and at least two universals left:

- Create a tent with one extrovert and two universals.

- e = e - 1

- u = u - 2

d. If there are extroverts left after this, it's impossible, return -1.

e. For the remaining universals, allocate them into tents of up to three people.

- The number of tents needed is ceil(u / 3)

3. The total number of tents is a + number of tents for extroverts + number of tents for remaining universals.

But in code, dealing with large numbers (up to 10^9), I can't use loops; I need mathematical operations.

So, I need to translate this logic into mathematical operations.

Let's see.

First, allocate 'a' tents for introverts.

Then, for extroverts and universals:

- Determine the number of tents needed for extroverts.

- Calculate the required universals for these tents.

- Check if there are enough universals.

- Calculate the remaining universals and the number of tents needed for them.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts as ceil(e / 3), and calculate the required universals based on the remainder of e divided by 3.

Specifically:

- If e % 3 == 0, required universals = 0

- If e % 3 == 1, required universals = 2

- If e % 3 == 2, required universals = 1

Then, if u >= required universals, then the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(e / 3), and the remaining universals are u - required universals.

Then, the number of tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((u - required universals) / 3)

Finally, total tents = a + ceil(e / 3) + ceil((u - required universals) / 3)

But I need to make sure that if e % 3 == 1 and u < 2, or e % 3 == 2 and u < 1, then it's impossible, return -1.

Otherwise, calculate the total tents as above.

Wait, but in the case where e % 3 == 0, and u >= 0, it's fine.

If e % 3 == 1, need u >= 2.

If e % 3 == 2, need u >= 1.

Then, the remaining universals are u - required universals, and ceil((u - required universals) / 3) tents are needed for them.

Total tents = a + ceil(e / 3) + ceil((u - required universals) / 3)

But to minimize the number of tents, perhaps there is a better way to allocate the universals.

Wait, perhaps there is a way to combine the allocation of extroverts and universals more efficiently.

Let me think about the example in the problem.

In the first test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

So, introverts: 1 tent

Extroverts: 2

Universals: 3

Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(2 / 3) = 1 tent

Required universals: since 2 % 3 == 2, required universals = 1

Remaining universals: 3 - 1 = 2

Number of tents for remaining universals: ceil(2 / 3) = 1 tent

Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3

Which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2 tents

Required universals: 4 % 3 == 1, required universals = 2

But u = 1 < 2, so impossible, return -1

Which matches the second test case.

In the third test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(4 / 3) = 2 tents

Required universals: 4 % 3 == 1, required universals = 2

Remaining universals: 2 - 2 = 0

Number of tents for remaining universals: ceil(0 / 3) = 0

Total tents: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

Which should be correct.

In the fourth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(1 / 3) = 1 tent

Required universals: 1 % 3 == 1, required universals = 2

But u = 1 < 2, so impossible, return -1

Which matches the fourth test case.

Seems consistent.

So, in code, I can implement this logic.

But I need to handle large values efficiently, as a, b, c can be up to 10^9.

So, I need to use integer division and modulo operations to calculate the required values efficiently.

Also, I need to handle the case where e = 0, which means only introverts and universals, which is straightforward.

If e = 0, then total tents = a + ceil(u / 3)

If a = 0 and e = 0, then total tents = ceil(u / 3)

If a = 0 and e > 0, proceed as above.

Also, need to handle the case where u = 0.

If u = 0 and e % 3 == 0, then number of tents for extroverts is e / 3, and required universals = 0, which is fine.

If u = 0 and e % 3 != 0, then it's impossible, return -1.

Okay, I think I have a solid plan.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

There is a function func_2 that takes a, b, c (introverts, extroverts, universals) and calls func_1 to handle the extroverts and universals, then adds the number of introverts' tents.

func_1 takes extroverts and universals and calculates the number of tents needed for them, returning None if it's impossible.

In func_1:

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:

if extroverts % 3 != 0:

if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:

return None

return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

According to my earlier reasoning:

- If extroverts % 3 == 0, required universals = 0

- If extroverts % 3 == 1, required universals = 2

- If extroverts % 3 == 2, required universals = 1

And check if u >= required universals.

Then, the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(e / 3)

And the remaining universals are u - required universals

Then, the number of tents for remaining universals is ceil((u - required universals) / 3)

Total tents = a + ceil(e / 3) + ceil((u - required universals) / 3)

But in the given code, func_1 checks if extroverts % 3 != 0, and if so, checks if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3, then returns None, else returns ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

This seems different from my logic.

Let me verify this with some examples.

Take the first test case:

e = 2, u = 3

extroverts % 3 == 2 % 3 == 2 != 0

extroverts % 3 + universals = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3, so it's okay.

Then, ceil((2 + 3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Then, func_2 would return a + ret = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

e = 4, u = 1

4 % 3 == 1 != 0

4 % 3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None, hence -1, which matches.

Third test case:

e = 4, u = 2

4 % 3 == 1 != 0

4 % 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 >= 3, so return ceil((4 + 2)/3) = ceil(6/3) = 2

Then, total tents = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches.

Fourth test case:

e = 1, u = 1

1 % 3 == 1 != 0

1 % 3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None, hence -1, which matches.

Seems consistent so far.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for e = 2, u = 3, required universals = 1, and u = 3 >= 1, so it should be okay.

In func_1, it checks if e % 3 + u >= 3 when e % 3 != 0, which seems to be a different condition.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent.

Let me see.

In func_1:

if e % 3 != 0:

if e % 3 + u < 3:

return None

else:

return ceil((e + u)/3)

else:

return ceil((e + u)/3)

Wait, but in my earlier logic, for e % 3 == 1, required u = 2

for e % 3 == 2, required u = 1

So, in both cases, e % 3 + u >= 3 would ensure that u >= required universals.

Wait, let's check:

- If e % 3 == 1, required u = 2

So, e % 3 + u = 1 + u >= 3 => u >= 2, which matches required u >= 2

- If e % 3 == 2, required u = 1

e % 3 + u = 2 + u >= 3 => u >= 1, which matches required u >= 1

- If e % 3 == 0, required u = 0, which is always fine.

So, this condition in func_1 seems equivalent to my earlier logic.

Therefore, the given code seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required for participants with different preferences regarding tent occupancy.

### Approach

1. **Introverts** require their own tent.
2. **Extroverts** must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals** can be in a tent with one, two, or three people.

Our goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences.

#### Solution Code

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

def main():
    test_case_n = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_case_n):
        introverts, extroverts, universals = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Introverts' Tents:**
   - Each introvert needs one tent.

2. **Extroverts' Tents:**
   - Extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people (one extrovert and two others).
   - We calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to ensure there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - Specifically, if `extroverts % 3 == 1`, we need at least two universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 2`, we need at least one universal.
   - If these conditions are not met, it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and we return -1.

4. **Total Tents:**
   - Sum the tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts and universals.
   - For remaining universals after satisfying extroverts' conditions, additional tents are calculated using `ceil((universals - required_universals) / 3)`.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum number of tents while respecting all preferences.
