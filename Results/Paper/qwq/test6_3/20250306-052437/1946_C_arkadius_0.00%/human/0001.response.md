Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to find the maximum number x such that when I remove exactly k edges from the tree, each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

The problem mentions removing exactly k edges, which will split the tree into k+1 connected components. My goal is to maximize x, which is the minimum size of these components after the removal.

I need to ensure that each of these k+1 components has at least x vertices. I need to find the largest possible x that satisfies this condition.

Let's think about how to approach this. Since I need to maximize x, and x is related to the sizes of the connected components, I might need to consider different ways to remove k edges and see what the smallest component size is in each case.

But trying all possible ways to remove k edges would be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4. So, I need a smarter way to find the maximum x without checking every possible edge removal.

I recall that in trees, many problems can be solved using tree traversals, dynamic programming, or other tree-specific algorithms. Maybe I can model this problem using some tree properties.

Let me consider the tree as a rooted tree, choosing an arbitrary root. Then, I can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or similar traversal to calculate subtree sizes and other properties.

If I root the tree at some vertex, say vertex 0, then each edge can be considered as either ascending or descending based on the parent-child relationship.

Perhaps I can think about the edges I remove as cutting the tree into subtrees, and I need to ensure that each resulting subtree has at least x vertices.

I need to remove exactly k edges, so I'll have k+1 subtrees. I need to maximize x, which is the minimum size among these k+1 subtrees.

This sounds like a candidate for a binary search on x, where for each candidate x, I check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

So, I can set up a binary search between x = 1 and x = n, since x cannot be larger than n.

For each mid value in the binary search, I need to check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least mid vertices.

How do I check this efficiently?

I need a way to count the number of components that would have at least mid vertices if I remove k edges.

Wait, actually, I need to remove exactly k edges, and ensure that all resulting components have at least mid vertices.

Alternatively, I can think of it as removing k edges to maximize the minimum size of the components.

But for the binary search to work, I need a function that tells me, for a given x, whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

I need to implement this function efficiently.

Let me consider the tree as rooted, and perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

For each node, I can calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, if I consider removing edges from the root towards its children, each removal would separate a subtree.

If I remove an edge to a child, that child's subtree becomes a separate component.

So, if I remove edges to children whose subtrees are at least x, I can consider those as valid components.

But I need to ensure that the remaining tree also has at least x vertices.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can model this using dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Looking at the code provided, it seems like the approach is to root the tree at vertex 0, calculate subtree sizes, and then define a function func_3 that checks for a given x whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

func_3 uses func_1, which seems to traverse the tree in postorder, calculating some good_components and remaining_size.

I need to understand what good_components and remaining_size represent.

In func_1, good_components seems to count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices, and remaining_size accumulates the size of subtrees that are smaller than x.

Wait, actually, in func_1, for each node, it accumulates good_components from its children, and if a child's remaining_size is at least x, it increments good_components, otherwise it adds the child's remaining_size to its own remaining_size.

Finally, for the root, it returns the total good_components and the remaining_size.

Then, in func_3, it checks if good_components > k or if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x.

I need to interpret what this means.

It seems like good_components counts the number of subtrees that can be separated by removing edges, each of size at least x.

remaining_size represents the size of the remaining tree after removing those edges.

So, if good_components > k, it means I can remove more than k edges to get components of size at least x, which is better than required.

If good_components == k and the remaining_size >= x, it means removing k edges results in all components having at least x vertices.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

This seems logical.

Now, I need to verify if this implementation is correct.

First, the tree is rooted at vertex 0 using a non-recursive DFS in root_tree_non_recursive.

Then, func_1 performs a postorder traversal using a stack to calculate good_components and remaining_size.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n) per call.

func_3 uses func_1 to check for a given x whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

Finally, func_4 performs a binary search between 1 and n to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

This overall approach seems correct.

Now, I need to ensure that the implementation is bug-free and efficient enough.

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5, the total time should be acceptable.

Each test case involves O(n log n) time, since the binary search runs in O(log n) and each func_3 call is O(n).

So, total time is O(sum_n log sum_n), which should be fine.

Looking at the code, it seems well-structured and correct.

I don't see any off-by-one errors or incorrect indexings.

The tree is rooted at vertex 0, and parents and children are correctly assigned.

The func_1 correctly traverses the tree in postorder and calculates the required values.

func_3 correctly checks the conditions based on good_components and remaining_size.

func_4 performs the binary search correctly.

func_5 reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls func_4 to get the answer.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the provided program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
