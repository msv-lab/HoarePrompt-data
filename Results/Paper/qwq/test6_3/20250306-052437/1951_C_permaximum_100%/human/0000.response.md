Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to go to a concert. There are n days when tickets are on sale, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. I need to buy exactly k tickets, and there are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. Every time I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all the remaining days.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying these k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Let's look at the example provided to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 tickets on day 1. Prices for remaining days become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 tickets on day 2. Prices for remaining days become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 4. Prices for remaining day become [3]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 6 each.

Total cost = 4 + 12 = 16

Wait, but the output says 10, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me read the explanation again.

In the first test case, one optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1. Prices become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2. Prices become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3 for 4. Prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4 for 6 each.

Total cost = 4 + 12 = 16, but the output is 10. Hmm, maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose differently.

Let's see another approach.

Maybe I should prioritize buying from the cheapest days first, but considering the price increases.

This seems like a problem that can be approached with a priority queue, where I always pick the day with the current lowest price.

Let me think about that.

If I use a min-heap to keep track of the days based on their current prices, I can always pick the day with the lowest current price to buy tickets.

Each time I buy x tickets on a day, I need to increase the prices of all remaining days by x.

Wait, but in the heap, I have all the days, and when I buy x tickets, I need to increase the prices of all the remaining days by x.

But in a heap, it's efficient to update the prices of all elements.

Wait, but in Python's heapq, updating an element requires removing and re-adding it, which isn't efficient if done multiple times.

Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can process the days in order, but that might not be optimal because the prices change based on future purchases.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The program does the following:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k.

- Read the array of prices.

- Call func_1 with these parameters.

- Print the result.

Now, func_1 does:

- Import heapq.

- Create a priority queue (min-heap) of tuples (price, day_index).

- Heapify the priority queue.

- Initialize total_cost to 0.

- Initialize tickets_bought to 0.

- Initialize price_increase to 0.

- While tickets_bought < k:

- Pop the smallest price and its day index from the heap.

- Add price_increase to the price to get the current price.

- Determine how many tickets to buy: min(m, k - tickets_bought).

- Add (price * tickets_to_buy) to total_cost.

- Add tickets_to_buy to price_increase.

- Return total_cost.

Wait, but in this approach, it's assuming that we always buy from the day with the current lowest price, and then increase the price for all remaining days.

But is this correct?

Let me think about the first test case again.

n=4, m=2, k=3

prices=[8,6,4,2]

So, initially, the heap is [(8,0),(6,1),(4,2),(2,3)]

Heapified, the smallest is (2,3).

Buy min(m, k - tickets_bought) = min(2,3) = 2 tickets.

Current price is 2 + 0 = 2.

Total cost += 2 * 2 = 4.

price_increase += 2.

Now, the remaining days' prices are increased by 2.

So, the heap now should have the remaining days with increased prices.

But in the code, it's just popping the smallest each time and adding price_increase to the price.

Wait, but it's not actually updating the prices in the heap; it's just adding price_increase to the price when popping.

Is this sufficient?

Let me see.

In the first iteration:

- Pop (2,3). price = 2 + 0 = 2.

- Buy 2 tickets. total_cost = 4.

- price_increase = 2.

Remaining days are 0,1,2 with prices [8,6,4].

But since price_increase is 2, their actual prices are [10,8,6].

Now, in the next iteration:

- Pop the smallest, which is (4,2). price = 4 + 2 = 6.

- Buy 1 ticket (since k - tickets_bought = 1).

- total_cost += 6.

- price_increase += 1 = 3.

- Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

Which matches the first test case's output.

Okay, so in this approach, by always picking the day with the current smallest price and considering the price_increase accumulated so far, it seems to work.

Let me check the second test case.

n=4, m=2, k=8

prices=[8,6,4,2]

- Initialize heap: [(8,0),(6,1),(4,2),(2,3)]

- price_increase = 0

- tickets_bought = 0

- total_cost = 0

First iteration:

- Pop (2,3). price = 2 + 0 = 2.

- Buy min(2,8) = 2 tickets.

- total_cost += 4.

- price_increase += 2 = 2.

Remaining days: 0,1,2 with prices [8,6,4] + 2 = [10,8,6].

Second iteration:

- Pop (6,2). price = 6 + 2 = 8.

- Buy min(2,6) = 2 tickets.

- total_cost += 16.

- price_increase += 2 = 4.

Remaining days: 0,1 with prices [10,8] + 2 = [12,10].

Third iteration:

- Pop (10,1). price = 10 + 4 = 14.

- Buy min(2,4) = 2 tickets.

- total_cost += 28.

- price_increase += 2 = 6.

Remaining days: 0 with price [12] + 2 = 14.

Fourth iteration:

- Pop (12,0). price = 12 + 6 = 18.

- Buy min(2,2) = 2 tickets.

- total_cost += 36.

- price_increase += 2 = 8.

Total cost = 4 + 16 + 28 + 36 = 84.

But the output says 64. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let me recalculate:

First buy: 2 tickets at 2 each, total 4. price_increase=2.

Second buy: 2 tickets at 6+2=8 each, total 16. price_increase=4.

Third buy: 2 tickets at 8+4=12 each, total 24. price_increase=6.

Fourth buy: 2 tickets at 10+6=16 each, total 32. price_increase=8.

Total cost: 4+16+24+32=76.

Wait, but the output is 64. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the price increase is applied to the remaining days after the current day.

In the first iteration, when I buy 2 tickets on day 4, the prices for days 1,2,3 increase by 2.

So, prices become [10,8,6,2].

Wait, but in the heap, I have all days, and I need to make sure that the prices are updated accordingly.

This seems more complicated.

Perhaps the approach in the code is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I should sort the days based on their original prices and prioritize buying from the cheapest days first, considering the price increases.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, considering the constraints, and calculate the total cost.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, it needs to be efficient.

Another idea: since buying x tickets on a day increases the price for remaining days by x, it's like adding x to all future ticket prices.

So, the total cost would be sum over all tickets of the price on their day, considering the increases.

This seems similar to prefix sums.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

- Sort the days based on their prices.

- Assign the smallest prices to the days where we buy the least number of tickets.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the greedy approach in the code again.

In the first test case, it gave the correct output, but in the second, it didn't.

So, perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the second test case.

Let's simulate it step by step.

Initialize:

n=4, m=2, k=8

prices=[8,6,4,2]

heap: [(8,0),(6,1),(4,2),(2,3)]

price_increase=0

tickets_bought=0

total_cost=0

First iteration:

Pop (2,3). price=2+0=2.

Buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 4.

price_increase += 2.

Remaining days: 0,1,2 with prices [8,6,4] + 2 = [10,8,6].

Second iteration:

Pop (6,2). price=6+2=8.

Buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 16. total_cost=20.

price_increase += 2=4.

Remaining days: 0,1 with prices [10,8] + 2 = [12,10].

Wait, why is it adding 2 to the prices again?

Wait, price_increase is already 4, but when popping (6,2), it's adding the current price_increase which is 2 (from the previous step).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how price_increase is accumulated.

Let me look back at the code.

In the loop:

- Pop (price, day)

- current_price = price + price_increase

- tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)

- total_cost += current_price * tickets_to_buy

- price_increase += tickets_to_buy

So, in the first iteration:

- Pop (2,3). current_price=2+0=2. buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 4. price_increase=2.

Second iteration:

- Pop (4,2). current_price=4+2=6. buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 12. total_cost=16. price_increase=4.

Third iteration:

- Pop (6,1). current_price=6+4=10. buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 20. total_cost=36. price_increase=6.

Fourth iteration:

- Pop (8,0). current_price=8+6=14. buy 2 tickets. total_cost += 28. total_cost=64. price_increase=8.

So, total_cost=64, which matches the second test case's output.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 76, but actually, it's 64. So, maybe the approach is correct.

Let me verify again.

First buy: 2 tickets at 2 each -> 4. price_increase=2.

Second buy: 2 tickets at 4+2=6 each -> 12. price_increase=4.

Third buy: 2 tickets at 6+4=10 each -> 20. price_increase=6.

Fourth buy: 2 tickets at 8+6=14 each -> 28.

Total: 4+12+20+28=64.

Yes, that's correct. I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, perhaps the approach is correct.

Let me check the third test case.

n=5, m=100, k=1

prices=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

heap: [(1,1),(10,3),(100,2),(1000,4),(10000,0)]

price_increase=0

tickets_bought=0

total_cost=0

First iteration:

Pop (1,1). current_price=1+0=1. buy 1 ticket. total_cost +=1. price_increase +=1.

Done, since k=1.

Total cost=1, which matches the output.

Fourth test case:

n=6, m=3, k=9

prices=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

heap: [(5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5)]

price_increase=0

tickets_bought=0

total_cost=0

First iteration:

Pop (5,0). current_price=5+0=5. buy 3 tickets. total_cost +=15. price_increase +=3.

Remaining days:1,2,3,4,5 with prices [5,5,5,5,5]+3=[8,8,8,8,8]

Second iteration:

Pop (5,1). current_price=5+3=8. buy 3 tickets. total_cost +=24. total_cost=39. price_increase +=3=6.

Remaining days:2,3,4,5 with prices [8,8,8,8]+3=[11,11,11,11]

Third iteration:

Pop (5,2). current_price=5+6=11. buy 3 tickets. total_cost +=33. total_cost=72. price_increase +=3=9.

Done, since k=9.

Total cost=72, which matches the output.

So, in all test cases, this approach gives the correct answer.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
