Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called "penalty". The penalty for a subsequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, if I have a subsequence like [1, 3, 2], the penalty would be 1 because 3 is greater than 2.

My goal is to split the array into s and t in such a way that the total penalty, which is p(s) + p(t), is minimized. I need to find the minimum possible penalty.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if my array is [1, 2, 3], possible subsequences are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], or even an empty sequence.

Now, the problem allows me to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, and every element must be in exactly one of them. So, it's like partitioning the array into two subsequences.

I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties from both s and t. The penalty is counted for each pair of consecutive elements in the subsequence where the first is less than the second.

Hmm, this sounds a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to minimize the total penalty is to maximize the number of times an element is greater than the next one in both subsequences because in that case, the penalty would be lower. Wait, no, actually, the penalty is incremented when an element is less than the next one. So, to minimize penalty, I want as many elements as possible to be greater than or equal to the next element in both s and t.

But that seems too vague. Maybe I need a more structured approach.

Let me consider the properties of the subsequences s and t.

Suppose I try to maximize the number of increasing subsequences. Wait, but the penalty is for increasing pairs, so maybe I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs across both s and t.

Wait, actually, the penalty is the number of times an element is less than the next one in each subsequence, and I need to sum those for s and t.

I need to minimize p(s) + p(t).

Let me think about what p(s) represents. It's the number of times an element in s is less than the next one in s. Similarly for t.

So, for the entire array, if I consider all pairs of consecutive elements in s and t, and count the number of times the first is less than the second, I need to minimize that sum.

But since s and t together contain all elements of the array, but in their respective subsequence orders, it's a bit complicated to think about.

Maybe I can look at it differently. Maybe I can try to assign each element to s or t in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

Let me consider a simple example to get some intuition.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One possible split is s = [2, 4, 5], t = [1, 3]

For s: 2 < 4 < 5, so p(s) = 2

For t: 1 < 3, so p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 2 + 1 = 3

Is this the minimal possible? Let's see.

Another split could be s = [1, 2, 3], t = [4, 5]

For s: 1 < 2 < 3, p(s) = 2

For t: 4 < 5, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3 again.

What if s = [1, 3, 5], t = [2, 4]

For s: 1 < 3 < 5, p(s) = 2

For t: 2 < 4, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3.

Another split: s = [1, 2, 4], t = [3, 5]

For s: 1 < 2 < 4, p(s) = 2

For t: 3 < 5, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3.

Hmm, seems like it's always 3 in these splits. But is there a better split?

What if s = [1, 3], t = [2, 4, 5]

For s: 1 < 3, p(s) = 1

For t: 2 < 4 < 5, p(t) = 2

Total penalty = 3.

Same as before.

What if s = [1, 2], t = [3, 4, 5]

For s: 1 < 2, p(s) = 1

For t: 3 < 4 < 5, p(t) = 2

Total penalty = 3.

Still the same.

What if s = [1], t = [2, 3, 4, 5]

For s: no pairs, p(s) = 0

For t: 2 < 3 < 4 < 5, p(t) = 3

Total penalty = 3.

Same again.

Seems like no matter how I split it, I get a total penalty of 3. Maybe that's the minimal possible for this array.

Let me check another test case.

Second example:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

The output is 1.

So, there must be a way to split this array such that p(s) + p(t) = 1.

In the note, it says one possible split is s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

For s: 8 > 3 < 1, so p(s) = 0 (since no pair where s_i < s_{i+1})

For t: 2 < 1 is not true, so p(t) = number of times t_i < t_{i+1}, which is 1 < 7, 7 > 4, 4 < 3 â†’ so only one increasing pair: 1 < 7, and 4 < 3 is not increasing, so p(t) = 1.

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Okay, that makes sense.

Is there a better split? Let's try.

Another split: s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3, 1, 7, 4, 3]

For s: 8 > 2 > 1, so p(s) = 0

For t: 3 > 1 < 7 > 4 < 3, so p(t) = 1 (1 < 7)

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Same as before.

What if s = [8, 1, 1, 3], t = [2, 3, 7, 4]

For s: 8 > 1 < 1 < 3, so p(s) = 1 (1 < 3)

For t: 2 < 3 < 7 > 4, so p(t) = 2 (2 < 3 and 3 < 7)

Total penalty = 1 + 2 = 3, which is worse.

So, the minimal penalty is indeed 1.

From these examples, it seems that the goal is to distribute the elements into s and t such that in each subsequence, the number of increasing pairs is minimized.

I need a strategy to achieve this.

One idea is to try to assign elements to s or t based on some ordering criteria.

Let me think about the properties of the subsequences.

Suppose I try to maximize the number of decreasing subsequences in s and t.

Because in a decreasing subsequence, there are no increasing pairs, so p(s) and p(t) would be 0.

But that might not be possible, because not all elements can be in a single decreasing subsequence.

In fact, finding the longest decreasing subsequence is a well-known problem, but I need to split into two subsequences.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimum number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the entire array.

But the problem allows splitting into any two subsequences, not necessarily covering with decreasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of decreasing subsequences required to cover the array.

But I need to split into exactly two subsequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of assigning each element to s or t in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the array and decide for each element whether to put it in s or t, based on some condition.

The condition should be such that it minimizes the number of increasing pairs in both s and t.

One way to do this is to try to assign each element to the subsequence where it is less than or equal to the previous element in that subsequence.

Wait, but that might not always work, because sometimes assigning to the other subsequence might lead to better overall penalty.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I maintain the last elements of s and t.

Then, for each new element, I choose to assign it to the subsequence where it is greater than or equal to the last element of that subsequence.

If it can't be assigned to either, then I have to create a new pair, but in this problem, since I can assign to either s or t, I don't have to create a new subsequence.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another problem.

Let me consider the following approach:

Initialize two empty lists, s and t.

For each element in the array, assign it to the subsequence (s or t) where the last element is less than or equal to the current element.

If both s and t satisfy this condition, choose the one where the last element is smaller, to minimize the increasing pairs.

If neither s nor t can accommodate the element without creating an increasing pair, then assign it to the subsequence that has the smaller last element.

Wait, perhaps I need to formalize this.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Initialize s and t as empty lists.

For each element in the array:

- If s is empty or a[-1] <= current element, assign to s.

- Else if t is empty or b[-1] <= current element, assign to t.

- Else, assign to the subsequence which has the smaller last element.

Wait, but in the second condition, if neither s nor t can accommodate the element without creating an increasing pair, I assign to the one with the smaller last element.

Is this optimal? Let's see.

In the first test case:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 1:

- s is empty, so assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 1 <= 2, so assign to s: s = [1,2], t = []

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 2 <= 3, so assign to s: s = [1,2,3], t = []

Fourth element 4:

- s[-1] = 3 <= 4, so assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4], t = []

Fifth element 5:

- s[-1] = 4 <= 5, so assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4,5], t = []

Total penalty: p(s) = 4, p(t) = 0 => total penalty = 4.

But in the example, the minimal penalty is 3.

So, this approach is not optimal.

Alternative approach needed.

Let me try to assign to the subsequence which has the smaller last element.

First element 1:

- Both empty, assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 1 < 2, assign to s: s = [1,2], t = []

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 2 < 3, assign to s: s = [1,2,3], t = []

Fourth element 4:

- s[-1] = 3 < 4, assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4], t = []

Fifth element 5:

- s[-1] = 4 < 5, assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4,5], t = []

Again, total penalty = 4.

Still not optimal.

Maybe I should assign to the subsequence which has the larger last element.

First element 1:

- Both empty, assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 1 < 2, assign to s: s = [1,2], t = []

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 2 < 3, assign to s: s = [1,2,3], t = []

Fourth element 4:

- s[-1] = 3 < 4, assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4], t = []

Fifth element 5:

- s[-1] = 4 < 5, assign to s: s = [1,2,3,4,5], t = []

Same as before.

Not working.

Maybe I should assign to the subsequence which has the larger last element only if it's less than or equal to the current element.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider assigning to the subsequence which would minimize the increasing pairs.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of minimizing the number of increasing pairs by maximizing the number of decreasing runs in s and t.

Wait, perhaps I need to split the array into two decreasing subsequences as much as possible.

So, the idea is to assign each element to the subsequence where it can be appended without breaking the decreasing order, and if it can't, assign it to the other subsequence.

Let's try this approach.

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 1:

- Both empty, assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 1 < 2, can't assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- t is empty, so assign to t: s = [1], t = [2]

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 1 < 3, can't assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- t[-1] = 2 < 3, can't assign to t without creating an increasing pair.

- So, assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is s.

- But s[-1] = 1 < 3, which would create an increasing pair in s.

- Wait, maybe I need to assign to the subsequence which allows me to maintain the decreasing order.

- Since neither s nor t is decreasing in a way that allows me to append 3 without creating an increasing pair, maybe I need to choose the subsequence with the larger last element.

- t[-1] = 2 > s[-1] = 1, so assign to t: t = [2,3]

- Now, s = [1], t = [2,3]

Fourth element 4:

- s[-1] = 1 < 4, can't assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- t[-1] = 3 < 4, can't assign to t without creating an increasing pair.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is s.

- Assign to s: s = [1,4], t = [2,3]

Fifth element 5:

- s[-1] = 4 < 5, can't assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- t[-1] = 3 < 5, can't assign to t without creating an increasing pair.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is t.

- Assign to t: t = [2,3,5], s = [1,4]

Now, s = [1,4], t = [2,3,5]

Calculate penalties:

p(s): 1 < 4, so p(s) = 1

p(t): 2 < 3 < 5, so p(t) = 2

Total penalty = 3.

This matches the example.

So, this approach seems to work for this case.

Let me try another split.

Take n = 5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Following the approach:

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 1:

- Assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 1 < 2, can't assign to s.

- t is empty, assign to t: s = [1], t = [2]

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 1 < 3, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 2 < 3, can't assign to t.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is s.

- Assign to s: s = [1,3], t = [2]

Fourth element 4:

- s[-1] = 3 < 4, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 2 < 4, can't assign to t.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is t.

- Assign to t: t = [2,4], s = [1,3]

Fifth element 5:

- s[-1] = 3 < 5, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 4 < 5, can't assign to t.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is s.

- Assign to s: s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]

Now, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]

Calculate penalties:

p(s): 1 < 3 < 5, p(s) = 2

p(t): 2 < 4, p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 3.

Same as before.

Another split: n = 8, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 8:

- Assign to s: s = [8], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 8 > 2, can assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- Wait, s is currently [8], and 2 < 8, so assigning 2 to s would make s = [8,2], which is decreasing.

- But according to the approach, I should assign to the subsequence where the last element is greater than or equal to the current element.

- Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the condition.

Let me formalize the condition:

For each element, assign it to the subsequence where the last element is greater than or equal to the current element.

If both allow, choose one.

If neither allows, assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element.

In this case:

First element 8:

- Both empty, assign to s: s = [8], t = []

Second element 2:

- s[-1] = 8 > 2, can assign to s: s = [8,2], t = []

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 2 < 3, can't assign to s without creating an increasing pair.

- t is empty, assign to t: s = [8,2], t = [3]

Fourth element 1:

- s[-1] = 2 > 1, can assign to s: s = [8,2,1], t = [3]

Fifth element 1:

- s[-1] = 1 >= 1, can assign to s: s = [8,2,1,1], t = [3]

Sixth element 7:

- s[-1] = 1 < 7, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 3 < 7, can't assign to t.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is s.

- But s[-1] = 1 < 7, which would create an increasing pair.

- Wait, maybe I should assign to the subsequence where I can maintain the decreasing order.

- Since neither allows, I have to choose one, perhaps assign to t.

- Assign to t: t = [3,7], s = [8,2,1,1]

Seventh element 4:

- s[-1] = 1 < 4, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 7 > 4, can assign to t: t = [3,7,4], s = [8,2,1,1]

Eighth element 3:

- s[-1] = 1 < 3, can't assign to s.

- t[-1] = 4 > 3, can assign to t: t = [3,7,4,3], s = [8,2,1,1]

Now, s = [8,2,1,1], t = [3,7,4,3]

Calculate penalties:

p(s): 8 > 2 > 1 >= 1, so no increasing pairs, p(s) = 0

p(t): 3 < 7 > 4 < 3, so p(t) = 1 (3 < 7)

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1.

Which matches the example.

So, this approach seems to work for this case as well.

Let me try another test case.

n = 5, a = [3,3,3,3,3]

All elements are equal.

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 3:

- Assign to s: s = [3], t = []

Second element 3:

- s[-1] = 3 == 3, can assign to s: s = [3,3], t = []

Third element 3:

- s[-1] = 3 == 3, can assign to s: s = [3,3,3], t = []

Fourth element 3:

- s[-1] = 3 == 3, can assign to s: s = [3,3,3,3], t = []

Fifth element 3:

- s[-1] = 3 == 3, can assign to s: s = [3,3,3,3,3], t = []

Total penalty: p(s) = 0 (no increasing pairs), p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Which matches the third test case.

Another test case:

n = 1, a = [1]

Assign to s: s = [1], t = []

Total penalty: p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Matches the fourth test case.

Last test case:

n = 2, a = [2,1]

Initialize s and t as empty.

First element 2:

- Assign to s: s = [2], t = []

Second element 1:

- s[-1] = 2 > 1, can assign to s: s = [2,1], t = []

Total penalty: p(s) = 0 (2 > 1), p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Which matches the fifth test case.

So, this approach seems to work for all the provided examples.

Let me try to formalize the algorithm:

- Initialize two empty lists, s and t.

- For each element in the array:

- If s is empty or s[-1] >= current element, assign to s.

- Else if t is empty or t[-1] >= current element, assign to t.

- Else, assign to the subsequence whose last element is smaller.

- After assigning all elements, calculate p
