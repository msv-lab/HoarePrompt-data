Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array of integers, and I need to determine the final MEX of the array after they've played optimally. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game rules:

1. There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

2. Players take turns, with Alice going first.

3. On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

4. On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`.

5. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

My task is to find out what the MEX will be when both play optimally.

Alright, so MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

Given that Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, I need to think about how their choices affect the final composition of `c`.

Let's consider that Alice will try to include the necessary elements in `c` to keep the MEX as high as possible, while Bob will try to disrupt that by removing elements that could help Alice.

Since Alice can choose which elements to add to `c`, and Bob can choose which elements to remove, their strategies will revolve around controlling which elements end up in `c`.

Given that Alice starts and they alternate turns, the number of elements in `c` will depend on the number of turns Alice gets to play.

Wait, actually, since Alice picks an element and adds it to `c` on her turn, and Bob just removes an element on his turn, the total number of elements in `c` will be equal to the number of times Alice plays.

Given that, in a game with `n` elements, the number of times Alice plays is ceil(n/2), because she goes first.

But actually, let's think carefully: if `n` is even, Alice and Bob each play `n/2` times. If `n` is odd, Alice plays `(n+1)/2` times, and Bob plays `(n-1)/2` times.

But in this game, Alice adds an element to `c` each time she plays, and Bob removes an element each time he plays, but he doesn't add it to `c`.

Wait, no, Bob removes an element from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`. So, the size of `c` will be equal to the number of times Alice plays, which is ceil(n/2).

But actually, no, because Bob also removes elements from `a`, which affects what's available for Alice to choose from.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that the game ends when all elements are deleted from `a`, and `c` contains elements chosen only by Alice.

Since Bob can remove elements, he can prevent Alice from choosing certain elements, which could affect the MEX of `c`.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, meaning she wants `c` to contain as many of the smaller non-negative integers as possible.

Bob, wanting to minimize the MEX, would try to prevent Alice from getting those smaller integers into `c`.

So, perhaps this is a game where Alice tries to collect the necessary numbers to keep the MEX high, and Bob tries to disrupt that.

I need to find the final MEX when both play optimally.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's analyze the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0, 0, 1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [0, 1], c = [1]

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1], c = [1, 0]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1, 0]

MEX of [1, 0] is 2.

Is this the optimal outcome?

Could Bob do better? If Bob chooses differently, say chooses 1 first:

- Alice chooses 1, a = [0, 0], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [0], c = [1]

- Alice chooses 0, a = [], c = [1, 0]

Same as before.

Another possible game:

- Alice chooses 0, a = [0, 1, 1], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [0, 1], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 1, a = [0], c = [0, 1]

- Bob chooses 0, a = [], c = [0, 1]

Again, MEX is 2.

Seems like no matter what, the MEX is 2.

Second test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 0, a = [1, 2, 3], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [2, 3], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 2, a = [3], c = [0, 2]

- Bob chooses 3, a = [], c = [0, 2]

MEX of [0, 2] is 1.

Is this the optimal outcome?

Alternatively:

- Alice chooses 3, a = [0, 1, 2], c = [3]

- Bob chooses 0, a = [1, 2], c = [3]

- Alice chooses 1, a = [2], c = [3, 1]

- Bob chooses 2, a = [], c = [3, 1]

MEX of [3, 1] is 0.

But Bob's goal is to minimize MEX, which seems contradictory because in this case, choosing 0 first leads to MEX 1, while choosing another element leads to MEX 0.

Wait, perhaps Bob can influence the MEX by choosing which elements to remove.

Let's see:

- Alice chooses 0, a = [1, 2, 3], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [2, 3], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 2, a = [3], c = [0, 2]

- Bob chooses 3, a = [], c = [0, 2]

MEX is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice chooses 0, a = [1, 2, 3], c = [0]

- Bob chooses 2, a = [1, 3], c = [0]

- Alice chooses 1, a = [3], c = [0, 1]

- Bob chooses 3, a = [], c = [0, 1]

MEX is 2.

Wait, now the MEX is 2.

So, depending on Bob's choices, the MEX can be different.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so in this case, he would choose to make MEX as small as possible.

Wait, but in the second scenario, MEX is 2, which is higher than in the first scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding Bob's strategy.

Actually, Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he would try to make sure that Alice doesn't get to have smaller numbers in `c`.

Wait, but in the second scenario where Bob chooses 2 first, leading to MEX 2, whereas in the first scenario where he chooses 1, leading to MEX 1, Bob's goal is to minimize MEX, so choosing 1 is better for him.

Wait, but in the second scenario, MEX is 2, which is higher, but Bob wants to minimize it.

So, perhaps Bob should choose in a way that forces the MEX to be lower.

In this case, choosing 1 leads to MEX 1, while choosing 2 leads to MEX 2.

So, to minimize MEX, Bob should choose 1.

Hence, the optimal MEX is 1.

Third test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 1]

Possible game:

- Alice chooses 1, a = [1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [], c = [1]

MEX of [1] is 0.

Alternatively:

- Alice chooses 1, a = [1], c = [1]

- Bob chooses 1, a = [], c = [1]

MEX is still 0.

So, MEX is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the MEX depends on which elements Alice can include in `c`, and Bob tries to prevent Alice from including certain elements.

I need to find a way to model this game to determine the optimal MEX.

Let me think about the game in terms of who has control over which elements.

Since Alice chooses elements to add to `c`, and Bob can remove elements, including those that Alice might want.

But Bob can only remove elements from `a`, not directly from `c`.

Wait, no, Bob just removes an element from `a`, so he can prevent Alice from choosing certain elements.

So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might need to achieve a higher MEX.

Alice, on the other hand, wants to select elements that help her maximize the MEX.

To maximize the MEX, Alice needs to have as many of the smaller integers in `c` as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, perhaps this is similar to a game where Alice is trying to collect a set of numbers, and Bob is trying to disrupt that.

I need to find a way to determine, for each possible MEX value, whether Alice can achieve it despite Bob's efforts.

In other words, for a given MEX value `k`, can Alice ensure that all numbers from 0 to k-1 are in `c`, even if Bob tries to prevent it?

If Alice can ensure that, then the MEX would be at least `k`.

I need to find the maximum `k` for which Alice can ensure that all numbers from 0 to k-1 are in `c`.

Alternatively, since MEX is the smallest missing number, the higher the MEX, the more of the smaller numbers are present in `c`.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice needs to include as many of the smaller numbers in `c` as possible.

Bob, to minimize MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including certain small numbers in `c`.

I need to model their strategies accordingly.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the initial array `a`.

Suppose I have the count of each number in `a`.

For each number `i`, if Alice wants to have `i` in `c`, she needs to choose it before Bob removes all instances of it.

But Bob can remove elements, potentially removing elements that Alice wants.

I need to think about how many times Alice gets to choose versus how many times Bob gets to choose.

Given that Alice goes first, and they alternate, the number of choices Alice has is ceil(n/2), and Bob has floor(n/2).

But perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the availability of each number.

For each number `i`, the number of times it appears in `a` is `cnt[i]`.

Alice wants to include `i` in `c`, but Bob can remove some instances of `i`.

The question is, can Alice ensure that at least one instance of `i` makes it into `c`, given that Bob can remove some instances.

Let's think about it in terms of the number of times Alice can pick `i` before Bob removes all instances.

If `cnt[i]` is the count of `i` in `a`, and Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, with Alice picking first, then the number of times Alice can pick `i` is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Because for each pair of elements, Bob can remove one, and Alice can pick one.

If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice gets the last one.

So, Alice can get ceil(cnt[i]/2) instances of `i` into `c`.

But, since `c` can have duplicates, but for MEX, we only care about the presence of each number, not the count.

So, for each `i`, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, then Alice can include `i` in `c`.

Wait, but Bob can be strategic about which elements he removes.

Actually, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants more.

So, perhaps this simple calculation doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each `i`, if cnt[i] is the count of `i` in `a`, then:

- If cnt[i] is 0, `i` is not present.

- If cnt[i] is 1, Alice can pick it on her first turn, or Bob can remove it.

- If cnt[i] is 2, Alice can pick one, Bob can remove one, so Alice gets one into `c`.

- If cnt[i] is 3, Alice can pick two, Bob removes one, so Alice gets two into `c`.

Wait, but in terms of just needing at least one instance of `i` in `c`, perhaps it's sufficient to check if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1.

But let's verify with some examples.

If cnt[i] = 1:

- Alice picks it first: c = [i], Bob removes something else.

- Bob picks it first: removes it, Alice can't include it.

So, Alice can include it only if she picks it before Bob removes it.

If cnt[i] = 1, Alice can include it only if she picks it on her turn.

But depending on the sequence, it might or might not happen.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of who has the majority of picks.

If the total number of picks is n, Alice has ceil(n/2) picks, Bob has floor(n/2).

But it's not just about the total picks, but about which elements they pick.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many of the small numbers as possible in `c`, while Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each number `i` from 0 to n, Alice needs to ensure that she can include `i` in `c`, despite Bob's removals.

I need to find the smallest `i` for which Alice cannot ensure that `i` is in `c`.

In other words, the MEX will be the smallest `i` such that Bob can prevent Alice from including `i` in `c`.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice needs to include as many `i`s as possible.

To minimize MEX, Bob needs to prevent Alice from including some `i`s.

I need to find the point where Bob can successfully prevent Alice from including some `i`.

Let me consider that for each `i`, the number of times `i` appears in `a` is `cnt[i]`.

Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2) instances of `i` in `c`, because for every two, Bob can remove one, and Alice can pick one.

If cnt[i] is odd, Alice gets one more.

So, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include `i` in `c`.

Therefore, for each `i`, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include `i`, else not.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest `i` for which ceil(cnt[i]/2) ==0, which means cnt[i] ==0.

Wait, but if cnt[i] ==0, obviously `i` is not present, so MEX is `i`.

But in the first test case, for i=0, cnt[0]=2, ceil(2/2)=1 >=1, so included.

i=1, cnt[1]=2, ceil(2/2)=1 >=1, included.

i=2, cnt[2]=0, so MEX is 2.

Which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

i=0, cnt[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 >=1, included.

i=1, cnt[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 >=1, included.

i=2, cnt[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 >=1, included.

i=3, cnt[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 >=1, included.

But in the example, the output is 1, which suggests that not all i up to 3 are included.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the order in which Alice and Bob make their choices.

Because even if cnt[i] >=1, Bob might choose to remove it if it's crucial.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

If Alice chooses 0, Bob can choose 1, then Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 3.

c=[0,2]

MEX=1

Alternatively, if Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 3, Bob chooses 2.

c=[1,3]

MEX=0

But Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would choose in a way that leads to MEX=1.

Wait, but in this case, it seems MEX=1 is possible.

Wait, perhaps Bob can't always achieve MEX=1, but in this specific case, he can.

Wait, perhaps my earlier logic is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to find the smallest i such that the number of times Alice can pick i is less than 1, meaning ceil(cnt[i]/2) <1, which is cnt[i]<2.

So, if cnt[i] ==0 or cnt[i] ==1, and Bob can remove it, then Alice can't include it.

Wait, but in the first test case, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0.

So, for i=0 and i=1, cnt[i]=2, ceil(2/2)=1 >=1, so included.

i=2, cnt[2]=0, so not included, MEX=2.

In the second test case, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

So, for i=0, cnt[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=0.5, which is >=1, so included.

i=1, cnt[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=0.5, which is >=1, so included.

i=2, cnt[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=0.5, which is >=1, so included.

i=3, cnt[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=0.5, which is >=1, so included.

But in the example, output is 1, which contradicts this.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Maybe I need to consider that for i where cnt[i]=1, Alice can include it only if she picks it before Bob removes it.

But in the second test case, there are four elements, and Alice gets to pick twice (since n=4, ceil(4/2)=2).

But Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants.

So, perhaps in some cases, even if cnt[i]=1, Alice can include it, but in others, she can't.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and check if the number of available picks for Alice is sufficient to include i.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say that for each i from 0 to n, in order to include i in c, Alice needs to pick it at least once, and Bob shouldn't remove all instances of it.

Given that, for each i, the number of times Alice can pick i is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

So, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include i in c.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest i where ceil(cnt[i]/2) ==0, which is when cnt[i]<2.

Wait, but in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for i=0,1,2,3.

So, ceil(1/2)=0.5 >=1, so according to this, all i from 0 to 3 are included, so MEX should be 4.

But in the example, output is 1, which contradicts this.

Hence, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can include i in c only if cnt[i] > floor(n/2).

Wait, why would that be?

Because if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then even if Bob removes floor(n/2) instances, there's still at least one left for Alice to pick.

Wait, let's think in terms of total picks.

Total picks are n, Alice picks ceil(n/2) times, Bob picks floor(n/2) times.

For a particular i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then even if Bob removes floor(n/2) instances, there's still at least one instance left for Alice to pick.

Hence, Alice can include i in c.

If cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), then Bob can remove all instances of i by picking them in his turns.

Hence, Alice cannot include i in c.

Therefore, the MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

Let's test this with the second test case.

n=4, floor(n/2)=2.

cnt[0]=1 <=2, so MEX=0.

But in the example, output is 1.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, perhaps Alice can still include i even if cnt[i] == floor(n/2), because she picks ceil(n/2) times.

Let me see.

In the second test case, n=4, floor(n/2)=2, ceil(n/2)=2.

cnt[i]=1 for i=0,1,2,3.

Alice picks 2 times, Bob picks 2 times.

Alice can pick two different i's, but since each i has only one instance, she can pick two different i's.

But Bob can remove two other i's.

Wait, but in this case, Alice can pick, say, 0 and 1, Bob removes 2 and 3.

Then c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But in the example, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] < ceil(n/2).

Because if cnt[i] >= ceil(n/2), Alice can pick it at least once, even if Bob removes floor(n/2) times.

If cnt[i] < ceil(n/2), Bob can remove enough to prevent Alice from picking it.

Let's test this with the second test case.

n=4, ceil(n/2)=2.

For i=0, cnt[0]=1 <2, so MEX=0.

But in the example, output is 1.

Contradiction again.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider that Alice can pick multiple times, but each time she picks a different element.

Wait, but she can pick the same element if it's available multiple times.

But in the second test case, all elements are unique, so she has to pick different elements each time.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3].

Alice picks first, say picks 0, c=[0].

Bob picks next, picks 1.

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2].

Bob picks 3.

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, Alice picks 1 first, c=[1].

Bob picks 0, a=[2,3].

Alice picks 2, c=[1,2].

Bob picks 3.

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would choose the first option, leading to MEX=1.

Wait, but in this case, MEX=1 is possible.

But according to my earlier logic, since cnt[0]=1 < ceil(n/2)=2, MEX should be 0.

But in the example, it's 1.

So perhaps my condition is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include i in c if cnt[i] > floor(n/2).

Because Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements, so if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), at least one remains for Alice to pick.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

In the second test case, floor(n/2)=2, cnt[i]=1 <=2 for all i, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Still a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice needs cnt[i] >= ceil((n+1)/2).

Wait, let's try it.

In the second test case, n=4, ceil((4+1)/2)=3.

cnt[i]=1 <3, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Hmm.

I need to find another way.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick elements.

Alice picks ceil(n/2) times.

Bob picks floor(n/2) times.

Alice wants to include as many small i's as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

For each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can pick at least one instance of i, because Bob can remove at most floor(n/2) elements.

Hence, Alice can include i in c.

If cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), Bob can remove all instances of i.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

In the second test case, n=4, floor(n/2)=2.

cnt[i]=1 <=2 for all i, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if cnt[i] == floor(n/2), and there are multiple i's with cnt[i] == floor(n/2), Bob can choose to remove those to prevent Alice from including them.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for all i, and floor(n/2)=2, so cnt[i] < floor(n/2), meaning Bob can remove enough to prevent Alice from including them.

Hence, MEX should be 0, but in the example, it's 1.

I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can include i in c if cnt[i] > floor(n/2).

Because Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements, and if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), at least one remains for Alice to pick.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

In the second test case, floor(n/2)=2, cnt[i]=1 <=2 for all i, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if multiple i's have cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include them, but she needs to prioritize lower i's.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for all i, which is <= floor(n/2)=2, so MEX should be 0, but it's 1.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that Alice can include i if cnt[i] >= ceil((cnt[i]+1)/2).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me try to think in terms of the game progression.

Alice and Bob take turns, Alice starts.

Let's simulate the game for the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[0,2], MEX=1

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

c=[1,2], MEX=0

Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would choose the first option where MEX=1.

Hence, the minimal possible MEX is 1.

So, in this case, MEX=1.

But according to my earlier logic, since cnt[i]=1 <= floor(n/2)=2 for all i, MEX should be 0.

But in reality, it's 1.

Hence, my logic is flawed.

I need to find a better way to determine the MEX.

Let me consider that Alice can include i in c if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), because Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements.

If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), at least one remains for Alice to pick.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i for which cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

In the second test case, floor(n/2)=2, cnt[i]=1 <=2 for all i, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if cnt[i] == floor(n/2), Alice can still include i if she picks it before Bob removes all instances.

Wait, in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 and floor(n/2)=2, so cnt[i] < floor(n/2), meaning Bob can remove the single instance before Alice can pick it.

Hence, MEX should be 0, but in the example, it's 1.

I'm confused.

Maybe I need to consider that Alice can include i if cnt[i] >= ceil((n+1)/2).

In the second test case, ceil(5/2)=3, cnt[i]=1 <3, so MEX=0.

But again, in the example, it's 1.

This isn't adding up.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that the MEX is determined by the numbers that Alice can include in c.

Alice can include ceil(n/2) numbers in c, and Bob can remove floor(n/2) numbers.

Hence, the numbers that remain in c are those that Alice chooses.

So, Alice can choose ceil(n/2) numbers to include in c.

To maximize MEX, she wants to include the smallest possible numbers.

Bob, to minimize MEX, wants to prevent Alice from including small numbers.

Hence, the MEX will be the smallest number that Alice cannot include in c.

So, I need to find the smallest i such that the number of available i's is less than the number of times Alice needs to pick i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through i from 0 to n, and keep track of how many picks Alice has left to include i.

Initialize available_picks_by_alice = ceil(n/2)

For each i from 0 to n:

if cnt[i] > 0:

if available_picks_by_alice > 0:

include i in c

available_picks_by_alice -=1

else:

MEX = i

break

else:

MEX = i

break

Wait, but in the second test case, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1

available_picks_by_alice = 2

So, include 0 and 1 in c, then MEX=2

But in the example, it's 1.

So, this doesn't match.

Perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants.

Hence, I need to account for Bob's removals in a way that minimizes the MEX.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different perspective.

I recall that in some games, the outcome can be determined by the number of times a player can perform an action.

In this case, Alice can perform ceil(n/2) actions of picking an element to include in c.

Bob can perform floor(n/2) actions of removing an element.

Hence, the total number of elements removed is floor(n/2), and the number of elements in c is ceil(n/2).

But the specific elements in c depend on Alice's choices and Bob's interference.

I need to find a way to determine which elements Alice can include in c, considering Bob's attempts to remove elements that Alice wants.

This seems similar to a game where Alice is trying to collect a set of elements, and Bob is trying to disrupt that by removing elements.

Perhaps I can model this as a game where Alice needs to collect certain elements, and Bob tries to prevent her from collecting them.

In such games, the outcome often depends on the number of times each player can act and the availability of the elements they need.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick an element before Bob can remove it.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through the numbers in order and see if Alice can include them in c.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm:

1. Calculate available picks for Alice: ceil(n/2)

2. Sort the numbers from 0 to n-1 in ascending order.

3. For each
