Alright, I have this problem here about Alice and Bob playing a game on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's see.

So, the game is played on an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from `a`, deletes it, but doesn't add it to `c`. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final score will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. From the description, MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example, MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. For [3,1,0,1], it's 2, and for [0,3,1,2], it's 4.

So, the goal is to have the highest possible MEX in `c`, considering that Alice is trying to maximize it and Bob is trying to minimize it. Since Alice chooses elements to put into `c` and Bob just removes elements from `a`, Bob can influence which elements Alice can choose in the future.

Let me think about how the game progresses. The total number of moves is `n`, and since Alice starts, she will make the first move, then Bob, then Alice, and so on, alternating turns until `a` is empty.

Wait, actually, the problem says that Alice starts with an empty array `c`, and on her turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from `a`, deletes it, but doesn't add it to `c`. So, the sequence of moves would be: Alice picks an element to add to `c` and removes it from `a`, then Bob removes an element from `a`, and so on, alternating turns until `a` is empty.

I need to find out which elements end up in `c` and what their MEX is.

Let me consider the number of elements Alice can add to `c`. Since Alice and Bob alternate turns, and Alice goes first, in `n` total moves, Alice will have made `ceil(n/2)` moves, and Bob will have made `floor(n/2)` moves. Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If `n` is even:

- Alice makes `n/2` moves.

- Bob makes `n/2` moves.

If `n` is odd:

- Alice makes `(n+1)/2` moves.

- Bob makes `(n-1)/2` moves.

Because Alice starts and they alternate.

So, the number of elements in `c` will be the number of times Alice gets to pick, which is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Wait, but actually, Alice picks an element and removes it from `a`, and Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`. So, in total, `n` elements are removed, with Alice removing `(n + 1) // 2` elements (since she starts and they alternate), and Bob removing `n - (n + 1) // 2` elements.

Wait, more carefully:

- Total moves: `n`.

- Alice moves: ceil(n / 2).

- Bob moves: floor(n / 2).

Because Alice starts.

So, the size of `c` will be ceil(n / 2), since Alice adds one element to `c` each time she plays.

Now, I need to determine which elements end up in `c` such that their MEX is maximized, considering that Bob is trying to minimize that MEX.

This seems like a game where Alice wants to include as many low numbers in `c` as possible to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to interfere with that.

Wait, actually, no. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, which means she wants to have as many low numbers as possible in `c`, because MEX is the smallest missing number. So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have 0, 1, 2, ..., up to some k in `c`, and then k+1 is missing.

But Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having a complete sequence in `c`.

Wait, but Bob doesn't add anything to `c`; he just removes elements from `a`. So, by removing elements from `a`, he can limit the choices available to Alice.

Wait, but Alice chooses which element to add to `c`, and Bob chooses which element to remove.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to add to `c`, thereby forcing Alice to add other elements.

Wait, no, Bob removes an element from `a`, but he doesn't get to choose what Alice adds to `c`; Alice chooses what to add to `c` from the remaining elements in `a`.

So, perhaps Bob can try to remove elements that Alice would prefer to add to `c`, thereby forcing Alice to add less desirable elements.

But it's not entirely clear how their moves interact.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the set of elements that Alice can add to `c`. Since she adds ceil(n/2) elements to `c`, and Bob removes floor(n/2) elements from `a`, but not necessarily from what Alice would choose.

Wait, no, Bob removes elements from `a`, which reduces the pool of available elements for Alice to choose from in her future turns.

But Alice gets to choose which elements to add to `c` from the remaining elements in `a`.

So, perhaps I need to think in terms of the elements that Alice can secure for `c`.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me look at small examples to get some intuition.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

So, for n=4, arr=[0,0,1,1], the output is 2.

In this case, possible sequences:

- Alice chooses 0, c=[0], a=[0,1,1]

- Bob removes 0, a=[1,1]

- Alice chooses 1, c=[0,1], a=[]

- Bob removes nothing.

- MEX of c=[0,1] is 2.

Another sequence:

- Alice chooses 1, c=[1], a=[0,0,1]

- Bob removes 1, a=[0,0]

- Alice chooses 0, c=[1,0], a=[]

- Bob removes nothing.

- MEX of c=[1,0] is 2.

Seems like regardless of their choices, MEX is 2.

Another test case:

n=4, arr=[0,1,2,3]

Output:1

Possible sequence:

- Alice chooses 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob removes 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice chooses 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob removes 3, a=[]

- MEX of c=[0,2] is 1.

Another sequence:

- Alice chooses 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob removes 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice chooses 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob removes 3, a=[]

- MEX of c=[1,2] is 0.

But the output is 1, so perhaps in optimal play, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Looking at the output, it's 1 for this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Looking at the code provided:

def func_1(arr):

freq = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in arr:

freq[i] += 1

cou = 0

for i in range(n + 1):

if freq[i] >= 2:

continue

if freq[i] == 1:

cou += 1

if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:

print(i)

break

So, this code counts the frequency of each number up to n in the array, and then iterates from 0 to n+1, checking certain conditions to decide which number to print as the MEX.

Wait, but in the first test case, arr=[0,0,1,1], freq=[2,2], so freq[i]>=2 for i=0 and i=1.

Then, cou starts at 0.

For i=0, freq[0]>=2, skip.

i=1, freq[1]>=2, skip.

i=2, freq[2]==0, so cou==0, which is not ==2, and freq[i]==0, so print 2.

Which matches the output.

In the second test case, arr=[0,1,2,3], freq=[1,1,1,1], so for i=0, freq[0]==1, cou=1.

i=1, freq[1]==1, cou=2, which equals 2, so print 1.

Which matches the output.

In the third test case, arr=[1,1], freq=[0,2], so for i=0, freq[0]==0, cou=0, which is not ==2, and freq[i]==0, so print 0.

Which matches the output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But is this the correct approach?

I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

The logic seems to be: iterate from 0 to n+1, and for each i, if freq[i]>=2, skip.

If freq[i]==1, increment cou.

If cou==2 or freq[i]==0, print i and break.

Wait, why is this correct?

Let me think about what this is doing.

In the first test case, arr=[0,0,1,1], freq=[2,2], so skip both 0 and 1, then at i=2, freq[2]==0, so print 2.

In the second test case, arr=[0,1,2,3], freq=[1,1,1,1], so for i=0, freq[0]==1, cou=1.

i=1, freq[1]==1, cou=2, which equals 2, so print 1.

In the third test case, arr=[1,1], freq=[0,2], so for i=0, freq[0]==0, so print 0.

So, it seems to be finding the first number that either appears zero times or appears once, and when two numbers appear once, it picks the smallest such number.

But is this really equivalent to the MEX of c when both play optimally?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about which elements end up in c.

Given that Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it.

Wait, Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants c to have as many low numbers as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, meaning he wants to ensure that some low numbers are not in c.

Given that Alice gets to choose which elements to put in c, and Bob can remove elements from a, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from putting certain elements into c by removing them.

Wait, but Alice chooses first and can select an element to add to c.

Then Bob removes an element from a.

Then Alice chooses another element to add to c, and so on.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to add to c in the future.

But Alice gets to choose which elements to add to c.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times an element appears in the original array.

If an element appears only once, then if Alice picks it, it goes into c, and if Bob picks it, it's removed and doesn't go into c.

If an element appears twice, then even if Bob removes one, Alice can still pick the other to put into c.

If an element appears three times, Alice can pick two, or Bob can remove one, etc.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of frequencies.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the array.

For each number i from 0 to n, count how many times it appears in arr.

Now, Alice wants to include as many low numbers as possible in c, while Bob wants to prevent that.

Given that Alice gets to choose which elements to include in c, and Bob can remove elements from a, perhaps Bob can try to remove elements that Alice would want to include in c.

But since Alice chooses first and can select which element to add to c, perhaps she can secure certain elements.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

Suppose a number i appears freq[i] times in arr.

Alice can try to include i in c as many times as possible, but since c only contains distinct elements (since MEX is about the smallest missing integer), duplicates don't help.

Wait, no, c can contain duplicates, but MEX is defined based on the presence of each number, not the count.

But in the MEX definition, it's just whether the number is present or not.

So, duplicates in c don't help; only the unique elements in c matter for MEX.

Wait, actually, the problem says "appends that element to c", so c can contain duplicates.

But in the MEX definition, it's the smallest non-negative integer not present in c, regardless of duplicates.

But, in the examples provided, c seems to contain duplicates.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"Example game:

1. Alice chooses the element 1. After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1].

2. Bob chooses the element 0. After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1].

3. Alice chooses the element 0. After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0].

4. Bob chooses the element 1. After this move, a=[] and c=[1,0]."

So, c=[1,0], which contains duplicates if there were multiple 1's or 0's added.

Wait, in this example, arr=[2,2,1], which has duplicates.

Wait, no, in this particular example in the note, arr=[2,2,1], but in the sample input, arr=[0,0,1,1].

Wait, in the first test case, arr=[0,0,1,1], and c=[1,0], which has no duplicates.

But in the note, it's a different example with arr=[2,2,1], and c=[1], then c=[1,0], but I think the MEX is determined by the unique elements in c.

Wait, actually, the MEX is defined based on the array c, regardless of duplicates.

But in practice, duplicates don't affect the MEX.

So, for c=[1,0], the MEX is 2, same as c=[0,1], or c=[1,0,0], etc.

So, perhaps I can consider c as a set for the purpose of computing MEX.

But in terms of the game, Alice is choosing elements to add to c, and Bob is removing elements from a.

Now, I need to find out, given optimal play, what will be the MEX of c.

I need to find a way to model this game.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears in arr.

Suppose a number i appears freq[i] times.

Alice wants to include i in c at least once, to ensure that i is present in c, which helps in maximizing the MEX.

Bob wants to prevent Alice from including i in c.

Given that, for each number i, if freq[i] >= 2, then even if Bob removes one, Alice can still include one in c.

If freq[i] == 1, then if Bob removes it, it won't be in c.

If freq[i] == 0, it's not in a to begin with.

Wait, but freq[i] is the count in arr.

So, for each i from 0 to n, freq[i] is the number of times i appears in arr.

Now, Alice wants to include as many i's in c as possible, specifically the smallest i's.

Bob wants to prevent that.

Given that, perhaps the numbers that appear at least twice are secure for Alice to include in c, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can still include another.

For numbers that appear only once, Alice may or may not be able to include them in c, depending on Bob's actions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include a number in c.

If freq[i] >= 2, Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can still include another.

If freq[i] == 1, then Alice can include i in c only if she picks it before Bob removes it.

But since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, Bob will try to remove elements that Alice wants to include in c to minimize the MEX.

So, for freq[i] >= 2, Alice can ensure that i is in c.

For freq[i] == 1, Alice may or may not be able to include i in c, depending on the game play.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves Alice has versus the number of elements that appear only once.

Let me define:

- Let s be the set of unique elements in arr, i.e., elements with freq[i] == 1.

- Let d be the set of elements that appear at least twice, freq[i] >= 2.

Now, Alice has ceil(n/2) moves to include elements in c.

Bob has floor(n/2) moves to remove elements from a.

Bob can try to remove elements that Alice wants to include in c.

But Alice can choose which elements to include in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each element appears.

Let me consider that:

- For each element i that appears freq[i] times.

- If freq[i] >= 2, Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can still include another.

- For elements with freq[i] == 1, Alice can include them in c only if she picks them before Bob removes them.

So, in the optimal play, Alice will try to include as many unique elements as possible, and Bob will try to remove those unique elements to prevent Alice from including them.

So, for elements that appear at least twice, Alice can always include them in c.

For elements that appear only once, Alice can include some of them in c, depending on how many moves she has and how Bob plays.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of unique elements that appear only once.

Let me define:

- Let u be the number of elements that appear exactly once in arr.

- Alice has ceil(n/2) moves to include elements in c.

- Bob has floor(n/2) moves to remove elements from a.

- For elements that appear at least twice, Alice can include them in c.

- For elements that appear only once, Alice can include some of them in c, but Bob can try to remove them.

So, the number of elements that Alice can include in c from the unique elements is ceil(n/2) - number of elements that appear at least twice.

Wait, perhaps not exactly.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of elements that appear at least twice and the number that appear only once.

Let me denote:

- Let d be the number of elements that appear at least twice.

- Let u be the number of elements that appear exactly once.

Then, Alice can include d elements in c for sure, since she can always include at least one occurrence of each element that appears at least twice.

For the u unique elements, Alice has ceil(n/2) - d moves to include them in c.

But Bob has floor(n/2) moves to remove elements from a.

Bob can try to remove the unique elements that Alice wants to include in c.

So, the number of unique elements that Alice can include in c is ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of unique elements that Alice can secure in c.

Let me think differently.

Total moves: n.

Alice's moves: ceil(n/2).

Bob's moves: floor(n/2).

Elements that appear at least twice: Alice can include them in c.

Elements that appear exactly once: Alice and Bob compete over them.

So, the number of elements that Alice can include in c is d (from elements that appear at least twice) plus some from the unique elements.

The number of unique elements that Alice can include is ceil(n/2) - d, assuming that Bob uses his moves to prevent Alice from including as many unique elements as possible.

Wait, perhaps Alice can include min(u, ceil(n/2) - d) unique elements in c.

Therefore, the total number of unique elements in c would be d + min(u, ceil(n/2) - d).

But I need to consider that Bob can interfere.

Wait, perhaps it's d + ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2), but that seems off.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of unique elements that Alice can secure in c.

Let me consider that Alice can secure d elements from the elements that appear at least twice.

Then, with her remaining moves, she can try to include unique elements, but Bob can try to prevent her.

So, the number of moves Alice has left after including d elements is ceil(n/2) - d.

Bob has floor(n/2) moves to remove elements.

So, the number of unique elements that Alice can include in c is max(ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2), 0).

Wait, that seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps it's min(u, ceil(n/2) - d).

Because Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) - d unique elements, but there are only u unique elements.

But Bob can interfere by removing some unique elements.

So, the number of unique elements that Alice can include is ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2).

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2).

But that could be negative.

Wait, perhaps the number of unique elements Alice can include is ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2).

If ceil(n/2) - d > floor(n/2), then Alice can include ceil(n/2) - d - floor(n/2) unique elements.

Else, she can include zero.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of unique elements that Alice can secure.

Let me consider that Alice can secure d elements from the elements that appear at least twice.

Then, with her remaining moves, she can try to include unique elements, but Bob can try to remove them.

So, for each unique element, Alice and Bob compete to determine whether it ends up in c or not.

Alice needs to include as many unique elements as possible, while Bob tries to prevent that.

So, for each unique element, Alice needs to include it before Bob removes it.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

So, if ceil(n/2) > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one unique element.

Wait, for n odd, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2.

So, (n+1)/2 - (n-1)/2 = 1.

So, Alice can include at least one unique element.

For n even, ceil(n/2) = n/2, floor(n/2) = n/2.

So, Alice can include zero unique elements.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, for n even, Alice has n/2 moves, Bob has n/2 moves.

For each unique element, Alice needs to include it before Bob removes it.

So, if Alice and Bob each have n/2 moves, then Bob can remove all unique elements before Alice includes them.

Therefore, for n even, Alice cannot include any unique elements beyond those that appear at least twice.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, arr=[0,0,1,1], output is 2.

In this case, d=2 (0 and 1 appear twice), u=0.

So, Alice can include both 0 and 1 in c, and MEX is 2.

In the second sample, n=4, arr=[0,1,2,3], d=0 (all elements appear once), u=4.

Alice has
