Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array of integers. Alice starts with an empty array c. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from the original array a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from a, and just deletes it from a. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in c. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final score will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example, MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not. MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4, as 0,1,2,3 are present, but 4 is not.

So, the goal is to have c such that its MEX is as large as possible for Alice, but Bob is trying to minimize it. I need to think about how their actions affect the MEX of c.

Let me think about the game mechanics. Alice picks an element to add to c and removes it from a, while Bob just removes an element from a without adding it to c. So, Alice is controlling what goes into c, and Bob is trying to limit what Alice can do by removing elements that Alice might want.

Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX, she would want to include as many of the smaller numbers in c as possible, so that the MEX is higher. Bob, wanting to minimize the MEX, would try to prevent Alice from including certain elements in c.

But wait, Bob can remove elements that Alice might need. So, Bob could remove elements that Alice wants to put in c, thereby forcing Alice to pick other elements.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

One possible game play is:

1. Alice picks 1 and adds it to c, so c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

2. Bob picks 0 and removes it, a = [0,1]

3. Alice picks 0 and adds it to c, c = [1,0], a = [1]

4. Bob picks 1 and removes it, a is empty.

So, c = [1,0], MEX is 2.

Is this the optimal play? Let's see if Alice can get a higher MEX or if Bob can force a lower MEX.

Suppose Alice picks 0 first:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0,1,1]

2. Bob picks 0, a = [1,1]

3. Alice picks 1, c = [0,1], a = [1]

4. Bob picks 1, a is empty.

c = [0,1], MEX is 2 again.

Another play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

2. Bob picks 1, a = [0,0]

3. Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [0]

4. Bob picks 0, a is empty.

c = [1,0], MEX is 2.

Seems like no matter what, the MEX ends up being 2 in this case.

Let's look at the second example:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

Possible play:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 1, a = [2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c = [0,2], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a is empty.

c = [0,2], MEX is 1.

Wait, but Alice could have picked 1 instead of 2.

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,2,3]

2. Bob picks 0, a = [2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c = [1,2], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a is empty.

c = [1,2], MEX is 0.

But in the first play, c = [0,2], MEX is 1, which is better for Alice than MEX=0.

So, Alice should pick 0 first to maximize the MEX.

But in this case, Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by picking 1 after Alice picks 0.

Alternatively:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 1, a = [2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c = [0,2], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a is empty.

c = [0,2], MEX is 1.

Or:

1. Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 2, a = [1,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c = [0,1], a = [3]

4. Bob picks 3, a is empty.

c = [0,1], MEX is 2.

So, depending on Bob's choices, MEX can be 1 or 2. But Bob wants to minimize it, so he would choose to make MEX=1.

Hence, the minimal MEX Alice can achieve against Bob's optimal play is 1.

Wait, but in one scenario, MEX is 2. But since Bob is trying to minimize, he can force MEX to be 1.

So, for this case, the answer is 1.

Third example:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

Possible play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

2. Bob picks 1, a is empty.

c = [1], MEX is 0.

Another play:

1. Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

2. Bob picks 1, a is empty.

c = [1], MEX is 0.

So, MEX is always 0 in this case.

From these examples, it seems like the MEX depends on which elements Alice manages to include in c.

I need to find a general strategy for Alice and Bob to play optimally.

Let me think about the game in terms of who gets to choose which elements go into c.

Alice gets to choose which elements go into c, but Bob can interfere by removing elements that Alice might need.

I need to think about which elements are critical for achieving a higher MEX.

MEX is determined by the smallest missing non-negative integer in c.

So, to achieve a MEX of k, Alice needs to have all integers from 0 to k-1 in c.

Bob wants to prevent that by removing elements that Alice needs.

Let me consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

I need to find out, for each possible k, whether Alice can ensure that she has all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c, despite Bob's attempts to prevent it.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider that the game is about Alice trying to collect certain numbers, and Bob trying to disrupt her collection.

I need to think about the number of times each number appears in the array.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice can potentially collect it more than once, but since she only needs one of each for MEX purposes, maybe multiple occurrences don't help much.

Wait, for MEX, Alice only needs to have each number from 0 to k-1 at least once to achieve MEX k.

Bob can try to prevent this by removing those numbers.

But Alice gets to choose which elements to add to c, and Bob can only remove elements.

Wait, no, on Bob's turn, he picks and removes an element from a, without adding it to c.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to add to c.

But Alice chooses which elements to add to c, and which ones to let Bob remove.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total number of turns.

The game ends when a is empty, so there are n turns in total.

Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice starting.

So, if n is even, each plays n/2 times.

If n is odd, Alice plays (n+1)/2 times, Bob plays (n-1)/2 times.

Alice gets to choose which elements to add to c on her turns, and Bob removes elements on his turns.

Wait, but Bob removes elements without adding to c.

So, the size of c at the end will be equal to the number of Alice's turns, since she adds one element to c each time she plays.

Wait, no, actually, Alice adds one element to c on each of her turns, and Bob removes one element on his turns, but doesn't add to c.

Wait, no, Bob just removes an element from a, he doesn't add to c.

So, the size of c will be equal to the number of times Alice plays.

Wait, no, Alice adds one element to c and removes it from a on her turn.

Bob removes one element from a on his turn.

So, total elements removed from a is n, and elements added to c is equal to the number of times Alice plays.

Since there are n elements, and each turn removes one element, the game ends after n turns.

Alice plays on turns 1,3,5,... and Bob on turns 2,4,6,...

So, if n is even, Alice plays n/2 times, Bob plays n/2 times.

If n is odd, Alice plays (n+1)/2 times, Bob plays (n-1)/2 times.

But the size of c is equal to the number of times Alice plays, since she adds one element to c each time.

So, the size of c is either n/2 (if n even) or (n+1)/2 (if n odd).

But I need to maximize the MEX of c, which is the smallest missing integer in c.

To maximize MEX, Alice needs to have as many small integers in c as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having certain small integers in c.

I need to think about how many times each number appears in a.

If a number appears only once in a, and Alice doesn't pick it, then it will be removed by Bob, and Alice won't be able to include it in c.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice can afford to have Bob remove some of them.

So, for each number i, count the number of times it appears in a, say freq[i].

If freq[i] >= 2, then Alice can ensure that at least one of them is added to c, because even if Bob removes one, there's another one left for Alice to pick.

If freq[i] == 1, then Alice must pick it on her turn to include it in c, otherwise Bob can pick it and remove it, and it won't be in c.

If freq[i] == 0, which can't happen since a is initially of size n and contains only numbers from 0 to n-1.

Wait, no, a contains n integers, each in the range 0 to n-1, but duplicates are allowed.

So, freq[i] can be >=1 for i from 0 to n-1.

Now, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small i's in c as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each i from 0 to n:

Check if Alice can include all i's from 0 to i-1 in c, despite Bob's efforts.

If she can, then MEX is at least i.

Find the smallest i where she can't do that.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times Alice gets to pick elements.

Let me think differently.

Letâ€™s consider that Alice gets to pick k elements to include in c, where k is ceil(n/2), since she plays ceil(n/2) times.

Bob gets to pick floor(n/2) elements to remove.

Alice wants to select elements such that c contains as many small integers as possible.

Bob wants to remove elements that Alice needs to achieve a higher MEX.

So, to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve against Bob's optimal play, I need to see what is the smallest i such that Alice can include all j < i in c, considering Bob's interference.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about it in terms of frequency counts.

Suppose I have freq[i] being the number of times i appears in a.

Alice needs to have all j < i in c to achieve MEX i.

To have all j < i in c, Alice needs to include each j < i at least once in c.

But Bob can remove some of these j's.

So, for each j, if freq[j] >=2, Alice can ensure that at least one j makes it to c, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can pick the other.

If freq[j] ==1, Alice must pick j on her turn to include it in c, otherwise Bob can remove it.

So, for MEX to be i, Alice needs to have all j < i in c.

To have all j < i in c, for each j < i:

- if freq[j] >=2, it's fine, Alice can ensure one is in c.

- if freq[j] ==1, Alice must pick it on her turn.

So, the number of freq[j]==1 for j < i is the number of elements that Alice must pick on her turn to include in c.

Letâ€™s denote count = number of j < i with freq[j] ==1.

Then, Alice needs at least count turns to pick these elements.

Alice has total of ceil(n/2) turns.

So, for MEX i, Alice needs at least count turns to pick the necessary elements.

If ceil(n/2) >= count, then Alice can include all j < i in c, and MEX can be i.

But Bob will try to prevent this by choosing elements that Alice needs.

Wait, but in reality, Bob can remove elements that Alice needs, but Alice can prioritize picking the necessary elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of elements that Alice must include versus the number of turns she has.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- For a given i, to achieve MEX i, Alice needs to have all j < i in c.

- For each j < i:

- if freq[j] >=2, Alice can ensure one is in c.

- if freq[j] ==1, Alice must pick it on her turn.

So, the number of j < i with freq[j] ==1 is the number of mandatory picks for Alice.

Letâ€™s denote this as mandatory_i.

Alice has ceil(n/2) turns.

If mandatory_i <= ceil(n/2), then Alice can include all necessary j < i in c, and MEX can be i.

Otherwise, she cannot.

So, the minimal i where mandatory_i > ceil(n/2) will be the MEX.

Wait, but Bob can try to interfere by removing elements that Alice needs.

However, in the above reasoning, I considered that Alice can pick the necessary elements if she has enough turns.

But perhaps Bob can force a lower MEX by removing critical elements that Alice needs.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice needs, even if they appear only once.

But if freq[j] ==1, and Alice doesn't pick it, Bob can remove it, making it unavailable for c.

So, for j < i, if freq[j] ==1, Alice must pick it on her turn to include it in c.

So, the number of such j's is the number of mandatory picks for Alice.

If the number of mandatory picks is less than or equal to the number of turns Alice has, she can include all necessary j's in c, and achieve MEX i.

Otherwise, she cannot.

So, the smallest i where mandatory_i > ceil(n/2) is the MEX.

Hence, I can iterate i from 0 to n+1, compute mandatory_i, and find the smallest i where mandatory_i > ceil(n/2).

Wait, but ceil(n/2) is the number of turns Alice has.

Wait, but in the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2

For i=0: mandatory_0=0 (since no j <0), ceil(4/2)=2, 0 <=2, so MEX can be 0.

For i=1: mandatory_1=0 (only j=0 with freq[0]>=2), so MEX can be 1.

For i=2: mandatory_2=0 (j=0 and j=1 both have freq>=2), so MEX can be 2.

But in the example, MEX is 2, which matches.

In the second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

For i=0: mandatory_0=0, ceil(4/2)=2, 0<=2, so MEX can be 0.

For i=1: mandatory_1=1 (only j=0 with freq[0]==1), ceil(4/2)=2, 1<=2, so MEX can be 1.

For i=2: mandatory_2=2 (j=0 and j=1 both have freq==1), ceil(4/2)=2, 2<=2, so MEX can be 2.

For i=3: mandatory_3=3 (j=0,1,2 all have freq==1), ceil(4/2)=2, 3 > 2, so MEX is 3.

But in the example, MEX is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, in the second test case, according to the example, the output is 1, but according to this, MEX can be up to 2.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice has to reserve some of her turns for picking elements that are not necessary for MEX, but Bob can force her to pick those.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can force Alice to pick elements that are not necessary for achieving a higher MEX.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to find the minimal i such that the number of j < i with freq[j]==1 is greater than the number of turns Alice has.

In the second test case:

n=4, freq=[1,1,1,1]

For i=0: mandatory_0=0, ceil(4/2)=2, 0 <=2, MEX can be 0.

i=1: mandatory_1=1, 1<=2, MEX can be 1.

i=2: mandatory_2=2, 2<=2, MEX can be 2.

i=3: mandatory_3=3, 3>2, so MEX is 3.

But in the example, MEX is 1, which suggests that my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice might need to use some of her turns to block Bob, or to pick elements that are not necessary for MEX, but Bob forces her to.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice might have to use some of her turns to pick elements that are not necessary for achieving MEX i, and only has a certain number of turns to pick the necessary elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the total number of turns Alice has to pick the necessary elements, considering that Bob can force her to waste some turns.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the number of elements that Alice must pick to include in c to achieve MEX i, and see if she has enough turns to pick them, considering Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through possible MEX values and check if Alice can achieve that MEX with her available turns.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a given MEX value i, to achieve it, Alice needs to have all j < i in c.

For each j < i:

- if freq[j] >=2, Alice can ensure one is in c.

- if freq[j] ==1, Alice must pick it on her turn.

So, the number of mandatory picks is the number of j < i with freq[j]==1.

Alice has ceil(n/2) turns.

If mandatory_i <= ceil(n/2), then Alice can achieve MEX i.

Otherwise, she cannot.

So, the minimal i where mandatory_i > ceil(n/2) is the MEX.

In the second test case:

n=4, freq=[1,1,1,1]

ceil(4/2)=2

i=0: mandatory=0 <=2, can achieve MEX 0

i=1: mandatory=1 <=2, can achieve MEX 1

i=2: mandatory=2 <=2, can achieve MEX 2

i=3: mandatory=3 >2, cannot achieve MEX 3

So, according to this, MEX should be 3, but in the example, it's 1.

Wait, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can force Alice to pick elements that are not necessary for achieving MEX i, thereby reducing the number of turns Alice has available to pick the necessary elements.

In the second test case, Bob can remove elements that Alice needs for higher MEX, forcing her to pick elements that are not critical, thus preventing her from achieving a higher MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice has to use some of her turns to pick elements that are not necessary for MEX, and only has remaining turns to pick the necessary elements.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of turns Alice needs to pick the necessary elements for MEX i, and see if she has enough turns after accounting for Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through possible MEX values and check if Alice can include all required elements in c, given Bob's optimal play.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute frequency counts for each number.

Then, for each possible MEX value i from 0 to n+1:

Compute the number of j < i with freq[j]==1. This is the number of mandatory picks.

If the number of mandatory picks is less than or equal to ceil(n/2), then MEX can be i.

Otherwise, it cannot.

So, the smallest i where mandatory picks > ceil(n/2) is the MEX.

But in the second test case, this gives MEX=3, which doesn't match the example output of 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust for the fact that Bob can force Alice to pick elements that are not necessary for MEX i, thereby reducing the number of turns available for picking necessary elements.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], freq=[1,1,1,1]

Alice has ceil(4/2)=2 turns.

To achieve MEX=2, she needs to have j=0 and j=1 in c.

Since freq[0]=1 and freq[1]=1, both are mandatory picks.

So, she needs to use both of her turns to pick 0 and 1.

But Bob has floor(4/2)=2 turns as well.

Bob can remove 2 and 3, which are not necessary for MEX=2.

So, Alice can pick 0 and 1, and c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But in the example, it's said that MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Bob can remove elements that Alice needs for higher MEX, but in this case, since all elements are necessary for higher MEX, Bob can force Alice to have a lower MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice has to use her turns to pick the necessary elements, and Bob can remove other elements, but in this case, it seems Alice can pick 0 and 1, and achieve MEX=2.

But according to the example, MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, in the second test case,
