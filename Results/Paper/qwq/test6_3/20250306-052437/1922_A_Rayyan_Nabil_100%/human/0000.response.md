Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there should be at least one position where it doesn't satisfy the above conditions based on the template t.

My task is to find out if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to ensure that a and b match t, but c does not.

Let's consider each position i from 1 to n.

For each position i, I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If t[i] is lowercase, then:

- a[i] must be equal to t[i]

- b[i] must be equal to t[i]

- c[i] must not be equal to t[i] (since c doesn't match t)

Wait, but c should not match t, which means that there must be at least one position where c doesn't satisfy the template condition.

But if t[i] is lowercase, then for c to not match, c[i] must be different from t[i].

But t[i] is equal to a[i] and b[i] in this case, since both a and b match t.

So, for t[i] lowercase, c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

But a[i] and b[i] must be equal since t[i] is lowercase.

Wait, no, a[i] and b[i] don't necessarily have to be equal; they just have to match the template.

Wait, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] must be equal to t[i], and b[i] must be equal to t[i].

Therefore, a[i] must be equal to b[i] for t[i] to be lowercase.

Otherwise, if a[i] != b[i], then t[i] cannot be lowercase.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i], we can set t[i] to be lowercase a[i] (or b[i], since they're equal).

For positions where a[i] != b[i], we cannot set t[i] to be lowercase because that would require a[i] == b[i] == t[i], which is not possible if a[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase.

When t[i] is uppercase, the condition is that s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

So, for t[i] uppercase, a[i] must be different from lowercase t[i], and b[i] must also be different from lowercase t[i].

Wait, but a and b both match t, so for t[i] uppercase, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

So, in this case, t[i] is an uppercase letter, and a[i] != lowercase t[i], and b[i] != lowercase t[i].

Now, for c, it should not match t.

Meaning, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

So, to make c not match t, we need to have at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

Our goal is to construct such a template t.

Let's consider the positions where a[i] == b[i].

For these positions, t[i] can be set to lowercase a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be set to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no.

Actually, for t[i] uppercase, a[i] must be different from lowercase t[i], and b[i] must be different from lowercase t[i].

So, t[i] must be chosen such that lowercase t[i] is not equal to a[i] and not equal to b[i].

Because a[i] and b[i] are both different from lowercase t[i].

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase, and its lowercase version must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Therefore, t[i] must be an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is different from both a[i] and b[i].

If such a letter exists, we can choose it.

Otherwise, it's impossible for that position.

Now, for c, we need to ensure that c does not match t.

Meaning, there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

So, to make c not match t, we need to have at least one such position.

Our task is to choose t in such a way that a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Let's think about the constraints.

First, for positions where a[i] == b[i], t[i] must be lowercase a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase, and its lowercase version must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

Now, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

So, let's consider the positions where t[i] is lowercase, which are the positions where a[i] == b[i].

For these positions, to make c not match t, we need c[i] != t[i], which is c[i] != a[i] != b[i].

Similarly, for positions where t[i] is uppercase, to make c not match t, we need c[i] == lowercase t[i].

But t[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is some letter that is not a[i] or b[i].

So, for positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to lowercase t[i], which is not a[i] or b[i].

Wait, but in this case, c[i] would be equal to lowercase t[i], which is different from a[i] and b[i].

But I need to ensure that c does not match t, which means that for at least one position, the condition is violated.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for a and b to match t, while c does not, there must be at least one position where:

- Either t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- Or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase t[i]

And for all other positions, c must not satisfy the template condition.

Wait, no, for c to not match t, it's sufficient that there is at least one position where the condition is violated.

So, I need to choose t such that:

1. For all positions where a[i] == b[i], set t[i] to lowercase a[i].

2. For positions where a[i] != b[i], set t[i] to an uppercase letter whose lowercase version is not equal to a[i] or b[i].

Then, check if there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

If such a position exists, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the second case, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i].

Then, for c, if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must not be equal to lowercase t[i] to match t.

But for c to not match t, we need at least one position where c[i] == lowercase t[i].

So, if there exists at least one position where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase t[i], then c does not match t.

Alternatively, if for all positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] != lowercase t[i], then c matches t, which is not what we want.

Therefore, to ensure c does not match t, there must be at least one position where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase t[i].

Moreover, for positions where t[i] is lowercase, c[i] must be different from t[i] to not match t.

But in this approach, I need to make sure that such a position exists.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of possibilities.

Let me consider the positions where a[i] != b[i].

In these positions, t[i] must be uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i].

Now, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase t[i]

But in our case, t[i] is lowercase only when a[i] == b[i].

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i], t[i] is lowercase a[i], and for c to not match t, we need c[i] != a[i].

Similarly, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] is uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], and for c to not match t, we need c[i] == lowercase t[i].

Wait, but in this case, lowercase t[i] is not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] is equal to lowercase t[i], which is different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no.

Let me rephrase.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] is uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i].

Therefore, for c to match t, c[i] must be different from lowercase t[i].

But for c to not match t, we need c[i] == lowercase t[i].

So, for these positions, if t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase t[i], then c does not match t.

Our goal is to have at least one such position.

Now, consider that for positions where a[i] == b[i], t[i] is lowercase a[i], and for c to not match t, we need c[i] != a[i].

Similarly, for positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] is uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], and for c to not match t, we need c[i] == lowercase t[i].

So, to ensure that c does not match t, we need at least one position where:

- Either t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- Or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase t[i]

Now, in the positions where t[i] is lowercase (i.e., a[i] == b[i]), c[i] != a[i] would satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, in positions where t[i] is uppercase (i.e., a[i] != b[i]), c[i] == lowercase t[i] would satisfy the condition.

So, to have c not match t, we need at least one position where one of these two conditions holds.

Now, in the positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], then that position satisfies the condition for c not matching t.

Similarly, in positions where a[i] != b[i], if c[i] == some value that is not a[i] or b[i], then that position satisfies the condition.

Wait, but in positions where a[i] != b[i], t[i] is uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] == lowercase t[i], which is not equal to a[i] or b[i].

So, in these positions, c[i] is different from a[i] and b[i].

Therefore, for c to not match t, we need c[i] to be equal to the chosen lowercase t[i], which is different from a[i] and b[i].

But in reality, c[i] can be any letter, and we need to choose t[i] such that c[i] == lowercase t[i], which is not equal to a[i] or b[i].

Wait, but a[i] and b[i] are both known, and c[i] is also known.

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], if c[i] is not equal to a[i] or b[i], then we can choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], making c not match t.

But wait, no.

If we choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], and if c[i] == lowercase t[i], then c does not match t.

So, for these positions, if c[i] is different from a[i] and b[i], we can choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], thus making c not match t.

But, in this case, c[i] == lowercase t[i], which is different from a[i] and b[i], so c does not match t.

Alternatively, if c[i] is equal to a[i] or b[i], then we cannot choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], because that would require c[i] == lowercase t[i], but lowercase t[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i].

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], we cannot choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], because that would violate the condition that lowercase t[i] != a[i] and lowercase t[i] != b[i].

Wait, but if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], and we set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], then c[i] != lowercase t[i], meaning c matches t.

But we need c to not match t, so we need c[i] == lowercase t[i], which is only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then we can set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], making c not match t.

If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then we cannot make c not match t through this position, because we cannot set t[i] to have lowercase version equal to c[i] if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then we can set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], making c not match t.

- If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then we cannot make c not match t through this position, because we have to set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version not equal to a[i] or b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], which is different from lowercase t[i], so c matches t.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then we can make c not match t by setting t[i] appropriately.

- If c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then we cannot make c not match t through this position.

Similarly, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- t[i] is lowercase a[i].

- For c to not match t, we need c[i] != a[i].

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] != a[i], then c does not match t.

Therefore, to have c not match t, we need at least one position where:

- Either a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If there exists at least one such position, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], we can set t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase version equal to c[i], making c not match t.

In positions where a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then t[i] is lowercase a[i], and c[i] != t[i], so c does not match t.

Therefore, if there exists at least one position where either:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Then, we can construct a template t that makes a and b match t, while c does not match t.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Therefore, the condition simplifies to checking if there exists at least one position i where:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- Or if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If such a position exists, then "YES", else "NO".

This seems like a straightforward condition to check.

Now, looking back at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function func_1(n, a, b, c) is supposed to determine if such a template t exists.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(n, a, b, c):

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

return 'YES'

return 'NO'

It seems to be checking if there exists at least one position i where both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the condition should be:

- If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- Or if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

But in the code, it's checking for positions where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], regardless of whether a[i] == b[i] or not.

Is this equivalent to my condition?

Let's compare.

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- My condition: c[i] != a[i]

- Code condition: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

But since a[i] == b[i], a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] is equivalent to c[i] != a[i].

So, in this case, the code's condition matches my condition.

Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

- My condition: c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- Code condition: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Again, since a[i] != b[i], if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] hold true.

Therefore, the code's condition seems to align with my derived condition.

Hence, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that a and b match t, while c does not.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
