Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation allows me to select three integers i, j, and x, and set all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I need to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best strategy here. Since I can perform the operation only once, I need to choose the subarray to set in a way that minimizes the cost.

One straightforward approach is to set the entire array to a single value. That would cost n burles, where n is the length of the array. But maybe I can do better by taking advantage of the elements that are already equal.

Let me think about it differently. If the entire array is already equal, then the cost is 0. If not, I need to find a way to make them all equal with at most one operation.

Wait, but I can perform the operation only once, so I need to choose the best possible subarray to set to a particular value.

Hmm, maybe I should consider making the entire array equal to the value of one of its elements, and see what's the minimal cost for that.

Let's consider that I choose to make all elements equal to a specific value, say x. Now, I need to set all elements that are not x to x. If I can do this in one operation, I need to select a subarray where the elements are not equal to x and set them to x.

But the problem is that I can only perform one operation, so I need to choose the subarray in a way that covers as many non-x elements as possible in one go.

Wait, but I can choose any subarray and set it to any value x. So maybe I should choose x to be the most frequent value in the array, and then set the subarray that contains the least frequent elements to x.

But I'm not sure if that's the optimal strategy.

Let me look at some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the sample input:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Here, the array is [1,2,3,4,5,1]. If I choose to make all elements equal to 1, I need to set the subarray from index 1 to 5 to 1. That would cost 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 burles. But according to the sample output, the answer is 4, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe I can choose to set a different subarray. For example, set the subarray from index 2 to 5 to 1, which costs 4 burles, and then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal. And since I can perform only one operation, I need to find a way to cover the necessary elements in one go.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, so maybe there's a way to do it with cost 4.

Looking at the sample input and output:

Input:

8

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

1

1

2

1 2

3

1 2 3

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

So, for the first test case, n=6, array=[1,2,3,4,5,1], output=4.

For the second test case, n=7, array=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], output=0, which makes sense because all elements are already equal.

Third test case, n=8, array=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], output=2.

Fourth test case, n=1, array=[1], output=0.

Fifth test case, n=2, array=[1,2], output=1.

Sixth test case, n=3, array=[1,2,3], output=2.

Seventh test case, n=7, array=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3], output=6.

Eighth test case, n=9, array=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3], output=7.

Looking at these examples, I need to find a pattern or a strategy that leads to these outputs.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the length of the array minus the length of the longest subarray of equal elements.

Wait, for the first test case, n=6, longest subarray of equal elements is 1 (for example, all 1's or all 2's, etc.), so 6 - 1 = 5, but the sample output is 4, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's about the ends of the array.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

(st, end) = (0, 0)

while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:

l += 1

st += 1

while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:

r -= 1

end += 1

if a[0] == a[-1]:

ans = r - l - 1

elif st == 0 and end == 0 and (a[0] != a[-1]):

ans = len(a) - 1

else:

ans = r - l

print(max(0, ans))

So, the code is trying to do something with the left and right ends of the array, counting how many consecutive elements are equal at the starts and ends.

Let's see what it's doing step by step.

It initializes l=0 and r=n-1.

Then it has a while loop: while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:

l += 1

st += 1

Similarly, another while loop: while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:

r -= 1

end += 1

Then, if a[0] == a[-1], ans = r - l - 1

elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1], ans = len(a) - 1

else, ans = r - l

Finally, print(max(0, ans))

Let's apply this to the first test case:

n=6, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

Initially, l=0, r=5

a[0]=1, a[1]=2, so a[0] != a[1], so the first while loop doesn't run, st=0

Then, a[5]=1, a[4]=5, a[5] != a[4], so the second while loop doesn't run, end=0

Since a[0] == a[-1] (both are 1), ans = r - l - 1 = 5 - 0 - 1 = 4

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

l=0, r=6

a[0]=1, a[1]=1, so first while loop runs:

l=0, r=6, a[0]==a[1], so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2], so l=2, st=2

a[2]==a[3], so l=3, st=3

a[3]==a[4], so l=4, st=4

a[4]==a[5], so l=5, st=5

Now l=5, r=6, l < r and a[5]==a[6], so l=6, st=6

Now l=6, r=6, so first while loop stops.

Second while loop: r=6, l=6, r > l is False, so end=0

a[0]==a[-1], which are both 1, so ans = r - l -1 = 6 - 6 -1 = -1

But then it prints max(0, ans), so 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case: n=8, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

l=0, r=7

a[0]=8, a[1]=8, so first while loop runs:

l=0, r=7, a[0]==a[1], so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2], so l=2, st=2

a[2]==a[3], no, a[2]=8, a[3]=1, so first while loop stops.

Second while loop:

r=7, l=2, a[7]=8, a[6]=8, so r=6, end=1

a[6]=8, a[5]=8, so r=5, end=2

a[5]=8, a[4]=2, so second while loop stops.

Now, a[0]==a[-1], both 8, so ans = r - l -1 = 5 - 2 -1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=1, a=[1]

l=0, r=0

First while loop doesn't run since l < r is False.

Second while loop doesn't run since r > l is False.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans = r - l -1 = 0 - 0 -1 = -1

But print(max(0, ans)) = 0, which matches.

Good.

Another test case: n=2, a=[1,2]

l=0, r=1

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, so no.

Second while loop: a[1]==a[0]? 2!=1, so no.

a[0]!=a[-1], and st=0, end=0, so ans = len(a) -1 = 2-1=1, which matches.

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3]

l=0, r=2

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[2]==a[1]? 3!=2, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans = len(a)-1=3-1=2, which matches.

Another test case: n=7, a=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

l=0, r=6

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 4!=3, no.

Second while loop: a[6]==a[5]? 3!=1, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=7-1=6, which matches.

Last test case: n=9, a=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

l=0, r=8

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 9==9, so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2]? 9==2, no.

Second while loop: r=8, l=1, a[8]==a[7]? 3!=5, no.

a[0]==a[-1]? 9!=3, so go to else clause, ans=r - l =8 -1=7, which matches.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But I need to understand why this approach works.

Looking at the code, it seems to be trying to find the minimum cost to make the array equal by possibly making the ends of the array consistent and then setting the middle part.

Specifically, it seems to be calculating the length of the middle part that needs to be set to make the entire array equal.

But I need to think about whether this is always the minimal cost.

Let me consider a few more test cases to verify.

Test case 1:

n=4

a=[1,1,1,1]

Here, the array is already equal, so cost should be 0.

According to the code:

l=0, r=3

First while loop: a[0]==a[1], so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2], so l=2, st=2

a[2]==a[3], so l=3, st=3

Second while loop: r=3, l=3, doesn't run.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1 =3 -3 -1=-1

print(max(0, ans))=0, which is correct.

Test case 2:

n=5

a=[1,2,1,2,1]

According to the code:

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=5-1=4

But is there a better way?

If I set the subarray from index 1 to 4 to 1, cost=4, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal.

So, cost=4, which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,2,2,2,1]

According to the code:

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=5-1=4

But, if I set the subarray from index 0 to 4 to 2, cost=5.

Wait, but I can set the subarray from index 0 to 0 to 2 (cost=1) and from index 4 to 4 to 2 (cost=1), but I can only perform one operation, so I can't do that.

Alternatively, set the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, cost=3, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1], cost=3, which is better than 4.

But according to the code, it would output 4, which is higher than necessary.

Wait, but the problem allows at most one operation, so I need to find the minimal cost with at most one operation.

In this case, setting the middle subarray to 1 costs 3, which is less than setting the ends to 2, which costs 4.

But the code would output 4, which is not the minimal possible.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. It says "no more than once", meaning I can choose to perform zero or one operation.

So, in this case, I can choose not to perform any operation if the array is already equal.

But in this test case, the array is not equal, so I need to perform one operation.

Wait, but performing zero operations would leave the array not equal, which is invalid.

Wait no, the problem says "You can no more than once apply the following operation", which I interpret as I can choose to perform zero or one operation.

But the problem says "no more than once", which probably means I can choose to perform zero operations if it's already equal, or one operation otherwise.

But in this test case, it's not equal, so I need to perform one operation.

So, in this case, setting the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1 costs 3, which is better than setting the subarray from index 0 to 4 to 2, which costs 5.

But according to the code, it would output 4, which is higher than necessary.

So, is the code incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, in this test case:

n=5, a=[1,2,2,2,1]

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], and st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=4

But in reality, I can set the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, which is better.

So, perhaps the code is not always giving the minimal cost.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the code is calculating the minimal cost to make the array equal by setting a specific subarray.

Let me see.

In the code, when a[0]==a[-1], it calculates r - l -1.

Otherwise, if st==0 and end==0 and a[0]!=a[-1], it sets ans=len(a)-1.

Else, ans=r - l.

I need to see if this covers all cases optimally.

In the test case above, a=[1,2,2,2,1], a[0]==a[-1]=1.

So, l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

But a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=4-0-1=3.

Wait, in this case, it would output 3, which matches the better option I thought of earlier.

Wait, in my earlier manual calculation, I thought the code would output 4, but actually, since a[0]==a[-1], it would output r - l -1=3.

So, it's correct.

I must have misremembered.

So, in this test case, the code outputs 3, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,2,3,2,1]

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=4

But actually, if I set the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1].

So, cost=3, which is less than 4.

But according to the code, it would output 4.

Is it incorrect?

Wait, let's see:

a[0]==a[-1]? 1==1, yes.

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

But a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=4-0-1=3

Wait, no, in this array, a=[1,2,3,2,1], a[0]==a[-1]=1.

So, l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=4-0-1=3

Which matches the optimal cost of 3.

So, the code seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,2,3,4]

l=0, r=3

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[3]==a[2]? 4!=3, no.

a[0]!=a[-1], st=0, end=0, so ans=len(a)-1=4-1=3

But, if I set the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, resulting in [1,1,1,1].

Alternatively, set the subarray from index 0 to 2 to 4, costing 3, resulting in [4,4,4,4].

So, cost=3 is the minimal, which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,1,2,1,1]

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1], so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2], no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3], so r=3, end=1

a[3]==a[2], no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=3-1-1=1

So, ans=1

Is this correct?

If I set the subarray from index 2 to 2 to 1, costing 1, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1].

Yes, cost=1, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,2,2,1]

l=0, r=3

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[3]==a[2], so r=2, end=1

a[2]==a[1], no.

a[0]!=a[-1], and st=0, end=1 (not zero), so ans=r - l=2 - 0=2

But, setting the subarray from index 1 to 2 to 1 costs 2, resulting in [1,1,1,1].

Alternatively, setting the subarray from index 0 to 1 to 2 costs 2, resulting in [2,2,2,1], then set index 3 to 2, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

So, cost=2 is minimal, which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,2,1,2,2]

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3], so r=3, end=1

a[3]==a[2], no.

a[0]!=a[-1], and st=0, end=1, so ans=r - l=3 - 0=3

But, setting the subarray from index 0 to 2 to 2 costs 3, resulting in [2,2,2,2,2].

Alternatively, setting the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 2 costs 3, resulting in [1,2,2,2,2].

In the first case, cost=3, which matches the code's output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[1,1,2,2,1,1]

l=0, r=5

First while loop: a[0]==a[1], so l=1, st=1

a[1]==a[2], no.

Second while loop: a[5]==a[4], so r=4, end=1

a[4]==a[3], no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=4 -1 -1=2

Is this correct?

If I set the subarray from index 2 to 3 to 1, costing 2, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1,1].

Yes, cost=2, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,1]

l=0, r=2

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[2]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=2 -0 -1=1

But, setting the subarray from index 1 to 1 to 1 costs 1, resulting in [1,1,1].

Yes, cost=1, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,2,3,1]

l=0, r=3

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[3]==a[2]? 1!=3, no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=3 -0 -1=2

Setting the subarray from index 1 to 2 to 1 costs 2, resulting in [1,1,1,1].

Yes, cost=2, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[1,2,1,2,1]

l=0, r=4

First while loop: a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, no.

Second while loop: a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, no.

a[0]==a[-1], so ans=r - l -1=4 -0 -1=3

Setting the subarray from index 1 to 4 to 1 costs 4, or setting index 0 to 2 to 2 costs 3, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, setting index 1 to 3 to 1 costs 3, resulting in [1,1,1,2,1], which is not all equal.

Wait, to make all elements equal in one operation, I need to choose a subarray that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array equal.

For example, setting index 1 to 4 to 1 costs 4, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1].

Alternatively, setting index 0 to 3 to 1 costs 4, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1].

There doesn't seem to be a way to do it with less than 4 operations, but according to the code, ans=r - l -1=3.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the code is giving an incorrect answer.

Wait, according to the code, ans=3, but actually, the minimal cost is 4.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, in this array, a=[1,2,1,2,1], if I set the subarray from index 1 to 4 to 1, costing 4, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1].

Alternatively, setting index 0 to 3 to 1, costing 4.

But is there a way to do it with cost=3?

If I set index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, resulting in [1,1,1,2,1], which is not all equal.

Then, I would need to set index 3 to 4 to 1, costing 2, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

So, with one operation, the minimal cost is 4, but the code outputs 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the code, when a[0]==a[-1], ans=r - l -1=4 -0 -1=3.

But in reality, the minimal cost is 4.

So, in this case, the code is giving an incorrect answer.

Hmm, so perhaps the code is flawed.

Let me check the sample input again.

In the sample input, there is a test case with n=6, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1], output=4.

According to the code, ans=r - l -1=5 -0 -1=4, which matches.

But in this test case I just constructed, n=5, a=[1,2,1,2,1], according to the code, ans=3, but the minimal cost seems to be 4.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set the subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, resulting in [1,1,1,2,1].

Then, since I can't perform another operation, the array is not all equal.

But if I choose to set a different subarray, like index 1 to 4 to 1, costing 4, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal.

So, the minimal cost should be 4, but the code outputs 3, which is less than the actual minimal cost.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Is there a way to make the array all equal with cost=3?

Let me see:

- Set index 0 to 2 to 2, costing 3, resulting in [2,2,2,2,1].

Not all equal.

- Set index 2 to 4 to 2, costing 3, resulting in [1,2,2,2,1].

Not all equal.

- Set index 1 to 3 to 1, costing 3, resulting in [1,1,1,2,1].

Not all equal.

- Set index 0 to 1 to 1, costing 2, resulting in [1,1,1,2,1].

Not all equal.

- Set index 3 to 4 to 1, costing 2, resulting in [1,2,1,1,1].

Still not all equal.

So, it seems impossible to make the array all equal with cost less than 4, but the code is outputting 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, perhaps the logic needs to be adjusted.

Let me see what the code is trying to do.

It seems to be trying to find the minimal cost by calculating the length of the middle part that needs to be set, assuming that the ends are already equal or can be made equal.

But in this particular case, where a[0]==a[-1], but the middle part has alternating values, the code is miscalculating the minimal cost.

So, perhaps the approach is not general enough.

I need to think of a better way to solve this problem.

Let me consider that to make all elements equal to a specific value x, I need to set all elements that are not x to x.

But since I can only perform one operation, I need to choose a subarray that covers all the elements that are not equal to x.

So, the minimal cost would be the length of the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

But finding the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements is equivalent to finding the smallest window that includes all positions where a[i] != x.

But since x can be any value, I need to choose x in a way that minimizes this cost.

Wait, but x can be any value, even not present in the array.

But in the problem, x can be any integer, not necessarily present in the array.

But probably choosing x as one of the existing values in the array would be optimal.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to make all elements equal to the most frequent value in the array.

Then, the cost would be the number of elements that are not equal to this value.

But I can only perform one operation, which can set a subarray to x.

So, it's not directly applicable.

Wait, maybe I should find the maximal subarray where all elements are already equal, and then set the rest in one operation.

Wait, but I can only set a subarray to a specific value, not set multiple subarrays.

Wait, more precisely, I can set one subarray to a specific value, and the rest remains as is, but I need the entire array to be equal.

So, I need to choose a value x, choose a subarray, set that subarray to x, and ensure that after this operation, the entire array is equal to x.

That means, the subarray I choose should cover all elements that are not equal to x.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to minimize the length of the subarray that covers all non-x elements.

Hence, for each possible x, I need to find the minimal subarray that covers all positions where a[i] != x, and then choose the x that minimizes the cost.

But since I can choose x to be any value, including new values not in the array, I need to consider all possible x.

But in practice, choosing x to be a value not in the array would require setting the entire array to x, costing n, which may not be optimal.

So, probably choosing x to be one of the existing values in the array is optimal.

So, let's consider each unique value in the array, and for each, find the minimal subarray that covers all positions where a[i] != x.

Then, choose the x and the corresponding subarray that minimizes the cost.

This seems correct, but it's O(n * number of unique values), which could be acceptable since n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases being 2e5, it should be fine.

But this approach might be too slow for the time constraints, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this.

Looking back at the original code, it seems to be trying to find the minimal cost by considering the ends of the array that are already equal.

Specifically, it tries to extend the left and right ends that are already equal to a[0], and then set the middle part to a[0].

But as we've seen, this doesn't always give the minimal cost, as in the test case a=[1,2,1,2,1], where the code outputs 3, but the minimal cost is 4.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to make all elements of an array equal with the least cost, given that we can perform at most one operation to set a subarray to a specific value.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal.
   - We can perform at most one operation where we select a subarray and set all its elements to any value `x`.
   - The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

2. **Insight**:
   - To minimize the cost, we should maximize the number of elements that are already equal to the chosen value `x`.
   - The optimal strategy is to choose `x` as the most frequent element in the array and then set the subarray that contains all non-`x` elements to `x`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Find the most frequent element `x` in the array.
   - Identify the smallest subarray that covers all positions where elements are not equal to `x`.
   - The cost is the length of this subarray.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements are already equal, the cost is 0.
   - If the array has only one element, the cost is 0.
   - If no element is repeated, setting the entire array to any value costs `n`.

### Solution Code

```python
def find_min_cost(a):
    from collections import defaultdict

    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        freq[num] += 1

    # Find the most frequent element
    x = max(freq, key=freq.get)

    # Find positions where a[i] != x
    non_x_positions = [i for i, num in enumerate(a) if num != x]

    if not non_x_positions:
        return 0  # All elements are already x

    # Find the min subarray that covers all non-x elements
    # This is the subarray from the smallest to the largest index of non-x elements
    l = min(non_x_positions)
    r = max(non_x_positions)

    # The minimal subarray to set is from l to r
    return r - l + 1

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        ans = find_min_cost(a)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - We calculate the frequency of each element in the array using a dictionary.

2. **Identifying the Most Frequent Element**:
   - We select the element `x` that appears most frequently in the array.

3. **Finding Non-`x` Positions**:
   - We collect the indices of all elements that are not equal to `x`.

4. **Determining the Minimal Subarray**:
   - If there are no non-`x` elements, the array is already uniform, and the cost is 0.
   - Otherwise, find the smallest subarray that includes all non-`x` elements by selecting the range from the smallest to the largest index of non-`x` elements.

5. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - The cost is the length of this minimal subarray.

This approach ensures that we minimize the cost of operations required to make all elements equal.
