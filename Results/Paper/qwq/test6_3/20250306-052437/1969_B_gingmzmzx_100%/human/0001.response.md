Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only consists of 0s and 1s. I need to make sure that this string is sorted in non-descending order, which in this case would mean all 0s come before all 1s. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I can perform this operation as many times as I want, and I need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

First, I need to understand what it means for the string to be sorted. In this context, it means that all 0s should appear before any 1s. So, in essence, I need to move all the 1s to the end of the string.

Now, thinking about the operation allowed: cyclic shift on any substring. So, each time I perform this operation, I'm rotating that substring by one position, and it costs me the length of that substring.

I need to find a way to move the 1s to the end with the least total cost.

Let me consider a simple example to get a feel for the problem.

Take "10". To sort it, I need to get "01". So, I can perform a cyclic shift on the entire string: "10" -> "01", with a cost of 2.

Another example: "11000".

One way is:

1. Shift substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", so the string becomes "01100". Cost: 3.

2. Shift substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", so now "00110". Cost: 3.

3. Shift substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", so now "00011". Cost: 3.

Total cost: 9.

But is there a better way? Maybe, but in this case, the total cost is 9, which matches the sample input.

Another example: "101011".

One possible sequence:

1. Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", so "011011". Cost: 2.

2. Shift [2,3]: "11" -> "11", no change. Cost: 2, but no improvement.

Wait, "11" rotated remains "11".

Alternatively:

1. Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", so "110011". Cost: 3.

2. Shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", so "011011". Cost: 4.

3. Shift [5,6]: "11" -> "11", no change. Cost: 2.

This doesn't seem optimal.

Another approach:

1. Shift [1,5]: "10101" -> "11010" Cost: 5.

So, "110101" -> "110101", no change.

Wait, "10101" shifted cyclically: "1" moves to the end, so "01011". Wait, no.

Wait, cyclic shift means taking the last character and moving it to the front.

So, "10101" becomes "1 * 1010" -> "10101", which is the same.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps instead of trying to shift substrings directly to get to the sorted string, I need to think in terms of the positions where the string is not sorted and find a way to fix those positions with minimal cost.

Let me think about the positions where the string is not sorted. In a sorted string, all 0s come before all 1s. So, in the given string, any "1" that appears before a "0" is out of place and needs to be moved to the end.

So, maybe I can count the number of "1"s that appear before any "0"s and calculate the cost based on that.

Wait, but in the sample input, "10" requires a cost of 2, which makes sense because there's one "1" before one "0", and shifting the entire substring costs 2.

In "11000", there are two "1"s before three "0"s, and the total cost is 9, which is 3 operations of cost 3 each.

Wait, is there a pattern here?

Let me look at the code provided and see if it matches my intuition.

The code is:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

s = list(map(int, input().strip()))

zeroes = s.count(0)

cnt = [0, 0]

ans = 0

for c in s:

cnt[c] += 1

if c == 0:

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0

else:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the string, converts it to a list of integers, counts the number of zeroes, initializes a count list for 0 and 1, and initializes ans to 0.

Then, it iterates through each character in the string:

- Increments the count of that character.

- If the character is 0:

- If there are any 1s counted so far, add 1 to ans.

- Else, do nothing.

- If the character is 1:

- Add (total zeroes - zeroes counted so far) to ans.

Finally, it prints ans.

So, let's see what this is doing.

In the first part, it counts the total number of zeroes in the string.

Then, as it iterates through the string, it keeps track of how many 0s and 1s it has seen so far.

For each 0 encountered, if there are any 1s before it, it adds 1 to the answer. This seems like it's counting the number of 1s that are before each 0, but actually, it's just checking if there are any 1s before it and adding 1 if there are.

Wait, no. It adds 1 to ans for each 0 that has at least one 1 before it.

Then, for each 1 encountered, it adds (total zeroes - zeroes seen so far) to ans.

Wait, let's see with an example.

Take "10":

- Total zeroes = 1

- cnt = [0,0]

- ans = 0

- First character '1':

- cnt[1] +=1 => cnt = [0,1]

- Since c=1, ans += (1 - 0) = 1

- Now ans=1

- Second character '0':

- cnt[0] +=1 => cnt = [1,1]

- Since c=0 and cnt[1] >0, ans +=1 => ans=2

- Print 2, which matches the sample input.

Another example, "0000":

- Total zeroes=4

- cnt=[0,0]

- ans=0

- First '0':

- cnt=[1,0]

- c=0 and cnt[1]=0, so do nothing

- Second '0':

- cnt=[2,0]

- c=0 and cnt[1]=0, so do nothing

- Third '0':

- cnt=[3,0]

- c=0 and cnt[1]=0, so do nothing

- Fourth '0':

- cnt=[4,0]

- c=0 and cnt[1]=0, so do nothing

- ans=0, which matches the sample input.

Another example, "11000":

- Total zeroes=3

- cnt=[0,0]

- ans=0

- First '1':

- cnt=[0,1]

- c=1, ans += (3 - 0) = 3 => ans=3

- Second '1':

- cnt=[0,2]

- c=1, ans += (3 - 0) = 3 => ans=6

- Third '0':

- cnt=[1,2]

- c=0, and cnt[1]=2>0, so ans +=1 => ans=7

- Fourth '0':

- cnt=[2,2]

- c=0, and cnt[1]=2>0, so ans +=1 => ans=8

- Fifth '0':

- cnt=[3,2]

- c=0, and cnt[1]=2>0, so ans +=1 => ans=9

- Which matches the sample input.

So, it seems to be calculating the correct answer.

But why does this work?

Let's try to understand the logic behind it.

For each '1' encountered, it adds the total number of zeroes to ans.

But wait, in the code, for each '1', it adds (zeroes - cnt[0]), which is the number of zeroes that come after this '1' in the string.

Because cnt[0] is the number of zeroes seen so far, and zeroes is the total number of zeroes, so (zeroes - cnt[0]) is the number of zeroes that come after the current position.

Similarly, for each '0', if there are any '1's before it, it adds 1 to ans.

So, overall, ans is summing up, for each '1', the number of zeroes after it, and for each '0', if there are any '1's before it, add 1.

But in the sample explanation, they are performing shifts on substrings and calculating the cost based on the length of the substring.

How does this relate to the per-character counts?

Wait, maybe it's counting the number of inversions, where a '1' appears before a '0'.

In the first example, "10", there is one inversion: '1' before '0'.

The cost is 2, which is different from the number of inversions.

Wait, perhaps it's the total cost required to fix all inversions.

But in "10", one inversion, cost 2.

In "11000", there are 3 '1's before 3 '0's, so 9 inversions, and the cost is 9.

Wait, but in the code, it's not exactly counting the number of inversions.

Wait, no, in "11000", the number of inversions is 3 (each '1' before each '0'), so 3 inversions, but the cost is 9.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's not counting inversions directly, but something else.

Wait, let's see:

For each '1', it adds the number of '0's after it.

In "11000":

- First '1': 3 '0's after => +3

- Second '1': 3 '0's after => +3

- Total from '1's: 6

- For each '0', if there are any '1's before it, add 1.

- First '0': two '1's before => +1

- Second '0': two '1's before => +1

- Third '0': two '1's before => +1

- Total from '0's: 3

- Total ans: 9

Which matches the sample.

So, it's summing, for each '1', the number of '0's after it, and for each '0', the number of '1's before it.

In this way, it's counting the total number of swaps needed, where each swap has a cost equal to the substring length.

Wait, but I need to see if this correctly represents the minimal cost to sort the string using the allowed operations.

Another way to think about it is that each '1' needs to be moved past all the '0's that come after it, and each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that come before it.

But the operation allowed is cyclic shifting of any substring, with cost equal to the length of the substring.

Is there a direct correlation here?

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of bubble sort, where each swap fixes one inversion.

But in this case, the operation is not a single swap but a cyclic shift of a substring, which can be seen as multiple swaps.

Wait, perhaps each cyclic shift can fix multiple inversions at once, depending on the substring chosen.

But I need to find the minimal total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

Is there a way to minimize this total cost?

Looking back at the code, it seems to be calculating the total number of inversions, where an inversion is a '1' before a '0', and assigning a cost equal to the number of such inversions.

But in the sample input, for "10", cost is 2, which is the length of the substring shifted.

Wait, but according to the code, it's counting:

- For each '1', the number of '0's after it: 1 '1' * 1 '0' = 1

- For each '0', if there are '1's before it: 1 '0' * 1 '1' = 1

- Total: 2, which matches the sample.

Similarly, in "11000":

- For each '1', number of '0's after: 2 '1's * 3 '0's = 6

- For each '0', number of '1's before: 3 '0's * 2 '1's = 6

- Total: 9, which matches the sample.

Wait, but 2 '1's * 3 '0's would be 6, plus 3 '0's * 2 '1's = 6, total 12, but the sample output is 9.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the code, for '1's, it's adding the number of '0's after, and for '0's, it's adding 1 if there are any '1's before.

So, in "11000":

- For '1's: 3 + 3 = 6

- For '0's: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

- Total: 9

Yes, that makes sense.

So, it's summing, for each '1', the number of '0's after it, and for each '0', whether there are any '1's before it.

But why does this give the minimal total cost?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to move all '1's to the end of the string.

Each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' requires a certain cost.

If I can shift a substring that contains a '1' and a '0' in such a way that the '1' moves to the right and the '0' moves to the left, I can effectively swap their positions with a cost equal to the substring length.

But in reality, a cyclic shift isn't a swap; it's rotating the substring.

Wait, maybe I need to consider how many positions each '1' needs to move to reach the end.

Each '1' needs to be moved past all the '0's that come after it.

Similarly, each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that come before it.

But I need to find a way to group these movements into cyclic shifts of substrings to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps the code is calculating the total number of such individual movements, each costing 1, but in reality, shifting a substring of length k costs k, and it can move multiple elements at once.

So, maybe there's a way to perform shifts that move multiple elements simultaneously, thus reducing the total cost below the number of individual movements.

But in the sample input, for "10", shifting the entire substring of length 2 costs 2, which is the same as performing two individual movements, each costing 1.

But perhaps by shifting larger substrings, I can save on the cost.

Wait, in "11000", the code outputs 9, which seems to be consistent with shifting the entire string once, costing 5, but that doesn't sort it.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal cost is indeed the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's after them, plus the sum over all '0's of the number of '1's before them.

This seems to be what the code is calculating.

But is this the minimal total cost?

Looking back at the sample input "11000", the operations performed in the note are:

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

2. Shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

3. Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3

Total cost: 9

Which matches the code's output.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another sample input "101011":

According to the code:

- Total zeroes: 2

- cnt = [0,0]

- ans = 0

- '1': cnt=[0,1], ans += (2 - 0) = 2 => ans=2

- '0': cnt=[1,1], ans +=1 (since cnt[1]>0) => ans=3

- '1': cnt=[1,2], ans += (2 -1) =1 => ans=4

- '0': cnt=[2,2], ans +=1 => ans=5

- '1': cnt=[2,3], ans += (2 -2) =0 => ans=5

- '1': cnt=[2,4], ans += (2 -2) =0 => ans=5

Which matches the sample output of 5.

So, it seems to be correct for the given samples.

But I need to make sure that this is indeed the minimal cost in general.

Let me think about another example.

Take "01".

It's already sorted, so cost should be 0.

According to the code:

- Total zeroes:1

- cnt=[0,0]

- ans=0

- '0': cnt=[1,0], ans +=0 (since cnt[1]=0)

- '1': cnt=[1,1], ans += (1 -1)=0 => ans=0

Correct.

Another example: "1010"

- Total zeroes:2

- cnt=[0,0]

- ans=0

- '1': cnt=[0,1], ans += (2 -0)=2 => ans=2

- '0': cnt=[1,1], ans +=1 (since cnt[1]>0) => ans=3

- '1': cnt=[1,2], ans += (2 -1)=1 => ans=4

- '0': cnt=[2,2], ans +=1 => ans=5

So, according to the code, cost is 5.

Is there a way to sort "1010" with a lower cost?

Let's see:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", cost 2. String becomes "0110".

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", cost 2. String becomes "0011".

Total cost: 4, which is less than 5.

So, according to the code, it's 5, but I found a way to do it with cost 4.

So, perhaps the code is not always giving the minimal cost.

Wait, but in the sample input, it matches.

Maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me see what's happening.

In "1010", according to the code:

- For each '1', number of '0's after:

- First '1': two '0's after => +2

- Second '1': one '0' after => +1

- Third '1': zero '0's after => +0

- For each '0', if there are '1's before:

- First '0': one '1' before => +1

- Second '0': two '1's before => +1 (since cnt[1]>0)

- Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

But I found a way to sort it with cost 4.

So, perhaps the code is overestimating the cost in some cases.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal cost is indeed 5, and my approach is incorrect.

Wait, let's try another way.

If I perform:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", cost 3. String becomes "1100".

- Shift [1,2]: "11" -> "11", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "00" -> "00", no change, cost 2.

Total cost: 7, which is higher than 4.

My earlier approach of shifting [1,2] and [3,4], each costing 2, total 4, seems better.

So, according to the code, it's 5, but I can do it with 4.

So, perhaps the code is not correct.

Wait, but in the sample input, it matches.

Maybe the code is correct for some cases but not all.

I need to find out what's the logic behind the code and see if it's universally applicable.

The code seems to be calculating the total number of pairs where a '1' is before a '0', and assigning a cost of 1 for each such pair.

But in reality, the operation allows shifting a substring, which can affect multiple pairs at once.

So, perhaps the minimal total cost is not equal to the number of inversions.

In the "1010" example, there are three inversions:

- '1' at position 1 and '0' at position 2

- '1' at position 1 and '0' at position 4

- '1' at position 3 and '0' at position 4

So, three inversions, but according to the code, it's calculating 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, no, in "1010", there are two '1's before one '0' each, and one '1' before another '0', so total inversions are 2 + 1 = 3.

But according to the code, it's calculating 5.

So, perhaps it's not counting inversions directly.

Wait, in the code, for each '1', it adds the number of '0's after it, and for each '0', if there are any '1's before it, adds 1.

So, in "1010":

- For '1's: 2 '0's after first '1', 1 '0' after second '1', 0 '0's after third '1' => 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

- For '0's: first '0' has one '1' before, second '0' has two '1's before => 1 + 1 = 2

- Total: 3 + 2 = 5

But in reality, I can sort it with a cost of 4.

So, perhaps the code is overestimating the cost.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal cost is indeed 5, and my approach is missing something.

Let me try to see if there's a way to sort "1010" with a cost less than 5.

My earlier approach:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", cost 2. String becomes "0110".

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", cost 2. String becomes "0011".

Total cost: 4.

Seems correct.

So, according to the code, it's 5, but I can do it with 4.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it matches.

Maybe the code is correct for some cases but not all.

I need to see what's the fundamental logic behind the code.

Looking back, perhaps the code is calculating the total number of operations needed if each operation fixes only one inversion.

But in reality, shifting a substring can fix multiple inversions at once.

So, the code might be overestimating the cost in cases where shifting a substring can fix multiple inversions simultaneously.

In the "1010" example, shifting [1,2] fixes one inversion ("10" -> "01"), and shifting [3,4] fixes another inversion ("10" -> "01"), total cost 4, which is less than the code's output of 5.

Hence, the code is not correctly calculating the minimal cost in all cases.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
