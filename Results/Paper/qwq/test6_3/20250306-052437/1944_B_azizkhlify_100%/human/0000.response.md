Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's an integer k, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k, with specific properties.

First, l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array, and r should be a subset of the last n elements. Also, the bitwise XOR of the elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in r.

The problem says that at least one pair of l and r always exists, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the original sequence and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, l is any selection of 2k elements from the first n elements, and r is any selection of 2k elements from the last n elements, and they can be in any order.

The key is that the XOR of l should equal the XOR of r.

I need to find such l and r.

Let me recall that the XOR of a set of numbers is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and I can group them in any way.

Also, XOR has the property that if I have two sets with the same XOR, then the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero.

But maybe I don't need to get too deep into XOR properties here.

Let me think about the frequencies of each number in the first and second halves.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, some of them will be in the first n elements and some in the second n elements.

I can count how many times each number appears in the first n and in the second n.

Wait, but since each number appears exactly twice, in one half or the other, or once in each.

So, for each number from 1 to n, I can determine in which halves it appears.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on where their two occurrences are:

1. Both in the first n.

2. Both in the second n.

3. One in the first n and one in the second n.

Given that, I can count for each category.

Wait, but in the first n and the second n, since the total is 2n and each number appears twice, it's possible for a number to have both occurrences in the first n, both in the second n, or one in each.

But the problem is to select 2k elements from each half such that their XORs are equal.

I need to find a way to select these subsets.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first n and the XOR of all elements in the second n.

Let's denote XOR_l as the XOR of the first n elements, and XOR_r as the XOR of the second n elements.

Since the entire array's XOR is XOR_l XOR XOR_r, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, but I need to select subsets of size 2k from each half with equal XOR.

An idea: since k can be up to n/2, and n can be up to 5*10^4, and t is up to 5000, I need an efficient solution.

Given the constraints, I need an approach that is linear or linearithmic in n per test case.

Let me think differently.

I need to select 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the second n such that their XORs are equal.

An idea: try to match pairs of elements.

Wait, perhaps I can look for pairs of elements where one is in the first half and one is in the second half.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the XOR differences.

Wait, maybe I can consider the XOR of the entire first half and second half, and see how to balance them.

Hmm.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps there is a straightforward way to construct such subsets.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=1

Array: 1,2,2,1

So, first n: 1,2

Second n: 2,1

One possible solution is l=[2,1], r=[2,1]

Their XORs are both 3.

Another solution is possible, but this one works.

In the second test case:

n=6, k=1

Array: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

First n: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Second n: 1,6,3,5,5,4

One possible solution is l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

Their XORs are both 2.

Okay, so in this case, they selected two elements from each half with equal XOR.

In the third test case:

n=4, k=1

Array:1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4

l=[1,2], r=[1,2]

XORs are both 3.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=2

Array:5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2

l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]

XORs are both 1^5^1^3 = 1 and 6^4^2^4 = 1.

Wait, 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 5 XOR 1 = 4

And 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR (4 XOR 4) XOR 2 = 6 XOR 0 XOR 2 = 6 XOR 2 = 4.

So, both XOR to 4.

Okay, so in this case, they selected four elements from each half.

Alright, so I need a general approach.

Let me think about frequencies.

Each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

So, for each number, it can be in:

- Both first n and second n.

- Only first n (if both occurrences are in first n).

- Only second n (if both are in second n).

Wait, no. If both occurrences are in first n, then it's only in first n.

Similarly, if both are in second n, only in second n.

If one is in first n and one in second n, then it's in both.

But actually, for subset definition, it's about selecting from the first n and second n.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of available pairs.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of available numbers in each half.

Let me try to think of a way to select 2k elements from each half such that their XORs match.

An idea: select k pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of two identical numbers, one from the first half and one from the second half.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements, so that would be k pairs.

But the problem allows any subset, not necessarily pairs of identical numbers.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Another idea: since XOR is involved, maybe I can look at the XOR of all elements in the first half and second half, and adjust the subsets accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can select a subset from the first half and then find a subset in the second half that has the same XOR.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that each number appears exactly twice, once in each half.

Wait, no, it's possible for a number to appear twice in the same half.

But the problem says "each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a".

So, each integer appears twice in the entire array, but they can be in the same half or split between the two halves.

Given that, perhaps I can look at the numbers that appear in both halves.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers based on where their two occurrences are.

Let me categorize the numbers:

- Type A: both occurrences in the first n.

- Type B: both occurrences in the second n.

- Type C: one occurrence in the first n and one in the second n.

Let me count how many numbers are in each type.

Given that, I can think about selecting elements from these types to form l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can select some numbers of type C, where one is in l and one is in r.

Since they are the same number, their XORs will cancel out.

Then, I need to make sure that the remaining selections from type A and type B balance out the XORs.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

An idea: select 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the second n such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Let me denote XOR_l as the XOR of l and XOR_r as the XOR of r.

I need XOR_l == XOR_r.

Which is equivalent to XOR_l XOR XOR_r == 0.

But XOR_l XOR XOR_r is equal to the XOR of all elements in l and r.

Wait, no.

Actually, XOR_l XOR XOR_r is equal to the XOR of all elements in l and r, because XOR is associative and commutative.

Wait, more precisely, XOR_l XOR XOR_r is equal to the XOR of the symmetric difference of l and r.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Let me consider the total XOR of all elements in the first n and second n.

Let me denote XOR_first as the XOR of the first n elements, and XOR_second as the XOR of the second n elements.

Now, if I select l from the first n and r from the second n, then XOR_l is the XOR of l, and XOR_r is the XOR of r.

I need XOR_l == XOR_r.

Which means XOR_l XOR XOR_r == 0.

But XOR_l XOR XOR_r == XOR_l + XOR_r (in XOR terms).

Wait, but I can relate this to the total XORs.

Actually, XOR_l is a subset of XOR_first, and XOR_r is a subset of XOR_second.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the difference between XOR_first and XOR_second.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Given that, perhaps I can select k pairs of numbers, where each pair has the same number in both l and r.

Wait, but that might not necessarily make the XORs equal.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for numbers that appear in both halves.

Let me consider that for numbers of type C (one in first n, one in second n), selecting one for l and one for r won't affect the XOR since they are the same number, and XORing the same number twice cancels out.

For numbers of type A (both in first n), selecting both would give XOR as 0 for that number.

Similarly, for type B (both in second n), selecting both would give XOR as 0.

Wait, perhaps I can aim to select pairs of numbers in such a way that their XORs balance out.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a simpler approach.

Given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, perhaps there is a straightforward way to construct l and r.

Looking back at the examples, in the first test case, they selected the same elements for l and r.

In the second test case, they selected different elements.

So, perhaps there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements that appear in both halves.

Wait, but I need to select from the first n and second n specifically.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements that appear in both halves, but I need to be careful about from which half I select them.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me consider a different angle.

Suppose I select some elements from the first n for l and some from the second n for r.

I need the XOR of l to equal the XOR of r.

An idea: select elements for l and r such that the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero.

But again, I need a practical way to select such subsets.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, I can think in terms of their contributions to the XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can select k pairs of identical numbers, one from the first n and one from the second n, and include them in l and r respectively.

But then, their XORs would be equal because they are the same numbers.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in total for l and 2k for r.

Wait, actually, if I select k pairs of identical numbers, that would be 2k elements in total, but split between l and r.

Wait, no, l and r each should have 2k elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to select 2k elements from each half.

Wait, perhaps I need to select k pairs of identical numbers, and for each pair, put one in l and one in r.

But then l and r would each have k elements, but the problem requires 2k elements in each.

Wait, the problem says to output two lines, each with 2k integers.

Wait, actually, looking back, the problem says to output two lines, each with 2k integers, where the first line is l, a subset of the first n elements, and the second line is r, a subset of the second n elements, and their XORs should be equal.

Wait, but in the examples, they have 2k elements in each.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, k=1, so 2k=2, and they output two elements in each line.

In the second test case, n=6, k=1, 2k=2, again two elements in each line.

In the third test case, n=4, k=1, 2k=2, two elements in each line.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=2, 2k=4, four elements in each line.

So, yes, each line should have 2k elements.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be trying to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

But perhaps the approach is not correct.

Wait, let's look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

l = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

re = ul = ur = 0

res = []

for i in range(n):

l[a[i]-1] += 1

for i in range(n, 2*n):

r[a[i]-1] += 1

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

l[a[i]-1] = 0

ul += 2

if ul == k*2:

break

k = 2*k - ul

if k:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] == 1:

print(a[i], end=' ')

re += 1

res.append(a[i])

if re == k:

break

print()

for i in res:

print(i, end=' ')

if ul != ur:

for i in range(n, 2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

r[a[i]-1] = 0

ur += 2

if ul == ur:

break

print()

So, what's happening here?

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and k, and then the array a of length 2n.

Then, it initializes two frequency arrays, l and r, each of size n, to count the occurrences of each number in the first n and second n elements respectively.

Then, it iterates through the first n elements to count their frequencies in l, and through the second n elements to count their frequencies in r.

Then, it iterates through the first n elements again, and for each number that appears twice in the first n (l[a[i]-1] == 2), it prints two instances of that number as part of l, sets l[a[i]-1] to 0, and increments ul by 2.

It does this until ul reaches 2k.

If ul reaches 2k, it breaks.

Then, it sets k to 2k - ul, which would be zero if ul == 2k.

If k is still positive, meaning that ul < 2k, it then tries to select additional elements from the first n that appear only once (l[a[i]-1] == 1), prints them, adds them to res, and increments re by 1, until re reaches k.

Then, it prints a newline.

Then, it prints the elements in res.

Then, if ul != ur, it tries to select elements from the second n that appear twice (r[a[i]-1] == 2), prints two instances of them as part of r, sets r[a[i]-1] to 0, and increments ur by 2, until ul == ur.

Finally, it prints a newline.

Wait, but ur is initially zero, and it only increments ur when it prints two elements from the second n.

Wait, but ul is the count of elements selected for l, and ur is the count of elements selected for r.

Wait, but the problem requires that both l and r have exactly 2k elements.

But in this code, it seems that it's trying to make sure that l has 2k elements, and then r has 2k elements, but it's not clear if it's ensuring that.

Wait, in the first loop, it selects elements from the first n that appear twice, and prints two instances of them for l, until it has 2k elements.

If it doesn't reach 2k, it selects additional elements that appear once.

Then, for r, it seems to select elements that appear twice in the second n, printing two instances of them, until ur equals ul, which is 2k.

But wait, ur is initialized to zero, and it increments ur by 2 each time it prints two elements from the second n.

So, it seems to be trying to make ur equal to ul, which is 2k.

But, the problem requires that both l and r have exactly 2k elements each.

Wait, but in the code, it's selecting 2k elements for l, and then selecting 2k elements for r.

But it's not clear if the selections are correct in terms of their XORs being equal.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to select the same elements for l and r, but that's not always possible, as seen in the second test case.

Wait, in the second test case, l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], which are different elements but have the same XOR.

So, the approach needs to ensure that the XORs are equal, not necessarily that the elements are the same.

But in the code, it's selecting elements for l and r independently, based on their frequencies, but it's not clear how this ensures that their XORs are equal.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to select elements to make their XORs equal.

Let me think differently.

An idea: since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select 2k elements from each half with equal XOR, perhaps I can look at the XOR of all elements in the first n and the second n, and adjust the selections accordingly.

Let me denote XOR_first as the XOR of the first n elements, and XOR_second as the XOR of the second n elements.

Now, if I select a subset l from the first n with XOR_l, then the remaining elements in the first n have XOR equal to XOR_first XOR XOR_l.

Similarly, if I select a subset r from the second n with XOR_r, then the remaining elements in the second n have XOR equal to XOR_second XOR XOR_r.

But I need XOR_l == XOR_r.

So, XOR_l == XOR_r.

But I'm not sure how to use this directly to select l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the difference between XOR_first and XOR_second.

Let me think about the XOR of the entire array.

The XOR of the entire array is XOR_first XOR XOR_second.

But since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and XOR is commutative and associative, the overall XOR of the entire array is zero because each pair of identical numbers XORs to zero.

Wait, but that's only if n is even, because each number appears twice.

Wait, no, actually, XOR of two identical numbers is zero, and zero XOR any number is that number.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If a number appears twice, its XOR is zero. So, if all numbers appear twice, the XOR of the entire array should be zero.

Wait, but in the fourth test case:

Array:5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2

XOR of all elements: 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 6 XOR 4 XOR 6 XOR 4 XOR 2

Which is (5 XOR 5) XOR (1 XOR 1) XOR (3 XOR 3) XOR (2 XOR 2) XOR (6 XOR 6) XOR (4 XOR 4) = 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 0.

So, the XOR of the entire array is zero.

Similarly, in the first test case: 1,2,2,1 -> 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0.

So, in general, the XOR of the entire array is zero.

Therefore, XOR_first XOR XOR_second = 0, which implies XOR_first = XOR_second.

That's an important observation.

So, XOR_first = XOR_second.

Now, I need to select subsets l from the first n and r from the second n, each with 2k elements, such that XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that XOR_first = XOR_second, perhaps I can use this to my advantage.

Let me think about the XOR of l and the XOR of the remaining elements in the first n.

Let me denote the remaining elements in the first n after selecting l as l'.

Similarly, the remaining elements in the second n after selecting r are r'.

Since XOR_first = XOR_l XOR l', and XOR_second = XOR_r XOR r'.

But since XOR_first = XOR_second, and XOR_l = XOR_r, then XOR_l XOR l' = XOR_l XOR r'.

Therefore, l' = r'.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, if XOR_l = XOR_r, and XOR_first = XOR_l XOR l', and XOR_second = XOR_r XOR r', and XOR_first = XOR_second, then XOR_l XOR l' = XOR_r XOR r'.

But since XOR_l = XOR_r, then l' = r'.

Which means that the remaining elements in the first n and second n after selecting l and r should be equal.

But that seems tricky to arrange.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting l and r such that the XOR of l and r is equal.

But I need to find a way to construct such subsets.

Let me consider that since XOR_first = XOR_second, and I need XOR_l = XOR_r, perhaps I can select l and r such that l' = r'.

But I'm not sure how to do that directly.

Let me consider a different approach.

An idea: since the XOR of the entire array is zero, and XOR_first = XOR_second, perhaps I can select l and r such that l XOR r = XOR_first XOR XOR_second
