Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a certain operation on it no more than 5*10^5 times. The operation involves choosing a subarray defined by indices l and r, computing the MEX of that subarray, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing these operations.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. For example, MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

So, the operation allows me to choose any subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't have to use all of them. The challenge is to maximize the sum of the array.

Given that n can be up to 18, which is relatively small, it suggests that the solution might involve some kind of dynamic programming or exhaustive search, but since n is small, it's manageable.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

In the first sample:

Input:

2

0 1

Output:

4 1

1 2

So, the array is [0,1]. The MEX of the entire array is 2 (since 0 and 1 are present), so setting both elements to 2 gives a sum of 4.

In the second sample:

Input:

3

1 3 9

Output:

13 0

Here, the sum is already 13, and no operations are needed because any operation would set a subarray to its MEX, which wouldn't increase the sum.

In the third sample:

Input:

4

1 100 2 1

Output:

105 2

3 3

3 4

So, operations are performed on subarrays [3,3] and [3,4].

Initially, the array is [1,100,2,1]. After the first operation on [3,3], which is the element 2. The MEX of this single element is whatever is not in the set {2}, which is 0, so it sets it to 0. Now the array is [1,100,0,1]. Then, operation on [3,4], which is [0,1], MEX is 2, so set both to 2. Now the array is [1,100,2,2], sum is 105.

In the fourth sample:

Input:

1

0

Output:

1 1

1 1

So, single element 0, MEX of [0] is 1, set it to 1, sum becomes 1.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to identify subarrays where setting them to their MEX increases the total sum, and perform such operations.

Now, looking at the provided program:

The program reads input, processes the array, performs some operations, and outputs the final sum and the sequence of operations.

Let's try to understand the program step by step.

First, it reads the input:

input()

lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then, it defines some functions: func_1, func_2, func_3.

func_1 seems to find the subarray that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the increase in the sum.

It iterates over all possible subarrays, computes the sum if that subarray is set to its MEX, and keeps track of the subarray that gives the maximum sum.

func_2 seems to be related to performing operations on subarrays recursively.

func_3 applies the operation to the subarray defined by l and r, sets it to its MEX, and updates the list and operations list.

After defining these functions, the main logic seems to be:

- Find the best subarray to operate on using func_1.

- While there is a subarray that increases the sum, perform operations using func_3.

- Then, try to set any remaining 0s to 1 by performing operations on individual elements.

Finally, it prints the sum and the list of operations.

Looking back at the sample inputs and the operations performed, it seems plausible that this approach could work.

However, I need to verify if this program correctly maximizes the sum for any given input within the constraints.

One thing I notice is that the program uses a brute-force approach to find the best subarray to operate on, which is acceptable given that n is up to 18, so the number of subarrays is manageable (n*(n+1)/2, which is around 171 for n=18).

But, I need to think about whether repeatedly applying this operation will always lead to the maximum possible sum.

Also, I need to consider if there are any edge cases where this approach might fail.

Let me think about a small example.

Suppose the array is [0,0,0].

The MEX of the entire array is 0, since 0 is present. So, setting all elements to 0 doesn't change anything.

But, if I operate on a subarray [1,1], MEX is 1 (since {0} doesn't have 1), set it to 1.

Now array is [1,0,0].

Then, operate on [2,3], MEX is 0 (since {0,0} has 0), set to 0.

Sum is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Alternatively, operate on [1,2], MEX is 1 (since {0,0} has 0, so MEX is 1), set to 1.

Now array is [1,1,0].

Then, operate on [3,3], MEX is 0, set to 0.

Sum is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Alternatively, operate on [1,3], MEX is 1 (since {1,1,0} has 0 and 1, so MEX is 2), set to 2.

Sum is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Wait, that seems better.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array at once gives a better sum than operating on parts separately.

Does the program handle this correctly?

In func_1, it seems to find the single operation that gives the maximum sum increase, and then applies it, and repeats.

But in this case, operating on the entire array at once gives a better sum than operating on parts separately.

So, in this case, it should operate on [1,3], set all to 2, sum becomes 6.

Is that what the program does?

Looking at func_1, it seems to consider all possible subarrays and chooses the one that maximizes the sum if set to its MEX.

In this case, operating on [1,3] would give sum = 2*3 = 6, which is better than operating on [1,2] and [3,3] separately, which would give sum = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

So, yes, it seems to choose the best subarray in one operation.

But, I need to think about whether repeating this process multiple times will lead to the optimal sum.

Suppose we have [0,0,1].

Operating on [1,2], MEX is 1, set to 1.

Now array is [1,1,1].

Sum is 3.

Alternatively, operating on [1,3], MEX is 2 (since {0,0,1} has 0 and 1), set to 2.

Sum is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Better.

So, again, operating on larger subarrays can be better.

Another example: [0,1,2].

Operating on [1,3], MEX is 3 (since {0,1,2} has 0,1,2), set to 3.

Sum is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Operating on individual elements:

Set [1,1] to MEX 1, [2,2] to MEX 0, [3,3] to MEX 0.

Sum is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1, which is worse.

So, operating on the entire array is better.

Another example: [0,1,3].

MEX of [1,3] is 2, set to 2.

Sum is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

But, operating on [1,2], MEX is 2 (since {0,1} has 0 and 1), set to 2.

Then, [3,3], MEX is 0, set to 0.

Sum is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is worse.

So, operating on the entire array is better.

So, it seems that operating on larger subarrays can lead to better sums, but not always.

For example, [0,1,2,3].

Operating on [1,4], MEX is 4, set to 4.

Sum is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.

Operating on [1,3], MEX is 3, set to 3.

Then [4,4], MEX is 0, set to 0.

Sum is 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9, which is worse.

So, operating on the entire array is better.

Wait, but in the third sample input, operating on subarrays separately led to a better sum.

Wait, in the third sample:

Input: 1 100 2 1

Operations:

3 3: set [2] to MEX 0

Then 3 4: set [0,1] to MEX 2

Result: [1,100,2,2], sum 105

Alternatively, operating on the entire array [1,4], MEX is 0 (since {1,100,2,1} has 1 and 2 and 100, so MEX is 0), set to 0.

Sum would be 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is worse.

So, in this case, operating on subarrays separately is better.

So, the program needs to choose wisely which subarrays to operate on.

Now, looking back at the program, func_1 tries to find the subarray that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum.

But, in the third sample, operating on [3,3] and then [3,4] leads to a better sum than operating on the entire array.

So, perhaps the program is correctly identifying the best subarrays to operate on in sequence.

But, I need to think about whether this greedy approach of always choosing the best subarray at each step leads to the global optimum.

Is there a case where choosing a suboptimal operation early on leads to a better overall sum later?

Hmm.

Let me think about [0,0,1,2].

Option 1:

Operate on [1,4], MEX is 3, set to 3.

Sum: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.

Option 2:

Operate on [1,2], MEX is 1, set to 1.

Now array: [1,1,1,2].

Operate on [3,4], MEX is 0, set to 0.

Sum: 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Worse.

Option 3:

Operate on [1,3], MEX is 2, set to 2.

Now array: [2,2,2,2].

Sum: 8.

Better than option 2, but worse than operating on the entire array.

Option 4:

Operate on [2,4], MEX is 0, set to 0.

Now array: [0,0,0,0].

Sum: 0.

Worse.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array is best.

But, according to the program, func_1 would choose the subarray that gives the maximum sum increase, which in this case is [1,4], giving sum 12.

But, in the third sample, it chose to operate on [3,3] and then [3,4], leading to sum 105, which is better than operating on the entire array.

Wait, in the third sample, operating on the entire array [1,4], MEX is 0, set to 0, sum 0, which is worse than 105.

So, the program correctly chose not to operate on the entire array.

Hence, the program seems to make the right choice.

Another consideration: Since n is small, perhaps the optimal solution involves performing operations on overlapping subarrays in a specific sequence to maximize the sum.

But, in the provided program, it seems to iteratively choose the best subarray at each step and apply the operation, updating the array each time.

I need to think about whether this iterative greedy choice leads to the global optimum.

Another potential issue is that performing operations in a certain sequence might prevent performing better operations later on, but in the program, it seems to always choose the best possible operation at each step, which should lead to the global optimum.

Also, the program, after no more operations can increase the sum, tries to set any remaining 0s to 1, which makes sense because setting 0 to 1 increases the sum by 1, and it's the best we can do for individual elements.

Given that, it seems the program is correctly maximizing the sum.

Now, regarding the operations not exceeding 5*10^5, since n is small (up to 18), and each operation is O(n^2), but since n is small, it's manageable.

Also, the program seems to perform operations only when they increase the sum, so it shouldn't perform unnecessary operations.

Hence, I think the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
