Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. So, it's not about the positions but about having at least k common elements between the subsegment and b.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b," and in the example, it shows that even if you rearrange the subsegment, as long as at least k elements are the same as in b, it's good. So, it's about having at least k elements that are present in b, considering the frequency of each element.

Hmm, so I need to consider the frequency of each element in b and ensure that the subsegment has at least that frequency for at least k elements.

Wait, but k refers to the number of matching elements, not the frequency. Let me read the problem again.

"at least k of them match the elements of array b"

So, it's about having at least k elements in the subsegment that are also in b, regardless of their positions.

But in the example, for b = [1,2,3,4] and k=3, the subsegment [4,1,2,3] is good because all 4 elements are in b, which is more than k=3. Another subsegment [2,3,4,5] is good because 3 elements (2,3,4) are in b, which meets k=3. But [3,4,5,6] is not good because only 2 elements (3,4) are in b, which is less than k=3.

So, it seems like for each subsegment, I need to count how many elements are also in b, and if this count is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b," which might imply considering the frequency of elements in b. For example, if b has two 3's, then the subsegment needs to have at least two 3's to match both.

But in the example provided, b has unique elements, so frequencies aren't an issue. Let me see if there's an example where b has duplicate elements.

Looking back at the problem, it says "elements of array b are not necessarily unique," so b can have duplicates.

So, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Wait, but in the matching, it's about rearranging the subsegment to match at least k elements of b. So, it's about having at least k elements in the subsegment that are also in b, considering the frequency.

So, I need to count, for each subsegment, how many elements are common between the subsegment and b, considering the frequency, and if this count is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

Wait, but in the example, b has unique elements, so frequency isn't a concern. But to generalize, I need to handle cases where b has duplicate elements.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t, the number of test cases, is up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2e5, and similarly for m.

So, I need an efficient way to process each test case quickly.

First, for each test case, I need to find the number of subsegments of a of length m that have at least k elements that are also in b, considering the frequency of elements in b.

To do this efficiently, I can precompute the frequency of each element in b using a counter.

Then, for each subsegment of a of length m, I can count how many elements are in b by checking if each element in the subsegment is in b's counter and has a positive count.

But doing this naively for each subsegment would be too slow because m can be up to 2e5, and n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases being 2e5.

So, I need a sliding window approach to process each subsegment efficiently.

I can initialize a counter for the first subsegment of a, count how many elements are in b, and then slide the window by one, updating the counts accordingly.

Wait, but if I use a sliding window, I can maintain a window of size m, and keep track of how many elements in the window are also in b, considering the frequency.

So, I can initialize a counter for the first m elements of a, and count how many of them are in b's counter with positive frequency.

Then, as I slide the window to the right, I add the new element and remove the leftmost element of the previous window, updating the count accordingly.

This way, I can efficiently compute the number of good subsegments.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, create a counter for b, which counts the frequency of each element in b.

Then, for the first subsegment of a of length m, create a counter for these m elements, and find the intersection of this counter with b's counter. Sum the minimum frequencies for each element present in both counters. If this sum is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

Then, as I slide the window to the right, I add the new element if it's in b's counter, and remove the element that is no longer in the window.

Wait, but I need to consider the frequency. So, I need to keep track of the frequency of each element in the current window that is also in b.

This seems a bit tricky, but I can maintain a count of how many elements in the current window are matching elements based on b's frequencies.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to keep a frequency counter for the current window, and keep a sum of the minimum frequencies between the window's counter and b's counter.

If this sum is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let cb be the counter of b.

For each subsegment of a of length m, let ca be the counter of the subsegment.

Then, the number of matching elements is the sum over all elements of min(ca[element], cb[element]).

If this sum is at least k, then it's a good subsegment.

So, I need to compute this sum for each subsegment efficiently.

Using a sliding window approach, I can maintain the current sum of min(ca[element], cb[element]).

When I slide the window to the right, I add the new element and remove the leftmost element of the previous window.

When adding a new element, if it's in b's counter and its frequency in the window is less than its frequency in b, then the sum increases by 1.

If its frequency in the window is already equal to its frequency in b, then the sum doesn't increase.

Similarly, when removing an element, if its frequency in the window was equal to its frequency in b, then the sum decreases by 1.

Otherwise, it stays the same.

So, I can keep track of the sum by updating it based on adding and removing elements.

This seems efficient because it's O(n) per test case.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is 2e5, this should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read array a of size n

- Read array b of size m

- Initialize cb as Counter(b)

- Initialize ca as Counter(a[0:m])

- Initialize sum as sum of min(ca[element], cb[element]) for all elements

- Initialize answer as 0

- If sum >= k, increment answer

- For each position i from m to n-1:

- If a[i] is in cb and ca[a[i]] < cb[a[i]], then sum += 1

- ca[a[i]] += 1

- If a[i - m] is in cb and ca[a[i - m]] <= cb[a[i - m]], then sum -= 1

- ca[a[i - m]] -= 1

- If sum >= k, increment answer

- Output answer

Wait, but in the code provided, it's using sorted arrays and counters.

Let me look at the provided code:

from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):

cb = Counter(sorted(b))

ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

ans = 0

sm = sum((ca & cb).values())

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

for r in range(m, n):

if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sm += 1

ca[a[r]] += 1

if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:

sm -= 1

ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

return ans

So, it's defining a function func_1 that takes n, m, k, a, b as arguments.

It initializes cb as Counter of sorted b, and ca as Counter of sorted first m elements of a.

Then, it computes sm as the sum of the minimum frequencies between ca and cb using the & operator, which gives the intersection of counters.

If sm >= k, it increments ans.

Then, it slides the window from m to n-1:

- If ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], it increments sm and updates ca[a[r]]

- If ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], it decrements sm and updates ca[a[r - m]]

- If sm >= k, it increments ans

Finally, it returns ans.

Wait, but sorting a and b might not be necessary, and it might even be problematic because the order shouldn't matter since we're considering rearrangements.

But in the code, it's sorting a and b before creating the counters. I think this is unnecessary because counters are frequency maps, and sorting doesn't change the frequencies.

So, sorting here is redundant and might even be harmful because it changes the order of elements, but since we're using counters, the order doesn't matter.

I think the code would work the same without sorting a and b.

Let me try removing the sorted part.

So, cb = Counter(b) and ca = Counter(a[:m])

Then, sm = sum((ca & cb).values())

Then, the sliding window logic remains the same.

Yes, that should work.

Now, let's check if this logic is correct.

In the sliding window, when we add a new element a[r], if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], then sm += 1, because we're adding an element that is still needed in b.

Otherwise, if ca[a[r]] >= cb[a[r]], then adding another a[r] doesn't increase sm because we already have enough of a[r] to match b.

Similarly, when removing a[r - m], if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], then sm -= 1, because we're removing an element that was contributing to the match.

Otherwise, if ca[a[r - m]] > cb[a[r - m]], then removing it doesn't affect sm because we still have enough of a[r - m] to match b.

This seems correct.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

So, cb = Counter({1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1})

First subsegment: a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

ca = Counter({1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1})

sm = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4, which is >=2, so ans=1

Next, subsegment a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4]

ca.update({5:1}), remove {4:1}

ca now is {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

But wait, in the code, it's ca[a[r]] +=1 and ca[a[r - m]] -=1

So, for r=4, a[4]=4

Since ca[4]=1 < cb[4]=1, sm +=1 to 5

But actually, it should remain 4 because we're replacing 4 with 4, so sm should stay the same.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, no, in this case, ca[4] was 1, which is equal to cb[4]=1, so adding another 4 doesn't increase sm because ca[4] >= cb[4].

Wait, but in the code, it checks if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], which is ca[4]=1 < cb[4]=1? 1 < 1 is False, so sm doesn't increase.

Then, ca[4] becomes 2.

Then, remove a[1 - m = -3], which is a[-3]=4

ca[4] was 2, cb[4]=1, so ca[4] <= cb[4]? 2 <=1? No, so sm doesn't decrease.

Then, ca[4] becomes 1.

So, sm remains 4.

Similarly, for r=5, a[5]=5

ca[5]=0 < cb[5]=0, so sm +=1 to 5

Wait, cb[5]=0 because 5 is not in b.

So, ca[5]=1 < cb[5]=0? Wait, cb[5]=0, so ca[5] < cb[5] is False, so sm doesn't increase.

Then, ca[5]=1

Remove a[2]=2

ca[2]=1 <= cb[2]=1, so sm -=1 to 4 -1=3

Then, ca[2]=0

Next, r=6, a[6]=6

ca[6]=0 < cb[6]=0, so sm doesn't increase, ca[6]=1

Remove a[3]=3

ca[3]=1 <= cb[3]=1, so sm -=1 to 3-1=2

ca[3]=0

So, sm=2 >=2, ans=4

Which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = Counter({1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1})

First subsegment: a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

ca = Counter({1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1})

sm = 4 >=3, ans=1

Next, a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4]

ca.update({4:2}, remove {4:1} -> ca={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sm remains 4 >=3, ans=2

Next, a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5]

ca.update({5:1}, remove {1:1} -> ca={1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

sm = min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(0,0)=0+1+1+1+0=3 >=3, ans=3

Next, a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6]

ca.update({6:1}, remove {2:1} -> ca={1:0,2:0,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

sm = min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(0,0)+min(0,0)=0+0+1+1+0+0=2 <3, ans=3

So, total ans=3, which matches the second test case.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = Counter({1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1})

First subsegment: a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3]

ca = Counter({1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1})

sm = 4 >=4, ans=1

Next, a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4]

ca.update({4:2}, remove {4:1} -> ca={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sm remains 4 >=4, ans=2

Next, a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5]

ca.update({5:1}, remove {1:1} -> ca={1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

sm = 3 <4, ans=2

Next, a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6]

ca.update({6:1}, remove {2:1} -> ca={1:0,2:0,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

sm = 2 <4, ans=2

Which matches the third test case.

Seems correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
