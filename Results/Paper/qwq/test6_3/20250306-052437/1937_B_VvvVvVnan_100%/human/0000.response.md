Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a 2xN grid filled with 0s and 1s. There's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) and it needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only move one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths produce this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lex smallest string means. If I have two strings, the lex smaller one is the one that would appear first in a dictionary. So, for example, between "001" and "010", "001" is smaller because the first difference is at the second position, and 0 is less than 1.

Given that, I need to find the path that gives me the smallest possible string in this lex order, and then count how many such paths there are.

Let's think about how the grasshopper can move. From any cell, it can move right or down, but it can't move left or up. So, from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1). From (1,2), it can go to (1,3) or (2,2), and so on. Eventually, it needs to reach (2,N).

Each path corresponds to a sequence of moves: a series of rights and downs. The string is constructed by collecting the values in the cells in the order visited.

To find the lex smallest string, I need to choose the path where the sequence of cell values is as small as possible in lex order.

One way to approach this is to consider the decisions at each step: whether to move right or down. At each decision point, I should choose the move that leads to the smallest possible remaining string.

But that sounds a bit too vague. Maybe I can model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges represent moves. Then, I can try to find the path with the lex smallest string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, building such a graph is not feasible due to time and space constraints. So, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the structure of the grid. It's only 2 rows, but N can be large. So, perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to traverse the grid that allows me to determine the smallest string without exploring all possible paths.

Let's consider that the grasshopper starts at (1,1). From there, it can go right to (1,2) or down to (2,1).

Suppose a_{11} is 0. Then, moving to (1,2) would add another a_{12}, and moving down to (2,1) would add a_{21}.

I need to choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire path. Maybe I should think recursively.

Define a function that, given the current position, returns the lex smallest string from there to the end, and the count of paths that produce that string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, a recursive approach would be too slow unless it's optimized with memoization.

But even with memoization, the state space might be too large.

Is there a better way to model this?

Let me think about the path the grasshopper takes. Each path can be represented by a sequence of moves: R (right) and D (down). Since it starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), it needs to make exactly one down move and (N-1) right moves, but the order matters.

Wait, no. Actually, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step, as long as it reaches (2,N).

Wait, actually, more carefully: from (1,1), each move is either right or down, but it can't move down from (2,j), it can only move right.

Wait no, the grid is only 2 rows. So from (1,j), it can move to (1,j+1) or (2,j). From (2,j), it can only move to (2,j+1).

So, from (1,j), it can choose to go down to (2,j) or right to (1,j+1).

From (2,j), it can only go right to (2,j+1).

So, the path consists of a sequence of right and down moves, but with the constraint that down moves can only be from (1,j) to (2,j), and once it's in row 2, it can only move right.

So, effectively, the grasshopper chooses at some point to move down from (1,j) to (2,j), and then continues right to (2,N).

So, the path can be characterized by the column index where it decides to move down.

And, for each possible down move column, the string is constructed by collecting the values along that path.

So, to find the lex smallest string, I need to consider all possible down move columns and find which one gives the smallest string.

Wait, but it's not just about the down move column. Because, depending on when it moves down, the order of collecting the values changes.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the path where the grasshopper moves down at column k as P_k.

So, for P_k, the string is:

- From (1,1) to (1,k): a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}

- Then down to (2,k): a_{2k}

- Then right to (2,N): a_{2,k+1}, a_{2,k+2}, ..., a_{2N}

So, the string for P_k is: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} a_{2,k+1} ... a_{2N}

Now, to find the lex smallest string, I need to choose k such that this sequence is smallest possible.

So, I can iterate through all possible k from 1 to N, compute the string for each P_k, and find the smallest one.

But with N up to 2*10^5, iterating through all k and comparing strings would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to find the k that gives the smallest string.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different k values efficiently.

Let’s consider two consecutive k: k and k+1.

String for k: s_k = a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} a_{2,k+1} ... a_{2N}

String for k+1: s_{k+1} = a_{11} ... a_{1,k+1} a_{2,k+1} a_{2,k+2} ... a_{2N}

I need to compare s_k and s_{k+1} to see which one is smaller.

To do this efficiently, I can look for the first position where s_k and s_{k+1} differ.

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings as being composed of three parts:

- Prefix: a_{11} ... a_{1,k-1}

- Middle: a_{1k} a_{2k}

- Suffix: a_{2,k+1} ... a_{2N}

Wait, but this isn't accurate because in P_k, the string is a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} a_{2,k+1} ... a_{2N}, which includes a_{1k}, whereas in P_{k+1}, it's a_{11} ... a_{1,k} a_{1,k+1} a_{2,k+1} ... a_{2N}.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best way.

Let me try to think differently.

Since the grid has only two rows, maybe I can model the problem as choosing a point to switch from row 1 to row 2.

Yes, exactly. The grasshopper stays in row 1 until some column k, then switches to row 2 at column k, and stays in row 2 until column N.

So, the string is a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} ... a_{2N}

Now, to find the lex smallest string, I need to choose k such that this sequence is smallest.

I need to find the k that minimizes the string a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} ... a_{2N}

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the smallest string found.

But again, with N up to 2*10^5, this would be too slow if done naively.

I need a way to find the smallest string among all possible P_k efficiently.

Let me consider that for k from 1 to N, the string is a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} ... a_{2N}

I can think of it as concatenating two parts: the prefix from row 1 up to k, and the suffix from row 2 starting from k.

So, s_k = a_{11} ... a_{1k} + a_{2k} ... a_{2N}

I need to find the k that gives the smallest s_k.

To find the lex smallest string, I can compare s_k and s_{k+1} and see which one is smaller.

But comparing strings directly would be inefficient for large N.

I need a way to find the minimal string among all s_k in linear time or O(N log N) time.

One idea is to precompute the suffix strings a_{2k} ... a_{2N} for all k, and also the prefixes a_{11} ... a_{1k}, and then find the k that gives the smallest concatenation of prefix and suffix.

But still, comparing strings for each k would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible continuation.

Let me think about it step by step.

Start at (1,1). At each step, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

If I stay in row 1, I append a_{1,j+1} to the string.

If I switch to row 2 at column j, I append a_{2,j} and then a_{2,j+1} to a_{2,N}.

I need to choose the path where the sequence is lex smallest.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the current position and the current string built so far.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the grasshopper can only switch from row 1 to row 2 at most once, since once it's in row 2, it can't go back to row 1.

So, the path is: stay in row 1 for some columns, then switch to row 2 at some column, and stay in row 2 until the end.

So, the minimal string would be the one where the switch point k is chosen such that the concatenation of a_{11}...a_{1k} and a_{2k}...a_{2N} is lex smallest.

I need to find the k that minimizes this concatenation.

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_k.

But again, with N up to 2*10^5, I need a way to find the minimal s_k without comparing all of them directly.

An idea is to find the position where the strings start differing when comparing s_k and s_{k+1}.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me consider that the grasshopper will stay in row 1 as long as it's beneficial, and switch to row 2 at the earliest beneficial opportunity.

But what does "beneficial" mean in terms of lex order?

It means that switching to row 2 at column k should lead to a smaller string than staying in row 1.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and at each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I can keep track of the current string being built, and choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty string.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, decide whether to move right in the current row or, if in row 1, whether to move down to row 2.

Choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Continue until reaching (2,N).

This seems promising.

To implement this, I need a way to compare the options at each step.

At position (r,c), I can:

- If r == 1, move right to (1,c+1), appending a_{1,c+1} to the string.

- If r == 2, move right to (2,c+1), appending a_{2,c+1} to the string.

- If r == 1, move down to (2,c), appending a_{2,c} to the string.

I need to choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

To do this, I can look ahead and see which move gives the smallest next character.

But since the grid is only 2 rows, I can compare the options directly.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a path where at each step, I choose the move that gives the smallest possible next character, given the constraints.

But I need to be careful because choosing the smallest next character might not lead to the overall smallest string if it forces suboptimal choices later on.

However, in practice, this greedy approach often works for such problems.

Let me try to implement this idea.

I'll start at (1,1). The current string is empty.

Option 1: move right to (1,2), append a_{12}.

Option 2: move down to (2,1), append a_{21}.

Choose the option that leads to the smallest string.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire path, not just the next step.

To make it more precise, perhaps I can simulate the path by always choosing the smallest available move, considering the future moves.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first sample input:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string = 0 0 0

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string = 0 0 0

Both paths give the same string "000", which is the smallest possible.

Number of such paths is 2.

Another sample:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 0 1 0

2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 0 0 0

3. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

4. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

The lex smallest string is "11000" from path 2, and only one path produces it.

So, in this case, choosing to switch at column 3 gives the smallest string.

How can I generalize this?

I need to find the switch column k that minimizes the string s_k = a_{11}...a_{1k} a_{2k}...a_{2N}

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by comparing the options at each step.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as merging two strings: the string from row 1 and the string from row 2, with the constraint that after switching to row 2, I have to take the rest of row 2.

So, it's similar to finding the smallest string that is a combination of prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2, starting from some k.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest concatenation of a_{11}...a_{1k} and a_{2k}...a_{2N}.

To optimize this, perhaps I can precompute the suffixes of row 2 and prefixes of row 1, and then find the k that minimizes the concatenation.

But comparing strings for each k is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal string by comparing the options at each step.

Let me try to simulate this.

Initialize the current minimal string as the string for k=1: s1 = a_{11}...a_{11} a_{21}...a_{2N}

Then, for k=2, s2 = a_{11} a_{12} a_{22}...a_{2N}

Compare s1 and s2 at the first differing position.

Choose the smaller one, and continue.

But this still seems too slow for large N.

I need a way to find the minimal s_k in linear time.

Another idea: since the grid has only two rows, perhaps I can find the point where switching to row 2 gives a smaller continuation than staying in row 1.

In other words, find the k where a_{2k} is smaller than a_{1,k+1}, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep choosing to stay in row 1 until switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current string as empty.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

To decide, compare the next possible moves:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,c+1}

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,c}

Then, append the rest of row 2: a_{2,c+1}...a_{2,N}

Choose the option that leads to the smallest string.

This sounds similar to the greedy approach.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Define a function that, given the current position, returns the lex smallest string from there to the end.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient implementation.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current path and compare the options at each step.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize an empty list to build the string.

Start at (1,1).

While not at (2,N):

- If current position is in row 1:

- Option 1: move right to (1,c+1), append a_{1,c+1}

- Option 2: move down to (2,c), append a_{2,c}, then append the rest of row 2: a_{2,c+1}...a_{2,N}

- Choose the option that gives the smallest string.

- If current position is in row 2:

- Only option: move right to (2,c+1), append a_{2,c+1}

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To compare the options efficiently, I need a way to compare the strings without building them fully.

Wait, perhaps I can compare the options character by character.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Start at (1,1).

While not at (2,N):

- If current position is in row 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,c+1}, and then continue.

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,c}, and then append the rest of row 2: a_{2,c+1}...a_{2,N}

- Compare option 1 and option 2 character by character to decide which one is smaller.

- Choose the smaller option.

- If current position is in row 2:

- Only option: move right to (2,c+1), append a_{2,c+1}

This seems correct, but I need to make it efficient.

To make it efficient, I can precompute the suffixes of row 2.

Let me precompute the suffixes of row 2: for each c, suffix2[c] = a_{2c} a_{2,c+1} ... a_{2N}

But even better, since row 2 is just a string, I can access its substring in O(1) time if I precompute the suffixes.

Wait, in Python, strings are immutable and accessing substrings is efficient.

So, I can represent the suffixes directly using string slicing.

Now, implement the algorithm:

Initialize an empty list for the result.

Start at (1,1).

While not at (2,N):

- If current position is in row 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,c+1}, and then continue.

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,c}, and then append suffix2[c+1:]

- Compare option 1 and option 2 character by character.

- Choose the smaller one.

- If current position is in row 2:

- Only option: move right to (2,c+1), append a_{2,c+1}

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

To implement this efficiently, I can keep track of the current row and column, and at each step, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on the lex smallest option.

I need to keep building the string and keep track of the path choices.

But I'm not sure how to count the number of paths that lead to the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps after finding the smallest string, I can count how many paths produce that string.

But that might still be inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest string first, and then count the number of paths that produce it.

To find the smallest string, I can iterate through the columns and choose the smallest available character at each step.

Then, to count the number of paths that produce this string, I can keep track of the choices that lead to this string.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Initialize current row as 1, current column as 1.

While current column < N or current row < 2:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column+1}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare the two options and choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column+1}

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this, I need to compare the two options efficiently.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Define a function that, given the current row and column, returns the lex smallest string from there to (2,N).

Use memoization to store the results for each state to avoid recomputing.

But with N up to 2*10^5, memoization might not be efficient enough.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the grid column by column, and at each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 based on which option gives the smallest character at the current step.

This is a greedy approach, but I need to ensure that it leads to the overall smallest string.

Let me consider that at each step, I choose the smallest available character that doesn't compromise future steps.

In other words, at each step, choose the smallest possible character that allows the rest of the string to be as small as possible.

This sounds reasonable.

Let me try implementing this idea.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column < N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare a_{1,current_column} with a_{2,current_column}

- Choose the smaller one.

- If a_{1,current_column} == a_{2,current_column}, choose to stay in row 1.

- Else, choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

Wait, this seems incomplete.

I need to consider the future implications of my choice.

Choosing to stay in row 1 might lead to a smaller string in the future, even if the current character is larger.

Wait, perhaps I need to look ahead one step.

Wait, perhaps I can compare the options based on the current and next characters.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that from row 1, I can choose to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at any column.

I need to find the switch column k that minimizes the string a_{11}...a_{1k} a_{2k}...a_{2N}

To find k that minimizes this, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string.

But again, with N up to 2*10^5, this is too slow.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep choosing the smallest available character at each step, considering both options.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column <= N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare the two options and choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

Wait, this is similar to what I had before.

But I need a way to compare the two options efficiently.

Perhaps I can compare the remaining strings starting from the current position for both options.

But with N up to 2*10^5, this is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that once I switch to row 2, I have to take the rest of row 2.

So, for each k from 1 to N, the string is a_{11}...a_{1k} a_{2k}...a_{2N}

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the position where row 1 starts having a larger value than row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize the minimal string as the string for k=1: s = a_{11} a_{21} ... a_{2N}

Set the current minimal string as s, and set k=1.

For k from 2 to N:

- Compute s_k = a_{11} ... a_{1k} a_{2k} ... a_{2N}

- If s_k < s, set s = s_k

But again, this is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal s_k efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the point where a_{1k} > a_{2k}, and switch at that point.

But this might not always give the correct result.

Let me think about it.

If a_{1k} > a_{2k}, then switching at k would give a smaller string because a_{2k} < a_{1k}.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just at k.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where a_{1k} > a_{2,k-1}, and switch there.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have two strings: one built entirely from row 1 and row 2's last element, and another built by switching to row 2 at some point.

I need to find the minimal among all these.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the string built by staying in row 1 until some k, then switching to row 2.

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

To make it efficient, perhaps I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal s_k.

But again, with N up to 2*10^5, I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize a variable to store the current minimal string.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, choose the option (stay in row 1 or switch to row 2) that leads to the smallest string.

Continue until reaching (2,N).

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Let me try to code this step by step.

Define a function that, given the current row and column, returns the lex smallest string from there to (2,N).

Use memoization to store the results.

But with N up to 2*10^5, memoization might be too slow.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal choices.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column < N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare the two options and choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

Wait, I need a way to compare the two options efficiently.

Let me try to compare the two options character by character.

At each step, when choosing between staying in row 1 or switching to row 2, I need to compare the resulting strings starting from the current position.

To do this efficiently, I can compare the next characters in both options and choose the smaller one.

But I need to look ahead to ensure that choosing one option doesn't lead to a larger string later on.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that once I switch to row 2, I have to take the rest of row 2.

So, for option 1 (stay in row 1), the string is a_{1,current_column} followed by the rest of row 1 up to some point and then row 2.

For option 2 (switch to row 2), the string is a_{2,current_column} followed by the rest of row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffixes of row 2 and compare them directly.

Let me precompute suffix2 = a_{2,current_column} + a_{2,current_column+1} + ... + a_{2,N}

Then, for option 1, it's a_{1,current_column} + suffix1, where suffix1 is the rest of row 1 and row 2.

Wait, no, row 1 only goes up to column N.

Wait, actually, in row 1, if I stay in row 1 until column k, then switch to row 2 at column k, the string is a_{11}...a_{1k} a_{2k}...a_{2N}

So, for option 1 (stay in row 1), the string is a_{1,current_column} + suffix1, where suffix1 is the string from (1, current_column+1) to (2,N).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to implement the greedy approach.

At each step, choose the option that gives the smallest character at the current step, considering the future moves.

In practice, this means choosing to stay in row 1 if a_{1,current_column} is smaller than a_{2,current_column}, otherwise switch to row 2.

But I need to ensure that this leads to the overall smallest string.

Let me try this approach with the second sample input.

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Start at (1,1):

Option 1: stay in row 1, append '1', move to (1,2)

Option 2: switch to row 2, append '1', move to (2,1)

Both options append '1', so choose to stay in row 1.

Append '1', move to (1,2).

Next step:

Option 1: stay in row 1, append '1', move to (1,3)

Option 2: switch to row 2, append '0', move to (2,2)

Compare '1' and '0': '0' is smaller, so choose to switch to row 2.

Append '0', move to (2,2).

Next step:

Only option: move right to (2,3), append '0'

Append '0', move to (2,3).

Next step:

Only option: move right to (2,4), append '0'

Append '0', move to (2,4).

So, the string is '1000', but in the sample input, it's '11000'.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the path.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, s1=1101, s2=1100.

Possible paths:

1. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4): string = 1 1 0 1 0

2. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = 1 1 0 0 0

3. (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

4. (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = 1 1 1 0 0

The smallest is '11000' from path 2.

But in my greedy approach, I got '1000', which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.

I need to consider the entire path and not just the current step.

In the second sample input, choosing to stay in row 1 at the first step leads to a larger string later on.

So, perhaps I need to look ahead more than one step.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the lex smallest string is determined by the earliest position where paths differ.

So, I need to minimize the characters at each position in the string.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 based on which option gives the smallest character at each position.

Wait, but I need to consider that switching to row 2 affects the entire suffix.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the string is built by choosing a sequence of moves, each appending one character.

I need to choose the sequence that results in the lex smallest string.

This sounds like a shortest path problem where the "distance" is the lex order of the string.

But I'm not sure how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a merge of two strings: the string from row 1 and the string from row 2, with the constraint that after switching to row 2, I have to take the rest of row 2.

This is similar to merging two sorted arrays, but with lex order instead of numerical order.

Wait, perhaps I can treat the problem as merging two strings, where I choose to take characters from row 1 until a certain point, then switch to row 2.

I need to choose the switch point that gives the smallest merged string.

This seems similar to merging sorted arrays, but again, with lex order.

I need to find an efficient way to find the minimal merged string.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one where I stay in row 1 as long as it doesn't lead to a larger string later on.

In other words, stay in row 1 until the point where switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to implement a two-pointer approach.

Initialize two pointers: one for row 1 and one for row 2.

But since the grid has dependencies based on the moves, this might not directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal string by choosing to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column <= N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare option 1 and option 2 based on the lex order of the remaining strings.

- Choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

But again, comparing the remaining strings is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize the result string as empty.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column <= N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare option 1 and option 2.

- Choose the smaller one.

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

To compare option 1 and option 2, I need to look at the strings starting from the current position.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need a way to compare them efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute suffixes for row 2 and compare them with the corresponding parts of row 1.

Let me try to precompute suffixes for row 2.

Define suffix2 = [s2[i:] for i in range(N)]

But in Python, this would create a list of strings, which is inefficient for large N.

Instead, I can keep track of the suffix starting from each position.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right and keep track of the minimal choice at each step.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize an empty list for the result string.

Set current row = 1, current column = 1.

While current column <= N:

- If current row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,current_column}, move to (1, current_column+1)

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,current_column}, move to (2, current_column)

- Compare a_{1,current_column} with a_{2,current_column}

- If a_{1,current_column} < a_{2,current_column}, choose option 1

- Else, choose option 2

- If current row == 2:

- Only option: move right to (2, current_column+1), append a_{2,current_column}

- Move to (2, current_column+1)

But this is similar to what I had before, and it didn't give the correct result in the sample input.

In the second sample input, this approach chose '1000' instead of '11000'.

So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

I need to consider that choosing a larger character now might lead to a smaller string later on.

Therefore, I need a way to look ahead and see which option leads to the smallest string.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the minimal string at each position.

Let me define dp[c] as the lex smallest string from column c to N.

Then, dp[c] = a_{r,c} + dp[c+1], where r is the chosen row.

But I need to implement this efficiently.

Implementing this recursively with memoization might be too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

So, perhaps I can implement it iteratively, starting from column N down to column 1.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize dp as a list of strings of size N+1.

Set dp[N] = '' (empty string)

For c from N-1 downto 1:

- If row == 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append a_{1,c}, then dp[c+1]

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append a_{2,c}, then dp[c] (since in row 2, we have to take the rest from c onwards)

- Choose the smaller one.

- If row == 2:

- Only option: append a_{2,c}, then dp[c+1]

Wait, perhaps I need to track the row in the dp state.

Define dp[r,c] as the lex smallest string from row r, column c to (2,N)

Then:

-
