Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them to maximize something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input:

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Another example is n=3 and all elements are 69. So, no matter how I arrange them, the differences will be zero, so beauty is zero.

Okay, so it seems like the beauty is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order. Wait, in the first example, sorting ascending gives the maximum beauty. Let me see another example.

In the third test case, n=5 and the array is [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. If I sort it ascending: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

That matches the sample output. So, it seems like sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty.

Wait a minute, why does sorting ascending maximize the sum of differences? Let's think about it.

If I have two numbers, a and b, with a < b, then b - a is positive. The larger b is relative to a, the larger the difference. So, to maximize the sum of these differences, I want to maximize each difference.

But in the sum, each element except the first and last appears once with a positive sign and once with a negative sign. Wait, let's expand the sum:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Wait, that's interesting. The sum simplifies to an - a1, because all the intermediate terms cancel out.

So, the beauty is simply the last element minus the first element in the arranged array.

If that's the case, then to maximize the beauty, I should arrange the array so that the largest element is last and the smallest element is first. That way, an - a1 is maximized.

Yes, that makes sense. So, sorting the array in ascending order achieves this: the smallest element is first, and the largest is last. So, beauty = max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the first test case, it's [1, 2, 3], beauty = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, all elements are 69, so max - min = 0, which matches the output.

In the third test case, max = 100, min = 43, so beauty = 57, which matches.

Fourth test case, [3,4,3,3], max=4, min=3, beauty=1.

Fifth test case, [2,1], beauty=2-1=1.

So, yes, beauty = max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the program provided, it seems to be doing something else.

Let's look at the program:

First, it reads the number of test cases, num.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n, the length of the array.

- Read the array as input.

- Convert the input string to a list of integers.

- Call func_1(a, num2). If func_1 returns True, print 0; else, sort the array and calculate the sum of differences.

Define func_1:

- It seems to check if the array is already sorted in ascending order.

Wait, but in the program, if func_1 returns True, it prints 0, else it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the beauty should always be max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

So, why does the program have this condition?

Let's see what func_1 does.

func_1(a, num2):

- Initialize order = 0.

- For each i from 1 to n-1, if a[i-1] >= a[i], increment order.

- If order == 0, return True, else return False.

So, func_1 checks if the array is strictly increasing. If it is, it returns True; else, False.

In the program, if func_1 returns True, it prints 0; else, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.

But according to my earlier reasoning, beauty should always be max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

So, why does the program print 0 when the array is strictly increasing?

Wait, in the first test case, [2,1,3], which is not strictly increasing, so it sorts it and gets beauty=2.

In the second test case, [69,69,69], which is strictly increasing (or non-decreasing), so it prints 0.

Wait, but according to the problem, beauty should be max(a) - min(a), which is 0 in this case, which matches the output.

In the third test case, [100,54,80,43,90], not strictly increasing, so it sorts and gets beauty=57.

Fourth test case, [3,4,3,3], not strictly increasing, sort and get beauty=1.

Fifth test case, [2,1], not strictly increasing, sort and get beauty=1.

So, it seems that when the array is strictly increasing (which in this context seems to mean non-decreasing), it prints 0; else, it calculates the beauty by sorting.

But according to the problem, beauty should always be max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

So, why does the program print 0 when the array is strictly increasing?

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the func_1.

Looking back, func_1 checks if the array is strictly increasing (i.e., each element is greater than the previous one). If it is, it returns True, and the program prints 0.

But according to the problem, beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n, which simplifies to a_n - a_1.

So, in the case where the array is already strictly increasing, a_n - a_1 is still the beauty, which may or may not be zero.

But in the program, it prints 0 if the array is strictly increasing.

Wait, in the second test case, [69,69,69], which is strictly increasing (actually non-decreasing), beauty is 0, which is correct.

In other cases, where the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array to maximize beauty, which is max(a) - min(a).

So, perhaps the program is trying to optimize by checking if the array is already sorted in ascending order, and if it is, the beauty is a_n - a_1, which in this case happens to be zero.

But in general, even if the array is not strictly increasing, the beauty should still be max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the program, when the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences, which is also max(a) - min(a).

So, perhaps the program is correctly implementing the idea that beauty is max(a) - min(a), but with an unnecessary step.

Because regardless of whether the array is strictly increasing or not, the beauty is always max(a) - min(a).

In the program, when the array is strictly increasing, it prints 0, which is only correct if max(a) - min(a) equals zero, as in the second test case.

But in general, max(a) - min(a) could be greater than zero even if the array is strictly increasing.

Wait, no. If the array is strictly increasing, max(a) - min(a) is greater than zero, unless all elements are equal.

So, the program seems to have a mistake in this condition.

For example, consider an array [1,2,3], which is strictly increasing, max(a) - min(a) = 2, which is not zero.

But according to the program, it would print 0 because the array is strictly increasing.

Wait, but in the first test case, [2,1,3], which is not strictly increasing, so it sorts it and gets beauty=2.

If I had [1,2,3], which is strictly increasing, according to the program, it would call func_1, which would return True (since order=0), and print 0.

But according to the problem, beauty should be 3 - 1 = 2, not 0.

So, the program seems to have a mistake here.

Wait, but in the second test case, [69,69,69], which is strictly increasing (non-decreasing), max(a) - min(a) = 0, which matches the output.

So, the program seems to be incorrectly assuming that if the array is strictly increasing, beauty is zero, which is only true if all elements are equal.

Wait, no, strictly increasing means a_i > a_{i-1}, so max(a) - min(a) > 0, unless all elements are equal.

Wait, but "strictly increasing" means each a_i > a_{i-1}, so max(a) - min(a) > 0.

But in the program, func_1 checks if a_i >= a_{i-1}, which is non-decreasing.

Wait, in func_1, it checks if a_i - a_{i-1} >= 0, meaning non-decreasing.

If the array is non-decreasing, it prints 0; else, it sorts the array and calculates beauty.

But according to the problem, beauty should be max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

So, the program is incorrect in this condition.

Let me check with the first test case: [2,1,3]. func_1 would return False because 2 >= 1 is not true. So, it sorts the array to [1,2,3], and beauty = 2, which is correct.

Second test case: [69,69,69]. func_1 returns True because all elements are equal, so order=0, print 0, which is correct.

Third test case: [100,54,80,43,90]. func_1 returns False because it's not non-decreasing, so sort to [43,54,80,90,100], beauty=57.

Fourth test case: [3,4,3,3]. func_1 returns False because 3 >= 4 is not true, so sort to [3,3,3,4], beauty=1.

Fifth test case: [2,1]. func_1 returns False because 2 >= 1 is not true, so sort to [1,2], beauty=1.

So, in all sample inputs, the program gives the correct output.

But according to my earlier reasoning, beauty should always be max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

So, why does the program have this condition?

Wait, perhaps the condition is to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if it is, then beauty = a_n - a_1, which could be zero or positive.

But in the program, if func_1 returns True, it prints 0, which is only correct if a_n - a_1 == 0, i.e., all elements are equal.

Otherwise, it should calculate max(a) - min(a).

So, perhaps the program is trying to optimize by checking if the array is already sorted, and if it is, check if a_n - a_1 == 0, and print 0 in that case.

But in general, it should calculate max(a) - min(a).

Alternatively, since the sum simplifies to a_n - a_1 if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, no. If the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, beauty = a_n - a_1.

If it's not, then by sorting it in ascending order, beauty = max(a) - min(a).

So, in reality, regardless of the initial arrangement, beauty is always max(a) - min(a).

So, the program doesn't need to check if the array is sorted or not; it can directly calculate max(a) - min(a).

But in the program, it's checking if the array is non-decreasing (func_1 returns True if it is), and if so, prints 0, else sorts and calculates the sum of differences.

This is incorrect because if the array is non-decreasing and a_n - a_1 > 0, it should not print 0.

Wait, but in the second test case, where all elements are equal, which is non-decreasing, and a_n - a_1 = 0, so print 0.

In other cases where the array is non-decreasing but a_n - a_1 > 0, it should print a_n - a_1, not 0.

So, the program is incorrect in this aspect.

However, in the sample inputs, the only case where the array is non-decreasing is when all elements are equal, so it's printing 0 correctly.

In other cases, since func_1 returns False, it sorts the array and calculates beauty correctly.

But in a general case, if the array is non-decreasing with a_n - a_1 > 0, the program would print 0, which is incorrect.

For example, consider n=3, a=[1,2,3]. According to the program, func_1 returns True (since it's non-decreasing), so it prints 0, but according to the problem, beauty should be 2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But in the given sample inputs, such a case might not be present, so it produces correct outputs for the sample.

To sum up, the program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the array is non-decreasing and prints 0, which is only correct if all elements are equal.

Otherwise, it should always calculate max(a) - min(a), regardless of the initial arrangement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
