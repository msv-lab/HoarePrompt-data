Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. There's also an integer k, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific conditions:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the given array.

2. r is a subset of the last n elements of the given array.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Additionally, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and I can output any one of them if there are multiple solutions.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging them. So, order doesn't matter here, which is good because XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order in which we XOR the elements doesn't affect the result.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from the first n elements for l and 2k elements from the last n elements for r, such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR of a set of numbers is essentially the sum modulo 2 in each bit position. An important property is that the XOR of two identical numbers is zero, and XOR is its own inverse.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, I need to consider how these duplicates are distributed between the first n and the last n elements.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in the first n elements and the XOR of all elements in the last n elements. Since the entire array contains each number from 1 to n twice, the XOR of the entire array is zero (because each number XORed with itself is zero, and zero XORed with any number is the number itself, but since pairs are present, it's zero).

Therefore, the XOR of the first n elements is equal to the XOR of the last n elements, because the XOR of the entire array is zero.

Wait, actually, no. The XOR of the entire array is zero, so XOR of first n elements XORed with XOR of last n elements is zero, which implies that XOR of first n elements is equal to XOR of last n elements.

So, XOR(lft) = XOR(rgt).

Now, I need to find subsets l and r from lft and rgt respectively, each of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that XOR(lft) = XOR(rgt), and l is a subset of lft and r is a subset of rgt, both of size 2k, I need to find such subsets.

Wait, but this doesn't directly help me find l and r. I need a way to select these subsets.

Let me think differently. Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, some numbers will be in lft and some in rgt.

I need to group the numbers based on their positions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairs. For each number from 1 to n, there are two copies: one in lft and one in rgt, but it's not necessarily that both copies are in lft or both in rgt. They could be split between lft and rgt.

Wait, actually, lft is the first n elements, and rgt is the last n elements.

Given that, for each number from 1 to n, one copy is in lft and one is in rgt, because each number appears exactly twice in the entire array of 2n elements.

Wait, no. It's possible that both copies of a number are in lft or both are in rgt, as long as the total number of copies is two within the entire array.

Wait, actually, no. Since lft contains the first n elements and rgt contains the last n elements, a number can appear once in lft and once in rgt, or both in lft, or both in rgt.

Wait, but the problem states that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the array, but doesn't specify how they are distributed between lft and rgt.

So, a number can be present:

- Once in lft and once in rgt

- Both copies in lft

- Both copies in rgt

I need to consider all these possibilities.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k elements from rgt such that their XORs are equal.

The problem also mentions that at least one such pair always exists, so I don't need to worry about cases where it doesn't.

Now, thinking about how to approach this.

One idea is to select k pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of two identical numbers, one from lft and one from rgt.

Wait, but the problem allows subsets in any order, not necessarily pairs.

Wait, but since XOR is commutative and associative, the order doesn't matter.

If I can find k pairs of identical numbers, one from lft and one from rgt, I can include both in l and r.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements from lft and 2k from rgt.

Wait, but if I select two identical numbers, one from lft and one from rgt, and place both in l and both in r, that would be four elements, but I need only 2k in each.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me consider the XOR properties more carefully.

Given that XOR(l) = XOR(r), and I need to select subsets l from lft and r from rgt.

Alternatively, since XOR(lft) = XOR(rgt), maybe I can relate XOR(l) and XOR(r) to XOR of the remaining elements in lft and rgt.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting subsets such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = XOR(some other elements).

But since XOR(l) = XOR(r), that would mean XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, which is true if l and r have the same XOR.

Hmm.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I select some elements for l and some for r such that the combined XOR of selected elements from lft and rgt is equal.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the example to get some intuition.

In the first example:

n = 2, k = 1

a = [1,2,2,1]

So, lft = [1,2], rgt = [2,1]

One possible solution is l = [2,1], r = [2,1]

XOR of l is 2 XOR 1 = 3, XOR of r is 2 XOR 1 = 3, which matches.

Another possible solution could be l = [1,2], r = [1,2], which would also have XOR 3.

So, in this case, selecting the same elements in the same order works.

In the second example:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

lft = [6,4,2,1,2,3], rgt = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Solution: l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

XOR of l: 6 XOR 4 = 2, XOR of r: 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

So, in this case, they selected specific elements to match the XOR.

Looking at the solution approach, perhaps they are selecting pairs where the XOR matches.

But I need a general method.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how to balance the subsets.

An idea comes to mind: since XOR is involved, perhaps considering linear algebra over GF(2) could help, but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Given the constraints, n can be up to 5e4, and T up to 5000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5e4, it needs to be efficient.

I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking back at the code provided, let's try to understand what it's doing.

The function func reads T, the number of test cases, and then loops through each test case.

For each test case, it reads n and k, then reads the list of 2n integers.

It splits the list into lft (first n elements) and rgt (last n elements).

Then, it initializes some lists: ldb, rdb, sng.

It sorts lft and rgt.

Then, it iterates through lft to find duplicates and single occurrences.

Wait, no, it's finding elements that appear twice in lft and elements that appear only once.

Similarly, for rgt, it finds elements that appear twice.

Then, it tries to build l and r by selecting pairs of identical elements from lft and rgt.

Wait, looking at the code:

For ldb, it appends elements that appear twice in lft.

For rdb, it appends elements that appear twice in rgt.

For sng, it appends elements that appear only once in lft.

Then, it tries to build l and r by selecting from these lists.

In the output, for l, it prints 2k elements from ldb and sng, and for r, it prints 2k elements from rdb and sng.

Wait, but sng seems to be elements that appear only once in lft.

But in rgt, it's possible that these elements appear once or twice.

This seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand the logic.

It seems the code is trying to select pairs of identical elements from lft and rgt to ensure that their XOR cancels out.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at the first test case.

n=2, k=1

lft=[1,2], rgt=[2,1]

After sorting: lft=[1,2], rgt=[1,2]

ldb would be [2] (since 2 appears twice in lft?), wait no, in the code, it's checking if lft[i] == lft[i-1], and if so, append to ldb.

But in this case, lft is [1,2], so no duplicates, so ldb is empty.

Wait, but in the first test case, the code would output something different from the sample output.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(1, n):

if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:

ldb.append(lft[i])

Similarly for rgt.

So, in the first test case, lft = [1,2], after sorting, [1,2], no duplicates, so ldb is empty.

Then, sng would be elements that appear only once in lft, which are 1 and 2.

Then, for outputting l, it would select from sng until sz >= k.

Since k=1, it would print one element from sng, say 1, then 2.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's printing two elements for l and r.

Wait, 2k elements, k=1, so 2 elements.

But in the sample output, it's printing [2,1] and [2,1].

But according to the code, it might print [1,2] and [1,2], which is still correct.

So, perhaps it's acceptable.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct in general.

Let me consider another test case.

Take the second test case:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

lft = [6,4,2,1,2,3], rgt = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

After sorting:

lft = [1,2,2,3,4,6]

rgt = [1,3,4,5,5,6]

Then, ldb would be [2] (since 2 appears twice in lft)

rdb would be [5] (since 5 appears twice in rgt)

sng would be [1,3,4,6] in lft (elements that appear once)

Then, for l, it would first select 2k=2 elements.

It has ldb=[2], so it can select 2 and 2, but only one 2 is available in ldb.

Wait, no, in the code, it checks if k - sz >=2, and if so, prints elem, elem.

But k=1, sz=0, k - sz =1 <2, so it doesn't print two 2's.

Then, it moves to sng, and selects one element, say 1, and then another, say 3, to make 2 elements.

So, l would be [1,3]

Similarly, for r, it selects from rdb and sng.

rdb=[5], so it can select 5 and 5, but again, only one 5 is available.

But k=1, sz=0, k - sz=1 <2, so it selects one element from sng.

sng is [1,3,4,6] from lft, but in rgt, these elements are present.

Wait, but in rgt, 1,3,4,6 are present, but with possible duplicates.

So, it selects one element from sng, say 1, and another, say 3.

So, r would be [1,3]

Then, XOR of l is 1 XOR 3 = 2, XOR of r is 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

In the sample output, it's [6,4] and [1,3], which also matches (6 XOR 4 = 2, 1 XOR 3 = 2).

So, both are valid solutions.

Therefore, the code's approach seems to work.

But I need to verify if it's correct in general.

Let me think about the general case.

The code tries to select pairs of identical elements from lft and rgt, and uses them in l and r.

If there are enough such pairs, it can select k pairs to include in l and r.

If not, it fills the remaining elements from the single occurrences.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, the order doesn't matter, and selecting pairs that are identical ensures that their XOR contributes zero, which can be balanced with other selections.

Given that, it seems like the approach can work.

Moreover, since it's guaranteed that at least one solution exists, this approach seems to find a valid solution.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
