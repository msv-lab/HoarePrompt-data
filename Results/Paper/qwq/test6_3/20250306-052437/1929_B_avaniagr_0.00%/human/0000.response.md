Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2.

The problem asks to ensure that at least k of these diagonals have at least one colored cell, and we need to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to minimize the number of colored cells is to maximize the number of diagonals that each colored cell covers. Since each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, each cell can cover at most two diagonals.

So, ideally, each colored cell should cover two diagonals that don't have any other colored cells yet.

Let's consider some small values of n and k to get a better understanding.

Take n = 2:

- Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

- If k = 1, we just need to color one cell, which will cover two diagonals.

- If k = 2, we might need to color two cells, covering four diagonals.

- If k = 3, we might need to color three cells, covering six diagonals.

Wait, but for n=2, the total number of diagonals is 6, and the grid has only 4 cells. So, if k=3, we need to cover at least 3 diagonals. Let's see:

- Coloring one cell covers 2 diagonals.

- Coloring a second cell can cover 2 more diagonals.

- The third cell would cover 2 more, but some might already be covered.

But in this case, with only 4 cells, to cover all 6 diagonals, we need to color all 4 cells.

Wait, but the problem allows k up to 4n - 2, which for n=2 is 6.

But in the sample input, there's a case with n=2 and k=3, and the output is 2.

Wait, n=2, k=3, output is 2.

Wait, but with n=2, total diagonals are 6.

If k=3, we need at least 3 diagonals to have at least one colored cell.

So, by coloring 2 cells, we can cover 4 diagonals, which is more than 3.

Hence, 2 cells are sufficient.

Similarly, for n=3, k=4, output is 2.

For n=3, total diagonals are 10.

Coloring 2 cells can cover up to 4 diagonals.

Hence, it's sufficient for k=4.

Wait, but in another sample input, n=3, k=10, output is 6.

Which makes sense because to cover all 10 diagonals, we need to color enough cells to cover all of them.

So, there must be a pattern here.

Let me try to generalize.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Each cell covers exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell covers two diagonals: one main and one anti.

But some diagonals share cells.

I need to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

So, ideally, each colored cell should cover two new diagonals that haven't been covered yet.

But as we color more cells, it becomes harder to find cells that cover entirely new diagonals.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by c colored cells.

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

So, c cells can cover up to 2c diagonals.

But there might be overlaps, where multiple cells cover the same diagonal.

So, to cover k diagonals, we need at least ceil(k / 2) cells, because each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

But this is just a lower bound.

In practice, we might need more cells because of the overlaps.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, for n=3, k=4, output is 2.

According to the lower bound, ceil(4/2) = 2, which matches.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6.

Ceil(10/2) = 5, but the output is 6.

So, the lower bound isn't always tight.

There must be some constraints based on the grid structure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to cover all diagonals, i.e., k = 4n - 2.

Then, how many cells do I need to color?

Well, in this case, I need to cover all main and anti-diagonals.

To cover all main diagonals, I need to color at least one cell in each main diagonal.

Similarly for anti-diagonals.

But since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal, there might be overlaps.

Actually, this seems like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but for such a large n (up to 1e8), we need an efficient solution, probably something O(1).

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- n=3, k=4 → output=2

- n=3, k=3 → output=2

- n=3, k=10 → output=6

- n=3, k=9 → output=5

- n=4, k=7 → output=4

- n=7, k=11 → output=6

- n=2, k=3 → output=2

I need to find a pattern or formula that can produce these outputs based on n and k.

Looking at n=3:

- For k=4, output=2

- For k=3, output=2

- For k=10, output=6

- For k=9, output=5

Wait, for k=3, output=2, which is the same as for k=4.

Similarly, for k=9, output=5, which is less than for k=10 (which is 6).

This suggests that there are different regimes based on the value of k relative to n.

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

For c cells, the maximum number of diagonals covered is 2c, but only if the cells are chosen such that no two cells cover the same diagonal.

But in reality, there might be overlaps, so the actual number of diagonals covered could be less than 2c.

But in the best case, it's 2c.

So, to cover k diagonals, we need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, output=6.

Ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but output is 6.

So, there must be some constraints based on the grid structure.

Wait, perhaps for larger k, we need to consider the total number of diagonals and the structure of the grid.

Let me consider the total number of main and anti-diagonals.

For a grid of size n, there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, totaling 4n - 2 diagonals.

Now, if k is small, say k <= 2n - 1, maybe we can cover k diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=4, output=2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3, k=3, output=2, which is also ceil(3/2)=2.

For n=3, k=9, output=5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3, k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps there is a different formula when k is larger.

Wait, for n=3, k=9, output=5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps when k > some threshold, we need to adjust the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the minimum number of cells that cover at least k diagonals, considering the grid's structure.

Another approach is to consider the problem as a hitting set problem, where we have a set of diagonals and we want to hit at least k of them by selecting a subset of cells, each of which hits two diagonals.

The hitting set problem is NP-hard, but for this problem, we need an efficient solution.

Perhaps there is a mathematical formula based on n and k.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- n=3, k=4 → 2

- n=3, k=3 → 2

- n=3, k=10 → 6

- n=3, k=9 → 5

- n=4, k=7 → 4

- n=7, k=11 → 6

- n=2, k=3 → 2

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

For n=3:

- For k=3 and k=4, output=2

- For k=9, output=5

- For k=10, output=6

For n=4, k=7, output=4

For n=7, k=11, output=6

For n=2, k=3, output=2

Wait, for n=2, total diagonals are 6.

Output for k=3 is 2.

Ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=10, which is 4*3 - 2 = 10, so k=10 is the maximum.

Output is 6, which is n=3, so maybe n cells are needed when k is large.

Wait, but for n=3, k=10, output=6, which is 2n.

Wait, 2n for n=3 is 6, which matches.

Similarly, for n=4, k=7, output=4, which is n.

For n=7, k=11, output=6, which is ceil(11/2)=6.

Wait, but for n=3, k=10, output=6, which is 2n.

Wait, but for n=3, k=9, output=5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For k=10, it's 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps there's a correction when k is exactly 4n-2.

Looking back at the sample input, for n=3, k=10, output=6.

But ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an additional condition.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

So, it's printing:

(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)

Let's decode this.

First, (k // 2 + k % 2) is essentially ceil(k / 2).

Then, multiplied by (k < 4 * n - 3), which is 1 if k < 4n - 3, else 0.

Then, 2 * n multiplied by (k >= 4 * n - 3), which is 1 if k >= 4n - 3, else 0.

Plus (k == 4 * n - 2), which is 1 if k == 4n - 2, else 0.

So, the formula is:

ceil(k / 2) if k < 4n - 3

else 2n + (k == 4n - 2)

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, which is k == 4*3 - 2 = 10, so output should be 2*3 + 1 = 7, but in the sample, it's 6.

Wait, but in the sample, for n=3, k=10, output is 6, but according to this formula, it would be 2*3 + 1 = 7, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the formula.

Let's plug in n=3, k=10:

ceil(10 / 2) = 5

k < 4*3 - 3 = 9, which 10 is not less than, so 0

k >= 4*3 - 3 = 9, which 10 is >=9, so 1

k == 4*3 - 2 = 10, so 1

So, 5 * 0 + 2*3 *1 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, but sample output is 6.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the program.

Wait, maybe I misread the formula.

Looking back:

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

For n=3, k=10:

(k < 4n - 3) = 10 < 9, which is False, so 0

(k >= 4n - 3) = 10 >=9, which is True, so 1

(k == 4n - 2) = 10 ==10, which is True, so 1

So, 0 + 2*3*1 +1 = 6 +1 =7, but sample output is 6.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for k up to 4n - 4, the minimal number of cells is ceil(k / 2), and for k >= 4n - 3, it's 2n -1.

Wait, for n=3, 4n - 3 =9, so for k <9, it's ceil(k /2), for k >=9, it's 2*3 -1=5.

But in the sample, for k=9, output=5, which matches 2n -1=5.

For k=10, which is >=4n -3=9, it should be 2n -1=5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, discrepancy again.

Wait, maybe for k ==4n -2, it's 2n.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, output is 6, which is 2n.

So, perhaps for k >=4n -2, it's 2n.

Wait, but for k=9, which is less than 4n -2=10, output is 5=2n -1.

For k=10, output=6=2n.

So, perhaps:

- If k <=4n -4, then ceil(k /2)

- If k ==4n -3, then 2n -1

- If k ==4n -2, then 2n

But in the program, it's:

(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)

Which for k <4n -3, it's ceil(k /2)

For k >=4n -3, it's 2n + (k ==4n -2)

But in the sample, for k=9, which is k >=4n -3, it's 2n -1=5, but according to the formula, it's 2n + (k ==4n -2)=6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Looking back, maybe for k >=4n -3, it's 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2)

So, for k=9, it's 2n -1 +0=5

For k=10, it's 2n -1 +1=6

Which matches the sample output.

So, the correct formula seems to be:

- If k <4n -3, then ceil(k /2)

- Else, 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2)

So, the program seems to have a mistake.

In the program, it's 2n * (k >=4n -3), but according to this, it should be (2n -1) + (k ==4n -2)

Wait, but 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2) is equal to 2n -1 +1 =2n when k==4n -2.

Which matches the sample output for n=3, k=10: 6=2*3.

For k=9, it's 2n -1 +0=5, which matches.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the program, it's 2n * (k >=4n -3), which for k >=4n -3 is 2n.

But according to the corrected formula, it should be 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2)

So, for k >=4n -3:

- If k ==4n -2, then 2n

- Else, 2n -1

But in the program, it's 2n * (k >=4n -3) + (k ==4n -2)

Wait, for k >=4n -3, it's 2n + (k ==4n -2)

But according to the corrected formula, it should be 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2)

So, the program is adding 2n instead of 2n -1.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, which is k ==4n -2=10, output is 6, which is 2n=6.

According to the corrected formula, it's 2n -1 +1=6.

But 2n -1 +1 is 2n, which matches.

For k=9, which is k >=4n -3, but k !=4n -2, output should be 2n -1=5, which matches the sample.

But according to the program:

For k >=4n -3, it's 2n * (k >=4n -3) + (k ==4n -2)

Which for k=10, n=3:

2*3=6 +1=7, but sample output is 6.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back:

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))

So, it's:

ceil(k /2) * (k <4n -3) + 2n * (k >=4n -3) + (k ==4n -2)

For k <4n -3, it's ceil(k /2)

For k >=4n -3, it's 2n + (k ==4n -2)

But according to the corrected formula, it should be (2n -1) + (k ==4n -2)

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, which is k >=4n -3 and k ==4n -2, output is 6, which is 2n.

According to the program, it's 2n +1=7, but sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, for n=3, k=10:

2n=6 + (k ==4n -2)=1, so total 7, but sample output is 6.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect because for k >=4n -3, it should be 2n -1 + (k ==4n -2), but the program has 2n + (k ==4n -2).

Hence, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
