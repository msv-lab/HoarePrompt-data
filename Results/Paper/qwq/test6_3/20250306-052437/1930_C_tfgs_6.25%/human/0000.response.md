Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation he selects an index `i` from the current array `a`, inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from the array. After `n` operations, the array `a` is empty, and `S` contains unique elements that are the sums of array elements and their indices.

The task is to construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order and to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that among all possible sorted arrays `b`, I need to choose the one that is the largest when compared element by element from the start.

Given that `S` is a set, it only contains unique elements. So, if `a[i] + i` is already in `S`, inserting it again won't change `S`.

My goal is to maximize the sorted array `b` in decreasing order. To maximize it lexicographically, I need to maximize the first elements as much as possible, then the second elements, and so on.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to select indices in such a way that the set `S` contains the largest possible unique values.

One way to think about this is to prioritize selecting indices that give the largest possible `a[i] + i` values first, but I have to be careful because deleting an element affects the indices of the elements to the right.

Wait, when I delete an element at index `i`, all elements to the right shift left, so their indices decrease by 1.

This seems complicated to handle directly. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider that each element `a[i]` can be paired with an index `j`, where `j` is its position when selected, and the value added to `S` is `a[i] + j`.

But because of the deletion, determining the exact `j` for each `a[i]` is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider all possible `a[i] + i` values and figure out which ones to include in `S` to maximize the sorted array `b`.

Wait, but I have to perform exactly `n` operations, selecting one index each time, and deletions affect future indices.

This seems messy.

Let me try to find a different perspective.

Suppose I consider the final set `S` and try to maximize the sorted array `b`.

Since `b` is `S` sorted in decreasing order, to maximize `b` lexicographically, I need to have as many large elements as possible in `S`.

But `S` is a set, so it can't have duplicates.

Given that, perhaps I can consider all possible `a[i] + i` values, remove duplicates, and sort them in decreasing order.

But wait, the problem allows me to choose which elements to select and in what order, but with the constraint that I must perform `n` operations, each time selecting an index, inserting `a[i] + i` into `S`, and deleting `a[i]` from `a`, which shifts the indices of the remaining elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a small example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first sample input:

2

2 1

So, n=2, a=[2,1]

Operation 1:

Select i=1 (0-based index), value = a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, insert 3 into S, delete a[1], so a becomes [1]

Operation 2:

Select i=1 (now only one element left), value = a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, insert 2 into S, delete a[1], a is empty

So, S={3,2}, b=[3,2]

Alternative:

Operation 1:

Select i=0, value = a[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, insert 3 into S, delete a[0], a becomes [1]

Operation 2:

Select i=0, value = a[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, insert 2 into S, delete a[0], a is empty

Again, S={3,2}, b=[3,2]

Another alternative:

Operation 1:

Select i=0, value = a[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, insert 3 into S, delete a[0], a becomes [1]

Operation 2:

Select i=0, value = a[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, insert 2 into S, delete a[0], a is empty

Still S={3,2}, b=[3,2]

Wait, but the note says that if you select i=2 in the first operation and i=1 in the second, S={3}. But in this case, n=2, so selecting i=2 is out of bounds. Maybe it's referring to a different test case.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, a=[2,1], and selecting i=1 first and then i=1 again (after deletion) gives S={3,2}, and selecting i=2 first is not possible since indices are from 1 to |a|, and |a| is 2 initially.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the note. Let's look at the second sample input.

5

1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000

So, n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

If I always select the last element:

Operation 1: i=5, value = a[5] + 5 = 1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005, insert into S, delete a[5], a becomes [1,100,1000,1000000]

Operation 2: i=4, value = a[4] + 4 = 1000000 + 4 = 1000004, insert into S, delete a[4], a becomes [1,100,1000]

Operation 3: i=3, value = a[3] + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003, insert into S, delete a[3], a becomes [1,100]

Operation 4: i=2, value = a[2] + 2 = 100 + 2 = 102, insert into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Operation 5: i=1, value = a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, insert into S, delete a[1], a is empty

So, S={1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2}, b=[1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

Is this the lexicographically largest `b` possible? It seems so, as selecting different indices might lead to smaller values.

Another test case:

3

6 4 8

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

Possible operations:

Option 1:

Select i=1, value = 6 + 1 = 7, S={7}, a=[4,8]

Select i=2, value = 8 + 2 = 10, S={7,10}, a=[4]

Select i=1, value = 4 + 1 = 5, S={5,7,10}, b=[10,7,5]

Option 2:

Select i=3, value = 8 + 3 = 11, S={11}, a=[6,4]

Select i=2, value = 4 + 2 = 6, S={6,11}, a=[6]

Select i=1, value = 6 + 1 = 7, S={6,7,11}, b=[11,7,6]

Option 3:

Select i=2, value = 4 + 2 = 6, S={6}, a=[6,8]

Select i=1, value = 6 + 1 = 7, S={6,7}, a=[8]

Select i=1, value = 8 + 1 = 9, S={6,7,9}, b=[9,7,6]

Comparing the three options:

- [10,7,5]

- [11,7,6]

- [9,7,6]

The lexicographically largest is [11,7,6].

So, selecting the highest possible `a[i] + i` first seems beneficial.

But how to generalize this?

I need a strategy to maximize the elements in `S`.

Given that `S` is a set and must contain unique elements, I need to select indices in such a way that the largest possible unique values of `a[i] + i` are included in `S`.

But I also have to consider that selecting a particular index affects the indices of the remaining elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the sum `a[i] + i` is what I care about, and I need to select `n` such sums, each from a different step, with the indices shifting after each deletion.

Is there a way to model this without worrying about the shifting indices?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all possible `a[i] + p`, where `p` is the position at which the element is selected.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that each element `a[i]` can be paired with a position `p` from 1 to n, and the sum is `a[i] + p`.

But I need to assign unique positions `p` to each element, ensuring that each position is used only once.

Wait, maybe this is similar to assigning positions to elements and computing `a[i] + p`, but ensuring that each position is used exactly once.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the array in a certain way to maximize the sums.

Wait, but I need to maximize the set `S` of unique sums, sorted in decreasing order.

I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

Let me consider that the largest possible sum is the maximum of `a[i] + i`, which would be `a[n] + n` if the array is sorted in increasing order.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sums.

So, perhaps sorting the array in decreasing order and assigning the largest possible positions to them.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have all possible `a[i] + p`, where `p` is from 1 to n, and I need to select n unique sums such that they are maximized.

Wait, but I have to consider that each `p` can be used only once.

This seems like selecting n elements from the array, each with a unique position, and maximizing the sum `a[i] + p`.

But I need to maximize the set of these sums, sorted in decreasing order.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider the frequency of each possible sum.

If multiple elements can lead to the same sum, but since `S` is a set, only unique sums are kept.

So, I need to select n sums that are unique and as large as possible.

Wait, but I have to perform operations in sequence, selecting an index each time, and the indices shift after each deletion.

This seems too dynamic to handle directly.

Maybe I can consider that the sum `a[i] + p`, where `p` is the position at which it's selected, and ensure that all sums are unique.

But ensuring uniqueness while maximizing the sums is tricky.

Let me consider a greedy approach: always select the element that gives the current maximum sum that hasn't been selected yet.

But I need to keep track of which sums have been selected already.

Wait, but sets automatically handle uniqueness, so perhaps I can focus on selecting the largest possible unique sums.

But I need to make sure that the sums are unique and that I select n of them, considering the shifting indices.

This seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

In `func_1()`:

- Read `n`

- Read the array `a` of length `n`

- For each element in `a`, compute `a[i] + i + 1` (since indices seem to be 1-based in the problem)

- Create a counter of these sums

- Create a set of these sums, sort them in reverse order

- Initialize a counter `cnt` as `n - len(a)`, but `len(a)` is `n`, so `cnt = 0`?

Wait, no, after the loop, `a` is list(set(a)), so it's unique sums sorted in reverse.

Wait, no, originally `a` is the list of `a[i] + i + 1`, then counter is Counter(a), then `a` is set(a), sorted in reverse.

Then `cnt = n - len(a)`, which is the number of duplicates.

Then initialize `ans` as an empty list.

Then loop through the sorted unique sums:

- If `i > 0`, compute `adv = min(a[i-1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i-1]])`

- For `j` in `range(adv)`, append `a[i-1] - j - 1` to `ans`

- Subtract `adv` from `cnt`

- Subtract `adv` from `counter[a[i-1]]`

- Append `a[i]` to `ans`

- Subtract 1 from `counter[a[i]]`

Then, for `_` in range(`cnt`), append `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`

Finally, print the array `ans`

Wait, this seems to be trying to fill in the gaps between the unique sums with as many unique numbers as possible, considering the duplicates.

I need to verify if this approach correctly maximizes the lexicographical order of `b`.

Looking back at the examples:

First test case:

n=2, a=[2,1]

Compute a[i] + i + 1:

- a[0] + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

- a[1] + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

So, sums are [4,4], counter={4:2}

Set a={4}, sorted in reverse [4]

cnt = 2 - 1 = 1

Loop through a:

i=0, since i>0 is False, append a[0]=4 to ans

counter[4] -=1 => counter[4]=1

Then, for _ in range(1), append ans[-1]-1=3 to ans

So, ans=[4,3], which matches the first sample output.

Second test case:

n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

Compute a[i] + i +1:

- 1 +1 +1 = 3

- 100 +2 +1 = 103

- 1000 +3 +1 = 1004

- 1000000 +4 +1 = 1000005

- 1000000000 +5 +1 = 1000000006

counter={3:1,103:1,1004:1,1000005:1,1000000006:1}

a=[1000000006,1000005,1004,103,3]

cnt=5-5=0

Loop through a:

i=0, since i>0 is True:

a[i-1]=1000000006, a[i]=1000005

1000000006 - 1000005 -1 = 9999999990, but seems miscalculated.

Wait, 1000000006 - 1000005 = 999990, minus 1 is 999989

But cnt=0, so adv=min(999989,0,1)=0

Then append a[i]=1000005

Then counter[1000005]-=1

Next i=1, a[i-1]=1000005, a[i]=1004

1000005 - 1004 -1=999990, min(999990,0,1)=0

Append 1004

counter[1004]-=1

Similarly for others, cnt=0, so no additional elements.

Finally, ans=[1000000006,1000005,1004,103,3], which matches the second sample output.

Third test case:

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

Compute a[i] + i +1:

- 6+1+1=8

- 4+2+1=7

- 8+3+1=12

counter={8:1,7:1,12:1}

a=[12,8,7]

cnt=3-3=0

Loop through a:

i=0, i>0 False, append 12, counter[12]-=1

i=1, i>0 True, a[0]=12, a[1]=8

12-8-1=3, min(3,0,1)=0

Append 8

counter[8]-=1

i=2, i>0 True, a[1]=8, a[2]=7

8-7-1=0, min(0,0,1)=0

Append 7

counter[7]-=1

Then, for _ in range(0), do nothing

ans=[12,8,7], but the sample output is [11,7,6]

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In the third test case, according to the sample output, it should be [11,7,6], but according to this approach, it's [12,8,7].

So, perhaps the approach is not correct.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3, a=[6,4,8], and the output is [11,7,6]

But according to the program, it's [12,8,7]

So, the program is giving a different output than the sample.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that selecting i=3 first gives 8+3=11, then selecting i=2 gives 4+2=6, then selecting i=1 gives 6+1=7, resulting in S={11,6,7}, b=[11,7,6], which matches the sample output.

But according to the program, it's computing a[i] + i +1, which for i=0 (1-based), a[0]=6, i=0, a[i]+i+1=6+0+1=7

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in 0-based vs 1-based indexing.

In the problem, indices are 1-based, but in the program, it's using 0-based indexing in code.

Wait, in the code, it's a=list(map(int, input().split())), then for i in range(n): a[i] += i +1

So, a[i] += i +1, where i is 0-based, so a[0] becomes a[0] +1, a[1] becomes a[1]+2, etc.

In the third test case, a=[6,4,8]

After adjustment, a=[6+1=7,4+2=6,8+3=11]

Then, counter={7:1,6:1,11:1}

a=set(a)= {11,6,7}, sorted in reverse as [11,7,6]

cnt =3-3=0

Loop through a:

i=0, i>0 False, append 11, counter[11]-=1

i=1, i>0 True, a[i-1]=11, a[i]=7, 11-7-1=3, min(3,0,1)=0, append 7, counter[7]-=1

i=2, i>0 True, a[i-1]=7, a[i]=6, 7-6-1=0, min(0,0,1)=0, append 6, counter[6]-=1

Then, for _ in range(0), do nothing

So, ans=[11,7,6], which matches the sample output.

Wait, so in this case, it matches.

Earlier, I miscalculated the adjustment in the third test case.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Let me check another example.

Suppose n=1, a=[5]

Compute a[0] +1=6

S={6}, b=[6]

Which seems correct.

Another example: n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Compute a[0]+1=2, a[1]+2=4, a[2]+3=6

counter={2:1,4:1,6:1}

a=[6,4,2]

cnt=3
