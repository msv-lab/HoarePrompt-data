Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation, he selects an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from `a`. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain `n` elements, but since it's a set, it might have fewer unique elements if there are duplicates in the sums.

Then, he constructs a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order. My task is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b` that Stack can make by choosing the indices wisely in each operation.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that if I compare two arrays position by position, starting from the first element, the array with the larger element at the first position where they differ is considered larger. So, the largest possible `b` would have the largest possible elements at the earliest positions.

Given that `S` is a set, it can only contain unique elements. So, if I insert the same value multiple times, it only counts once in `S`. My goal is to maximize the values in `S` and arrange them in decreasing order.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since `S` is a set, the order in which I insert elements doesn't matter for the final `b`, except that I need to maximize the elements in `b`. So, I need to maximize the unique sums `a[i] + i` that I insert into `S`.

Wait, but the problem allows me to choose which index to pick at each step, and the array `a` changes after each deletion. So, the choice of `i` affects which elements are left in `a` and their indices, which in turn affects future sums.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's try to simplify it.

First, observe that the sum `a[i] + i` depends on the value of `a[i]` and the index `i`. Since `i` changes depending on which elements are deleted, I need to keep track of the current indices after each deletion.

Maybe instead of thinking step by step, I can think about all possible sums `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position where `a[i]` is located when it's chosen.

Wait, but the position changes after each deletion. This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in the first operation, I can choose any index from 1 to `n`, and `i` is the index in the current `a`. After deleting `a[i]`, the array shifts, and the indices of elements to the right of `i` decrease by 1.

This is getting messy. Maybe there's a better way to look at it.

Let's consider that ultimately, I'm selecting a permutation of the elements of `a`, and for each element, I'm computing `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position at which I choose that element.

Wait, but it's not exactly a permutation, because the positions change dynamically as I delete elements.

Hmm.

Let me try to think differently. Suppose I fix the order in which I select the elements. Then, for each element, I can determine its position when I select it, and compute `a[i] + pos`.

But calculating pos for each element based on the order is complicated.

Is there a smarter way to maximize the set `S`?

Wait a minute, since `S` is a set, duplicates don't matter. So, I should aim to insert as many unique large values as possible into `S`.

But I need to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`, which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.

So, I need to maximize the largest elements in `b`, and then the next largest, and so on.

Given that, I should try to maximize the maximum possible sum `a[i] + i`, then the next maximum, and so on, ensuring that they are unique.

But how do I ensure uniqueness while maximizing the sums?

Let me consider that the sum `a[i] + i` can be seen as `a[i] + (position in the selection order)`. Since the positions are from 1 to n, and the selection order affects the positions of remaining elements.

Wait, perhaps I can consider all possible sums `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is from 1 to n, and find a way to select `n` unique sums that are as large as possible.

But I need to make sure that these sums correspond to a valid sequence of selections.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find a way to sort the possible sums in decreasing order and select the largest unique ones.

Let me try to think about the possible sums.

Each element `a[i]` can be selected at some position `pos` from 1 to n, and the sum would be `a[i] + pos`.

But actually, in the problem, `pos` is the position at which it's selected, which depends on the order of selections.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to look at small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first sample input:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Possible operations:

1. Select i=1 (1-based index), insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, delete a[1], so a becomes [1]

Then select i=1 again, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {2, 3}, so b = [3, 2]

Alternatively, select i=2 first, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [2]

Then select i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, but since 3 is already in S, S remains {3}, b = [3]

So, the first approach gives a larger b lexicographically.

Another way: select i=2 first, insert 3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [2]

Then select i=1, insert 2 + 1 = 3, which is already in S, so S remains {3}, b = [3]

So, only by selecting i=1 first, I get b = [3, 2], which is larger than [3].

So, in this case, selecting the element that gives a larger sum first is better, but I also need to consider the uniqueness.

Wait, but in this case, selecting 2 first gives me 3 and then 2, which are unique.

But selecting 1 first gives me only 3.

Wait, no, selecting i=1 first gives me 3 and then 2, both unique.

Selecting i=2 first gives me only 3, since the second insertion of 3 is ignored.

So, to maximize b, I should select elements in such an order that the sums are as large as possible and unique.

In this case, selecting the element that gives the largest sum first, and then the next largest possible sum that is unique.

So, in general, I should sort the sums `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and pick the largest unique ones.

But I need to make sure that the order of selection is such that the positions are valid.

Wait, but in the first step, I can choose any index, and in the subsequent steps, the indices shift.

This seems too dynamic to handle directly.

Is there a way to precompute all possible sums `a[i] + pos` and select the largest unique ones?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each element can be assigned to any position from 1 to n, but with the constraint that the sums must be unique.

But that seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array `a` in decreasing order and assign the largest `a[i]` to the smallest possible `pos`, to maximize `a[i] + pos`.

But I need to ensure uniqueness.

Wait, maybe I should consider sorting the sums `a[i] + i` directly.

Wait, but `i` changes based on the selection order.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the final `b` is sorted in decreasing order, the largest element in `b` is the maximum sum `a[i] + i` over all possible selections.

To maximize b lexicographically, I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

So, I need to maximize the largest sum, then the next largest, and so on, ensuring they are unique.

Perhaps I can collect all possible unique sums `a[i] + i` and sort them in decreasing order.

But again, the sum `a[i] + i` depends on the order of selection.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the set `S` will contain unique sums, and I need to maximize the sorted list of these unique sums.

So, perhaps the problem reduces to selecting `n` unique sums from the possible `a[i] + i`, sorted in decreasing order.

But I need to make sure that these sums can be achieved through a valid sequence of operations.

This seems still vague.

Let me consider the frequency of each possible sum.

If I have multiple elements that can give the same sum, but since `S` is a set, only one of them will be inserted.

So, for each possible sum, I can have at most one instance in `S`.

Therefore, for each possible sum, I can include it in `S` at most once, regardless of how many elements in `a` can produce that sum.

Wait, but the sum depends on both `a[i]` and `i`, which changes based on the selection order.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have all possible sums `a[i] + i` for each element, considering their initial positions.

But since the positions change after each deletion, this is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each element can be assigned to any position from 1 to n, but with some constraints based on the selection order.

This seems too vague.

Let me look at another sample input to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the third sample input:

n = 3

a = [6, 4, 8]

Possible operations:

Option 1: Select i=1 first, insert 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1], a becomes [4, 8]

Then select i=1, insert 4 + 1 = 5, delete a[1], a becomes [8]

Then select i=1, insert 8 + 1 = 9, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {7, 5, 9}, b = [9, 7, 5]

Option 2: Select i=3 first, insert 8 + 3 = 11, delete a[3], a becomes [6, 4]

Then select i=2, insert 4 + 2 = 6, delete a[2], a becomes [6]

Then select i=1, insert 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {11, 6, 7}, which sorted is [11, 7, 6]

Option 3: Select i=2 first, insert 4 + 2 = 6, delete a[2], a becomes [6, 8]

Then select i=1, insert 6 + 1 = 7, delete a[1], a becomes [8]

Then select i=1, insert 8 + 1 = 9, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {6, 7, 9}, b = [9, 7, 6]

So, in this case, the lexicographically largest b is [11, 7, 6], achieved by selecting i=3 first, then i=2, then i=1.

In this option, the sums are 11, 6, and 7.

Wait, but 6 is less than 7, but since 7 was already in S, it's okay.

Wait, no, S can have unique elements, but in this case, all three sums are unique.

So, to maximize b, I should aim to get the largest possible sums first.

In this case, selecting i=3 first gives me 11, which is the largest possible sum.

Then, selecting i=2 gives me 6, and then i=1 gives me 7.

So, b = [11, 7, 6]

Another option is to select i=1 first, getting 7, then i=1, getting 6, then i=1, getting 9.

S = {7, 6, 9}, which is the same as [11, 7, 6] in the other option.

Wait, no, in the first option, S = {7, 5, 9}, which is [9,7,5], which is less than [11,7,6].

So, selecting i=3 first is better.

So, perhaps the strategy is to select the element that gives the largest possible sum first, then the next largest possible sum, and so on.

But I need to ensure that the sums are unique.

Wait, in the first option, selecting i=1 first gives S = {7,5,9}, which is [9,7,5], while selecting i=3 first gives S = {11,6,7}, which is [11,7,6], which is larger lexicographically.

So, in this case, selecting the element that gives the largest sum first is better.

But in the first sample input, selecting i=1 first gives S = {3,2}, which is [3,2], while selecting i=2 first gives S = {3}, which is [3].

So, again, selecting the largest sum first is better.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to sort the sums `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and select the largest unique ones.

But I need to confirm if this always works.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=3

a = [1, 2, 3]

Possible sums:

Select i=1 first, sum=1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [2,3]

Then select i=1, sum=2+1=3, delete a[1], a becomes [3]

Then select i=1, sum=3+1=4, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {2,3,4}, b = [4,3,2]

Alternatively, select i=3 first, sum=3+3=6, delete a[3], a becomes [1,2]

Then select i=2, sum=2+2=4, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Then select i=1, sum=1+1=2, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {6,4,2}, b = [6,4,2], which is larger than [4,3,2].

So, in this case, selecting the largest sum first is better.

Another option: select i=2 first, sum=2+2=4, delete a[2], a becomes [1,3]

Then select i=2, sum=3+2=5, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Then select i=1, sum=1+1=2, delete a[1], a is empty.

S = {4,5,2}, b = [5,4,2], which is less than [6,4,2].

So, selecting the largest sum first is better.

So, it seems that selecting the element that gives the largest sum first, and then continuing to select the largest possible sum at each step, leads to the lexicographically largest b.

This sounds like a greedy approach: always choose the largest possible sum that hasn't been chosen yet.

But I need to ensure that these sums can be achieved through a valid sequence of operations.

In other words, I need to make sure that I can select the elements in such an order that I can achieve the desired sums.

This seems tricky because the indices change after each deletion.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as assigning each element to a position from 1 to n, where the sum is `a[i] + pos`, and ensuring that all sums are unique.

Then, I need to maximize the sums in decreasing order.

This sounds similar to assigning positions to elements to maximize the sum `a[i] + pos`, with the constraint that all sums are unique.

Given that, perhaps I can sort the elements in decreasing order and assign the smallest possible position that results in a unique sum.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sums, so maybe sort the elements in decreasing order and assign the largest possible position that results in a unique sum.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that I have the elements sorted in decreasing order, and I try to assign positions to them to maximize the sum `a[i] + pos`, with the constraint that all sums are unique.

I need to maximize the sums in decreasing order.

This seems similar to assigning positions to elements to maximize the sum, with the uniqueness constraint on the sums.

This sounds complex.

Let me consider that the set S can contain at most n unique sums, and I need to select n unique sums that are as large as possible, sorted in decreasing order.

Given that, perhaps I can collect all possible sums `a[i] + i` for all i, remove duplicates, and sort them in decreasing order.

But this doesn't account for the fact that the indices change after each deletion.

Wait, maybe it's acceptable to consider all possible sums `a[i] + i` for all i, and then select the largest unique sums, sorted in decreasing order.

But I need to confirm if this always works.

Let me consider the first sample input:

n=2

a=[2,1]

Possible sums:

a[1]+1=3

a[2]+2=3

So, S={3}, b=[3]

But earlier we saw that by selecting i=1 first, then i=1, S={3,2}, b=[3,2], which is better.

So, considering all possible sums `a[i]+i` and selecting the unique largest ones doesn't account for the fact that by choosing different orders, I can get different sets S.

So, perhaps I need to consider that by choosing different orders, I can get different sets S, and I need to choose the order that gives me the largest possible b.

This seems too vague for implementation.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array `a` in decreasing order, and assign positions to elements starting from the smallest position, ensuring that the sums are unique.

But I need to maximize the sums, so maybe assigning the largest possible position to the largest elements.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array `a` in decreasing order, and assign positions from 1 to n to them, ensuring that the sums are unique.

But this still doesn't guarantee the lexicographically largest b.

Let me try to think about the frequency of the sums.

If multiple elements can give the same sum, then only one of them will be inserted into S.

So, for sums that appear multiple times, I can only include one instance in S.

Therefore, I need to consider the frequency of each sum and ensure that I include each sum only once in S.

Given that, perhaps I can collect all possible sums `a[i] + i` for all i, count their frequencies, and then select one instance of each sum, choosing the largest sums first.

But again, this doesn't account for the selection order and the dynamic nature of the indices.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the problem again.

I need to maximize the lexicographical order of b, which is S sorted in decreasing order.

So, I need to maximize the largest element in S, then the second largest, and so on.

To maximize b, I should aim to have the largest possible sums in S, as high up in the sorted order as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can sort all possible sums `a[i] + i` in decreasing order, remove duplicates, and take the first n unique sums.

But in the first sample input, that would give S={3}, but actually, by selecting in a certain order, I can get S={3,2}.

So, perhaps I need to consider that by selecting elements in a certain order, I can get more unique sums.

Therefore, simply taking the largest unique sums might not be sufficient.

Wait, in the first sample input, a=[2,1], n=2.

Possible sums:

- Select i=1 first: a[1]+1=3, then a[1]+1=2 -> S={3,2}

- Select i=2 first: a[2]+2=3, then a[1]+1=3 -> S={3}

So, in this case, selecting i=1 first gives me two unique sums, while selecting i=2 first gives me only one unique sum.

So, selecting i=1 first is better.

Another way to look at it: by selecting the element with the smaller a[i] first, I can get a smaller sum that is unique.

In this case, selecting a[1]=2 first gives me sum=3, then after deleting a[1], a becomes [1], and selecting a[1]=1 gives sum=2, which is unique.

While selecting a[2]=1 first gives sum=3, and then selecting a[1]=2 gives sum=3 again, which is not unique.

So, in this case, selecting the smaller a[i] first allows me to get a smaller unique sum.

But in the third sample input, selecting the largest a[i] first gives the largest possible sum.

So, it's not clear which way to go.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I consider all possible sequences of selections and choose the one that gives the largest b.

But with n up to 3e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the set S can contain at most n unique sums, and I need to maximize these sums in decreasing order.

So, perhaps I can consider the possible sums `a[i] + i` for all i, count their frequencies, and then select the largest sums first, taking only one instance of each sum.

But in the first sample input, sums are 3 and 3, so only one 3.

But by selecting in a certain order, I can get an additional unique sum of 2.

So, perhaps I need to consider that by deleting an element, I can affect future sums.

This seems too involved.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the order in which I select the elements.

Then, for each selection, the sum is `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position at which I select it.

But `pos` is from 1 to n, and I need to maximize the unique sums.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each element is assigned a unique position from 1 to n, and the sum is `a[i] + pos`.

Then, I need to assign positions to elements to maximize the sum `a[i] + pos`, with the constraint that all sums are unique.

This sounds similar to assigning positions to elements such that the sums are unique and maximized.

Given that, perhaps I can sort the elements in decreasing order and assign the smallest possible position that results in a unique sum.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sums, so maybe assign the largest possible position that results in a unique sum.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that I sort the elements in decreasing order and assign positions to them in a way that maximizes the sum `a[i] + pos`, with the constraint that all sums are unique.

This seems similar to assigning positions to elements to maximize the sum, with the uniqueness constraint on the sums.

This sounds like an assignment problem.

But I need an efficient way to assign positions to elements to maximize the sum, with the constraint that all sums are unique.

This seems too involved for this context.

Let me consider that the maximum possible sum is a[i] + n, and the minimum is a[i] + 1.

Given that, perhaps I can try to assign the largest possible sums first, ensuring that they are unique.

So, start with the largest possible sum a[i] + n, choose the largest a[i], assign it the largest possible position that doesn't cause sum duplicates.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each a[i], I can choose a position from 1 to n, and the sum is a[i] + pos.

I need to select n unique sums, maximize them in decreasing order.

This sounds like selecting n unique sums from the possible a[i] + pos, sorted in decreasing order.

But I need to make sure that these sums correspond to a valid assignment of positions to elements.

This seems too complex.

Let me consider that since S is a set, and I need to maximize b, which is S sorted in decreasing order, perhaps I can focus on maximizing the elements of S directly.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that S contains the maximum possible unique sums.

But again, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me look at the provided program to see how it approaches this problem.

Looking at the code:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and the array a.

- It modifies a[i] to a[i] + i + 1, which seems to correspond to a[i] + pos, assuming pos starts from 1.

- Then it creates a Counter of a, which counts the frequency of each sum.

- Then it creates a sorted list of unique sums in reverse order.

- Then it initializes cnt to n - len(a), which is n - number of unique sums.

- Then it iterates through the sorted unique sums in decreasing order, and for each sum, it appends it to ans, and if there are multiple instances in the counter, it tries to add additional sums by decrement
