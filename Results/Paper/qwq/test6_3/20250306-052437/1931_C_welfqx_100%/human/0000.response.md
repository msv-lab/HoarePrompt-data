Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation allows me to select three integers i, j, x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and set all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles. My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I need to spend to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. It lets me change a subarray (from index i to j) to a single value x, and the cost is the length of that subarray. I can do this operation at most once. So, I need to think about how to use this operation to make the entire array equal, possibly without using the operation at all if the array is already equal.

Looking at the examples:

- For the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the output is 4. That means I need to spend 4 burles to make all elements equal. If I choose i=2, j=5, x=1, then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4 (since j-i+1=5-2+1=4). That seems correct.

- For the array [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], the output is 0, which makes sense because all elements are already equal, so no operation is needed.

- For [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], the output is 2. If I set i=4, j=5, x=8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], and the cost is 2 (5-4+1=2).

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to find the largest contiguous subarrays that already have the same value and try to minimize the cost by maximizing the length of these subarrays.

Wait a minute, but I can choose any x, not necessarily an existing value in the array. So, I need to choose x such that the cost is minimized.

Let me think differently. If I choose x to be the most frequent value in the array, then the cost might be minimized because I have to change fewer elements.

But no, that's not necessarily true because I can choose any x, and the cost depends on the length of the subarray I'm changing, not on the value of x.

Actually, the value of x doesn't affect the cost directly; it's just a value to set the subarray to. So, I need to think about how to partition the array into segments where each segment is either already equal or needs to be set to some x with a certain cost.

Wait, perhaps it's about finding runs of consecutive equal elements and calculating the minimal cost to connect them.

Let me consider that the array is divided into groups where each group has the same value. I need to merge these groups with operations, and each operation has a cost equal to the length of the subarray being set to x.

I need to find a way to merge these groups with at most one operation to make the entire array equal.

But since I can only perform one operation, I need to find a way to cover the parts that are not equal to a certain value with one operation.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a value x and see what is the minimal cost to set the entire array to x with at most one operation.

But that seems similar to finding the minimal number of elements to change to make the array equal to x, but with a different cost model.

Wait, no. Since the cost is based on the length of the subarray being set, it's not directly equivalent to changing individual elements.

Let me consider that with one operation, I can set any subarray to a single value x, and the cost is the length of that subarray.

So, to make the entire array equal to some value x, I can choose to set the entire array to x with cost n (the full length), or I can set a subarray to x and rely on the remaining parts already being x.

Wait, but the remaining parts may not be x.

Hmm.

Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I want the entire array to be equal to x. Then, I need to make sure that all elements not equal to x are covered by the operation.

So, the operation can set a subarray to x, and the cost is the length of that subarray.

I need to choose x and the subarray in such a way that after the operation, all elements are equal to x, and the cost is minimized.

Alternatively, I can choose not to perform any operation if the array is already equal.

So, the minimal cost would be zero if the array is already equal, otherwise, the minimal cost required to make it equal.

Wait, but I can perform at most one operation.

So, I need to find the minimal cost of at most one operation to make the array equal.

Let me consider that I can perform zero or one operation.

If I perform zero operations, the cost is zero, but only if the array is already equal.

If I perform one operation, I need to choose a subarray and set it to x, and choose x such that the entire array becomes equal to x.

To make the entire array equal to x, I need to set all elements not equal to x to x.

But with only one operation, I can set a single subarray to x.

So, I need to choose x and a subarray such that, after setting that subarray to x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

That means that the parts outside of that subarray must already be equal to x.

Wait, that's an important insight.

So, if I choose x and a subarray, the subarray is set to x, and the rest of the array must already be x.

Therefore, to make the entire array equal to x, the parts outside the subarray must already be x.

So, the cost is the length of the subarray.

Alternatively, if I don't perform any operation, the array must already be equal.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x and a subarray such that the parts outside the subarray are already x, and the subarray is set to x, minimizing the length of the subarray.

Alternatively, if the array is already equal, the cost is zero.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the length of the array that is already equal to x, and set the remaining part to x with one operation.

In other words, find the largest contiguous segment(s) where all elements are equal to x, and set the rest to x in one operation.

But since I can only perform one operation, I need to find the minimal cost to cover the parts that are not equal to x with one operation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing x such that the minimal cost is minimized.

So, I need to choose x and, optionally, one subarray to set to x, such that the entire array becomes x.

The cost is zero if the array is already x, otherwise, it's the cost of setting the non-x parts to x with one operation.

But with one operation, I can set only one subarray to x.

So, I need to cover all the non-x elements with one subarray.

Therefore, the minimal cost would be the length of the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

Wait, but that might not be possible, because the non-x elements might be spread out.

Wait, no. If I set a subarray to x, then the parts outside that subarray must already be x.

So, to cover all non-x elements with one subarray, I need to set a subarray that includes all non-x elements.

Therefore, the subarray should be from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

So, the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements is from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

Therefore, the cost is (last_non_x_index - first_non_x_index + 1).

But I need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

So, for each possible x, calculate the subarray that needs to be set to x to make the entire array x, and choose the x that minimizes this cost.

Wait, but x can be any integer, not necessarily in the array.

But in practice, x should be chosen to minimize the cost.

Wait, perhaps it's better to choose x such that the maximal run of x is maximized.

Wait, perhaps I should choose x to be the value that has the longest consecutive run in the array.

Then, the cost would be the total length minus the length of the longest consecutive run of x.

So, the minimal cost is n - max(length of consecutive runs of x for all x).

Wait, that seems promising.

Let me verify with the examples.

First example: [1,2,3,4,5,1]

Possible x values are 1,2,3,4,5.

- For x=1: consecutive runs are [1] and [1], max run length is 1.

- For x=2: consecutive run is [2], length 1.

- For x=3: [3], length 1.

- For x=4: [4], length 1.

- For x=5: [5], length 1.

So, n - max run length = 6 - 1 = 5.

But in the example, the output is 4.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that I can choose x not in the array.

If I choose x not in the array, then the max run length is 0, and the cost would be n - 0 = n.

But in the example, the output is 4, which is less than 6.

So, choosing x not in the array doesn't help.

Wait, but x can be any integer, not necessarily in the array.

But in that case, the cost would be n, which is higher than some other options.

So, perhaps choosing x to be one that is already in the array is better.

Wait, in the first example, if I choose x=1, and set the subarray from index 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 4.

That matches the example output.

If I choose x=1 and set the subarray from index 2 to 5, which has length 4.

Similarly, if I choose x=1 and set the subarray from index 1 to 6, which has length 6, but that's more expensive.

So, choosing the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

Wait, but in this case, there are two runs of 1: [1] at the beginning and [1] at the end.

So, the non-1 elements are from index 2 to 5.

Setting this subarray to 1 makes the entire array 1's.

The length is 4, which matches the example.

Alternatively, if I choose x=2, the non-2 elements are [1,3,4,5,1], so I need to set from index 1 to 6, which has length 6.

Similarly for x=3, x=4, x=5.

So, choosing x=1 gives the minimal cost of 4.

Hence, the minimal cost is n minus the maximum run length of x, where x is chosen to maximize this run length.

So, in this case, max run length of 1 is 1, but choosing x=1 allows me to set the subarray from index 2 to 5 to 1, which has length 4, and the total cost is 4.

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, n - max run length = 6 - 1 = 5, but the actual minimal cost is 4.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's n - (the sum of the lengths of the maximal runs of x).

But in this case, there are two runs of 1: one at the beginning of length 1, and one at the end of length 1, so sum is 2, and 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the example.

That seems promising.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is n - sum of the lengths of the maximal runs of x, where x is chosen to maximize this sum.

Wait, but in the second example, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], n=7, sum of lengths of maximal runs of 1 is 7, so 7 - 7 = 0, which matches the output.

In the third example, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], n=8.

Maximal runs:

- 8: length 3 ([8,8,8] at the beginning)

- 1: length 1

- 2: length 1

- 8: length 2 ([8,8] at the end)

- 8: length 1 ([8] in the middle)

So, sum of maximal runs of 8 is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

Hence, 8 - 6 = 2, which matches the output.

In the fourth example, n=1, array [1], already equal, so cost is 0.

In the fifth example, [1,2], n=2.

Possible x:

- x=1: maximal run of 1 is 1, so 2 - 1 = 1

- x=2: maximal run of 2 is 1, so 2 - 1 =1

- x=3: maximal run of 3 is 0, so 2 - 0 =2

So, minimal cost is 1, which matches the output.

In the sixth example, [1,2,3], n=3.

Possible x:

- x=1: sum of maximal runs is 1, 3 -1 =2

- x=2: sum of maximal runs is 1, 3 -1 =2

- x=3: sum of maximal runs is 1, 3 -1 =2

So, minimal cost is 2, matches the output.

In the seventh example, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], n=7.

Possible x:

- x=1: sum of maximal runs is 2 ([1,1]), so 7 -2 =5

- x=3: sum of maximal runs is 1 ([3] at the end), so 7 -1 =6

- x=2: sum of maximal runs is 1 ([2]), so 7 -1=6

- x=4: sum of maximal runs is 1 ([4]), so 7 -1=6

- x=7: sum of maximal runs is 1 ([7]), so 7 -1=6

So, minimal cost is 5, but the output is 6. Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the seventh example, the output is 6, but according to my calculation, for x=1, it's 7 -2 =5, which is less than 6.

But according to the example, it's 6.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the operation sets a subarray to x, and the rest must already be x.

So, for x=1, I need to set the subarray from index 1 to 4 ([4,3,2,7]) to 1, which has length 4, and the rest are already 1.

Wait, but in the array [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], setting indices 1 to 4 to 1 would make the array [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's.

Wait, I need to set a subarray that covers all non-1 elements.

Wait, but the non-1 elements are at indices 1,2,3,4,7.

So, to cover all non-1 elements, I need to set from index 1 to 7 to 1, which has length 7.

But that would make the entire array [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is correct, but the cost is 7, which is higher than the example output.

Wait, but the example output is 6.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe choosing x=3.

For x=3, the maximal run is [3] at the end, length 1.

So, n -1 =6, which matches the example.

How is that possible?

If I choose x=3, and set the subarray from index 1 to 6 to 3, which has length 6, the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which is all 3's.

So, the cost is 6, which matches the output.

But if I choose x=1 and set from index 1 to 6, which has length 6, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's.

Wait, I need to set a subarray to x such that the rest are already x.

So, for x=3, the rest outside the subarray must be 3.

In this case, if I set indices 1 to 6 to 3, and index 7 is already 3, so the entire array becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Similarly, if I set indices 1 to 5 to 3, but index 6 is 1, which is not 3, so that wouldn't work.

Hence, I need to set from index 1 to 6 to 3, which has length 6.

Hence, the cost is 6.

Similarly, for x=1, if I set indices 1 to 6 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's.

So, I need to set indices 1 to 7 to 1, which has length 7, but that's more expensive.

Hence, the minimal cost is 6.

So, in this case, choosing x=3 and setting indices 1 to 6 to 3 gives the minimal cost of 6.

Therefore, the formula is n - sum of the lengths of the maximal runs of x, where x is chosen to maximize this sum.

In this case, for x=3, sum of maximal runs is 1, so 7 -1 =6.

For x=1, sum of maximal runs is 2, so 7 -2=5.

But wait, in practice, choosing x=1 and setting indices 1 to 6 to 1 gives an array of [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's.

So, to make the entire array 1's, I need to set indices 1 to 7 to 1, which has length 7.

But according to my earlier calculation, n - max run length of x=1 is 7 -2 =5, but in practice, it seems that I need to set a subarray of length 7.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of the maximal runs of x should be contiguous.

Wait, no, the runs are contiguous sequences of x.

So, for x=1, in [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], the runs are [1,1], which is length 2.

There is no other run of 1's.

So, sum of maximal runs is 2.

But to make the entire array 1's, I need to set all non-1 elements to 1, which are from indices 1 to 5 and index 7.

So, to cover indices 1 to 5 and 7 with one subarray, I need to set from index 1 to 7, which has length 7.

Hence, the cost is 7, not 5.

So, my formula suggests 5, but in reality, it's 7.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think about choosing x and then finding the minimal subarray that covers all non-x elements.

So, for x=1, non-1 elements are at indices 1,2,3,4,7.

To cover all these with one subarray, I need to set from index 1 to 7, which has length 7.

For x=3, non-3 elements are at indices 1,2,3,4,6.

To cover these with one subarray from index 1 to 6, which has length 6.

Similarly, for x=2, non-2 elements are at indices 1,3,4,5,6,7.

To cover these with one subarray from index 1 to 7, which has length 7.

For x=4, non-4 elements are at indices 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Set from index 2 to 7, length 6.

For x=7, non-7 elements are at indices 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Set from index 1 to 7, length 7.

Hence, the minimal cost is 6, which corresponds to choosing x=3 or x=4.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimal length of the subarray that covers all non-x elements, over all possible x.

So, for each x,
