Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me starting first. Each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The goal is to maximize my points, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine in case of ties.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n turns in total, with each player taking n turns. The game is played in a way that both players can see all the cards on the table at any time, so it's a game of perfect information.

Given that Nene is very smart and plays optimally, I need to anticipate her moves to maximize my own score.

Let me think about the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

In the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. Since there are 8 cards in total, with each number from 1 to 4 appearing twice. So, Nene's cards must be the remaining ones: 2,3,4,4.

The explanation says that in one possible sequence of plays:

1. I play one of my 1's.

2. Nene plays one of her 4's.

3. I play my other 1, and since there's already a 1 on the table, I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays her other 4, and since there's already a 4 on the table, she gets 1 point.

5. I play my 2, no point.

6. Nene plays her 2, gets 1 point.

7. I play my 3, no point.

8. Nene plays her 3, gets 1 point.

So, I end up with 1 point, and Nene with 3 points.

It's claimed that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

I need to find a general strategy for any n and any distribution of my cards.

Let me try to model this.

First, since each number appears exactly twice, for each number, there are two cards: one in my hand and one in Nene's hand, or both in my hand, or both in Nene's hand.

Wait, no. The problem says that the deck has 2n cards with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. Then, the cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. So, for each number from 1 to n, its two cards are split between me and Nene in some way: either I have both, Nene has both, or we each have one.

But the problem says: "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) — the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times."

Wait, it says "each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times." But since there are n cards in my hand, and each integer appears at most twice, but not necessarily exactly twice, because if I have both copies of a number, then that number appears twice in my hand, but for numbers where Nene has both, they don't appear in my hand at all.

So, for each number from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then Nene has none.

- If I have one card, Nene has one card.

- If I have no cards, Nene has both.

I need to find out, given my cards, what is the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me try to think about the game.

Since we take turns alternately, with me starting first, and each turn consists of playing one card, and possibly getting a point if there's already a card with the same number on the table.

I need to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

I need to think about how the order of playing cards affects the points scored.

Let me consider that the game is fully determined by the sequence in which cards are played, and since both players play optimally, I need to find the sequence that maximizes my points.

But considering the perfect information, it's like a game tree where both players make optimal choices.

This seems complex, so maybe there's a smarter way to approach it.

Perhaps I can think in terms of which numbers I can play to get points, and how Nene can block me or help me.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of which numbers are "pairs" where both cards are held by one player, and which are "split" between me and Nene.

Let's define:

- For each number x from 1 to n:

- If I have both cards, then Nene has none.

- If I have one card, and Nene has one card.

- If I have no cards, Nene has both.

I need to categorize the numbers based on who holds the cards.

Let me denote:

- Let S be the set of numbers where I have both cards.

- Let T be the set of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- Let U be the set of numbers where I have no cards and Nene has both.

From the input, for each test case:

- First line: n

- Second line: a1 a2 ... an: the numbers on my n cards.

From this, I can count the frequency of each number in my hand.

- If a number appears twice in my hand, it's in S.

- If it appears once, it's in T.

- If it doesn't appear, it's in U.

My goal is to maximize the number of times I play a card and there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, I need to consider her strategies.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: A number is in S (I have both cards).

- If I play both cards in my turns, I will get 1 point for the second card, since the first card was already played.

Scenario 2: A number is in T (I have one card, Nene has one card).

- One card with this number is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

- Depending on the order in which we play these cards, points can be scored.

Scenario 3: A number is in U (Nene has both cards).

- I have no cards with this number, so Nene will play both of her cards with this number.

- I cannot get any points from this number, but Nene can get 1 point from the second card.

Now, I need to think about how to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me consider that Nene will play in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

I need to think about the interaction between our moves.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph or use some combinatorial approach.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of "pairs" I can form.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times I can play a card that already has a pair on the table.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of "conflicts" or "opportunities" to score points.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote:

- Let m be the number of numbers in S, i.e., numbers where I have both cards.

- Let k be the number of numbers in T, i.e., numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- Then, the number of numbers in U is n - m - k.

Now, I have n turns to play, and Nene has n turns.

I need to select which cards to play in which turns.

Nene will select her cards optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to maximize my points, given Nene's optimal play.

Let me think about the possible points I can get.

For each number in S, if I play both cards, I will get 1 point for the second card.

For each number in T, depending on the order in which we play our cards, I might get a point if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of which cards to play when, to maximize my points.

Let me consider that the table state is public, so both of us know which cards are on the table at any time.

I need to decide which card to play in my turn, based on the current table state and anticipating Nene's moves.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the total number of points that can be scored in the game is equal to the number of times a card is played and there is already a card with the same number on the table.

In total, for each number from 1 to n:

- If both cards are played to the table, one player will get 1 point for playing the second card.

- If only one card is played, no points are scored for that number.

But since each number has exactly two cards, and both will be played to the table, there will be n points scored in total, one for each number.

Wait, but according to the example, Nene scored 3 points and I scored 1 point, totaling 4 points, which matches n=4.

So, in general, the total points scored will be n.

Given that, my goal is to maximize my points, which would mean minimizing Nene's points.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, it's a zero-sum game in terms of points.

Wait, but it's not exactly zero-sum because the total points are fixed at n.

Wait, actually, since each number contributes exactly one point to either me or Nene, depending on who plays the second card, the total points will be n.

So, if I get p points, Nene gets n - p points.

So, Nene wants to minimize p, and I want to maximize p.

Given that, Nene will play in a way that minimizes p.

So, I need to find the maximum p such that, even with Nene playing optimally to minimize p, p is achieved.

This sounds like a minimax problem.

In game theory, this would be modeled as a minimax game, where I choose my moves to maximize the minimum p that I can get, given Nene's optimal response.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate p without simulating the entire game.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the game is equivalent to assigning, for each number, who plays the second card.

The player who plays the second card for a number gets the point for that number.

So, the game reduces to determining, for each number, who plays the second card.

Given that we take turns, with me starting first, and we each have a set of cards, I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize the number of numbers for which I play the second card.

Wait, but Nene is also deciding her order to maximize her points.

This seems like a combinatorial game.

Let me consider the following approach.

For each number, there are two cards: one mine and one Nene's.

For numbers in S, both cards are mine.

For numbers in T, one is mine and one is Nene's.

For numbers in U, both are Nene's.

Now, for numbers in S, since both cards are mine, I will play them in my two turns, and I will get 1 point for the second card.

For numbers in U, both cards are Nene's, so she will play both in her turns, and she will get 1 point for the second card.

For numbers in T, one card is mine and one is Nene's, so one of us will play the card first, and the other will play the second card and get the point.

So, for numbers in T, the question is who plays the second card.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers in S plus half the number of numbers in T, rounded in my favor, considering Nene's optimal play.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think again.

For numbers in S, I will get 1 point for each, because I play both cards and the second one gets a point.

For numbers in U, Nene gets 1 point for each, and I get nothing.

For numbers in T, it depends on who plays the second card.

So, for each number in T, either I play the second card and get 1 point, or Nene plays the second card and gets 1 point.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will try to play her card in such a way that minimizes my chances of getting points from T.

Wait, but the order of play is alternating, with me starting first.

Each player has n turns, and in each turn, a player plays one card.

So, the sequence of plays is determined by the sequence of choices made by both players over their n turns.

This seems too involved to simulate directly, especially given the constraints on n.

I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum points I can get.

Let me consider the total points available.

Total points available are n, one for each number.

Out of these, for numbers in S, I will get 1 point for each, because I play both cards and get a point for the second one.

For numbers in U, Nene will get 1 point for each, since she plays both cards and gets a point for the second one.

For numbers in T, for each such number, one point will be awarded to either me or Nene, depending on who plays the second card.

So, the points I can get are equal to the number of numbers in S plus the number of numbers in T where I play the second card.

Nene will try to minimize this latter quantity.

So, I need to maximize the number of numbers in T where I play the second card, given that Nene is trying to minimize it.

This sounds like a combinatorial game where I need to maximize my gain against Nene's opposition.

Let me think about the number of turns I have and Nene has.

Each has n turns.

I start first.

Let me denote:

- Let m = |S|: numbers where I have both cards.

- Let k = |T|: numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- Let l = |U|: numbers where Nene has both cards.

So, m + k + l = n.

For numbers in S, I will get m points, because I play both cards and get 1 point for each.

For numbers in U, Nene gets l points.

For numbers in T, for each, either I get 1 point or Nene gets 1 point.

So, my total points will be m plus the number of numbers in T where I play the second card.

Nene will try to minimize this number.

I need to find the maximum number of numbers in T where I can play the second card, given Nene's opposition.

Let me think about the sequence of plays.

Since I start first, and we alternate turns, I have turns 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 2n turns.

Nene has turns 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n turns.

I need to decide which card to play in my turns to maximize the number of T numbers where I play the second card.

Nene will decide her plays to minimize this number.

This seems like a game where the order of plays matters a lot.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent game states, and edges represent moves, but that might be too complex.

Let me consider a different approach.

Let me consider that for numbers in T, the point for that number will be awarded to the player who plays the second card for that number.

So, for each number in T, I need to ensure that I play my card after Nene plays her card for that number.

Wait, but Nene can choose to play her card for that number at any time during her turns.

Similarly, I can choose to play my card for that number at any time during my turns.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to maximize the number of T numbers where I play the second card.

Nene will try to minimize this number.

Let me consider that for each number in T, there is a pair of turns where the two cards for that number are played.

I need to choose, for each T number, in which of my turns I play my card for that number.

Nene will choose, for each T number, in which of her turns she plays her card for that number.

Given that, I need to maximize, over all possible choices of my plays, the minimum number of T numbers where I play the second card, given Nene's optimal choices.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of T numbers where I can force Nene to play her card before I play mine.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which turns I can use to play my T cards in a way that maximizes the number of times I play second for those T numbers.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for numbers in S, I will get 1 point each, as I play both cards.

For numbers in U, Nene gets 1 point each.

For numbers in T, it's a competition between me and Nene to see who plays the second card.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get from T is equal to the number of T numbers where I play second.

Nene will try to minimize this number.

Given that, perhaps I can get floor((k + 1)/2) points from T, where k = |T|.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, S={1}, k=|T|=2 (numbers 2 and 3), l=|U|=1 (number 4).

So, m=1, k=2, l=1.

Total points I can get: m + points from T.

From T, I can get 1 point, as per the example.

So, points from T: 1.

Hence, total points: 1 (from S) + 1 (from T) = 2.

But in the explanation, it's said that I get 1 point.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the first test case, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

So, S={1}, T={2,3}, U={4}.

Nene's cards are 2,3,4,4.

So, m=1, k=2, l=1.

Total points I can get: m + points from T.

In the explanation, I get 1 point, coming from playing the second 1.

But according to my earlier assumption, I should get m=1 plus some points from T.

But in the example, I only get 1 point, not 2.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I can get points from T only if I play the second card for those numbers.

But Nene can play her cards in T in such a way that minimizes my points from T.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get from T is ceil(k/2), and Nene can minimize it to floor(k/2).

Wait, in the first test case, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, which matches the example where I get 1 point from T.

Wait, but in the second test case:

n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, S={8,5}, m=2.

T={7,4,1,2}, k=4.

U={3,6}, l=2.

Total points I can get: m=2 + points from T.

In the output, it's 2, which suggests that I get 0 points from T.

But according to my earlier assumption, I should get ceil(4/2)=2 points from T.

But in reality, it's 2 points total, which includes m=2, but points from T seem to be 0.

Wait, in the second test case, output is 2, which is equal to m=2, implying that I get 0 points from T.

Wait, but according to my earlier assumption, I should get ceil(k/2)=2 points from T.

But in reality, it's m=2 + 0 from T = 2.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can arrange her plays to minimize the points I get from T.

Given that, perhaps the points I can get from T is floor(k/2).

In the first test case, floor(2/2)=1, which matches the example.

In the second test case, floor(4/2)=2, but according to the output, it's m=2 + 0 from T =2, which suggests that I get 0 from T.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for numbers in T, Nene can choose to play her card before me, thus preventing me from getting a point from that number.

So, for each number in T, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, then Nene gets the point for that number, and I get nothing.

If I play my card before Nene plays hers, then I don't get a point for that number, and Nene will play her card later and get the point.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I play my card first, then when Nene plays her card later, she gets the point.

If Nene plays her card first, then when I play my card later, I don't get a point.

Wait, no.

Let me think carefully.

- If I play my card first, it's placed on the table.

- Then, when Nene plays her card for the same number later, she gets a point.

- If Nene plays her card first, it's placed on the table.

- Then, when I play my card for the same number later, I get a point.

So, for each number in T, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, I get 1 point.

If I play my card before Nene plays hers, she gets 1 point.

Wait, but according to the earlier understanding, it's the player who plays the second card that gets the point.

So, for numbers in T:

- If Nene plays her card before I play mine, then when I play mine later, I get a point.

- If I play my card before Nene plays hers, then when she plays hers later, she gets a point.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

"On each turn:

- The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it.

- The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table."

So, the player gets a point if, when they play their card, there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Therefore, for numbers in T:

- If Nene plays her card first, then when I play my card later, there's already a card with the same number on the table, so I get a point.

- If I play my card first, then when Nene plays her card later, there's already a card with the same number on the table, so she gets a point.

So, for each number in T, either I get 1 point or Nene gets 1 point, depending on who plays the
