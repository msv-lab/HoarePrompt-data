Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems straightforward enough, but I need to make sure I understand it completely before I dive into the given program to check its correctness.

So, the problem is about determining the area of a square, given the coordinates of its four corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which means it's not rotated at any angle; it's aligned with the x and y axes. That simplifies things a lot because the sides are either horizontal or vertical.

The input consists of multiple test cases, starting with an integer t indicating how many test cases there are. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers: the x and y coordinates of one of the square's corners. The problem guarantees that the given points do form a valid square with positive area, so I don't need to worry about invalid inputs or degenerate cases like all points being the same.

My task is to calculate the area of this square for each test case.

First, I need to recall how to calculate the area of a square. The area is simply the square of the length of one of its sides. Since the sides are parallel to the axes, I can easily calculate the side lengths by finding the differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

But in this problem, the points are given in a random order, so I need to figure out which points correspond to which sides.

Let me think about the properties of such a square. Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points will have some specific patterns.

For example, in a square aligned with the axes, there will be two distinct x-coordinates and two distinct y-coordinates. Each point will have one of the two x-coordinates paired with one of the two y-coordinates.

So, if I have four points, and I list their x-coordinates and y-coordinates, I should see that there are only two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

For instance, in the first example:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

The x-coordinates are 1, 4, 1, 4, so the unique x-values are 1 and 4.

The y-coordinates are 2, 5, 5, 2, so the unique y-values are 2 and 5.

Similarly, in the second example:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-values: -1, 1, 1, -1

y-values: 1, -1, 1, -1

Unique x: -1 and 1

Unique y: -1 and 1

And the third example:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-values: 45, 45, 17, 17

y-values: 11, 39, 11, 39

Unique x: 45 and 17

Unique y: 11 and 39

This pattern holds for all the examples, which makes sense because the squares are axis-aligned.

So, to find the area, I need to find the difference between the two unique x-values (which will give me the side length) and square it, or find the difference between the two unique y-values and square it. Both should give me the same area since it's a square.

Wait a minute, in a square, the side lengths should be equal, so the difference between the x-values and the difference between the y-values should be the same. But in the examples, that seems to hold.

For the first example:

x差: 4 - 1 = 3

y差: 5 - 2 = 3

Area: 3*3 = 9

Second example:

x差: 1 - (-1) = 2

y差: 1 - (-1) = 2

Area: 2*2 = 4

Third example:

x差: 45 - 17 = 28

y差: 39 - 11 = 28

Area: 28*28 = 784

Perfect, that matches the sample outputs.

So, my approach would be:

1. For each test case, collect the four points.

2. Find the unique x-values and y-values.

3. Calculate the difference between the two unique x-values to get the side length.

4. Square the side length to get the area.

5. Print the area.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates: (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h).

Next, it calculates two distances squared:

n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2

x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2

Then, it compares n and x and prints the smaller one.

Wait, that seems suspicious.

In a square, all sides are equal, so any two adjacent sides should have the same length. But here, it's calculating the squared distances between two pairs of points and comparing them.

But in the context of the problem, where the points are given in random order, it's not guaranteed that (a,b) and (e,f) are adjacent points, or that (c,d) and (g,h) are adjacent.

In fact, in a square, the distance between two adjacent points should be equal to the side length, and the distance between two diagonal points should be equal to the side length times sqrt(2).

But in this program, it's calculating squared distances between arbitrary pairs of points and then taking the minimum of those squared distances.

That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the author intended to find the distance between two adjacent points to determine the side length, then square it to get the area.

But without ensuring that the pairs are indeed adjacent, this approach could be flawed.

Let me check with the sample inputs.

Take the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Calculating distances squared:

Between (1,2) and (4,5): (1-4)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18

Between (1,2) and (1,5): (1-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Between (1,2) and (4,2): (1-4)^2 + (2-2)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

Between (4,5) and (1,5): (4-1)^2 + (5-5)^2 = 9 + 0 = 9

Between (4,5) and (4,2): (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Between (1,5) and (4,2): (1-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18

So, the squared distances are either 9 or 18.

The side length squared should be 9 (since side length is 3), and the diagonal squared is 18.

So, if the program is picking the smaller squared distance, which is 9, and printing it, that would be correct for this case.

Wait, but in this case, the area is 9, which matches the side length squared.

So, perhaps the author is relying on picking the smallest squared distance between any two points, which should be the side length squared in a square.

Let me check another sample input.

Second test case:

(-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Squared distances:

Between (-1,1) and (1,-1): ( -1-1)^2 + (1-(-1))^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

Between (-1,1) and (1,1): ( -1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

Between (-1,1) and (-1,-1): ( -1-(-1))^2 + (1-(-1))^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

Between (1,-1) and (1,1): (1-1)^2 + (-1-1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

Between (1,-1) and (-1,-1): (1-(-1))^2 + (-1-(-1))^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

Between (1,1) and (-1,-1): (1-(-1))^2 + (1-(-1))^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

So, squared distances are 4 and 8.

The smaller one is 4, which is the side length squared, since side length is 2, and area is 4.

That matches the sample output.

Third test case:

(45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Squared distances:

Between (45,11) and (45,39): (45-45)^2 + (11-39)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

Between (45,11) and (17,11): (45-17)^2 + (11-11)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

Between (45,11) and (17,39): (45-17)^2 + (11-39)^2 = 784 + 784 = 1568

Between (45,39) and (17,11): (45-17)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 784 + 784 = 1568

Between (45,39) and (17,39): (45-17)^2 + (39-39)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

Between (17,11) and (17,39): (17-17)^2 + (11-39)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

So, squared distances are 784 and 1568.

The smaller one is 784, which is the side length squared, since side length is 28, and area is 784.

Again, matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the author's approach is to calculate the squared distances between two pairs of points and pick the smaller one as the area.

But in the program, it's hardcoding specific pairs: (a,e) and (b,f) for one pair, and (c,g) and (d,h) for another pair.

But in the input, the points are given in random order, so there's no guarantee that these specific pairs are actually adjacent points.

Wait, in the way the program is written, it's assigning the input points to variables (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h), but in the input, they are in random order.

So, the pairs (a,e), (b,f), (c,g), (d,h) are just random pairs; they may or may not be adjacent points.

But in the sample inputs, it happened to work out that the pairs chosen were adjacent points, so their squared distances were equal to the side length squared.

But in general, this might not hold.

Let me consider a different arrangement of points.

Suppose the points are:

(0,0)

(0,1)

(1,0)

(1,1)

These form a square with side length 1 and area 1.

Now, if the program pairs (0,0) and (1,1), their squared distance is 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

If it pairs (0,0) and (0,1), their squared distance is 0 + 1 = 1.

So, n=1, x=2, and it would print the smaller one, which is 1, which is correct.

But wait, in this case, it worked because one of the pairs happened to be adjacent.

But what if the pairs chosen are both diagonal?

Suppose (a,b) = (0,0), (e,f)=(1,1)

Then n = (0-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

And (c,d)=(0,1), (g,h)=(1,0)

Then x = (0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

So, it would print 2, but the area should be 1.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, but in this case, the side length is 1, so area is 1, but it's printing 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, in this case, the side length is 1, so area is 1, but the program is calculating squared distances between diagonal points, which is 2, and printing that.

So, in this case, it would be incorrect.

Wait, but in the previous sample inputs, it happened to work because the smaller squared distance was equal to the side length squared.

But in this example, it's printing the squared diagonal instead of the squared side.

So, this suggests that the program is flawed because it doesn't always pick the side length squared; sometimes it might pick the diagonal squared, depending on how the points are paired.

Wait, but in the previous sample inputs, it worked out correctly, but in this example, it's giving the wrong answer.

So, perhaps the program is relying on luck that the smaller squared distance is the side length squared.

But in the example I just gave, it's picking the diagonal squared, which is twice the side length squared, leading to an incorrect area.

Therefore, this approach is not reliable.

So, the program is incorrect.

But wait, in the sample inputs, it produced the correct outputs.

How is that possible?

In the first sample input:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

As I calculated earlier, the squared distances are 9 and 18.

9 is the side length squared (3*3=9), and 18 is the diagonal squared (3*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(2)=18).

So, picking the smaller one, 9, is correct.

In the second sample:

(-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Squared distances: 4 and 8.

4 is the side length squared (2*2=4), 8 is the diagonal squared (2*sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(2)=8).

Picking 4 is correct.

Third sample:

(45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Squared distances: 784 and 1568.

784 is side length squared (28*28=784), 1568 is diagonal squared (28*sqrt(2)*28*sqrt(2)=1568).

So, picking 784 is correct.

In my earlier example:

(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

If the program pairs (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0), both pairs are diagonals, squared distance 2.

So, it would print 2, which is incorrect, as the area should be 1.

Therefore, the program can be incorrect in certain arrangements of points.

Hence, the program is flawed.

A correct approach would be to calculate all pairwise squared distances, identify the smallest one as the side length squared, and print that.

Alternatively, find the unique x and y values, compute the differences, and square one of them to get the area.

The given program does not guarantee that the pairs used are adjacent; hence, it might pick diagonal pairs in some cases, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
