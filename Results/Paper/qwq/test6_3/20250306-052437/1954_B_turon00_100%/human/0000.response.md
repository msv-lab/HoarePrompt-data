Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a beautiful array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if I can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and replace a[i] with a[i-1].

So, in other words, if the elements on both sides of an element are the same, I can change that element to match them. This operation can be performed any number of times.

I need to make sure I understand how this operation works. Let's look at an example.

Take the array [2, 2, 2]. No matter how many times I apply the operation, it remains the same, and all elements are already equal. So, it's beautiful.

Another example is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. According to the problem, this is beautiful. If I choose i=3, since a[2]=2 and a[4]=2, I can replace a[3]=1 with 2, making the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. Then, I can choose i=2, replacing a[2]=2 with 1, making [1,1,2,2,1].继续操作，最终可以变成全1或全2。

Wait, but in the example, it says that after removing the element at index 5, the array becomes [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful because there are operations that don't lead to all elements being the same.

So, I need to find a way to remove the least number of elements so that, after removal, the array cannot be transformed into an array where all elements are equal using the given operation.

First, I need to think about the properties of a beautiful array.

Let's consider that if all elements are already equal, it's beautiful, and removing any element won't change that, except if only one element remains, which is trivially beautiful.

Wait, but in the first test case, with [2,2,2], it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements because even if I remove one or two elements, it remains beautiful. Only if I remove all elements, but I can't do that. So, in such cases, the output should be -1.

Another example is [1], a single element. It's already beautiful, and I can't make it not beautiful by removing elements.

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], by removing one element, I can make it not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], by removing three elements, I can make it not beautiful.

So, I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is not beautiful.

But, according to the problem, the array is guaranteed to be beautiful, so I need to find a way to break that property by removing elements.

Let me think about what makes an array not beautiful.

An array is not beautiful if there is no way to make all elements equal by applying the operation any number of times.

Considering the operation allows me to change a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], it seems like this operation can propagate values through the array under certain conditions.

So, perhaps, if the array has multiple distinct values that cannot be made equal through these operations, it's not beautiful. But according to the problem, all given arrays are beautiful, so I don't need to worry about that.

I need to ensure that after removal of some elements, the array is no longer beautiful.

Let me consider the simplest cases.

If the array has all elements equal, I can't make it not beautiful by removing elements unless I remove all elements, which is not allowed. So, in such cases, the output should be -1.

If the array has two different values, and it's beautiful, perhaps removing elements to break the sequence that allows the operation to make all elements equal.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of runs of identical elements.

Let's consider the array as consisting of runs of identical elements.

For example, in [1,2,1,2,1], the runs are 1,2,1,2,1.

In [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], the runs are 3,5,3.

Wait, no, in [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], the runs are 3,5,3.

Wait, runs are sequences of identical elements.

So, in [1,2,1,2,1], runs are 1,2,1,2,1.

In [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], runs are 3,5,3.

In [2,2,2], runs are just 2.

So, perhaps, the number of runs can indicate something.

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], which has 5 runs, alternating 1 and 2.

After removing the last element, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which has 4 runs.

In this modified array, it's claimed that it's not beautiful because no matter how you apply the operation, you can't make all elements equal.

So, perhaps, if the array has an even number of runs of two different values alternating, it's not beautiful.

Wait, but in the original array [1,2,1,2,1], which is beautiful, but after removing one element, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful.

So, maybe, if the array has an even number of runs of two alternating values, it's not beautiful.

Wait, but in the original array, [1,2,1,2,1], which has an odd number of runs, it's beautiful, and after removing one element, it has an even number of runs, which might not be beautiful.

So, perhaps, the parity of the number of runs matters.

But, I need to think more generally.

Let me consider that the operation allows me to change a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1].

This seems like I can fix a[i] to be equal to its neighbors if the neighbors are equal.

So, if I have a sequence where a[i-1] == a[i+1], I can set a[i] to be equal to them.

This operation can be applied repeatedly.

So, in an array where there are sections where elements are surrounded by equal elements, I can propagate the surrounding value into them.

Therefore, if I have a run of a certain value, and it's surrounded by the same value, I can propagate that value into any element within that run.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the most frequent element.

Suppose I have an array where one element appears the most number of times, and I can use the operation to make all elements equal to that most frequent element.

Wait, but in the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], 1 appears three times, and 2 appears twice.

I can use the operation to make all elements equal to 1.

Similarly, in [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], 3 appears six times, and 5 appears once.

I can use the operation to make all elements equal to 3.

So, perhaps, in a beautiful array, there is at least one value that can be propagated to all positions using the operation.

So, to make the array not beautiful, I need to prevent any single value from being propagatable to the entire array.

Wait, but how?

Let me consider that if I remove elements in such a way that no single value can span the entire array through the operations, then the array is not beautiful.

So, perhaps, I need to remove elements to break the connectivity of any single value through the operations.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the minimal number of elements to remove so that no value can be spread to the entire array via the operations.

But this seems a bit abstract.

Let me consider the array as a graph where certain elements can be changed based on their neighbors.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the code.

It reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Reads n, the number of elements in the array.

- Reads the array a.

- Initializes tmp to a[0], cnt to 0, and ans to n.

- Iterates through the array:

- If a[i] equals tmp, increments cnt.

- Else, takes the minimum of ans and cnt, resets cnt to 0.

- After the loop, takes the minimum of ans and cnt.

- If n is 1 or ans is n, prints -1.

- Else, prints ans.

So, it seems to be counting the maximum consecutive run of the first element's value and finding the minimal such run length across the array.

Wait, no, actually, it's finding the minimal length of consecutive runs of the first element's value.

Wait, tmp is set to a[0], and it counts consecutive a[i] == tmp, and when it encounters a different value, it takes the minimum of ans and cnt, and resets cnt.

So, it's finding the minimal length of consecutive runs of a[0].

Then, it prints this minimal run length, unless n is 1 or the minimal run length is n, in which case it prints -1.

Wait, but in the example, for [2,2,2], n=3, ans=3, which is n, so it prints -1.

For [1,2,1,2,1], n=5, a[0]=1, runs of 1 are of length 1 and 3, so cnt=1, so ans=1, which is less than n, so it prints 1.

For [1], n=1, ans=1, which is equal to n, so it prints -1.

For [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], a[0]=3, runs of 3 are of length 3, then 3, with a single 5 in between, so cnt=3, ans=3, which is less than n=7, so it prints 3.

But according to the problem's sample output, it should print 3 for the fourth test case, which matches the code's output.

But is this logic correct?

Let me think about what this code is doing.

It seems to be finding the minimal length of consecutive runs of the first element's value.

Then, if n is 1 or this minimal run length is n, it prints -1, else, it prints this minimal run length.

Is this related to making the array not beautiful by removing elements?

Wait, perhaps the idea is that to break the array's beauty, I need to remove at least ans elements, where ans is the minimal length of consecutive runs of the most frequent element.

Wait, but in the code, it's using a[0] as the reference value.

But in the problem, the array is beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to some value via the operations.

So, perhaps, the minimal number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful is equal to the minimal length of consecutive runs of the value that can be propagated to the entire array.

Wait, but in the code, it's using a[0] as the reference value, which might not be the value that can be propagated to the entire array.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the array is beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to some value via the operations.

But the code is using a[0] as the reference value, assuming that a[0] is the value that can be propagated to the entire array.

Is this always true?

Wait, no. The problem says that the array is beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to some value via the operations, but it doesn't specify that it can be made equal to a[0].

It could be made equal to some other value.

For example, in [1,2,1,2,1], it can be made equal to 1 or to 2.

In [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], it can be made equal to 3.

So, in general, there might be multiple values that can be propagated to the entire array.

But the code is only considering runs of a[0].

Is this sufficient?

In the first test case, [2,2,2], a[0]=2, and all elements are 2, so ans=3, which is equal to n, so output -1, which is correct.

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], a[0]=1, runs of 1 are of length 1,1,1, so ans=1, which is less than n, so output 1, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, [1], a[0]=1, ans=1, which is equal to n, so output -1, which matches.

In the fourth test case, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], a[0]=3, runs of 3 are of length 3,3, so ans=3, which is less than n=7, so output 3, which matches.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me think of a case where it might fail.

Suppose the array is [1,1,2,2,1,1], and it's beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to 1 or to 2 via the operations.

If a[0]=1, runs of 1 are of length 2, then 2, then 2.

So, ans=2.

But is removing 2 elements sufficient to make it not beautiful?

Let's see.

If I remove two elements, for example, remove the two 2's, the array becomes [1,1,1,1], which is still beautiful.

Wait, but according to the code, it would output 2, but in reality, removing two elements might not be enough to make it not beautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to remove elements in a different way.

If I remove two 1's from the ends, the array becomes [1,2,2,1], which is still beautiful because I can make all elements equal to 1 or 2.

Wait, maybe I need to remove elements in such a way that I break the connectivity for propagation.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal run length of the value that can be propagated to the entire array.

But in this case, the code is using a[0] as the reference value, which might not be the value that requires the minimal removal.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible values that can be propagated to the entire array and find the minimal run length for each, then take the overall minimal.

But the code is only considering the runs of a[0].

Is this sufficient?

In the above example, [1,1,2,2,1,1], a[0]=1, runs of 1 are length 2,2.

But, if I consider value 2, runs are length 2.

So, the minimal run length is 2 for both 1 and 2.

So, the code, by using a[0]=1, finds ans=2, which seems correct.

But what if the array is [1,1,2,2,1,1], and it's beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to 1 or to 2.

If I remove one element, can I make it not beautiful?

Suppose I remove one 2, the array becomes [1,1,2,1,1]. Now, can this be made beautiful?

Well, it can be made all 1's by operations.

So, removing one element is not enough.

If I remove two 2's, it becomes [1,1,1,1], which is beautiful.

If I remove one 1, it becomes [1,2,2,1,1]. Can this be made beautiful? Yes, make all 1's or all 2's.

If I remove two 1's, for example, the first two, it becomes [1,2,2,1,1], still beautiful.

Wait, maybe removing two elements isn't enough.

Wait, perhaps in this case, I need to remove more elements.

Wait, but according to the code, it would output 2, but in reality, removing two elements might not be enough to make it not beautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements to remove so that no value can be propagated to the entire array.

In other words, after removal, there is no single value that can be made to occupy the entire array via the operations.

So, perhaps, I need to break the connectivity for each possible value that can be propagated to the entire array.

This sounds like finding the minimal number of elements to remove so that no value has a connected path to cover the entire array.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the code, it's finding the minimal run length of a[0] and using that as the answer.

But in the earlier example, it seems that removing the minimal run length might not always be sufficient.

Wait, maybe I need to remove the smallest run of any value that can be propagated to the entire array.

In other words, find the minimal run length among all runs of values that can be propagated to the entire array, and that's the minimal number of elements to remove.

But the code is only considering the runs of a[0], which might not be the value with the smallest run.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the array is beautiful, meaning that it can be made entirely equal to some value via the operations.

So, there must be at least one value that can be propagated to the entire array.

But the code is assuming that a[0] is such a value.

Is this always true?

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], a[0]=1, which can be propagated to the entire array.

In the fourth test case, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], a[0]=3, which can be propagated to the entire array.

In the first test case, [2,2,2], a[0]=2, which can be propagated to the entire array.

In the third test case, [1], a[0]=1, which can be propagated to the entire array.

So, in these cases, a[0] is a value that can be propagated to the entire array.

But is this always the case?

Suppose the array is [2,1,2,1,2], with a[0]=2, and it's beautiful, meaning it can be made entirely equal to 2 or 1.

In this case, a[0]=2, and runs of 2 are length 1,1,1.

So, ans=1.

But if I remove one element, can I make it not beautiful?

If I remove one 2, it becomes [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful, as per the second test case.

So, in this case, removing one element is sufficient.

So, the code would output 1, which is correct.

Another example: [1,1,2,2,1,1], a[0]=1, runs of 1 are length 2,2.

So, ans=2.

But earlier, I thought that removing two elements might not be enough, but perhaps I was wrong.

If I remove two 1's from different runs, say the first and the fifth, it becomes [1,2,2,1,1]. Still beautiful.

If I remove two 2's, it becomes [1,1,2,1,1], still beautiful.

If I remove one 1 and one 2, say the first 1 and the first 2, it becomes [1,2,1,1], which is still beautiful.

Wait, maybe in this case, removing two elements isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, ans=2, and in reality, removing two elements isn't enough, so perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but in the sample input, for the fourth test case, the expected output is 3, and the code would output 3 for [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], since the minimal run of 3 is 3.

So, perhaps, the minimal run length is the correct answer.

Wait, but in my earlier example, [1,1,2,2,1,1], the minimal run of 1 is 2, but removing two elements isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

So, perhaps, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal run length of the value that can be propagated to the entire array.

But in [1,1,2,2,1,1], the minimal run of 1 is 2, but removing two 1's isn't enough to break the beauty.

So, perhaps, this logic is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe the correct minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal run length among all possible values that can be propagated to the entire array.

But in this case, it's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal run length minus one.

Wait, but in the sample input, for [1,2,1,2,1], minimal run of 1 is 1, and removing one element is sufficient.

For [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], minimal run of 3 is 3, and removing three elements is sufficient.

For [2,2,2], minimal run is 3, which is equal to n, so output -1.

For [1], minimal run is 1, which is equal to n, so output -1.

So, perhaps, the rule is: if the minimal run length is less than n, then the minimal number of elements to remove is equal to that minimal run length; else, output -1.

But in my earlier example, [1,1,2,2,1,1], minimal run of 1 is 2, but removing two elements isn't enough, so perhaps this logic is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal run length of any value that can be propagated to the entire array.

In other words, find the minimal run length among all runs of values that can be propagated to the entire array, and that's the minimal number of elements to remove.

But in [1,1,2,2,1,1], both 1 and 2 can be propagated to the entire array.

The minimal run length for 1 is 2, for 2 is 2.

So, ans=2.

But in reality, removing two elements isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

So, perhaps, this logic is still flawed.

Wait, maybe the correct minimal number of elements to remove is equal to the minimal run length among all runs of the most frequent value.

But in this case, both 1 and 2 appear three times, so runs are of length 2 and 2 for 1, and 2 for 2.

So, again, ans=2, which seems insufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal run length among all possible values, but considering the way the operations work.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a beautiful array, and I want to make it not beautiful by removing the least number of elements.

What does it mean for an array to not be beautiful? It means that there is no way to make all elements equal via the given operations.

Given that, perhaps I need to ensure that after removal, there is no value that can be propagated to the entire array via the operations.

So, perhaps, I need to break all possible propagation paths for each value.

This sounds like finding the minimal number of elements to remove so that no value has a connected path covering the entire array.

But this seems too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of elements that appear in all possible propagation paths for any value.

But this is still unclear.

Looking back at the code, it's using the minimal run length of a[0] as the answer, which seems to work for the sample inputs, but fails in my earlier example.

So, perhaps, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me consider that in a beautiful array, there exists at least one value that can be propagated to the entire array via the operations.

To make the array not beautiful, I need to ensure that no such value exists.

So, I need to remove elements in such a way that for every value, there is at least one position where that value cannot be propagated.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps, I need to consider the array as a sequence where certain values can be propagated through the operations.

Given that, maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes are array positions, and edges exist between positions where operations can be applied.

But this might be too time-consuming.

Looking back at the code, it's finding the minimal run length of a[0], and using that as the answer.

In the sample inputs, this seems to work, but in my earlier example, it might not be sufficient.

So, perhaps, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the array is [1,1,1,2,1,1,1], n=7.

Here, a[0]=1, runs of 1 are of length 3, then 3, with a single 2 in between.

So, minimal run of 1 is 3.

According to the code, ans=3.

Is this correct?

If I remove three elements, for example, the three 1's surrounding the 2, the array becomes [1,1,2,1,1], which is still beautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to remove more elements.

Wait, perhaps in this case, removing three elements isn't enough.

Wait, but according to the code, ans=3, but in reality, removing three elements might not be enough to make it not beautiful.

So, perhaps, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to remove elements in a different way.
