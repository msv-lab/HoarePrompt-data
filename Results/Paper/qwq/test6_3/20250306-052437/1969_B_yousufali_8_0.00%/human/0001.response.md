Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the substring "101". If I perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "110". Another shift would make it "011". So, essentially, each shift rotates the substring by one position.

My goal is to rearrange the substring in such a way that, when combined with other operations on other substrings, the entire string becomes sorted.

I need to think about how these operations can be used to move 1s to the end of the string and 0s to the beginning.

Let me consider the first test case: "10". To sort this, I need to get "01". If I perform a cyclic shift on the entire string, "10" becomes "01", and the cost is 2 (since the length of the substring is 2). That matches the first output in the example.

The second test case is "0000", which is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

The third test case is "11000". According to the example, the total cost is 9, achieved through three operations each costing 3.

I need to find a general approach that can handle any binary string and compute the minimum cost to sort it.

Let me think about what needs to be done in general.

First, I need to know the position of each '1' in the string. Since I want all '1's to be at the end, I need to move each '1' that is not already in its correct position to the end of the string.

Each cyclic shift operation can effectively move one '1' to the right by one position per shift. But since I can choose any substring, I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to look at this.

Let's consider that each '1' that is not in its final position needs to be moved right by a certain number of positions.

For example, in "11000", the first two characters are '1's, and in the sorted string, they should be at the end. So, I need to move the first '1' three positions to the right and the second '1' two positions to the right.

But if I perform a cyclic shift on the substring that includes both '1's, I can move them both at once.

Wait, in the example, they performed three operations each of cost 3. That means they chose substrings of length 3 each time.

Let me see what happens if I apply the operations as described in the example.

Starting with "11000":

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011" (after cyclic shift)

   - String becomes "01100"

2. Choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011"

   - String becomes "00110"

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011"

   - String becomes "00011"

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

But is this the minimal cost? Maybe there's a way to do it with fewer operations or operations on larger substrings.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I look for the rightmost '0' that is after a '1'. In "11000", the rightmost '0' that is before any '1' is at position 3 ('0' in "01100"). I need to move this '0' to the left past the '1's.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of inversions. In a sorted array, there should be no '1' before a '0'. So, every '10' pair is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

Each cyclic shift can fix one inversion by moving a '1' to the right.

But I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions, where each inversion costs 2.

But in the first test case, "10" has one inversion, and the cost is 2, which matches.

In the third test case, "11000" has three '10' inversions: positions (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and positions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So, six inversions, but the cost is 9. So, maybe it's not directly the number of inversions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the positions of the '1's and '0's and calculate how much it costs to move each '1' to the right of all '0's.

Let me think about the positions.

Suppose I have the string "11000". The positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

In the sorted string, all '0's should be before '1's. So, in this case, '1's should be at positions 4 and 5.

So, I need to move the '1' at position 1 to position 4, and the '1' at position 2 to position 5.

To move the '1' from position 1 to position 4, it needs to be shifted right by 3 positions.

To move the '1' from position 2 to position 5, it needs to be shifted right by 3 positions as well.

So, total shifts: 3 + 3 = 6.

But in the example, they performed three operations each of cost 3, totaling 9.

So, perhaps there is a way to perform these shifts in a way that shares the cost.

Wait, maybe I can shift multiple '1's at once.

If I perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which costs 3.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "00110".

Finally, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost: 9.

But if I think about moving each '1' individually:

- Move the '1' from position 1 to position 4: shift it right by 3 positions, costing 1 shift of substring [1,4], costing 4.

- Move the '1' from position 2 to position 5: shift it right by 3 positions, costing 1 shift of substring [2,5], costing 4.

Total cost: 8.

But in the example, they did it for 9. So, maybe there is a better way.

Wait, but in my calculation, I'm assuming that I can shift a substring that includes the '1' and the positions I want to move it to.

But perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to find a general approach.

I recall that in sorting algorithms, the number of adjacent swaps needed to sort a sequence is equal to the number of inversions.

In this problem, since the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, which can be seen as performing multiple adjacent swaps in one operation.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is related to the number of inversions.

In the first test case, "10" has one inversion, and the cost is 2, which is 2 times the number of inversions.

In the third test case, "11000" has six inversions, and the cost is 9, which is not directly proportional.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the positions that need to be shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of '1's that need to be moved times the number of positions they need to be moved.

In "11000", there are two '1's that need to be moved three positions each, so 2*3=6, but the example shows 9.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider that each cyclic shift can only move one '1' by one position to the right per operation.

So, to move two '1's each by three positions, it would take 2*3=6 operations, each costing 1, but that doesn't match the example.

Wait, no, the cost is the length of the substring being shifted.

So, if I shift a substring of length k, it costs k, and I'm moving multiple '1's at once.

So, perhaps by choosing larger substrings, I can reduce the cost per '1' moved.

Wait, in the example, they chose substrings of length 3 each time, costing 3 per operation, and did it three times for a total cost of 9.

But maybe there's a way to choose larger substrings to reduce the total cost.

Let me consider shifting a larger substring that includes both '1's.

For example, in "11000", if I shift substring [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, shift substring [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", costing 4.

Now, the string is "00110".

Finally, shift substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11, which is higher than the example's 9.

So, that's worse.

Alternatively, shift substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Now, the string is "01100".

Then, shift substring [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", costing 4.

Now, the string is "00110".

Total cost: 3 + 4 = 7, which is better than the example's 9.

But the example did it in 9, but I found a way to do it in 7.

Wait, maybe the example is not showing the minimal way.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Let me check the problem statement again.

It says: "the minimal total cost to make the string sorted".

In the third test case, the example shows a total cost of 9, but I found a way to do it in 7.

Wait, perhaps the operations I'm choosing are invalid.

Let me see:

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

Total cost: 7.

Is this correct?

Yes, seems correct.

But according to the example, it's 9.

Maybe the example is not demonstrating the minimal cost, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows only cyclic shifts on substrings, not on the entire string.

Wait, no, it allows any substring.

Wait, in the first operation, shifting [1,3] in "11000" to get "01100", that's allowed.

Then shifting [1,4] in "01100" to get "00110", that's also allowed.

Total cost: 3 + 4 = 7, which is less than the example's 9.

So, perhaps there is a better way, and the example is just one possible way, not necessarily the minimal one.

So, I need to find the absolute minimal cost.

Therefore, I need a general approach to calculate the minimal cost.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to move all '1's to the end of the string.

Each '1' that is not already in its correct position needs to be moved right by a certain number of positions.

Suppose there are k '1's that need to be moved.

Each '1' needs to be moved right by a certain number of positions.

If I can perform operations that move multiple '1's at once, I can save on the cost.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved and the positions they need to be moved to.

Let me count the number of '1's that are not in their final positions.

In "11000", there are two '1's that need to be moved to positions 4 and 5.

So, I need to move them each by 3 positions.

But if I perform a cyclic shift on a substring that includes both '1's, I can move them together.

Wait, in the first operation, shifting [1,3] moves both '1's one position to the right.

So, "11000" -> "01100", cost 3.

Now, in the second operation, shifting [2,4] moves the '1' at position 2 to position 4, cost 3.

String becomes "00110".

Third operation, shifting [3,5] moves the '0' to the front, making "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 9.

But in my earlier approach, shifting [1,3] and then [1,4], total cost 3 + 4 = 7.

Is there something wrong with the example or my understanding?

Wait, perhaps the operations are being miscounted.

Let me try to simulate the operations.

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

3. Shift [2,5]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00011", cost 4.

Wait, that's two operations, total cost 3 + 4 = 7.

But in the example, they did three operations each costing 3, totaling 9.

So, perhaps my approach is better, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second operation, shifting [1,4] from "01100" to "00110", is that a valid cyclic shift?

Let's see: "01100" -> cyclic shift on [1,4]: "0110" becomes "0011", so "00110", which seems correct.

So, yes, that's a valid operation.

Therefore, the minimal cost is indeed 7, not 9.

Maybe the example is just demonstrating one possible way, not necessarily the minimal one.

So, I need to find the minimal possible cost.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Suppose I have a string of length n with m '1's.

In the sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, the '1's should be placed at positions n - m + 1 to n.

Any '1' that is not at or after position n - m + 1 needs to be moved to the right.

Each '1' that needs to be moved must be shifted right by a certain number of positions.

If I perform a cyclic shift on a substring that includes multiple '1's, I can move them all at once, which is more efficient.

So, perhaps I should group the '1's that need to be moved and perform shifts on substrings that cover multiple '1's to move them together.

But figuring out the optimal grouping is tricky.

Maybe there's a dynamic programming approach where I keep track of the positions of '1's and calculate the minimal cost to move them to their correct positions.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have positions p1, p2, ..., pm where '1's are located in the original string.

In the sorted string, '1's should be at positions n - m + 1, n - m + 2, ..., n.

So, each '1' at position pi needs to be moved to position n - m + i.

The difference in positions is (n - m + i) - pi.

So, the total number of positions each '1' needs to be moved is (n - m + i) - pi.

But since each cyclic shift can move a '1' by one position to the right per shift, the minimal number of shifts needed to move a '1' by k positions is k.

However, since shifts are on substrings and can affect multiple '1's at once, I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as moving '1's to their target positions, and the cost is the sum of the distances each '1' is moved.

In the earlier example, "11000":

- m = 2 '1's, n = 5.

- '1's should be at positions 4 and 5.

- Current positions: 1 and 2.

- So, '1' at position 1 needs to move 3 positions to the right (to position 4).

- '1' at position 2 needs to move 3 positions to the right (to position 5).

- Total movement: 3 + 3 = 6.

But in the example, they did it for 9, but I found a way to do it for 7, and my calculation suggests it should be 6.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the cost isn't directly equal to the sum of the movements, but to the operations performed.

Each operation can move multiple '1's at once, so the actual cost might be less than the sum of individual movements.

Wait, in the first approach, moving both '1's in one operation of shifting substring [1,3], which costs 3, moves both '1's one position to the right.

So, to move both '1's by 3 positions, it would take 3 operations, each costing 3, totaling 9, as in the example.

But in my earlier approach, I did it in two operations: [1,3] and [1,4], costing 3 + 4 = 7.

Is there a way to do it in operations that cost less?

Wait, perhaps I can do [1,4], costing 4, which moves both '1's one position to the right.

Then do it again, total of three operations, each costing 4, totaling 12.

But that's worse.

Wait, no, in one operation, I can move both '1's one position to the right.

So, to move them three positions to the right, I need three operations, costing 4 each, totaling 12.

But earlier, I did [1,3] (cost 3) to move both '1's one position to the right.

Then [1,4] (cost 4) to move both '1's one more position to the right.

Then [1,5] (cost 5) to move both '1's the third position to the right.

Total cost: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

But in the example, they did [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], each costing 3, totaling 9.

Wait, maybe I need to find a way to move the '1's in overlapping substrings to minimize the cost.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on the positions of the '1's.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the positions of the '1's in the sorted string and calculate how much I need to shift substrings to move them there.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in bubble sort, the number of swaps needed is equal to the number of inversions.

Each swap fixes one inversion.

In this problem, each operation can fix multiple inversions depending on the substring chosen.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimal cost to fix all inversions.

But this seems too broad.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved and the positions they need to be moved to.

Suppose I have k '1's that need to be moved to the end.

Each '1' needs to be moved right by a certain number of positions.

If I can perform a cyclic shift on a substring that contains multiple '1's, I can move them all at once, which is more efficient.

So, perhaps I should group the '1's that are close together and move them in batch operations.

But determining the optimal grouping is complex.

Maybe there's a formula based on the positions of the '1's.

Let me try to calculate the minimal cost for the third test case: "11000".

As I thought earlier, each '1' needs to be moved right by 3 positions.

If I perform operations that move both '1's together, I can reduce the cost.

For example, shifting [1,3] moves both '1's one position to the right for a cost of 3.

So, to move them three positions to the right, I need to perform this operation three times, costing 3 * 3 = 9.

But in my earlier approach, I did [1,3] and [1,4], totaling 7.

Wait, but [1,4] moves both '1's one position to the right, and [1,3] moves both '1's one position to the right.

So, to move them three positions to the right, I need to perform [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], costing 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

Wait, that's not matching my earlier calculation.

I must have made a mistake earlier.

Let me try to simulate it again.

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

3. Shift [1,5]: "00110" -> "00011", cost 5.

Total cost: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

But earlier, I thought it was 7, which was incorrect.

So, the minimal cost is indeed 9, as in the example.

Wait, but how?

Let me see the example operations again:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 9.

So, that makes sense.

Is there a way to do it for less than 9?

Let me try.

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

Total cost: 7.

Wait, in the second operation, shifting [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", which gives "00110", costing 4.

So, total cost is 3 + 4 = 7.

That seems better than the example's 9.

Is this valid?

Yes, it seems valid.

So, perhaps the example is not demonstrating the minimal cost.

Therefore, the minimal cost is 7, not 9.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 7, but according to the example, it's 9.

So, maybe the example is just showing one possible way, and the minimal cost is actually less.

But in the example, it's given as 9, and the fifth test case has an output of 11.

But according to my approach, I can do better.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operations are limited in some way that I'm not considering.

Let me check the problem statement again.

"Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s1 s2 … sn−1 sn into sn s1 s2 … sn−1 . In other words, you take one last character sn and place it before the first character while moving all other characters to the right."

So, a cyclic shift moves the last character of the substring to the front of the substring.

So, for substring [l, r], it becomes s_r s_l s_{l+1} ... s_{r-1}.

In my earlier simulation, I was thinking of moving the last character to the front.

So, for "110", cyclic shift makes it "011", which is correct.

But perhaps I'm missing some constraints on how the shifts affect the positions.

Wait, perhaps when I perform a shift on [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", it's actually moving the last character '0' to the front, making it '0' + '110' shifted, which is '0' + '110' cyclic shifted to '101', so "0101", which is different from what I thought.

Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the cyclic shift operation.

Let me clarify how cyclic shift works.

For substring s_l to s_r, it becomes s_r s_l s_{l+1} ... s_{r-1}.

So, for substring [1,4] in "0110", it's s1='0', s2='1', s3='1', s4='0'.

Cyclic shift: s4='0' moves to the front, and the rest shift to the right.

So, new substring is '0' '0' '1' '1', which is "0011".

So, "0110" -> "0011", which is what I thought earlier.

So, it's correct.

Therefore, the operations are valid.

So, in "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

Total cost: 7.

So, it's better than the example's 9.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal cost is indeed 7, and the example is just demonstrating one way to do it, not necessarily the minimal way.

So, I need to find the minimal possible cost.

Let me try to generalize this approach.

Suppose I have a binary string, and I want to move all '1's to the end.

I can group the '1's that are close together and perform shifts on substrings that cover multiple '1's to move them together.

In the previous example, shifting [1,3] moves two '1's at once, which is efficient.

Then, shifting [1,4] moves two '1's again, moving them further to the right.

So, by choosing substrings that cover multiple '1's, I can minimize the total cost.

But I need a systematic way to calculate this.

Let me consider the positions of the '1's.

In "11000", positions of '1's are 1 and 2.

I need to move them to positions 4 and 5.

So, I need to move them each by 3 positions.

If I perform a shift on [1,3], moving them each by 1 position, costing 3.

Then, perform another shift on [1,4], moving them each by another position, costing 4.

Then, perform a shift on [1,5], moving them each by the third position, costing 5.

Total cost: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

Alternatively, as I did earlier, perform [1,3] and [1,4], costing 3 + 4 = 7.

But in this case, it seems to work.

Is there a formula based on the number of '1's and their positions?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted, optimized in a certain way.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a binary string, and I want to make it sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

Each cyclic shift can be seen as moving the last character of the substring to the front.

This is similar to rotating the substring by one position to the right.

I need to find a series of such operations that will make the string sorted, with all '0's before '1's, and do this with minimal total cost, where the cost is the length of the substring shifted each time.

I recall that in string algorithms, rotations can be used to rearrange substrings.

But this seems complicated.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of inversions.

In a sorted string, there should be no '1' before any '0'.

So, every '10' pair is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

Each cyclic shift can correct some number of inversions.

For example, shifting a substring that contains a '10' pair can potentially correct that inversion.

But figuring out the minimal number of operations to correct all inversions is not straightforward.

Perhaps there's a way to model this problem using the concept of bubble sort, where adjacent swaps are used to sort the array, and the number of swaps is equal to the number of inversions.

But in this problem, the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, which can be seen as performing multiple adjacent swaps at once.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is related to the number of inversions divided by the size of the substring being shifted.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the positions of the '1's in the final sorted string and calculate how much I need to shift substrings to move them there.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look for a pattern in the example outputs.

Given the inputs:

1. "10" -> 2

2. "0000" -> 0

3. "11000" -> 9

4. "101011" -> 5

5. "01101001" -> 11

I need to find a way to compute these costs.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum of the positions of the '1's that are not in their final positions, adjusted by the number of '1's that should be after them.

But I need a clearer formula.

Let me consider that for each '1' that is not in its final position, I need to move it right by a certain number of positions, and the cost is proportional to the number of '1's being moved together.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the number of '1's that need to be moved and multiply by the average number of positions they need to be moved.

But this is too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have the entire string, and I want to make it sorted.

If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0.

If not, I can choose a substring that is not sorted and perform a cyclic shift on it.

But this seems too vague for finding a minimal cost.

Perhaps I need to consider dynamic programming, where I keep track of the positions of '1's and calculate the minimal cost to sort the string up to each position.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider a smaller example.

Take "101".

To sort it to "011", I can perform a cyclic shift on [1,3]: "101" -> "110", costing 3.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost: 6.

But perhaps there is a better way.

Alternatively, perform a cyclic shift on [2,3]: "101" -> "110", costing 2.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on [1,3]: "110" -> "011", costing 3.

Total cost: 5.

Better than the previous approach.

Is there a way to do it for less?

Let me try.

Perform a cyclic shift on [1,2]: "101" -> "011", costing 2.

Now, the string is sorted.

Total cost: 2.

That's better than both previous approaches.

So, in this case, the minimal cost is 2.

But according to the first test case, "10" can be sorted with cost 2.

So, perhaps for "101", it's also 2.

Wait, but "101" has two '10' inversions: positions (1,2) and (1,3).

In the first operation, shifting [1,2]: "10" -> "01", resulting in "011", which is sorted, costing 2.

So, indeed, the minimal cost is 2.

So, perhaps for each '10' inversion, it costs 2 to fix it.

But in the third test case, "11000" has six '10' inversions, but the cost is 9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's that are not in their correct positions multiplied by the average number of positions they need to be moved.

But I need a precise formula.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of '1's that need to be moved and the positions they need to be moved to.

In "11000", there are two '1's that need to be moved three positions each, so total movement is 6.

But in the operation, each cyclic shift can move multiple '1's at once.

So, if I perform a shift on a substring that contains both '1's, I can move them both by one position for the cost of the substring's length.

So, for [1,3], moving both '1's one position to the right costs 3.

So, to move them three positions to the right, I need to perform this operation three times, costing 9.

But in reality, I can choose different substrings to minimize the cost.

As in the earlier approach, [1,3] and [1,4], costing 3 + 4 = 7.

So, 7 is better than 9.

Is there a way to do it for less than 7?

Wait, perhaps [1,4] and [2,5], costing 4 + 3 = 7.

Same total cost.

Alternatively, [1,3], [2,5], costing 3 + 3 = 6.

Wait, let's see:

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

Total cost: 6.

That's better than 7.

So, 6 is better than 7.

Is there a way to do it for less than 6?

Let me try.

Starting with "11000":

1. Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

2. Shift [1,5]: "01100" -> "00110", cost 5.

Total cost: 8, which is worse.

Alternatively:

1. Shift [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

That's directly sorted, cost 4.

Better than 6.

Is this possible?

Wait, shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", which is "0011", so the string becomes "00110".

Wait, but "00110" is not sorted yet; there's still a '0' after '1's.

Wait, no, "00110" has '0's before '1's, so it's sorted.

Wait, no, "00110" is "00110", which is sorted as all '0's before '1's.

Wait, but in "00110", the '0' is at the end, which is fine since '0's are before '1's.

So, yes, it's sorted.

So, with one operation of shifting [1,4], costing 4.

That's better than 6.

So, the minimal cost is 4.

But earlier, I thought it was 6 or 7.

So, perhaps I was missing a better approach.

Let me see.

In "11000", shifting [1,4]: "0110" -> "0011", resulting in "00110", which is sorted, costing 4.

So, the minimal cost is 4, which is better than 6 or 7.

So, perhaps the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but according to the example, it's 9, but I found a way to do it for 4.

Is this possible?

Yes, shifting [1,4] once costs 4 and sorts the string.

So, why is the example showing 9?

Maybe the example is just demonstrating one possible way, not necessarily the minimal one.

So, I need to find the minimal possible cost.

Therefore, in the third test case, the minimal cost is 4, not 9.

But according to the example, it's 9.

So, perhaps the example is not minimal, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that I can't shift substrings in a certain way.

Wait, no, the problem allows shifting any substring any number of times.

So, shifting [1,4] is allowed, and it sorts the string in one operation for a cost of 4.

So, the minimal cost should be 4.

Therefore, perhaps the example is just showing one possible way, not the minimal one.

So, I need to find the minimal cost.

Now, I need a general approach to compute this minimal cost.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a binary string, and I want to move all '1's to the end.

I can iterate through the string and count the number of '1's that need to be moved.

Then, the minimal cost would be equal to the sum of the positions they need to be moved, considering that shifting a substring can move multiple '1's at once.

But I need a better way to calculate this.

Let me consider the positions of the '1's.

Suppose I have the positions p1, p2, ..., pm of the '1's in the original string.

In the sorted string, they should be at positions n - m + 1 to n.

So, for each '1' at position pi, it needs to be moved to position n - m + i.

The number of positions it needs to be moved is (n - m + i - pi).

But since I can perform shifts on substrings that cover multiple '1's, I can move them together.

So, perhaps I can group the '1's that need to be moved into contiguous blocks and perform shifts on those blocks.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of shifts needed to move each '1' to its final position.

Each cyclic shift can move a '1' by one position to the right.

So, to move a '1' by k positions, it would take k shifts.

But if I perform shifts on substrings that contain multiple '1's, I can move them all at once.

So, perhaps I can find overlapping shifts that cover multiple '1's to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a scheduling problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each '1' that needs to be moved is a node, and edges represent the cost to move them together.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the final positions of the '1's and pull the '0's to the front.

Each '0' that is after a '1' needs to be moved to the front.

But it's similar to moving '1's to the end.

Wait, perhaps I can count the number of '0's that are after '1's and calculate the cost based on their positions.

In "11000", there are two '1's and three '0's.

In the sorted string, it should be "00011".

So, I need to move the two '1's to the end.

The number of '0's after the '1's is one '0' after the first '1' and two '0's after the second '1'.

So, total movements: 1 + 2 = 3.

But in reality, to move the '1's to the end, it costs more.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of '0's after each '1' and sum them up.

In "11000":

- First '1' has one '0' after it.

- Second '1' has two '0's after it.

Total '0's after '1's: 1 + 2 = 3.

But earlier, I found that the minimal cost is 4, not 3.

So, perhaps it's not directly the sum of '0's after '1's.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the positions of the '1's that need to be moved.

But I need a precise formula.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of shifts needed to move each '1' to its final position.

Each shift can move a substring to the right by one position.

Wait, no, each shift cyclically shifts the substring by one position.

So, to move a '1' from position p to position q, it requires (q - p) shifts, each costing the length of the substring.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum of the lengths of the substrings being shifted, optimized in a certain way.

But I need a better approach.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Suppose I iterate through the string and count the number of '1's that are before any '0's.

Each '1' before a '0' needs to be moved to the end.

So, the cost to move each '1' is equal to the number of '0's after it.

Wait, no.

In "11000", there are three '0's after the '1's.

So, to move the first '1' to the end, it needs to pass all three '0's.

To move the second '1' to the end, it needs to pass the remaining two '0's.

So, total cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

But earlier, I found a way to do it for 4.

So, perhaps this is not the correct approach
