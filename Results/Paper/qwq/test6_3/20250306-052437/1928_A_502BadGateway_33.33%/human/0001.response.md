Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, or if he's just wasting his time.

First, I need to understand the process step by step. Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of its sides, so he can either cut along the length or the width. Let's consider both options.

If he cuts parallel to the width (along the length), he'll divide the length a into two parts, say c and a - c, both of which are integers since the sides are integers. So, he'll have two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b.

Alternatively, if he cuts parallel to the length (along the width), he'll divide the width b into two parts, say d and b - d, both integers. This gives him two rectangles of size a x d and a x (b - d).

After cutting, he can rotate and move these two rectangles to form a new rectangle. The goal is to see if he can form a rectangle that is different from the original one, where different means not the same up to rotation.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case, the rectangle is 1x1. He can't cut it into two smaller rectangles because one of the pieces would have zero area, which doesn't make sense. So, he can't form any new rectangle, hence "No".

In the second test case, 2x1. If he cuts parallel to the width, he gets two 1x1 rectangles. From these, he can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation. So, "No".

In the third test case, 2x6. If he cuts parallel to the width, he could get two 1x6 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from 2x6. So, "Yes".

Wait, but in the output, it's "Yes" for this case.

In the fourth test case, 3x2. If he cuts parallel to the width, he could get two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, he can't cut into 1.5 and 0.5. Wait, the problem says the sides are integers, so he can only cut into integer lengths. So, for 3x2, if he cuts along the length, he can cut the 3 into, say, 1 and 2, giving two rectangles of 1x2 and 2x2. From these, he can try to form a new rectangle.

Let's see: with a 1x2 and a 2x2, he can place them side by side to form a 1x4 rectangle or a 4x1, which is different from 3x2. So, "Yes".

In the fifth test case, 2x2. If he cuts along the width, he can get two 1x2 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, which is different from 2x2. So, "Yes".

In the sixth test case, 2x4. If he cuts along the width, he can get two 1x4 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x8 or 8x1 rectangle, which is different from 2x4. So, "Yes".

In the seventh test case, 6x3. If he cuts along the width, he can get two 3x3 rectangles. From these, he can form a 3x6 or 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation. So, "No".

From these examples, it seems like the key is to see if, after cutting, the two pieces can be rearranged to form a rectangle that isn't the same as the original one up to rotation.

Let me try to generalize this.

Given a rectangle a x b, Bob can cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.

He can choose to cut along the length or the width.

After cutting, he has two rectangles, and he can rotate and move them to form a new rectangle.

I need to check if this new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that two rectangles are the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotation.

So, first, I need to consider all possible ways Bob can cut the rectangle and then see what new rectangles he can form from the pieces.

But considering all possible cuts and then all possible ways to arrange the pieces seems complicated, especially since a and b can be up to 10^9.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of the rectangles involved.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle along its length, dividing the side of length a into c and a - c, where c is an integer between 1 and a - 1.

Then, he has two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

Now, he wants to form a new rectangle from these two pieces.

He can place them either side by side or one above the other.

If he places them side by side along their widths, he'll have a rectangle of width b + b = 2b and height min(c, a - c).

Alternatively, if he places them one above the other along their lengths, he'll have a rectangle of width max(c, a - c) and height b.

Wait, no.

Let me think carefully.

When he has two rectangles, he can place them either horizontally or vertically adjacent.

If he places them horizontally adjacent, the new width is the sum of their widths, and the height is the maximum of their heights.

Wait, no.

Actually, when placing rectangles to form a new rectangle, the new rectangle's dimensions will be the sum of the dimensions in one direction, depending on how they are arranged.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a * b.

After cutting into two pieces, the total area remains the same, so the new rectangle should also have area a * b.

But the problem seems to allow any rectangle to be formed from the two pieces, not necessarily using all the area.

Wait, no, I think it's about rearranging the pieces to form a new rectangle of the same area.

But in the examples, they seem to be using both pieces to form a new rectangle.

So, perhaps the new rectangle is formed by combining the two pieces in a different arrangement.

Wait, but the pieces can be rotated and moved, but they must form a single rectangle.

I need to find a way to determine if, after cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged (rotated and translated) to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one up to rotation.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the total area.

The area of the original rectangle is a * b.

After cutting into two rectangles, their areas are c * b and (a - c) * b if cutting along the length, or a * d and a * (b - d) if cutting along the width.

Then, when rearranging these two pieces, their total area is still a * b, so the new rectangle should have area a * b.

But the problem allows rotating the pieces, which means that the dimensions of the pieces can be flipped.

Wait, but in rectangle tiling, usually, tiling a rectangle with smaller rectangles has some constraints, but here it's simpler because we only have two pieces.

Given that we have two smaller rectangles, we need to see if they can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one up to rotation.

Let me consider that.

Suppose we have two rectangles with dimensions say p x q and r x s.

We need to see if we can arrange them into a new rectangle.

But in our case, the pieces are related because they come from cutting the original rectangle.

So, if we cut along the length, we have two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

Similarly, if we cut along the width, we have a x d and a x (b - d).

Let's consider cutting along the length first.

So, we have two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

Now, we can rotate these rectangles.

Rotating a rectangle means swapping its width and height.

So, c x b can be rotated to b x c, and similarly, (a - c) x b can be rotated to b x (a - c).

Now, we need to arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

There are a few ways to arrange two rectangles:

1. Place them side by side horizontally.

2. Place them side by side vertically.

3. Place one on top of the other.

But since we can rotate them, we need to consider all possible rotations and arrangements.

Let's consider placing them side by side horizontally.

If we have two rectangles with heights h1 and h2, and widths w1 and w2, placing them horizontally would give a new rectangle with height min(h1, h2) and width w1 + w2.

Wait, no.

Actually, when placing rectangles side by side horizontally, the height of the new rectangle is the maximum of the heights of the two rectangles, and the width is the sum of their widths.

Similarly, if placing them vertically, the width of the new rectangle is the maximum of the widths, and the height is the sum of the heights.

So, in our case, if we have two rectangles after rotation, say with dimensions h1, w1 and h2, w2, we can arrange them in the following ways:

- Place them horizontally adjacent: new height is max(h1, h2), new width is w1 + w2.

- Place them vertically adjacent: new height is h1 + h2, new width is max(w1, w2).

Now, we need to see if any of these arrangements result in a rectangle that is different from the original one up to rotation.

The original rectangle is a x b.

A rectangle is considered the same as another if one can be obtained by rotating the other by 90 degrees.

So, a x b is the same as b x a.

Therefore, any new rectangle that is c x d, where c x d is not equal to a x b or b x a, is considered different.

So, our task is to see if, after cutting and rearranging the two pieces, we can form such a c x d rectangle where c x d is different from a x b and b x a.

Now, to make this feasible for large a and b, I need to find a condition or a formula that can quickly determine if such a rearrangement is possible.

Let's consider the possible cuts and arrangements.

First, consider cutting along the length a into c and a - c, giving two rectangles c x b and (a - c) x b.

Then, we can rotate these pieces, so their dimensions become c x b or b x c, and (a - c) x b or b x (a - c).

Now, arranging them horizontally:

- Option 1: both rotated to b x c and b x (a - c), placed horizontally adjacent: new height is max(b, b) = b, new width is c + (a - c) = a. So, the new rectangle is b x a, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

- Option 2: one rotated to b x c and the other to b x (a - c), placed horizontally adjacent: again, height is b, width is c + (a - c) = a, so b x a, same as original.

- Option 3: one rotated to c x b and the other to b x (a - c), placed horizontally adjacent: height is max(c, b), width is b + (a - c). Wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me be more systematic.

After rotating, each piece can have two possible orientations:

- Piece 1: either c x b or b x c.

- Piece 2: either (a - c) x b or b x (a - c).

Now, for each combination of orientations, we can arrange them in two ways: horizontally or vertically.

So, total possibilities: 2 orientations for piece 1, 2 orientations for piece 2, and 2 arrangement methods (horizontal or vertical). But since arrangement methods are different, I need to consider each combination.

This seems too many cases. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the area and the possible factorizations.

The area is a * b.

After cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle should have area a * b, and dimensions c * d, where c * d = a * b, and c x d is different from a x b and b x a.

But not all factorizations of a * b will be achievable by cutting and rearranging the pieces in the way described.

So, I need to find if there exists a rectangle c x d such that:

1. c * d = a * b.

2. c x d is different from a x b and b x a.

3. It's possible to form c x d from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle along one side.

Now, to make this possible, perhaps there's a relationship between a and b that allows such a rearrangement.

Looking back at the examples:

- 1x1: can't be cut into two rectangles.

- 2x1: cutting into two 1x1, can only form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as original.

- 2x6: cutting into two 1x6, can form 1x12, which is different from 2x6.

- 3x2: cutting into 1x2 and 2x2, can form 1x4, which is different from 3x2.

- 2x2: cutting into two 1x2, can form 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

- 2x4: cutting into two 1x4, can form 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

- 6x3: cutting into two 3x3, can form 3x6, which is the same as original.

So, in cases where b is even, it's possible to form a different rectangle, except when a divides b, or something like that.

Wait, in 2x6, b=6 is even, and 2 divides 6.

In 3x2, b=2 is even, and 3 does not divide 2, but still, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, no, 3 divides 6, but in 3x2, it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if b is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle into two equal pieces along the length, each of size (a/2) x b, but a doesn't need to be even since we can have c != a - c.

Wait, but in the 2x6 example, b=6 is even, and they cut it into two 2x3 rectangles, but in the solution, it's mentioned that it's cut into two 1x6 rectangles to form a 1x12 rectangle.

Wait, but 2x6 can be cut into two 1x6 rectangles by cutting the length a=2 into two 1's.

Then, placing these two 1x6 rectangles side by side horizontally would give a 1x12 rectangle.

Similarly, in 3x2, cutting a=3 into 1 and 2, giving two rectangles 1x2 and 2x2.

Then, placing them side by side horizontally would give a 1x4 rectangle.

Similarly, in 2x2, cutting a=2 into 1 and 1, giving two 1x2 rectangles, which can be placed side by side to form a 1x4 rectangle.

In 2x4, cutting a=2 into 1 and 1, giving two 1x4 rectangles, which can be placed side by side to form a 1x8 rectangle.

In 6x3, cutting a=6 into 3 and 3, giving two 3x3 rectangles, which can be placed side by side to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

So, in cases where a is even, and perhaps some conditions on b, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 is even, but it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, in 2x1, cutting a=2 into 1 and 1, giving two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

So, in this case, even though a is even, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

So, perhaps just having a even isn't sufficient.

Wait, but in the 2x6 case, a=2 is even, and it's possible.

In 3x2, a=3 is odd, but it's still possible.

Wait, no, a=3 is odd, but in the explanation, it's cut into 1 and 2, which are integers, but 1 and 2 are both integers, so it's allowed.

Wait, but a=3 is odd, and it's cut into 1 and 2, which sum to 3.

Similarly, in 2x2, a=2 even, possible.

In 2x4, a=2 even, possible.

In 6x3, a=6 even, but not possible because the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, so in 6x3, cutting a=6 into 3 and 3, giving two 3x3 rectangles, which can be placed side by side to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

So, in this case, it's not considered a different rectangle.

Similarly, in 2x1, cutting a=2 into 1 and 1, giving two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

So, in cases where the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation, it's "No".

In other cases, where the new rectangle is different, it's "Yes".

So, perhaps the condition is that if b is even, then it's possible to form a different rectangle, except in cases where the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, but in 2x6, b=6 is even, and it's possible.

In 3x2, b=2 is even, and it's possible.

In 2x2, b=2 is even, possible.

In 2x4, b=4 is even, possible.

In 6x3, b=3 is odd, but a=6 is even, but it's "No" because the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, but in the code provided, it only checks if b is even, and if so, outputs "Yes", else "No".

But in the sample input, there's a case where a=6 and b=3, which should be "No", but according to the code, since b=3 is odd, it would output "No", which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in 2x1, b=1 is odd, so "No".

In 2x6, b=6 is even, so "Yes".

In 3x2, b=2 is even, so "Yes".

In 2x2, b=2 is even, so "Yes".

In 2x4, b=4 is even, so "Yes".

In 6x3, b=3 is odd, so "No".

So, the code seems to be correct for the sample inputs.

But is this always true?

Wait, in the 2x1 case, b=1 is odd, so "No", which is correct.

In the 2x2 case, b=2 is even, so "Yes", which matches the sample output.

In the 3x2 case, b=2 is even, "Yes", matches the sample.

In the 2x4 case, b=4 is even, "Yes", matches.

In the 6x3 case, b=3 is odd, "No", matches.

So, it seems to work for the sample inputs.

But is this a general rule?

Does b being even always allow forming a different rectangle?

Wait, consider a=4 and b=2.

Cut along a: cut a=4 into c=1 and a - c=3, giving two rectangles 1x2 and 3x2.

From these, can we form a different rectangle?

If we place them side by side horizontally: max height is 2, total width is 1 + 3 = 4, so 2x4, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Alternatively, place them vertically: height is 2 + 2 = 4, width is max(1, 3) = 3, so 4x3.

Is 4x3 different from 4x2? Yes, so "Yes".

But in the code, b=2 is even, so "Yes", which matches.

Another case: a=4, b=4.

Cut along a: cut a=4 into c=1 and 3, giving two rectangles 1x4 and 3x4.

From these, can form a new rectangle.

Place them horizontally: max height 4, total width 1 + 3 = 4, so 4x4, same as original.

Place them vertically: height 4 + 4 = 8, width max(1,3) = 3, so 8x3, which is different from 4x4.

So, "Yes".

But according to the code, b=4 is even, so "Yes", which is correct.

Another case: a=5, b=2.

Cut along a: cut a=5 into c=1 and 4, giving two rectangles 1x2 and 4x2.

Place them horizontally: max height 2, total width 1 + 4 = 5, so 2x5, same as original.

Place them vertically: height 2 + 2 = 4, width max(1,4)=4, so 4x4, which is different from 2x5.

So, "Yes".

But according to the code, b=2 is even, so "Yes", which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, a is odd, and b is even, and it's "Yes".

Another case: a=3, b=3.

Cut along a: cut a=3 into c=1 and 2, giving two rectangles 1x3 and 2x3.

Place them horizontally: max height 3, total width 1 + 2 = 3, so 3x3, same as original.

Place them vertically: height 3 + 3 = 6, width max(1,2)=2, so 6x2, which is different from 3x3.

So, "Yes".

But according to the code, b=3 is odd, so "No", which is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but in the sample input, a=3 and b=2 gives "Yes", which matches because b=2 is even.

But in this case, a=3 and b=3, b is odd, and according to the code, it should output "No", but in reality, it's possible to form a different rectangle, as shown.

So, the code is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but a=3 and b=3 is not in the sample input.

But according to the problem statement, two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, in the a=3 and b=3 case, original rectangle is 3x3.

After cutting into two 1x3 and 2x3 rectangles, arranging them vertically gives a 6x2 rectangle.

Is 6x2 the same as 3x3 up to rotation? No, because 6x2 rotated is 2x6, which is still not equal to 3x3.

So, it's a different rectangle, so it should be "Yes", but the code would output "No" because b=3 is odd.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, the condition can't just be b is even.

There must be a different condition.

Let me think again.

Perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even.

In the a=3 and b=3 case, both are odd, and it's still possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the a=3 and b=3 case, as I thought earlier, cutting into 1x3 and 2x3, and arranging them vertically to form a 6x2, which is different from 3x3.

So, even when both a and b are odd, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, the condition can't just be b is even.

Perhaps it's that a * b is even, meaning at least one of a or b is even.

But in the a=1 and b=1 case, which is 1x1, which is odd*odd=odd, and it's "No", which matches.

In a=2 and b=1, which is even*odd, "No" according to the sample.

Wait, no, in a=2 and b=1, according to the sample, it's "No".

But according to the condition that a*b is even, it would be "Yes", but in the sample, it's "No".

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps it's more about whether a divides b or something like that.

Wait, in a=2 and b=1, a=2 divides b=1? No, 2 doesn't divide 1.

In a=2 and b=6, 2 divides 6, so "Yes".

In a=3 and b=2, 3 doesn't divide 2, but it's "Yes".

Wait, no, in a=3 and b=2, 3 doesn't divide 2, but it's "Yes".

In a=2 and b=2, 2 divides 2, "Yes".

In a=2 and b=4, 2 divides 4, "Yes".

In a=6 and b=3, 6 divides 3? No, 6 doesn't divide 3, "No".

But in a=3 and b=3, 3 divides 3, which should be "Yes", but according to the code, b=3 is odd, "No", which is incorrect.

So, perhaps it's that a divides b or b divides a.

In a=2 and b=6, 2 divides 6, "Yes".

In a=3 and b=2, 3 doesn't divide 2 and 2 doesn't divide 3, but it's "Yes".

Wait, no, in a=3 and b=2, it's "Yes".

Wait, perhaps it's that gcd(a, b) > 1.

In a=3 and b=2, gcd(3,2)=1, but it's "Yes".

Wait, no, in the sample, a=3 and b=2 is "Yes".

In a=2 and b=1, gcd(2,1)=1, "No".

In a=2 and b=2, gcd(2,2)=2, "Yes".

In a=2 and b=4, gcd(2,4)=2, "Yes".

In a=6 and b=3, gcd(6,3)=3, "Yes", but in the sample, it's "No".

Wait, but in a=6 and b=3, it's "No", but gcd(6,3)=3 >1, which would suggest "Yes", but in reality, it's "No".

So, that can't be it.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle has an aspect ratio that is a rational number, perhaps it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But in the a=3 and b=3 case, it's a square, aspect ratio 1, which is rational, and it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in a=2 and b=1, aspect ratio 2, which is rational, but it's "No".

So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b share any common factors.

But in a=3 and b=2, they don't share common factors, and it's still "Yes".

This is confusing.

Let me think about the condition under which the new rectangle is different from the original one up to rotation.

Suppose after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle has dimensions c and d.

We need c*d = a*b.

And c x d is different from a x b and b x a.

Moreover, the new rectangle must be formable from the two pieces obtained by cutting the original rectangle.

So, perhaps, the number of ways to factor a*b into c and d, where c <= d, and c x d is different from a x b and b x a.

But the problem is to find if there exists at least one such c and d that can be formed from the two pieces.

Given that, perhaps it's equivalent to checking if there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two pieces that can be rearranged into such c and d.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

Let g = gcd(a, b).

Then, a = g * m, b = g * n, where m and n are coprime.

Now, the original rectangle is g*m x g*n.

After cutting, we have two smaller rectangles, say c x b and (a - c) x b.

In terms of m and n, c = k * g for some integer k.

Then, c x b = k*g x g*n.

After rotating, it could be g*n x k*g.

Similarly, (a - c) x b = (m*g - k*g) x g*n = (m - k)*g x g*n.

After rotating, it could be g*n x (m - k)*g.

Now, arranging these two pieces to form a new rectangle:

Option 1: place them horizontally adjacent.

Then, the new rectangle would have height max(g*n, g*n) = g*n, and width k*g + (m - k)*g = m*g.

So, g*n x m*g, which is the same as the original rectangle up to rotation.

Option 2: place them vertically adjacent.

Then, the new rectangle would have height g*n + g*n = 2*g*n, and width max(k*g, (m - k)*g).

So, 2*g*n x max(k*g, (m - k)*g).

For this to be different from the original rectangle up to rotation, we need 2*g*n x max(k*g, (m - k)*g) not to be equal to g*m x g*n or g*n x g*m.

So, we need to check if 2*g*n x max(k*g, (m - k)*g) is different from g*m x g*n.

Given that m and n are coprime, and g is the GCD of a and b.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the number of ways to tile the new rectangle with the two given pieces.

But this seems too broad.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the possible perimeters of the new rectangle.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is even.

In the sample inputs, it seems that if b is even, it's "Yes", except in cases like a=6 and b=3, which is "No".

But in a=6 and b=3, a is even, but b is odd, and it's "No".

Wait, but in the code, it only checks if b is even.

So, perhaps it's sufficient to check if b is even.

But as I saw in the a=3 and b=3 case, which should be "Yes", but b is odd, so the code would output "No", which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, a=3 and b=2 is "Yes", which matches b even.

a=6 and b=3 is "No", b odd.

a=2 and b=1 is "No", b odd.

a=2 and b=2 is "Yes", b even.

a=2 and b=4 is "Yes", b even.

a=2 and b=6 is "Yes", b even.

a=1 and b=1 is "No", b odd.

So, in the sample inputs, it seems to match, but in the a=3 and b=3 case, which is not in the sample input, it would be incorrect.

But maybe the problem guarantees that a and b are not both odd, or something like that.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify any such thing.

a and b can be any integers from 1 to 10^9.

So, I need a general solution.

Perhaps the condition is that a or b is even.

In the a=3 and b=2 case, a is odd, b is even, "Yes".

In a=2 and b=1, a is even, b is odd, "No".

In a=3 and b=3, both odd, but according to earlier reasoning, it's "Yes".

Wait, but in a=3 and b=3, both odd, it's "Yes", because we can form a 6x2 rectangle, which is different from 3x3.

So, perhaps if at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except in cases like a=2 and b=1.

Wait, but in a=2 and b=1, at least one is even, but it's "No".

Wait, no, a=2 is even, b=1 is odd, but in the sample input, it's "No".

So, the condition can't be "at least one of a or b is even".

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a*b is even, but in a=2 and b=1, a*b=2 is even, but it's "No".

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe it's that a*b is divisible by 4.

In a=2 and b=1, a*b=2, not divisible by 4, "No".

In a=2 and b=2, a*b=4, divisible by 4, "Yes".

In a=3 and b=2, a*b=6, divisible by 2, but not by 4, but it's "Yes".

Wait, no, 6 is divisible by 2, but not by 4.

But in the sample, it's "Yes".

Wait, but in a=3 and b=2, a*b=6, which is divisible by 2, but not by 4, and it's "Yes".

In a=2 and b=1, a*b=
