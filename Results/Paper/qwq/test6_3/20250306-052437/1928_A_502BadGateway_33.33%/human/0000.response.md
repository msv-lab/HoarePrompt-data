Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, or if he's just wasting his time.

First, I need to understand the process step by step. Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes a cut parallel to one of its sides, so he could cut either along the length or the width. Let's consider both options.

If he cuts parallel to the width (along the length), he would be dividing the length a into two parts, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the length (along the width), he divides b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

After the cut, he has two smaller rectangles. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. He can rotate and move them as he wishes, but the new rectangle must have integer sides.

The problem states that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, for example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle.

The task is to determine, for given a and b, whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the original one through this process.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For a 1x1 rectangle, it can't be cut into two smaller rectangles because either a or b would have to be at least 2 to make a cut.

- For a 2x1 rectangle, cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same.

- For a 2x6 rectangle, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- For a 3x2 rectangle, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, considered different from the original.

- For a 2x2 rectangle, cutting it into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, different from the original.

- For a 2x4 rectangle, it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, considered the same as 2x4, or perhaps other configurations.

- For a 6x3 rectangle, cutting it might not lead to a different rectangle.

From these examples, it seems like the key is to see if, after cutting, the two pieces can be rearranged to form a rectangle that is not the same as the original one under rotation.

I need to generalize this for any a and b.

Let's think about the cutting process more carefully.

Case 1: Cutting parallel to the width (dividing length a).

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two parts along the length, so he gets two rectangles of size a1 x b and a2 x b, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, he can arrange these two rectangles in two ways:

- Place them side by side along the width, forming a rectangle of size (a1 + a2) x b, which is the same as the original a x b.

- Place them side by side along the length, forming a rectangle of size max(a1, a2) x (b + b), assuming they are placed vertically.

Wait, no. If he places them side by side along the length, he would have to align them in a way that their dimensions match.

Actually, when arranging two rectangles to form a new one, the new rectangle's area must be the same as the sum of the areas of the two pieces, which is a x b.

So, the area of the new rectangle should be a x b.

Moreover, since he can rotate the pieces, each piece can be rotated by 90 degrees if needed.

So, for each piece, its dimensions can be either as they are or rotated.

Let's consider the pieces after cutting.

If Bob cuts parallel to the width, he gets two rectangles of size a x b1 and a x b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the length, he gets two rectangles of size a1 x b and a2 x b, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, from these two pieces, he can form a new rectangle by arranging them in different ways.

Given that he can rotate the pieces, each piece can be in two orientations: original or rotated.

So, for two pieces, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible orientation combinations.

Then, he needs to arrange them to form a rectangle of area a x b, with integer side lengths.

Moreover, two rectangles are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotation.

So, I need to check if there exists a way to arrange the two pieces, possibly rotating them, to form a rectangle that is not the same as the original one under rotation.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

Then, he has two rectangles, say R1 and R2, with integer dimensions.

He wants to arrange R1 and R2 to form a new rectangle, say R', with integer dimensions, such that R' is not the same as the original rectangle under rotation.

Given that R1 and R2 must fit together perfectly to form R', their combined area is a x b.

So, the area of R' is a x b, and its dimensions must be integers.

Moreover, since rotations are considered the same, I need to consider the canonical form of the rectangle, say with the smaller side first.

For example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle.

So, to compare rectangles, I can represent them as (min(w, h)), max(w, h)), where w and h are the width and height.

Then, two rectangles are the same if their (min, max) pairs are equal.

Given that, I need to check if there exists a way to arrange R1 and R2, possibly rotating them, to form a rectangle R' such that the (min, max) pair of R' is different from that of the original rectangle.

Now, to make this feasible, I need to find a condition based on a and b that determines whether such a R' exists.

Looking back at the examples:

- For 1x1: can't be cut.

- For 2x1: cutting results in two 1x1, which can only form 1x2 (same as 2x1).

- For 2x6: cutting into two 2x3, which can be arranged to form 4x3 (different from 2x6).

- For 3x2: cutting into two 3x1, which can be arranged to form 1x6 (same as 6x1, which is different from 3x2).

- For 2x2: cutting into two 1x2, which can be arranged to form 1x4 (same as 4x1, different from 2x2).

- For 2x4: cutting into two 2x2, which can be arranged to form 4x2 (same as 2x4), or perhaps 1x8 or something else.

Wait, 2x4 cut into two 2x2's, which can be arranged to form 4x2 (same as original), or 1x8 (if arranged in a line), but 1x8 is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, it seems possible to form a different rectangle.

- For 6x3: cutting into two 6x1.5, but since dimensions are integers, it would be two 6x1's or 6x2's, but 1.5 is not integer, so perhaps cutting into two 3x3's or something else. Wait, dimensions are integers, so cutting parallel to the width, say into two 3x3's, which can be arranged to form 3x6 (same as original), or 9x2, but 9x2 is different from 6x3.

But in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No", so perhaps my reasoning is incorrect here.

Wait, maybe I need to consider only cuts that result in integer dimensions.

So, when cutting, both resulting rectangles must have integer dimensions.

Given that, for 6x3, if Bob cuts parallel to the width, he can cut a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = 6, and both a1 and a2 are integers.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the height, he can cut b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = 3, and both are integers.

Then, he has two rectangles, say from cutting a: two 3x3 rectangles.

Then, arranging them, he can place them side by side along the width to form a 6x3 (same as original), or place them side by side along the height to form a 3x6 (same as original under rotation).

Alternatively, if he rotates one or both, he might get different configurations.

But in this case, it seems like any arrangement results in a rectangle that is the same as the original under rotation.

Hence, for 6x3, the answer is "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No", which matches this reasoning.

Similarly, for 2x4:

- Cutting parallel to width: say into two 2x2's.

- Arranging them: side by side along width forms 4x2 (same as original under rotation).

- Side by side along height forms 2x4 (same as original).

- If he rotates one of them, say one 2x2 rotated to 2x2, still the same.

- Wait, 2x2 rotated is still 2x2.

- So, seems like he can't form a different rectangle from 2x4.

But in the sample input, for 2x4, the output is "Yes", which contradicts my current reasoning.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there are multiple ways to cut the rectangle.

For 2x4:

- Cutting parallel to width (dividing a=2): possible cuts are 1x4 and 1x4.

- Then, arranging two 1x4 rectangles: placing them side by side along width forms 2x4 (original).

- Placing them side by side along height forms 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

- So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, the answer is "Yes".

I must have misread the sample input earlier.

So, for 6x3:

- Cutting parallel to width: say into 3x3 and 3x3.

- Arranging them: side by side along width forms 6x3 (original).

- Side by side along height forms 3x6 (same as original under rotation).

- Rotating one of them doesn't change anything, as 3x3 rotated is still 3x3.

- Hence, no different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but 3x3 is a square, so rotating doesn't change its dimensions.

Hence, for 6x3, it's "No".

For 2x4:

- Cutting parallel to width into 1x4 and 1x4.

- Arranging them side by side along height forms 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

- Hence, "Yes".

So, in this case, the possibility depends on whether after cutting, the two pieces can be arranged to form a rectangle with dimensions different from the original under rotation.

Now, to generalize this for any a and b.

I need to find a condition based on a and b that determines if such a rearrangement is possible.

Let's consider that after cutting, the two pieces will have dimensions that allow forming a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let's think about the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a x b.

The new rectangle must have the same area, so its dimensions must be such that their product is a x b.

Moreover, the new rectangle should not be the same as the original one under rotation, meaning that the sorted dimensions should be different from the sorted original dimensions.

So, let me define the original rectangle as (min(a,b), max(a,b)).

I need to check if there exists another pair (w, h), where w <= h, w x h = a x b, and (w, h) != (min(a,b), max(a,b)).

If such a pair exists, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

But, there's a catch: not all such pairs are achievable by arranging the two pieces obtained from a single cut.

Because, after cutting, the two pieces have specific dimensions, and arranging them to form a new rectangle imposes constraints on what dimensions are possible.

So, I need to consider what dimensions can be achieved by arranging the two pieces.

Let's consider the two possible ways to cut the rectangle: parallel to the width or parallel to the height.

Case 1: Cutting parallel to the width.

- This means dividing the length a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

- The two pieces are a1 x b and a2 x b.

- Now, to arrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle, we can place them side by side along the width or along the height.

- If placed side by side along the width, the new rectangle would have dimensions (a1 + a2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- If placed side by side along the height, the new rectangle would have dimensions max(a1, a2) x 2b.

- Wait, no. If placed side by side along the height, the height would be b, and the width would be a1 + a2 = a, which is again the same as the original.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, if placing them side by side along the height, the new rectangle would have dimensions (a1 + a2) x b, which is again a x b.

Alternatively, perhaps arranging them in different orientations.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that each piece can be rotated by 90 degrees.

So, each piece can be either in its original orientation or rotated.

Therefore, for each piece, there are two possibilities: original or rotated.

Thus, for two pieces, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible combinations of orientations.

Now, let's consider the dimensions of each piece in both orientations:

- Original: a1 x b and a2 x b.

- Rotated: b x a1 and b x a2.

Wait, no. If a piece is a1 x b, rotated it becomes b x a1.

Similarly, a2 x b rotated is b x a2.

So, the possible ways to arrange the two pieces are:

1. Both in original orientation:

- Place them side by side along the width: (a1 + a2) x b = a x b (same as original).

- Place them side by side along the height: max(a1, a2) x 2b.

Wait, but for them to be placed side by side along the height, their widths must match.

Wait, no, when placing them side by side along the height, their heights must match.

So, if both are in original orientation, their heights are b, so placing them side by side along the height would require that their widths add up.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two rectangles: R1 and R2, with dimensions w1 x h1 and w2 x h2.

I can rotate them, so effectively, their dimensions can be either w1 x h1 or h1 x w1, and similarly for R2.

Now, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange them such that their sides align properly.

There are a few ways to arrange two rectangles:

1. Place them side by side along their widths.

2. Place them one above the other along their heights.

3. Other configurations, but these are the basic ones.

Given that, and that rotations are allowed, I need to find if there's a way to arrange the two pieces to form a rectangle with dimensions different from the original under rotation.

This seems too vague. Maybe there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

Wait, perhaps not directly related.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider if a and b share any common factors.

Wait, let's consider the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle has an aspect ratio that cannot be achieved by any other combination of the pieces, then it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

From the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking at these, I see that for rectangles where either a or b is even, it seems possible to form a different rectangle, except for some cases like 6x3.

Wait, 6x3: a=6 is even, but the answer is "No".

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's more about whether both a and b are even.

But 2x1: a=2 is even, but "No".

2x6: a=2 even, "Yes".

3x2: a=3 odd, but "Yes" (since b=2 is even).

6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's about whether both a and b are odd.

If both are odd, then "No"; otherwise, "Yes".

But 1x1: both odd, "No".

2x1: one even, one odd, "No".

2x6: both even, "Yes".

3x2: one odd, one even, "Yes".

6x3: one even, one odd, "No".

Wait, this doesn't hold for all cases.

So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

Alternative approach: think about the number of ways to factorize a x b.

The area is a x b.

The number of possible rectangles with area a x b is the number of divisors of a x b.

But, since rotations are considered the same, we need to consider only rectangles where width <= height.

So, the number of such rectangles is the number of divisors of a x b that are <= sqrt(a x b).

Now, among these, one of them is the original rectangle (min(a,b), max(a,b)).

If there exists at least one other rectangle with area a x b that is different from the original one, then the answer is "Yes".

But, the question is whether Bob can obtain such a rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

So, it's not just about the existence of another rectangle with the same area, but whether it can be formed from the two pieces obtained from a single cut.

Hence, I need to relate the possible arrangements of the two pieces to the possible rectangles with area a x b.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two pieces have dimensions that must be compatible to form a new rectangle.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two pieces, say R1 and R2, with areas area1 and area2, where area1 + area2 = a x b.

But, in our case, since the cuts are parallel to one side, the pieces have integer dimensions and their areas are a x b1 and a x b2, where b1 + b2 = b, or similarly, b x a1 and b x a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, to form a new rectangle, the two pieces must be arranged in such a way that their sides match.

Let me consider that the new rectangle has width w and height h, with w x h = a x b.

Now, the two pieces must fit into this new rectangle.

Given that, their dimensions must be compatible with the new rectangle's dimensions.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider specific arrangements.

Let's consider that one piece is placed adjacent to the other along one side.

Then, the new rectangle's dimensions would be determined by the combined dimensions.

But this is getting too abstract.

Perhaps there's a simpler way to look at this.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two pieces have dimensions that are factors of the area, and their arrangement must form a rectangle with dimensions that are also factors of the area.

Given that, perhaps the key is to see if the area has more than one unique pair of factors (w, h) where w <= h.

If it has only one such pair, then the answer is "No"; otherwise, "Yes".

But, this doesn't take into account the cutting constraint.

Wait, perhaps the cutting constraint doesn't matter, and it's just about whether there exists another rectangle with the same area that is different from the original one under rotation.

But, the sample inputs suggest that for some cases where such a rectangle exists, it's still "No".

For example, 6x3: area is 18, possible rectangles are 1x18, 2x9, 3x6.

Among these, (3,6) is the same as the original, so the other options are (1,18) and (2,9), which are different.

However, in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No", meaning that even though there are other rectangles with the same area, it's not possible to form them by cutting and rearranging the pieces from a single cut.

Hence, the cutting constraint is crucial.

So, perhaps the condition is that if either a or b is even, then it's possible to form a different rectangle, except for some specific cases.
