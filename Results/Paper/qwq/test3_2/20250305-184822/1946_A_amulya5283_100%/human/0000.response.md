Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase its median. An operation is defined as choosing an element in the array and increasing it by 1.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle element in a sorted version of the array. For an array of length n, the median is at position ceil(n/2). For example, if n is 5, the median is at position 3 (1-based index); if n is 4, it's at position 2.

The task is to increase the median value by performing the least number of operations. An operation allows me to pick any element and increment it by 1.

I need to think about how increasing elements affects the median. Since the median is the middle value when the array is sorted, increasing elements could potentially change the sorted order and thus the median.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

2 2 8

Current median is 2 (sorted array: 2, 2, 8; median at position ceil(3/2)=2 is 2).

I need to increase the median to a value greater than 2. Let's say I increase a_1 from 2 to 3. Now the array is [3, 2, 8], sorted as [2, 3, 8], median is 3, which is greater than 2. It took only one operation.

So, in this case, the minimum number of operations is 1.

Example 2:

Input:

4

7 3 3 1

Sorted: [1, 3, 3, 7], median at ceil(4/2)=2 is 3.

I need to increase the median above 3. Let's say I increase a_1 from 7 to 9. Array becomes [9, 3, 3, 1], sorted [1, 3, 3, 9], median is still 3.

That didn't help. I need to increase one of the elements that contribute to the median.

Wait, in this array, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements in the sorted array. But according to the problem, the median is defined as the element at position ceil(k/2) in the sorted array, where k is the number of elements.

In this case, for n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, so the median is the 2nd element in the sorted array, which is 3.

To increase the median, I need to make the 2nd element in the sorted array greater than 3.

For example, if I increase a_2 from 3 to 4, array becomes [7, 4, 3, 1], sorted [1, 3, 4, 7], median is 4, which is greater than 3. That took one operation.

But according to the sample input, for n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], the output is 2. So maybe my understanding is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that multiple elements need to be increased to ensure the median increases.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

8

3

2 2 8

4

7 3 3 1

1

1000000000

5

5 5 5 4 5

6

2 1 2 3 1 4

2

1 2

2

1 1

4

5 5 5 5

Sample Output:

1

2

1

3

2

1

2

3

So, for the first test case, n=3, a=[2,2,8], output=1.

I already saw that increasing one element to 3 works.

For the second test case, n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], output=2.

Wait, earlier I thought increasing one element to 4 would suffice, but the sample output is 2. So perhaps I need to increase more elements.

Wait, maybe I need to make sure that the median is strictly greater than its current value, and perhaps multiple elements need to be increased.

Let me think differently.

Let's sort the array and focus on the median position.

For n elements, the median is at position m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (0-based index).

To increase the median, I need to make sure that the element at position m is increased.

But simply increasing that one element might not be enough, because increasing it could cause other elements to shift in the sorted order.

Wait, no. If I increase the element at position m, it could potentially change the sorted order.

Actually, to minimize operations, I should focus on the elements from position m to the end.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that at least one element from the second half is increased.

Wait, maybe I need to consider how many elements are equal to the current median.

If multiple elements are equal to the median, I might need to increase some of them to push the median up.

Let me consider the array sorted.

For example, in the first sample, n=3, a=[2,2,8], sorted as [2,2,8], median is 2.

To make the median greater than 2, I need to make sure that the element at position 2 (0-based) is greater than 2.

But in this case, position m=1 (since ceil(3/2)=2, 0-based index 1), which is 2.

So, I need to make a[1] > 2.

I can increase a[1] from 2 to 3, which would make the sorted array [2,3,8], median is 3.

But in the first sample, the output is 1, which matches.

In the second sample, n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], sorted [1,3,3,7], median is 3.

To make the median greater than 3, I need to make the element at position ceil(4/2)=2, which is a[1]=3 in 0-based indexing, greater than 3.

But in this case, increasing one element to 4 doesn't change the median to 4, because the sorted array would be [1,3,4,7], median is still 3 (since it's the second element).

Wait, no, in the sorted array [1,3,4,7], the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements, which is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, but according to the problem, the median is defined as the element at position ceil(k/2), which for k=4 is position 2 (0-based index 1), which is 3.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2 operations.

So perhaps I need to increase the median element and possibly others to ensure the median increases.

Wait, maybe I need to make sure that the median element is increased above its current value, and if there are multiple elements equal to the median, I need to increase enough of them to achieve that.

Let me look at another sample.

n=1, a=[1000000000], median is 1000000000.

To increase the median, I need to make it greater than 1000000000, so I need to increase a[0] by at least 1, making it 1000000001. So, 1 operation.

That matches the sample output.

Another sample:

n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To increase the median, I need to make it greater than 5.

Let's say I increase a[0] from 4 to 6, array becomes [6,5,5,5,5], sorted [5,5,5,5,6], median is still 5.

That didn't help.

I need to increase the median element, which is at position 2 (0-based), which is already 5.

To make it greater than 5, I need to increase a[2] to 6, but that would make the sorted array [5,5,6,5,6], which is [5,5,5,6,6], median is 5 again.

Wait, that's not working.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase multiple elements to ensure the median increases.

If I increase a[2] and a[3] to 6, array becomes [5,5,6,6,5], sorted [5,5,5,6,6], median is 5.

Still not enough.

If I increase a[2], a[3], and a[4] to 6, array becomes [5,5,6,6,6], sorted [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6, which is greater than 5.

That took 3 operations, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, I needed to increase three elements to make the median increase.

Wait, but why three? Because the median is the third element in the sorted array, and to make it greater than 5, I need to make sure that the third element is at least 6.

But in this array, the third element is 5, so I need to increase it to 6, but since there are multiple 5s, I need to increase enough elements to push the third element to 6.

In this case, increasing a[2], a[3], and a[4] achieves that.

Wait, but a[2] is already 5, so increasing it to 6 would make the sorted array [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

But why did I think that increasing only a[2] to 6 would not work? Actually, in that case, the sorted array would be [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated earlier.

If I only increase a[2] to 6, array becomes [5,5,6,5,5], sorted [5,5,5,6,6], median is 5, which is not greater than 5.

Wait, so I need to increase at least two elements to 6 to make the median 6.

Wait, no, in this case, increasing a[2] and a[3] to 6, array becomes [5,5,6,6,5], sorted [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

So, only two operations are needed, but the sample output is 3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says that they increased a[1], a[2], and a[3] to 6, making the array [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

That's three operations.

But I thought increasing a[2] and a[3] to 6 would suffice, with only two operations, making the array [5,5,6,6,5], sorted [5,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Why does the sample say it takes three operations?

Wait, maybe because in the sample, they chose to increase different elements.

But according to my logic, two operations should suffice.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the median is strictly greater than its current value, and in some cases, more operations are needed.

Let me check another sample.

n=6, a=[2,1,2,3,1,4], sorted [1,1,2,2,3,4], median is 2.

To increase the median above 2, I need to make the 3rd element in the sorted array greater than 2.

If I increase a[0] and a[2] to 3, array becomes [3,1,3,3,1,4], sorted [1,1,3,3,3,4], median is 3, which is greater than 2.

That's two operations, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, two operations suffice.

Wait, but earlier in n=5, according to my reasoning, two operations should suffice, but the sample output is three.

I must be missing something.

Let me look at the code provided.

def func():

t = int(input())

while t > 0:

t -= 1

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

if n == 1:

print(1)

else:

res = 0

mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1

for i in range(mdx, n):

if a[mdx] == a[i]:

res += 1

print(res)

So, the code sorts the array, finds the median index mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1.

Then, it counts how many elements from mdx to the end have the same value as a[mdx].

Wait, in the first sample with n=3, a=[2,2,8], sorted [2,2,8], mdx = 3//2 + 3%2 -1 = 1 +1 -1 =1, a[1]=2.

It counts how many elements from a[1] to a[2] are equal to 2, which is two elements (a[1]=2 and a[2]=8 is not 2, so res=1).

But in the first sample, the output is 1, which matches.

In the second sample, n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], sorted [1,3,3,7], mdx=4//2 +4%2 -1=2 +0 -1=1, a[1]=3.

It counts how many elements from a[1] to a[3] are equal to 3, which are a[1]=3 and a[2]=3, so res=2, matching the sample output.

In the third sample, n=1, a=[1000000000], mdx=1//2 +1%2 -1=0 +1 -1=0, a[0]=1000000000.

It counts how many elements from a[0] to a[0] are equal to 1000000000, which is one, matching the sample output.

In the fourth sample, n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], mdx=5//2 +5%2 -1=2 +1 -1=2, a[2]=5.

It counts how many elements from a[2] to a[4] are equal to 5, which are a[2]=5, a[3]=5, a[4]=5, so res=3, matching the sample output.

In the fifth sample, n=6, a=[2,1,2,3,1,4], sorted [1,1,2,2,3,4], mdx=6//2 +6%2 -1=3 +0 -1=2, a[2]=2.

It counts how many elements from a[2] to a[5] are equal to 2, which are a[2]=2 and a[3]=2, so res=2, matching the sample output.

In the sixth sample, n=2, a=[1,2], sorted [1,2], mdx=2//2 +2%2 -1=1 +0 -1=0, a[0]=1.

It counts how many elements from a[0] to a[1] are equal to 1, which is a[0]=1, so res=1, matching the sample output.

In the seventh sample, n=2, a=[1,1], sorted [1,1], mdx=2//2 +2%2 -1=1 +0 -1=0, a[0]=1.

It counts how many elements from a[0] to a[1] are equal to 1, which are a[0]=1 and a[1]=1, so res=2, matching the sample output.

In the eighth sample, n=4, a=[5,5,5,5], sorted [5,5,5,5], mdx=4//2 +4%2 -1=2 +0 -1=1, a[1]=5.

It counts how many elements from a[1] to a[3] are equal to 5, which are a[1]=5, a[2]=5, a[3]=5, so res=3, matching the sample output.

So, in all the sample cases, this code produces the correct output.

But earlier, when I tried to reason about the minimum operations needed, I thought that sometimes fewer operations might suffice, but according to the code, it's counting the number of elements from the median position to the end that are equal to the median value.

Wait, perhaps that's the minimal number of operations required.

Let me think about why this would be the case.

If I have the sorted array, and I want to increase the median, I need to make sure that the median value is increased.

To do that, I need to increase some of the elements from the median position to the end.

Each operation can increase one element by 1.

So, if multiple elements are equal to the median, I need to increase enough of them to make the median value increase.

In the fourth sample, n=5, a=[4,5,5,5,5], mdx=2, a[2]=5.

To make the median greater than 5, I need to make a[2] >5.

If I increase a[2] by 1, it becomes 6, and the sorted array becomes [4,5,6,5,5], which after sorting is [4,5,5,5,6], median is 5, which is not greater than 5.

So, increasing a[2] to 6 isn't enough because it gets rearranged in the sorted array.

Wait, in this case, if I increase a[2] to 6, the array becomes [4,5,6,5,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,6], median is 5.

So, that didn't work.

I need to make sure that after increasing, the median is greater than 5.

So, perhaps I need to increase multiple elements to ensure that the median increases.

In the sample, they increased a[0], a[1], a[2] to 6, making the array [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

That worked with three operations.

But earlier, I thought that increasing a[2] and a[3] would suffice, but in that case, a[2] to 6 and a[3] to 6, array becomes [4,5,6,6,5], sorted [4,5,5,6,6], median is 5, which is not greater than 5.

So, that approach fails.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase enough elements to ensure that the median value is increased.

In the sorted array, to make the median greater than its current value, I need to make sure that the median element is increased above the current median value.

But because the array is sorted, increasing one element might not be sufficient if other elements can move around in the sorted order.

Given that, perhaps the code's approach of counting the number of elements from the median position to the end that are equal to the median value is correct.

In the fourth sample, a=[4,5,5,5,5], mdx=2, a[2]=5.

There are three elements from a[2] to a[4] that are equal to 5.

So, res=3.

According to the code, it would output 3, which matches the sample.

In my earlier attempt, I thought that increasing two elements would suffice, but it seems that in practice, three operations are needed.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Let me think about why counting the number of elements from the median position to the end that are equal to the median value gives the minimal number of operations.

Suppose the sorted array is [a1, a2, ..., am, ..., an], with am being the median.

To make the median greater than am, we need am' > am, where am' is the new median after operations.

Each operation increases one element by 1.

To increase am, we need to make sure that am is increased, but since we can choose which elements to increase, we need to strategically choose which elements to increase to minimize the number of operations.

However, because the array is sorted, increasing an element before am could potentially affect the sorted order.

But in the code's approach, it seems to focus on the elements from am to the end that are equal to am.

By counting how many elements from am to the end are equal to am, it's determining how many elements need to be increased to make am' > am.

In other words, to make am' > am, we need to increase at least some of these elements to a value greater than am.

The minimal number of operations would be equal to the number of elements from am to the end that are equal to am, because increasing each of these elements by 1 operation makes them am+1, thus making the median am+1.

Wait, but in the fourth sample, am=5, and there are three elements from a2 to a4 that are equal to 5.

So, increasing each of these three elements by 1 makes them 6, and the sorted array becomes [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

Thus, it takes three operations.

In my earlier attempt, I tried increasing only two elements, but that didn't work because the sorted order could rearrange the elements in a way that the median doesn't increase.

Therefore, the code's approach seems correct.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
