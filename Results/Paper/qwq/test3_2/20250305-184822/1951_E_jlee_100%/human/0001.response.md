Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string such that none of the parts is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts, and then the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

First test case:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

So, the entire string is not a palindrome, so partitioning it into a single substring works.

Second test case:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

Here, every possible substring is a palindrome because all characters are 'l'. So, no valid partition exists.

Third test case:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

So, partitioning into three substrings: "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

Looking at this, I need to find a way to split the string such that no part is a palindrome. If the whole string is not a palindrome, I can just take it as a single part. If it is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, if all possible substrings are palindromes, like in the second test case, then it's impossible, and I should output "NO".

So, the key is to check if the string can be split into one or more substrings, none of which are palindromes.

I need to think about the conditions under which such a partition is possible.

First, if the entire string is not a palindrome, then I can just take it as a single substring, and I'm done.

If the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to split it into smaller parts. But, if all possible splits result in at least one palindrome, then it's impossible.

Wait, but in the third test case, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome itself, but it can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, even if the whole string is a palindrome, it's possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

But in the second test case, "lllllllll", every possible substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible.

Therefore, I need to find a way to determine whether it's possible to partition the string such that no substring is a palindrome.

One approach could be to check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome. If there is at least one such substring, then I can partition the string in a way that includes this substring, and possibly other substrings that are not palindromes.

But, wait, that might not be sufficient. I need to ensure that all substrings in the partition are not palindromes.

Another way is to try to split the string at positions where splitting would result in non-palindrome substrings.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for a string to not be a palindrome, there must be at least one position where the character doesn't match its corresponding character from the end.

For example, in "abba", a[0] == a[3] and a[1] == a[2], so it's a palindrome.

In "abcd", a[0] != a[3] or a[1] != a[2], so it's not a palindrome.

So, to check if a string is a palindrome, I can compare characters symmetrically from the ends towards the center.

Now, for the partitioning, I need to split the string into substrings where none of them satisfy this palindrome property.

One strategy could be to find the longest possible substring that is not a palindrome, and use that as one part, and then recursively apply the same strategy to the remaining parts.

But that might not always be efficient, especially considering the constraints on time and space.

Given that the sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases can be up to 10^6, I need an efficient solution, preferably linear time per string.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, then I can output it as a single substring.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to split it into smaller parts. In this case, I can try to split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- But, I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

- If I can find a split where neither part is a palindrome, then I can output those two parts.

- If I can't find such a split, then I need to try splitting into more parts.

- However, in the worst case, I might need to split the string into individual characters, but that's only acceptable if single characters are considered not to be palindromes.

Wait, but the problem states that single characters are palindromes, as per the example where "a" is a palindrome.

Therefore, single characters are palindromes, so splitting into single characters won't work.

So, I need to split into substrings of length at least 2, and ensure that none of them are palindromes.

Wait, but in the first test case, "sinktheyacht" is a single substring of length 12, which is not a palindrome.

In the third test case, substrings of lengths 2, 3, and 4 are used, none of which are palindromes.

So, I need to ensure that all substrings in the partition have length at least 2 and are not palindromes.

But, wait, the problem allows substrings of length 1, but as we've seen, single characters are palindromes, so they don't satisfy the condition.

Therefore, I need to partition the string into substrings of length at least 2, none of which are palindromes.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a minimum length for the substrings, except that they must not be palindromes.

However, single characters are palindromes, so substrings must be of length at least 2.

But in the first test case, the entire string is of length 12, which is greater than 2, and not a palindrome.

So, perhaps the rule is that as long as the substring is not a palindrome, its length doesn't matter, except that single characters are palindromes.

Wait, but in the third test case, there are substrings of length 2 and 3.

So, substrings can be of any length as long as they are not palindromes.

But single characters are palindromes, so substrings must be of length at least 2.

Wait, no, the problem allows substrings of any length, including 1, but substrings of length 1 are palindromes, which are invalid for this problem.

Therefore, I need to partition the string into substrings of length at least 1, but ensure that none of them are palindromes.

But single characters are palindromes, so effectively, I need to partition the string into substrings of length at least 2, and ensure that these substrings are not palindromes.

Wait, but in the first test case, the entire string is taken as one substring of length 12, which is not a palindrome.

In the third test case, substrings of lengths 2, 3, and 4 are used.

So, the substrings can be of any length greater than or equal to 2, as long as they are not palindromes.

Therefore, I need to partition the string into substrings of length at least 2, and none of them are palindromes.

But, in the second test case, "lllllllll", any substring of length 2 or more consists of 'l's, which are palindromes.

Hence, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, the general approach could be:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output it as a single substring.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- If one or both parts are palindromes, try splitting differently.

- If no such split is possible, output "NO".

But, this seems a bit naive. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes in this context.

If a string is a palindrome, then any split that results in at least one non-palindrome substring could be considered.

Wait, but I need all substrings in the partition to be non-palindromes.

So, for a string that is a palindrome, I need to find a way to split it such that neither part is a palindrome.

If that's not possible, then I need to try splitting into more parts.

But, in the case where all possible splits result in at least one palindrome, then it's impossible.

For example, in "lllllllll", any split will result in substrings that are palindromes, since all characters are 'l'.

Hence, "NO".

In "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome, but can be split into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

So, I need a way to determine if a string can be split into non-palindrome substrings.

One way to approach this is to try to split the string at positions where splitting would result in at least one non-palindrome substring.

But, this seems too vague.

Maybe I can think recursively.

Define a function that checks if a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

Base cases:

- If the string is empty, it's considered successfully partitioned (empty partition).

- If the string has length 1, it's a palindrome, so it cannot be partitioned.

- If the string has length 2 and the two characters are different, it's a non-palindrome, so it can be partitioned as itself.

- If the string has length 2 and the two characters are the same, it's a palindrome, so it cannot be partitioned.

For longer strings, try splitting after each possible position and check if both parts can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

But this recursive approach might be too slow for the constraints, as t can be up to 10^4 and |s| up to 10^6 in total.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me think about the minimal substring that is not a palindrome.

A substring of length 2 where the two characters are different is the smallest non-palindrome.

So, if I can find such a substring, I can use it as a building block.

In other words, if there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[i+1], then I can split the string into substrings that include such positions.

This might be a key observation.

Let me consider that.

If there exists at least one position where two consecutive characters are different, then I can partition the string into substrings that include these positions, making sure that each substring contains at least one such pair, thus ensuring that no substring is a palindrome.

On the other hand, if all consecutive characters are the same, then every substring of length 2 or more is a palindrome, and hence, it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in the third test case, "uwuowouwu", there are positions where consecutive characters are the same, like "uu", but still, it can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but "uwuowouwu" has "uw" where 'u' != 'w', so it has such positions.

Wait, but in "lllllllll", all consecutive characters are the same, and it cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings; otherwise, it's impossible.

Is this always true?

Let's see.

Suppose the string has at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1].

Can I always partition the string into non-palindrome substrings in this case?

Let's consider an example.

Take "abba".

Here, s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b', s[2] = 'b', s[3] = 'a'.

So, s[0] != s[1], s[1] == s[2], s[2] == s[3].

So, there is at least one position where consecutive characters are different.

If I split after the first 'b', I get "abb" and "a".

But "abb" is not a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

So, in this case, I need to find a different split.

If I split after the first 'a', I get "a" and "bba".

"a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

If I split after "ab", I get "ab" and "ba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, this partition works.

Hence, if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], I can try to split the string in a way that each substring contains such a pair.

In the above example, splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

Another way is to split into "abb" and "a", but "a" is invalid.

So, I need to ensure that no substring is a palindrome.

Hence, in this case, splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

Another example: "abc".

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b', s[2] = 'c'.

s[0] != s[1], s[1] != s[2].

So, possible splits:

- "a", "bc" -> "a" is palindrome, invalid.

- "ab", "c" -> "c" is palindrome, invalid.

- "abc" -> "abc" is not palindrome, valid.

So, in this case, partitioning into "abc" works.

Alternatively, "ab" and "c" would be invalid because "c" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into the entire string works.

Another example: "aaabaaa".

s = a a a b a a a

Positions where s[i] != s[i+1]: between s[3] and s[4] ('b' != 'a').

So, I can try to split after s[3], getting "aaaa" and "baaa".

"aaaa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, split after s[2], getting "aaa" and "baaaa".

"aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Split after s[4], getting "aaaab" and "aaa".

"aaaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

So, in this case, I need to find a different split.

If I split after s[3] and s[4], getting "aaaa", "b", "aaa".

But "b" and "aaa" are palindromes, invalid.

If I split after s[3] and s[5], getting "aaaa", "ba", "a".

"aaaa" is palindrome, "ba" is not palindrome, "a" is palindrome, invalid.

If I split after s[1] and s[3], getting "aa", "ab", "aaa".

"aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

If I split after s[2] and s[4], getting "aaa", "ba", "aa".

"aaa" is palindrome, invalid.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I need to find a split where each substring contains at least one position where two consecutive characters are different, and the substring is not a palindrome.

But in "aaabaaa", I can split into "aaaa" and "baaa".

"aaaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aaab" and "aaa", "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aaa" and "baaa", "aaa" is palindrome, invalid.

"aa" and "aabaaa", "aa" is palindrome, invalid.

"a" and "aabaaaa", "a" is palindrome, invalid.

Wait, seems like no matter how I split, I can't avoid having at least one palindrome substring.

But according to my earlier logic, since there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], it should be possible.

But in this case, it seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Maybe there are cases where even if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], it's still impossible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

In the above example, "aaabaaa", it seems impossible.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, single characters are palindromes, and any substring of length 2 or more where all characters are the same is also a palindrome.

In "aaabaaa", any substring that includes the 'b' and some 'a's might not be a palindrome.

For example, "aaaba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "aaaba" is not a palindrome because 'a' != 'b'.

Wait, but "aaaba" is "a a a b a", which is not symmetric.

Wait, "aaaba" reversed is "aabaa", which is different from "aaaba", so it's not a palindrome.

So, in this case, "aaaba" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, "aabaaa" is not a palindrome.

So, in "aaabaaa", if I split into "aaaba" and "aa", "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, split into "aaa" and "baaa", "aaa" is palindrome, invalid.

Wait, maybe split into "aaab" and "aaa", "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, perhaps split into "a a a b a a a", but all single characters are palindromes, invalid.

Alternatively, "aa aab aaa", "aa" is palindrome, invalid.

Wait, maybe "aaa b aaa", "aaa" is palindrome, invalid.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for "aaabaaa".

But according to my earlier logic, since there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], it should be possible.

But in this case, it seems impossible.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Maybe there are strings where, even though there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], it's still impossible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Hence, my earlier approach is flawed.

I need a better way to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a string where all characters are the same, like "aaaaa". In this case, any substring of length 2 or more is a palindrome, and single characters are palindromes as well. So, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

If I have a string where at least one character is different, like "aaaba", then I can try to include that difference in a substring to make it non-palindrome.

But, as seen earlier, even with such differences, it might still be impossible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, in "aaaba", if I consider the entire string, is "aaaba" a palindrome?

"aaaba" reversed is "abaaa", which is different, so "aaaba" is not a palindrome. So, in this case, I can take the entire string as one substring, which is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But in "aaabaaa", it seems tricky.

Wait, "aaabaaa" reversed is "aaabaaa", so it's a palindrome.

But, if I split it into "aaaba" and "aa", "aaaba" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, split into "aaa" and "baaa", both are palindromes, invalid.

Wait, "aaa" is a palindrome, "baaa" is "b a a a", which is a palindrome.

Wait, "baaa" reversed is "aaa b", which is "baaaa", which is different from "baaa". Wait, is "baaa" a palindrome?

"baaa" reversed is "aaa b", which is different from "baaa", so "baaa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was a palindrome.

Let me check.

"baaa" is "b a a a", reversed is "a a a b", which is "aaab", which is different from "baaa". So, "baaa" is not a palindrome.

So, in "aaabaaa", if I split into "aaa" and "baaa", "aaa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

But if I split into "aaaba" and "a", "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

If I split into "aaaa" and "baa", "aaaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, maybe split into "aa" and "aba" and "aa", but "aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, "aba" is a palindrome, invalid.

So, it seems impossible for "aaabaaa".

But according to the problem, in the second test case, "lllllllll", which is similar to "aaabaaa" in that all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Hence, perhaps, if all characters are the same, it's impossible.

If there's at least one character different, then it's possible.

But in "aaabaaa", not all characters are the same, but it's still impossible.

So, my earlier thought is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's possible if there's at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], and the string is not entirely made up of repeated characters with only a few differences.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal substring that is not a palindrome.

If I can find a way to split the string such that each substring contains at least one such minimal non-palindrome, then the entire partition will consist of non-palindrome substrings.

But I need to formalize this.

Another approach could be to use dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as whether the substring s[0..i] can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, if s[j+1..i] is not a palindrome and dp[j] is True, then dp[i] is True.

But this might be too slow for the constraints.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and |s| up to 10^6 in total, I need an O(n) solution per string.

So, dynamic programming might not be efficient enough.

Let me think about the properties of the string.

If the string is not a palindrome, I can take it as a single substring.

If it is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, as seen in "aaabaaa", even if there are positions where s[i] != s[i+1], it might still be impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, in "aaabaaa", if I split into "aaaba" and "aa", "aaaba" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, split into "aaa" and "baaa", "aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, but "baaa" is not a palindrome.

So, if I split into "aaa" and "baaa", "aaa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, split into "aaaa" and "baa", "aaaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, maybe split into "aa" and "aabaa", "aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for "aaabaaa".

But according to the problem, in the second test case, "lllllllll", which is similar, it's impossible.

Hence, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, it's impossible.

But in "aaabaaa", not all characters are the same, but it's still impossible.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible if the string is a palindrome and cannot be split into non-palindrome substrings.

But in "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome, but it can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, why is that possible in "uwuowouwu" but not in "aaabaaa"?

Let me check "uwuowouwu".

Is "uwuowouwu" a palindrome? Yes, it reads the same forwards and backwards.

But, it can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But in "aaabaaa", it seems impossible.

So, perhaps, for strings that are palindromes, it's possible to split them into non-palindrome substrings if there exists a way to split them such that no substring is a palindrome.

But, determining this seems non-trivial.

Maybe I need to consider the structure of the string.

Let me consider that if a string is a palindrome, then it has symmetric properties, and any split that respects this symmetry might preserve palindromic properties in the substrings.

But, in "uwuowouwu", splitting into "uw", "uow", "ouwu" breaks this symmetry in a way that none of the substrings are palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[n-1-i], then it's possible to split the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "aaabaaa", s[3] = 'b', and s[3] != s[3], but it's still impossible.

Wait, s[3] = 'b', and s[3] = s[3], which is true, but s[1] = 'a' and s[7] = 'a', which are equal, s[2] = 'a' and s[6] = 'a', equal, etc.

Wait, in "aaabaaa", all corresponding positions are equal except possibly the center in odd-length palindromes, but in this case, it's symmetric.

Wait, perhaps, for strings that are palindromes and consist of repeated characters with only the center different, it's still impossible to partition them into non-palindrome substrings.

But in "uwuowouwu", the characters are not all the same, and it can be split into non-palindrome substrings.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if a string is a palindrome, then any partition that includes an even split might not work, but there could be odd splits that work.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: if a string is a palindrome, and its length is odd, and the center character is different from others, maybe that can be exploited to create a non-palindrome substring.

But in "aaabaaa", the center 'b' might allow for such a split.

Wait, but earlier attempts to split it didn't yield a valid partition.

Maybe I need to look for substrings that are not palindromes and try to include them in the partition.

But this seems too general.

Perhaps I need to accept that determining the possibility of such a partition is non-trivial and requires a more sophisticated approach.

Given time constraints, I might need to implement a solution based on the initial flawed assumption and see if it passes the test cases.

So, going back to my initial thought: if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings; otherwise, it's impossible.

In the "aaabaaa" example, such positions exist ('a' != 'b'), but it seems impossible to partition it.

Hence, this assumption is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that if the string is not a palindrome, then it can be taken as a single substring.

If it is a palindrome, then I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

In such cases, I can try to split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

If both parts are not palindromes, then I'm done.

If one or both parts are palindromes, then I need to try splitting differently.

If no such split exists, then it's impossible.

So, for palindromic strings, I need to find at least one way to split them into two non-palindrome substrings.

To do this, I need to ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

Suppose I have a palindromic string s of length n.

I can try splitting it into two parts: s1 = s[0..k] and s2 = s[k+1..n-1], for some k from 0 to n-2.

I need to choose k such that neither s1 nor s2 is a palindrome.

If I can find such a k, then I can partition the string into two non-palindrome substrings.

If not, then it's impossible.

So, in code, for a palindromic string s, I can iterate through possible split points k and check if both s1 and s2 are not palindromes.

If such a k exists, then output "YES", and provide the partition.

Otherwise, output "NO".

For non-palindromic strings, just output the string itself as a single substring.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Let me test this logic with the "aaabaaa" example.

Is "aaabaaa" a palindrome?

"aaabaaa" reversed is "aaabaaa", so yes.

So, I need to find a k such that neither s[0..k] nor s[k+1..n-1] is a palindrome.

Let's try k=3:

s1 = "aaaa", which is a palindrome.

s2 = "baa", which is not a palindrome.

So, s1 is a palindrome, invalid.

k=2:

s1 = "aaa", palindrome.

s2 = "baaa", not palindrome.

Invalid.

k=4:

s1 = "aaaba", not palindrome.

s2 = "aa", palindrome.

Invalid.

k=1:

s1 = "a", palindrome.

s2 = "aabaaa", not palindrome.

Invalid.

k=5:

s1 = "aaabaa", not palindrome.

s2 = "a", palindrome.

Invalid.

k=0:

s1 = "", not a palindrome (empty string, perhaps consider it as not a palindrome).

s2 = "aaabaaa", which is a palindrome.

Invalid.

k=6:

s1 = "aaabaaa", palindrome.

s2 = "", not a palindrome.

Invalid.

So, in this case, no k satisfies the condition that both s1 and s2 are not palindromes.

Hence, it's impossible to partition "aaabaaa" into non-palindrome substrings.

Similarly, in "lllllllll", which is a palindrome, and all possible splits result in palindromes, so it's impossible.

In "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome, let's see:

n=9.

Try k=3:

s1 = "uwuo", not palindrome.

s2 = "wouwu", not palindrome.

Both are not palindromes, so this works.

Hence, I can partition "uwuowouwu" into "uwuo" and "wouwu", both of which are not palindromes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

So, in code, for each test case:

- Check if the string is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the string itself.

- If it is a palindrome, try to find a k from 0 to n-2 such that neither s[0..k] nor s[k+1..n-1] is a palindrome.

- If such a k exists, output "YES" and the two parts.

- If no such k exists, output "NO".

But, in the third test case, the output is a partition into three parts, not two.

So, perhaps, in some cases, splitting into more than two parts is necessary.

But, in the above approach, I'm only trying to split into two parts.

Is that sufficient?

In the third test case, splitting into two parts works, as shown earlier.

But the example output shows a partition into three parts.

So, perhaps, splitting into two parts is sufficient in this case.

Hence, maybe splitting into two parts is enough for all cases where it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider splitting into more than two parts in some cases.

But, for now, splitting into two parts seems sufficient.

If splitting into two parts doesn't work, then perhaps it's impossible.

In "aaabaaa", splitting into two parts doesn't work, as shown earlier.

Hence, in that case, it's impossible.

So, I can implement this approach.

Now, I need to implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to check for palindromes.

A straightforward way is to compare the string with its reverse, which is O(n).

But, for large n, this might be too slow if done naively.

However, in Python, reversing a string is efficient, so it should be fine.

Alternatively, I can check if s == s[::-1].

This should work efficiently.

Similarly, for checking s1 and s2 in the splitting step.

Hence, the implementation seems straightforward.

Let me outline the steps in code:

For each test case:

Read the string s.

If s is not a palindrome:

Print "YES"

Print 1

Print s

Else:

For k from 0 to n-2:

s1 = s[0..k]

s2 = s[k+1..n-1]

If neither s1 nor s2 is a palindrome:

Print "YES"

Print 2

Print s1 and s2

Break

Else:

Print "NO"

This should work.

But, in the third test case, splitting into three parts is shown, but in this approach, I'm only splitting into two parts.

However, in that case, splitting into two parts also works, as shown earlier.

Hence, splitting into two parts seems sufficient when possible.

Hence, this approach should work.

Let me test this approach with the given test cases.

First test case:

sinktheyacht

This is not a palindrome, so output "YES" and the string itself.

Which matches the given output.

Second test case:

lllllllll

This is a palindrome.

Trying to split it into two parts:

For k=0: s1="", s2="lllllllll", s2 is a palindrome.

For k=1: s1="l", s2="llllllll", both are palindromes.

For k=2: s1="ll", s2="lllllll", both are palindromes.

...

For k=7: s1="llllllll", s2="l", both are palindromes.

For k=8: s1="lllllllll", s2="",
