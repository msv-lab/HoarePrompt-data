Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input:

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I rearrange it to [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Another example: n=3 and all elements are 69. So, no matter how I arrange them, the differences will be zero, so beauty is zero.

Third example: n=5 with [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. Let's see, if I arrange them in ascending order: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty would be (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

Wait a minute, in the first example, arranging in ascending order gave the maximum beauty of 2. In the second example, since all are equal, beauty is zero. In the third example, again arranging in ascending order gave beauty of 57.

Wait, but in the first example, if I arrange it as [1,2,3], the beauty is 2. But if I arrange it as [3,2,1], then beauty would be (2-3) + (1-2) = (-1) + (-1) = -2. So, that's worse. If I arrange it as [1,3,2], beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, arranging in ascending order gives the highest beauty among these options.

Similarly, in the third example, arranging in ascending order gives beauty of 57, while any other arrangement would give a lower sum.

Wait, but in the second example, all elements are equal, so any arrangement gives beauty zero.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, [1,2,3] gives beauty 2, but [1,3,2] gives beauty 1, which is less. So, ascending order gives higher beauty.

But, let's think about it differently. Let's think about the sum (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}). If I expand this, a lot of terms cancel out. Let's see:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

= -a1 + (a2 - a2) + (a3 - a3) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) + an

= -a1 + an

So, the sum simplifies to an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the arranged array.

Wait, that's interesting. So, no matter how I arrange the array, the beauty is simply the last element minus the first element in the arranged sequence.

So, to maximize beauty, I need to maximize (an - a1), where an is the last element and a1 is the first element.

But, in the first example, arranging as [1,2,3], an=3 and a1=1, so beauty=2.

If I arrange as [3,2,1], an=1 and a1=3, beauty=1-3=-2.

If I arrange as [1,3,2], an=2 and a1=1, beauty=2-1=1.

So, indeed, the maximum beauty is achieved when an - a1 is maximized.

In the first example, maximum an - a1 is 3 - 1 = 2.

In the second example, all elements are 69, so an - a1 = 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third example, an - a1 = 100 - 43 = 57.

So, the maximum beauty is simply the maximum possible value of an - a1 over all possible arrangements.

But, since an is the last element and a1 is the first element, and I can arrange the array in any order, the maximum an - a1 is achieved when an is as large as possible and a1 is as small as possible.

Wait, but in the arrangement, an and a1 are just the first and last elements. So, to maximize an - a1, I need to maximize an and minimize a1.

But, an and a1 are not necessarily the maximum and minimum of the array; they are just the first and last elements in the arranged sequence.

Wait, no. an is the last element in the sequence, and a1 is the first element.

So, to maximize an - a1, I should choose the largest possible an and the smallest possible a1.

But, in the sequence, an and a1 are not necessarily the maximum and minimum of the array; they are just two elements in the array.

Wait, but I can choose any arrangement, so I can choose any element to be a1 and any element to be an.

Wait, but in the sum, an - a1 is determined by the chosen arrangement.

Wait, but from the earlier simplification, beauty = an - a1, where an is the last element and a1 is the first element in the arranged sequence.

So, to maximize an - a1, I need to maximize an and minimize a1.

So, the maximum an is the maximum element in the array, and the minimum a1 is the minimum element in the array.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the first example, max(a) - min(a) = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the beauty.

In the second example, all are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third example, 100 - 43 = 57.

So, it seems that the maximum beauty is simply max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the arrangement [1,3,2], beauty is 2 - 1 = 1, which is less than max(a) - min(a) = 3 - 1 = 2.

But, in the arrangement [1,2,3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, which equals max(a) - min(a).

So, to maximize beauty, I need to arrange the array such that the last element is max(a) and the first element is min(a).

Then, beauty = max(a) - min(a).

And, in other arrangements, it would be smaller.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

So, in the program, it seems that the function is trying to find max(a) - min(a) for each test case.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for e in range(t):

l = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0

y = 100000000

for i in range(l):

if nums[i] > x:

x = nums[i]

if nums[i] < y:

y = nums[i]

print(x - y)

So, it reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads n and then the array nums.

Then, it initializes x to 0 and y to a large number (100000000).

Then, it loops through the array to find the maximum value (x) and the minimum value (y).

Finally, it prints x - y, which is max(a) - min(a).

So, according to my earlier reasoning, this should be correct.

But, wait, in the problem statement, beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n, which simplifies to a_n - a_1.

So, by choosing a_n as max(a) and a_1 as min(a), we maximize this difference.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

But, just to be sure, let's check another example.

Fourth example: n=4, array [3,4,3,3].

If I arrange it as [3,3,3,4], then beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

If I arrange it as [4,3,3,3], then beauty is (3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1.

If I arrange it as [3,4,3,3], then beauty is (4-3) + (3-4) + (3-3) = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0.

So, the maximum beauty is 1, which is max(a) - min(a) = 4 - 3 = 1.

Fifth example: n=2, array [2,1]. Arranged as [1,2], beauty is (2-1) = 1. Arranged as [2,1], beauty is (1-2) = -1. So, maximum is 1, which is max(a) - min(a) = 2 - 1 = 1.

Hence, in all cases, the program seems to be correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
