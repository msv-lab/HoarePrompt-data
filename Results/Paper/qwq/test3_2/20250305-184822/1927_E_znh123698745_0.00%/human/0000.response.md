Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about creating something called a "k-level permutation" of length n, where k is even and k is less than or equal to n. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeats.

So, the task is to construct such a permutation where, when you look at all the continuous segments of length k, the sums of these segments differ by at most 1. In other words, the maximum sum and the minimum sum among these segments should be no more than 1 apart.

First, I need to understand what a k-level permutation is. Given that k is even, and we have to look at the sums of k consecutive elements in the permutation, and ensure that any two such sums differ by at most 1.

Let me think about small examples to get a feel for this.

Take the first test case: n=2, k=2.

Possible permutations are [1,2] and [2,1].

Let's check [1,2]: the only sum is 1 + 2 = 3.

Similarly, [2,1]: sum is 2 + 1 = 3.

So, there's only one sum, which is 3. So, max - min = 0, which is less than or equal to 1. Both are valid.

Next, n=3, k=2.

Possible permutations: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

Let's check [1,3,2]:

Sums: 1+3=4, 3+2=5.

max - min = 5 - 4 = 1, which is <=1. So, it's valid.

Another one: [1,2,3]:

Sums: 1+2=3, 2+3=5.

max - min = 5 - 3 = 2, which is >1. So, not valid.

Wait, but according to the sample output, [1,3,2] is acceptable for n=3, k=2.

So, it seems that some permutations satisfy the condition and others don't.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to generate some permutation based on a pattern, but I need to verify if this permutation satisfies the condition for being k-level.

Let me look at the program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

array = list(range(1, n + 1))

answer = [1]

a = [1, -1]

for i in range(1, n):

if (-1) ** i == -1:

answer.append(array[a[-1]])

a[-1] -= 1

else:

answer.append(array[a[0]])

a[0] += 1

print(*answer)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and k, creates a list of numbers from 1 to n, initializes the answer with 1, and then has a list 'a' with [1, -1].

Then, it loops from 1 to n-1, and based on whether (-1)**i is -1 or not, it appends either array[a[-1]] (which is array[-1] initially, which would be the last element) and decrements a[-1], or appends array[a[0]] (which is array[1] initially, which is 2), and increments a[0].

Wait, array is list(range(1, n+1)), so for n=3, array=[1,2,3].

answer starts with [1], a=[1,-1]

i=1:

(-1)**1 = -1, so append array[a[-1]] = array[-1] = 3, then a[-1] -=1, so a=[1,-2]

answer now [1,3]

i=2:

(-1)**2 =1, so append array[a[0]] = array[1] =2, then a[0] +=1, so a=[2,-2]

answer now [1,3,2]

Which matches the sample output for n=3, k=2.

Similarly, for n=2, k=2:

array=[1,2]

answer=[1]

i=1:

(-1)**1=-1, append array[-1]=2, a=[1,-2]

answer=[1,2]

But in the sample output, for n=2, k=2, it's [2,1].

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the sample output, for n=2, k=2, it's [2,1], but according to this program, it's [1,2].

But earlier, I saw that both [1,2] and [2,1] are valid for n=2, k=2.

So, it's acceptable.

But the program outputs [1,2], while the sample output shows [2,1].

Maybe there are multiple valid permutations, and the program is generating one that's different from the sample, but still valid.

I need to check if the program always generates a valid permutation for given n and k.

Looking back at the program:

It always starts with 1, then alternately takes from the end and the start of the array.

Wait, for n=3, k=2:

It generates [1,3,2], which is valid as we saw.

For n=2, k=2:

[1,2], which is valid.

Let me check for n=4, k=2:

array=[1,2,3,4]

answer=[1]

i=1: (-1)**1=-1, append array[-1]=4, a=[1,-2]

answer=[1,4]

i=2: (-1)**2=1, append array[a[0]]=array[1]=2, a=[2,-2]

answer=[1,4,2]

i=3: (-1)**3=-1, append array[a[-1]]=array[-2]=3, a=[2,-3]

answer=[1,4,2,3]

Now, check if this is a 2-level permutation.

Sums:

1+4=5

4+2=6

2+3=5

max - min =6-5=1, which is <=1. So, valid.

Another test: n=4, k=4

array=[1,2,3,4]

answer=[1]

i=1: append array[-1]=4, a=[1,-2]

answer=[1,4]

i=2: append array[a[0]]=array[1]=2, a=[2,-2]

answer=[1,4,2]

i=3: append array[a[-1]]=array[-2]=3, a=[2,-3]

answer=[1,4,2,3]

Sum: 1+4+2+3=10

Only one sum, so max - min =0 <=1. Valid.

Another test: n=5, k=4

array=[1,2,3,4,5]

answer=[1]

i=1: append array[-1]=5, a=[1,-2]

answer=[1,5]

i=2: append array[a[0]]=array[1]=2, a=[2,-2]

answer=[1,5,2]

i=3: append array[a[-1]]=array[-2]=4, a=[2,-3]

answer=[1,5,2,4]

i=4: append array[a[0]]=array[2]=3, a=[3,-3]

answer=[1,5,2,4,3]

Sums:

1+5+2+4=12

5+2+4+3=14

max - min =14-12=2 >1. Not valid.

Wait, but according to the problem, it should be valid.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

But according to this program, for n=5, k=4, it's generating [1,5,2,4,3], whose sums are 12 and 14, difference=2>1, which is invalid.

So, is the program incorrect?

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let me recalculate the sums for [1,5,2,4,3]:

Sums of length k=4:

1+5+2+4=12

5+2+4+3=14

Difference=2, which is greater than 1.

Hence, this permutation is not 4-level.

But according to the program, it's generating this permutation.

So, the program is incorrect for n=5, k=4.

Wait, but the problem says that such a permutation always exists under the constraints, so maybe there is another permutation that is valid.

Let me try to find a valid permutation for n=5, k=4.

We need to arrange numbers 1,2,3,4,5 such that the sums of every 4 consecutive numbers differ by at most 1.

Let's try [2,4,1,5,3]:

Sums:

2+4+1+5=12

4+1+5+3=13

Difference=1, which is <=1. So, this is valid.

Hence, [2,4,1,5,3] is a valid 4-level permutation for n=5.

But the program is generating [1,5,2,4,3], which is invalid.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=10, k=4, the output is [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6].

Let me check if this is valid.

Sums:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

max - min =24-23=1 <=1. Valid.

Similarly, for n=13, k=4, the output is [4,10,1,13,5,9,2,12,6,8,3,11,7].

Let's compute the sums:

4+10+1+13=28

10+1+13+5=29

1+13+5+9=28

13+5+9+2=29

5+9+2+12=28

9+2+12+6=29

2+12+6+8=28

12+6+8+3=29

6+8+3+11=28

8+3+11+7=29

max - min =29-28=1 <=1. Valid.

And for n=7, k=4: [1,6,3,7,2,5,4]

Sums:

1+6+3+7=17

6+3+7+2=18

3+7+2+5=17

7+2+5+4=18

max - min=18-17=1 <=1. Valid.

So, in the sample outputs, all the provided permutations are valid.

But the program is generating different permutations, which may or may not be valid.

In the case of n=5, k=4, it generates an invalid permutation.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
