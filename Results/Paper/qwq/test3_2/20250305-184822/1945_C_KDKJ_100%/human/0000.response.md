Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, there are n houses in a village, and each resident wants to live on either the left or the right side of a big road that will be built. The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. Each resident's preference is given in a sequence a1 to an, where 0 means they want to live on the left side, and 1 means they want to live on the right side.

The goal is to choose where to build the road so that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. Satisfaction means that their preference matches the side they are on. Additionally, we want the road to be as close as possible to the middle of the village, minimizing the absolute difference between the number of houses on each side and the village's center.

If there are multiple options that satisfy the conditions, we should choose the one with the smallest house number.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. Let's consider an example.

Suppose n = 3, and the sequence is "101".

If I build the road before the first house (i=0), all houses are on the right side. So, on the right side, we have houses 1, 0, 1. We need at least ceil(3/2) = 2 residents to want to be on the right side. In this case, house 1 wants right, house 0 wants left, house 1 wants right. So, two residents want right, which satisfies the condition. But we need to check if there's a better option closer to the center.

If I build the road after the first house (i=1), house 1 is on the left, and houses 2 and 3 are on the right. On the left side, house 1 wants right, but it's on the left, so it's not satisfied. That's 0 out of 1, which is less than ceil(1/2)=1. So, this doesn't satisfy the condition.

If I build the road after the second house (i=2), houses 1 and 2 are on the left, and house 3 is on the right. On the left side, houses 1 and 2 want right and left, respectively. So, house 2 is satisfied (since it wants left and is on left). That's 1 out of 2, which is equal to ceil(2/2)=1, so it satisfies. On the right side, house 3 wants right and is on right, so 1 out of 1, which satisfies ceil(1/2)=1.

So, both i=0 and i=2 satisfy the conditions, but i=2 is closer to the center (n=3, center is at house 2). So, i=2 is better.

Another example: n=6, sequence="010111".

Let's try i=3:

Left side: houses 1-3: "010". Wants left, right, left. So, satisfied: house 1 wants left and is on left, house 3 wants left and is on left. So, 2 out of 3, which is ceil(3/2)=2, satisfies.

Right side: houses 4-6: "111". All want right and are on right. 3 out of 3, which is more than ceil(3/2)=2.

So, i=3 satisfies.

But we need to check if there's a better i with smaller |n/2 - i|.

n=6, center is at i=3. So, i=3 is already at the center.

Another i to check: i=2.

Left side: houses 1-2: "01". Satisfied: house 1 wants left and is on left, house 2 wants right but is on left, so only 1 out of 2 satisfied. ceil(2/2)=1, so it's marginal.

Right side: houses 3-6: "0111". Satisfied: houses 3,4,5,6: wants left, right, right, right. So, houses 4,5,6 are satisfied. 3 out of 4, which is more than ceil(4/2)=2.

So, i=2 also satisfies, but |3-2|=1, while |3-3|=0, so i=3 is better.

Wait, but according to the problem, we need to minimize |n/2 - i|, and if multiple, choose the smallest i.

Wait, n=6, n/2=3. So i=3 is better than i=2.

But in the sample input, for n=6 with "010111", the output is 3.

For n=6 with "011001", the output is 2.

Wait, in the second case, n=6, "011001", let's see:

i=2: left="01", right="1001".

Left: house 1 wants left and is on left (satisfied), house 2 wants right and is on left (not satisfied). So, 1 out of 2, ceil(2/2)=1, satisfies.

Right: houses 3-6: "1100". Wants right, right, left, left. So, houses 3 and 4 are satisfied. That's 2 out of 4, which is equal to ceil(4/2)=2, satisfies.

So, i=2 satisfies.

i=3: left="011", right="001".

Left: houses 1,2,3: wants left, right, right. So, house 1 is satisfied. That's 1 out of 3, which is less than ceil(3/2)=2. So, doesn't satisfy.

Hence, i=2 is the only option that satisfies, so it's chosen.

Another sample: n=3, "000".

i=0: right side all "000", wants left, left, left. So, none are satisfied on right side, which doesn't satisfy ceil(3/2)=2.

i=1: left="0", right="00". Left: house 1 wants left and is on left (satisfied, 1 out of 1). Right: houses 2 and 3 want left and are on right (not satisfied), 0 out of 2, which is less than ceil(2/2)=1.

i=2: left="00", right="0". Left: houses 1 and 2 want left and are on left (both satisfied, 2 out of 2). Right: house 3 wants left but is on right (not satisfied), 0 out of 1, which is less than ceil(1/2)=1.

i=3: left="000", right=None. Left: houses 1,2,3 all want left and are on left (all satisfied, 3 out of 3). Right: no houses, so condition automatically satisfies.

Hence, i=3 satisfies.

n=3, center is i=2. |3/2 - 3|=0.5, |3/2 - 2|=0.5, |3/2 -1|=1.5, |3/2 -0|=1.5.

But only i=3 satisfies, so choose i=3.

Wait, in sample input, for n=3, "000", output is 3.

Another sample: n=3, "110".

i=0: right="110", needs at least ceil(3/2)=2 residents wanting right. Here, two 1's want right, so satisfies.

Left: none, which automatically satisfies.

i=1: left="1", right="10". Left: house 1 wants right but is on left (not satisfied), 0 out of 1, which is less than ceil(1/2)=1.

i=2: left="11", right="0". Left: houses 1 and 2 want right and are on left (both not satisfied), 0 out of 2, which is less than ceil(2/2)=1.

i=3: left="110", right=None. Left: houses 1,2,3 want right, right, left, so house 3 is satisfied (wants left and is on left). So, 1 out of 3, which is less than ceil(3/2)=2.

Hence, only i=0 satisfies.

But according to the sample input, for n=3, "110", output is 0.

Wait, but in the explanation above, i=0 satisfies.

Similarly, for n=3, "001", output is 1.

Let's check:

i=0: right="001", needs at least ceil(3/2)=2 wanting right. Here, only one '1' wants right, so doesn't satisfy.

i=1: left="0", right="01". Left: house 1 wants left and is on left (satisfied, 1 out of 1). Right: houses 2 and 3 want left and right. So, house 3 is satisfied (1 out of 2), which is equal to ceil(2/2)=1.

Hence, satisfies.

i=2: left="00", right="1". Left: houses 1 and 2 want left and are on left (both satisfied, 2 out of 2). Right: house 3 wants right and is on right (satisfied, 1 out of 1).

Hence, both i=1 and i=2 satisfy.

n=3, center is i=2. For i=1, |3/2 -1|=0.5. For i=2, |3/2 -2|=0.5. So, both have the same distance. But we need to choose the smaller i, which is i=1.

Hence, output is 1.

Another sample: n=4, "1100".

i=0: right="1100", needs at least ceil(4/2)=2 wanting right. Here, two '1's want right, so satisfies.

i=1: left="1", right="100". Left: house 1 wants right and is on left (not satisfied, 0 out of 1 < ceil(1/2)=1).

i=2: left="11", right="00". Left: houses 1 and 2 want right and are on left (both not satisfied, 0 out of 2 < ceil(2/2)=1).

i=3: left="110", right="0". Left: houses 1,2,3 want right, right, left. So, house 3 wants left and is on left (satisfied, 1 out of 3 < ceil(3/2)=2).

i=4: left="1100", right=None. Left: houses 1,2,3,4 want right, right, left, left. So, houses 3 and 4 are satisfied (2 out of 4 >= ceil(4/2)=2). Right: none, automatically satisfies.

Hence, i=0 and i=4 satisfy.

n=4, center is i=2. For i=0, |4/2 -0|=2. For i=4, |4/2 -4|=2. So, both have the same distance. But we need to choose the smaller i, which is i=0.

Hence, output is 0.

From these examples, I can see that we need to iterate through all possible positions i (from 0 to n) and check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. Then, among those positions that satisfy the condition, choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

Now, to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 2*10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute the number of satisfied residents on each side for each possible i.

One way to do this is to precompute prefix sums for the number of 0's and 1's.

Let's define S[i] as the prefix sum up to house i, where S[i][0] is the number of 0's and S[i][1] is the number of 1's among the first i houses.

Then, for a given i, the left side has houses 1 to i, and the right side has houses i+1 to n.

So, for the left side:

- Number of houses: i

- Number of residents wanting left (0): S[i][0]

- Number of residents wanting right (1): S[i][1]

- Number of satisfied residents: S[i][0] (since they are on left)

- Condition: S[i][0] >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly, for the right side:

- Number of houses: n - i

- Number of residents wanting left (0): S[n][0] - S[i][0]

- Number of residents wanting right (1): S[n][1] - S[i][1]

- Number of satisfied residents: S[n][1] - S[i][1]

- Condition: S[n][1] - S[i][1] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

So, for each i from 0 to n, we can compute these values using the prefix sums and check if both conditions are satisfied.

Then, among all i that satisfy both conditions, we choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

To implement this efficiently, we can:

1. Read the number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n.

b. Read the string a of length n.

c. Compute the prefix sums S, where S[i][0] is the count of '0's up to house i, and S[i][1] is the count of '1's up to house i.

d. Iterate over i from 0 to n:

i. For left side (houses 1 to i):

- satisfied = S[i][0]

- condition: satisfied >= ceil(i / 2)

ii. For right side (houses i+1 to n):

- satisfied = S[n][1] - S[i][1]

- condition: satisfied >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

iii. If both conditions are satisfied, calculate |n/2 - i| and keep track of the i with the smallest |n/2 - i|.

e. If multiple i have the same |n/2 - i|, choose the smallest i.

f. Output the chosen i.

To handle ceil division without using math.ceil for efficiency, we can use the formula:

ceil(a / b) = (a + b - 1) // b

But in this case, since b is 2, ceil(a / 2) = (a + 1) // 2

Also, to minimize |n/2 - i|, since n/2 may be a float, we need to handle it properly. Actually, since n is an integer, n/2 is a float unless n is even. To handle this correctly, we can compute the absolute difference as abs(i - n // 2), considering that house indices are integers.

Wait, but n/2 could be a float, so to compute |n/2 - i|, it's better to compute it as abs(i - n / 2), using floating-point arithmetic, and keep track of the minimum value.

But since we need to output integer i, and choose the smallest i in case of ties, we can iterate through all possible i, compute |n/2 - i|, and keep track of the minimum value and the corresponding i.

Implementing this in code should be straightforward.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program defines two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_2 seems to be a wrapper that runs func_1 t times, where t is the number of test cases.

In func_1:

- Read n and the string a.

- Initialize S as a list of lists: [[0, 0]]

- Iterate through each character in a:

- Copy the last element of S into a new list [x, y]

- If a[j] == '0', increment x

- Else, increment y

- Append [x, y] to S

- Initialize ans as -1

- Iterate through i from 0 to n:

- left = S[i][0]

- lsum = i

- right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

- rsum = n - i

- Check if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:

- If yes, continue to next i

- Else, check if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):

- If yes, set ans = i

- Print ans

This seems to be implementing the logic I described earlier.

Let's verify with the sample input and output.

Sample Output:

Let's take the first test case:

n=3, a="101"

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]

Iterate i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

left = S[0][0] = 0

lsum = 0

right = S[3][1] - S[0][1] = 2 - 0 = 2

rsum = 3 - 0 = 3

Check if 0*2 < 0 or 2*2 < 3, which is 0 < 0 or 4 < 3, false or false, so check |3/2 - 0| < |3/2 - (-1)|, which is |1.5| < |1.5|, but ans is -1, so set ans=0

i=1:

left=1, lsum=1

right=2 - 0=2, rsum=2

Check 1*2 <1 or 2*2 <2, which is 2<1 or 4<2, false or false, so check |1.5 -1| < |1.5 -0|, which is 0.5 <1.5, so set ans=1

i=2:

left=1, lsum=2

right=2 -1=1, rsum=1

Check 1*2 <2 or 1*2 <1, which is 2<2 or 2<1, false or false, so check |1.5-2| < |1.5-1|, which is 0.5 <0.5, not smaller, so keep ans=1

i=3:

left=1, lsum=3

right=2 -2=0, rsum=0

Check 1*2 <3 or 0*2 <0, which is 2<3 or 0<0, false or false, so check |1.5-3| < |1.5-1|, which is 1.5 <0.5, not smaller, so keep ans=1

But according to the sample, output should be 2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the code, it's checking left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum. If either is true, continue.

For i=1:

left=1, lsum=1 -> 1*2=2 <1? No

right=2, rsum=2 ->2*2=4 <2? No

So, check |1.5 -1| < |1.5 - (-1)|, which is 0.5 <1.5, set ans=1

For i=2:

left=1, lsum=2 ->1*2=2 <2? No

right=1, rsum=1 ->1*2=2 <1? No

Check |1.5 -2| < |1.5 -1|, which is 0.5 <0.5, not smaller, so keep ans=1

But sample output is 2. So, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition. The condition is if left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum, continue. Else, check if |n/2 -i| < |n/2 - ans|, and if so, set ans=i.

In the first iteration, i=0:

left=0, lsum=0 ->0*2=0 <0? No

right=2, rsum=3 ->2*2=4 <3? No

Set ans=0

i=1:

left=1, lsum=1 ->1*2=2 <1? No

right=2 -0=2, rsum=2 ->2*2=4 <2? No

Check |1.5-1| < |1.5-0|, which is 0.5 <1.5, set ans=1

i=2:

left=1, lsum=2 ->1*2=2 <2? No (since 2 <2 is false)

right=2 -1=1, rsum=1 ->1*2=2 <1? No (since 2<1 is false)

Check |1.5-2| < |1.5-1|, which is 0.5 <0.5? Not smaller, so keep ans=1

i=3:

left=1, lsum=3 ->1*2=2 <3? No

right=2 -2=0, rsum=0 ->0*2=0 <0? No

Check |1.5-3| < |1.5-1|, which is 1.5 <0.5? No, so keep ans=1

But sample output is 2, but according to this, it should output 1. There's a mistake.

Wait, in the sample explanation, for n=3, "101", output is 2.

But according to the code, it's choosing i=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, in the code, it's checking left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum, and if either is true, it continues. Otherwise, it checks if |n/2 -i| < |n/2 - ans|, and if so, sets ans=i.

But in the sample, for i=2, |1.5-2|=0.5, which is equal to |1.5-1|=0.5, but it's not smaller, so it keeps ans=1.

But according to the problem, if multiple i have the same |n/2 -i|, choose the smallest i, which is i=1 in this case, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. It says to minimize |n/2 -i|, and if multiple, choose the smallest i.

In this case, both i=1 and i=2 have |1.5 -1|=0.5 and |1.5 -2|=0.5, so should choose i=1, but sample output is 2. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps n/2 is integer division. In Python, n/2 is float division.

But in the problem, n is 3, 3/2 is 1.5, and |1.5 -1|=0.5, |1.5 -2|=0.5, so they are equal, and it should choose the smaller i, which is 1, but sample output is 2.

Wait, maybe I need to use integer division for n//2.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says to minimize |n/2 -i|, where n/2 is real number division.

But perhaps in code, it's better to use floating-point division.

Wait, in the code, n is integer, i is integer, n/2 is float.

But in Python, n/2 is float division.

So, for n=3, n/2=1.5

|1.5 -1|=0.5

|1.5 -2|=0.5

So, they are equal, and it should choose the smaller i, which is 1, but sample output is 2.

Perhaps I need to re-examine the condition.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"minimize |n/2 - i|.

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum |n/2 -i|, output the smaller one."

But in this case, i=1 and i=2 both have |1.5 -i|=0.5, so it should choose i=1, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"among all suitable positions i, minimize |n/2 -i|."

And if multiple, choose the smallest i.

But in the first sample input, n=3, a="101", output is 2.

But according to the code, it's choosing i=1, which matches the sample explanation.

Wait, perhaps the sample explanation has a mistake, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says:

"If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left side (with preferences a1=1, a2=0) and 1 out of 1 resident on the right side (with preference a3=1) will be satisfied with the choice. More than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which means that the road can be laid after house 2."

So, i=2 satisfies.

But i=1 also satisfies, as per the code.

Wait, does i=1 satisfy?

For i=1:

Left side: house 1, a1=1. Wants right but is on left. So, not satisfied. 0 out of 1, which is less than ceil(1/2)=1. So, doesn't satisfy.

Wait, in the code, for i=1:

left = S[1][0] =1 (but a1=1, which is '1', so S[1][0]=0, actually.

Wait, in the code, S is initialized as [[0,0]], and then for a="101":

- a[0]='1': S[1][1]=1

- a[1]='0': S[2][0]=1

- a[2]='1': S[3][1]=1

Wait, seems like I miscounted earlier.

Wait, let's re-examine the prefix sums.

S = [[0,0]]

a = "101"

For j=0, a[0]='1': y=0+1=1, so S=[[0,0], [0,1]]

For j=1, a[1]='0': x=0+1=1, y=1, S=[[0,0], [0,1], [1,1]]

For j=2, a[2]='1': y=1+1=2, S=[[0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [1,2]]

So, S[i][0] is the number of '0's up to house i.

For i=1: S[1][0]=0, which is correct, since a1='1'

For i=2: S[2][0]=1, which is correct, a1='1' and a2='0'

For i=3: S[3][0]=1, which is correct, a1='1', a2='0', a3='1'

Now, for i=1:

left = S[1][0]=0

lsum =1

right = S[3][1] - S[1][1]=2-1=1

rsum=2

Check 0*2 <1 or 1*2 <2, which is 0<1 or 2<2, which is true or false. Since left*2 < lsum is true, continue to next i.

So, i=1 does not satisfy.

Similarly, i=2:

left=1, lsum=2

right=2-1=1, rsum=1

Check 1*2 <2 or 1*2 <1, which is 2<2 or 2<1, false or false, so check |1.5-2| < |1.5-0|, which is 0.5 <1.5, set ans=2

i=3:

left=1, lsum=3

right=2-2=0, rsum=0

Check 1*2 <3 or 0*2 <0, which is 2<3 or 0<0, false or false, so check |1.5-3| < |1.5-2|, which is 1.5 <0.5, not smaller, so keep ans=2

Hence, output is 2, which matches the sample.

So, the code seems correct in this case.

Another test case: n=6, a="010111"

Compute S:

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [2,4]]

Iterate i from 0 to 6:

i=0:

left=0, lsum=0

right=4, rsum=6

Check 0*2 <0 or 4*2 <6, which is 0<0 or 8<6, false or false, set ans=0

i=1:

left=1, lsum=1

right=4-0=4, rsum=5

Check 1*2 <1 or 4*2 <5, which is 2<1 or 8<5, false or false, check |3-1|=2 < |3-0|=3, set ans=1

i=2:

left=1, lsum=2

right=4-1=3, rsum=4

Check 1*2 <2 or 3*2 <4, which is 2<2 or 6<4, false or false, check |3-2|=1 < |3-1|=2, set ans=2

i=3:

left=2, lsum=3

right=4-1=3, rsum=3

Check 2*2 <3 or 3*2 <3, which is 4<3 or 6<3, false or false, check |3-3|=0 < |3-2|=1, set ans=3

i=4:

left=2, lsum=4

right=4-2=2, rsum=2

Check 2*2 <4 or 2*2 <2, which is 4<4 or 4<2, false or false, check |3-4|=1 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=5:

left=2, lsum=5

right=4-3=1, rsum=1

Check 2*2 <5 or 1*2 <1, which is 4<5 or 2<1, false or false, check |3-5|=2 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=6:

left=2, lsum=6

right=4-4=0, rsum=0

Check 2*2 <6 or 0*2 <0, which is 4<6 or 0<0, false or false, check |3-6|=3 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

Hence, output is 3, which matches the sample.

Another test case: n=6, a="011001"

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,2], [2,2], [2,3]]

i=0:

left=0, lsum=0

right=3, rsum=6

Check 0*2 <0 or 3*2 <6, false or false, set ans=0

i=1:

left=1, lsum=1

right=3-0=3, rsum=5

Check 1*2 <1 or 3*2 <5, false or false, check |3-1|=2 < |3-0|=3, set ans=1

i=2:

left=1, lsum=2

right=3-1=2, rsum=4

Check 1*2 <2 or 2*2 <4, false or false, check |3-2|=1 < |3-1|=2, set ans=2

i=3:

left=1, lsum=3

right=3-2=1, rsum=3

Check 1*2 <3 or 1*2 <3, false or false, check |3-3|=0 < |3-2|=1, set ans=3

i=4:

left=2, lsum=4

right=3-2=1, rsum=2

Check 2*2 <4 or 1*2 <2, false or false, check |3-4|=1 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=5:

left=2, lsum=5

right=3-3=0, rsum=1

Check 2*2 <5 or 0*2 <0, false or false, check |3-5|=2 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=6:

left=2, lsum=6

right=3-3=0, rsum=0

Check 2*2 <6 or 0*2 <0, false or false, check |3-6|=3 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

But according to the sample, output is 2, but according to this, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing S.

Wait, a="011001"

S = [[0,0]]

For j=0, a[0]='0': x=0+1=1, y=0 -> [1,0]

S = [[0,0], [1,0]]

For j=1, a[1]='1': x=1, y=0+1=1 -> [1,1]

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1]]

For j=2, a[2]='1': x=1, y=1+1=2 -> [1,2]

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]

For j=3, a[3]='0': x=1+1=2, y=2 -> [2,2]

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,2]]

For j=4, a[4]='0': x=2+1=3, y=2 -> [3,2]

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,2], [3,2]]

For j=5, a[5]='1': x=3, y=2+1=3 -> [3,3]

S = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]

Wait, I made a mistake earlier.

So, for i=3:

left = S[3][0]=1

lsum=3

right = S[6][1] - S[3][1]=3 -2=1

rsum=3

Check 1*2 <3 or 1*2 <3, which is 2<3 or 2<3, false or false, check |3-3|=0 < |3-2|=1, set ans=3

i=4:

left=S[4][0]=2

lsum=4

right=3-2=1

rsum=2

Check 2*2 <4 or 1*2 <2, which is 4<4 or 2<2, false or false, check |3-4|=1 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=5:

left=S[5][0]=3

lsum=5

right=3-3=0

rsum=1

Check 3*2 <5 or 0*2 <0, which is 6<5 or 0<0, false or false, check |3-5|=2 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

i=6:

left=S[6][0]=3

lsum=6

right=3-3=0

rsum=0

Check 3*2 <6 or 0*2 <0, which is 6<6 or 0<0, false or false, check |3-6|=3 < |3-3|=0, not smaller, keep ans=3

But sample output is 2, but according to this, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted S.

Wait, a="011001"

S should be:

S[0] = [0,0]

S[1] = [1,0]

S[2] = [1,1]

S[3] = [1,2]

S[4] = [2,2]

S[5] = [3,2]

S[6] = [3,3]

Yes, as above.

For i=2:

left=S[2][0]=
