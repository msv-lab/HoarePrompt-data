Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp lost a string, but he has something called a "trace" of that string. The trace is an array of integers that correspond to the original string's characters in some way. Specifically, for each position i in the string, a_i is the number of earlier indices j (where j < i) that have the same character as s_i.

For example, in the string "abracadabra", the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. Looking at this, it seems that:

- The first 'a' has 0 earlier 'a's.

- The first 'b' has 0 earlier 'b's.

- The first 'r' has 0 earlier 'r's.

- The second 'a' has 1 earlier 'a'.

- And so on.

So, given this trace, I need to reconstruct any string that would produce this trace. The problem assures me that a valid string exists for the given trace.

First, I need to understand how to approach this. Since the trace gives the count of previous occurrences of the same character for each position, I need to assign characters to positions based on these counts.

I should think about how characters are reused in the string. Each time a character appears for the first time, its count is 0. The second time it appears, its count is 1, and so on.

So, for each position in the string, I need to choose a character that has appeared exactly a_i times before.

Wait, but how do I keep track of which characters have been used how many times?

Maybe I can maintain a frequency count for each possible character. Since the string consists only of lowercase Latin letters (a-z), there are 26 possible characters.

I can start by initializing a list or array with 26 zeros, each representing the count of a character from 'a' to 'z'.

Then, for each position in the string, I look at a_i. I need to find a character whose current count matches a_i. Once I assign that character to the position, I increment its count.

This seems plausible.

Let me try this with the first example:

n = 11

a = [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

I'll initialize counts for a-z: [0,0,0,...,0]

For the first position, a_1 = 0. So, I need a character that has appeared 0 times before. That means any character that hasn't been used yet. I can choose 'a' (first unused character). So, s[1] = 'a', and increment count of 'a' to 1.

Now, counts: a=1, b=0, c=0, ..., z=0

Second position, a_2 = 0. Again, need a character that has appeared 0 times before. So, 'b' is the next unused character. s[2] = 'b', increment b to 1.

Counts: a=1, b=1, c=0, ..., z=0

Third position, a_3 = 0. Need a character that hasn't been used yet. So, 'c', but wait, in the example, it's 'r'. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to choose the smallest available character that matches the count.

Wait, no. The problem says "any string s that corresponds to the given trace". So, it doesn't matter which characters I choose, as long as they satisfy the count conditions.

But in the example, it's "abracadabra", which suggests a particular ordering.

Maybe I should assign characters in order, preferring to reuse earlier characters when their count matches.

Wait, but in the first three positions, all counts are 0, so I can assign three different characters.

In "abracadabra", the first three characters are 'a', 'b', 'r'. So, it's assigning the first few letters in order.

But in the fourth position, a_4 = 1, meaning one previous 'a'. So, it assigns 'a' again.

Wait, but in my earlier step, I assigned 'a' to the first position, 'b' to the second, 'r' to the third, then 'a' to the fourth, which matches the example.

So, my approach seems to work.

Let me see for the entire example:

1. a=0: assign 'a', counts: a=1

2. a=0: assign 'b', counts: a=1, b=1

3. a=0: assign 'r', counts: a=1, b=1, r=1

4. a=1: need a character that has appeared once before. 'a' has count=1, so assign 'a', counts: a=2, b=1, r=1

5. a=0: assign 'c', counts: a=2, b=1, r=1, c=1

6. a=2: need a character that has appeared twice before. 'a' has count=2, so assign 'a', counts: a=3, b=1, r=1, c=1

7. a=0: assign 'd', counts: a=3, b=1, r=1, c=1, d=1

8. a=3: need a character that has appeared three times before. 'a' has count=3, so assign 'a', counts: a=4, b=1, r=1, c=1, d=1

9. a=1: 'b' has count=1, 'r' has count=1, 'c' has count=1, 'd' has count=1. I can choose any of them. In the example, it's 'r', so assign 'r', counts: a=4, b=1, r=2, c=1, d=1

10. a=1: 'b' has count=1, 'r' has count=2, 'c' has count=1, 'd' has count=1. I can choose 'b' or 'c' or 'r'. In the example, it's 'a', but wait, 'a' has count=4, which is more than 1, so why is it choosing 'a'?

Wait, a_10 =1, but 'a' has count=4, which is not equal to 1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in position 10, a_10=1, so I need a character that has appeared once before. Looking at the counts so far:

a=4, b=1, r=2, c=1, d=1

So, 'b' has count=1, 'c' has count=1, 'd' has count=1

In the example, position 10 is 'a', but according to the trace, it should be a character that has appeared once before. But 'a' has appeared 4 times, which is not equal to 1. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let's recount:

1. a=0: assign 'a', counts: a=1

2. a=0: assign 'b', counts: a=1, b=1

3. a=0: assign 'r', counts: a=1, b=1, r=1

4. a=1: assign 'a', counts: a=2, b=1, r=1

5. a=0: assign 'c', counts: a=2, b=1, r=1, c=1

6. a=2: assign 'a', counts: a=3, b=1, r=1, c=1

7. a=0: assign 'd', counts: a=3, b=1, r=1, c=1, d=1

8. a=3: assign 'a', counts: a=4, b=1, r=1, c=1, d=1

9. a=1: assign 'b', counts: a=4, b=2, r=1, c=1, d=1

10. a=1: assign 'c', counts: a=4, b=2, r=1, c=2, d=1

11. a=4: assign 'a', counts: a=5, b=2, r=1, c=2, d=1

But in the example, it's "abracadabra", which corresponds to:

Positions:

1. a:0 -> 'a'

2. a:0 -> 'b'

3. a:0 -> 'r'

4. a:1 -> 'a'

5. a:0 -> 'c'

6. a:2 -> 'a'

7. a:0 -> 'd'

8. a:3 -> 'a'

9. a:1 -> 'r'

10. a:1 -> 'a'

11. a:4 -> 'a'

Wait, but in position 10, a_10=1, but 'a' has count=4, which doesn't match. There's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the trace.

Wait, no, the trace is the number of previous occurrences, not the total count so far.

Wait, but in the example, for position 10, a_10=1, and 'a' has appeared 4 times before, but according to the trace, it should have appeared once before. So, something's off.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that a_i is the number of previous indices j < i where s_j = s_i, so it's the number of times s_i has appeared before position i.

In the example, for position 10, s_10='a', and 'a' has appeared 4 times before position 10, but according to the trace, a_10=1, which suggests that 'a' has appeared once before position 10. This is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j ."

So, a_i is the number of times s_i has appeared before position i.

In the example, for "abracadabra", the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4].

Looking at position 10:

s_10='a', and 'a' has appeared 4 times before position 10 (positions 1,4,6,8), so a_10 should be 4, but in the example, it's 1. This is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the indexing or the positions.

Wait, in the example, the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4], and the string is "abracadabra".

Let's list the positions and counts:

Positions:

1. 'a' - no previous 'a's -> 0

2. 'b' - no previous 'b's -> 0

3. 'r' - no previous 'r's -> 0

4. 'a' - one previous 'a' at position 1 -> 1

5. 'c' - no previous 'c's -> 0

6. 'a' - two previous 'a's at positions 1 and 4 -> 2

7. 'd' - no previous 'd's -> 0

8. 'a' - three previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6 -> 3

9. 'r' - one previous 'r' at position 3 -> 1

10. 'a' - four previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6,8 -> 4

11. 'b' - one previous 'b' at position 2 -> 1

Wait, but in the example trace, a_10=1, but according to this, it should be 4. There's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the example.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.

Let's recount:

Positions:

1. 'a' - 0 previous 'a's -> a_1=0

2. 'b' - 0 previous 'b's -> a_2=0

3. 'r' - 0 previous 'r's -> a_3=0

4. 'a' - 1 previous 'a' at position 1 -> a_4=1

5. 'c' - 0 previous 'c's -> a_5=0

6. 'a' - 2 previous 'a's at positions 1 and 4 -> a_6=2

7. 'd' - 0 previous 'd's -> a_7=0

8. 'a' - 3 previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6 -> a_8=3

9. 'r' - 1 previous 'r' at position 3 -> a_9=1

10. 'a' - 4 previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6,8 -> a_10=4

11. 'b' - 1 previous 'b' at position 2 -> a_11=1

So, the trace should be [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,4,1], but in the example, it's [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Looking back at the problem statement, the example input is:

5

11

0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4

10

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

1

0

8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

8

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

And the corresponding output is:

abracadabra

codeforces

a

aaaaaaa

dijkstra

Wait, in the first test case, the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4], and the string is "abracadabra", which, according to my earlier counting, should have a trace of [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,4,1], but the example has [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. This doesn't add up.

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the example.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of the trace.

Wait, let's re-read the problem statement:

"The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j ."

So, a_i is the number of times s_i has appeared before position i.

In "abracadabra", for position 10, s_10='a', and 'a' has appeared at positions 1,4,6,8, so 4 times before position 10, so a_10 should be 4.

But in the example trace, it's 1, which contradicts this.

This suggests that either the example is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Wait, perhaps a_i is the number of times any character has appeared up to position i-1, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe a_i is the number of times the character at position i has appeared before position i.

If that's the case, then in "abracadabra", for position 10, s_10='a', which has appeared 4 times before, so a_10 should be 4.

But in the example trace, it's 1, which doesn't match.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the indexing. Maybe the positions are 1-indexed or 0-indexed differently.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "for each position i in the string, a_i is the number of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i = s_j".

So, for i starting from 1 to n.

In "abracadabra", positions:

1: 'a' - 0 previous 'a's -> a_1=0

2: 'b' - 0 previous 'b's -> a_2=0

3: 'r' - 0 previous 'r's -> a_3=0

4: 'a' - 1 previous 'a' at position 1 -> a_4=1

5: 'c' - 0 previous 'c's -> a_5=0

6: 'a' - 2 previous 'a's at positions 1 and 4 -> a_6=2

7: 'd' - 0 previous 'd's -> a_7=0

8: 'a' - 3 previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6 -> a_8=3

9: 'r' - 1 previous 'r' at position 3 -> a_9=1

10: 'a' - 4 previous 'a's at positions 1,4,6,8 -> a_10=4

11: 'b' - 1 previous 'b' at position 2 -> a_11=1

So, the trace should be [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,4,1], but the example shows [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. This is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps in the example, the string is different from "abracadabra". Maybe it's "abracadabba" or something like that.

Wait, let's look at the output: "abracadabra"

But according to my counting, for "abracadabra", a_10 should be 4, but in the example trace, it's 1. This doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that multiple characters can have the same count, and I need to choose the correct character based on the entire trace.

This is getting too confusing. I need to find another way to approach this.

Let's think differently.

I need to reconstruct the string based on the trace. Each a_i tells me how many times the character at position i has appeared before.

I can think of it as, for each position i, I need to choose a character that has appeared exactly a_i times before.

So, for position i:

- Look at a_i.

- Choose a character that has appeared a_i times so far.

- If multiple characters have appeared a_i times, I can choose any of them.

- If no character has appeared exactly a_i times, I need to choose a new character (with a_i=0).

Wait, but the problem says that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s.

So, I need to make sure that for each a_i, there is at least one character that has appeared exactly a_i times before.

I need to keep track of the frequency of each character as I build the string.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a list or array of size 26, each element representing the count of a character from 'a' to 'z', all initialized to 0.

For each position i from 1 to n:

- I need to find a character whose current count is equal to a_i.

- Assign that character to position i.

- Increment the count of that character by 1.

Given that, I need to iterate through the trace and assign characters accordingly.

To implement this efficiently, I can keep track of which characters have which counts.

For example, I can have a list of lists, where each sublist contains characters with a specific count.

For count 0, count 1, count 2, etc.

Initially, all characters have count 0, so all are in the count 0 list.

As I assign characters to positions, I move them from one count list to the next.

Wait, but with n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so it's manageable.

Let me think about data structures.

Option 1:

- Have a list of counts for each character.

- For each position, iterate through all characters to find one with count equal to a_i.

- Assign that character to the position and increment its count.

This would be too slow for n up to 2e5, as it would be O(n*26), which is about 5e6 operations, which might be acceptable, but can we do better?

Option 2:

- Keep a list for each possible count, containing characters that have that count.

- For example, a list for count 0, count 1, etc.

- For each position, look in the list for count = a_i, pick any character from there, assign it to the position, and move that character to count = a_i + 1.

This seems more efficient.

Initially:

- All characters are in count 0.

- As I assign characters, I move them to higher counts.

This way, for each position, finding a character with count a_i is O(1), and moving it to the next count is also O(1).

This would make the entire algorithm O(n), which is efficient.

Let's try to implement this logic.

Initialize:

- counts = [0] * 26  # count of each character, 'a' to 'z'

- position_lists = [[] for _ in range(n)]  # list of characters with count i

- for each character 'a' to 'z':

- position_lists[0].append('a')  # all start with count 0

For each position i from 1 to n:

- a_i = trace[i-1]

- Choose any character from position_lists[a_i]

- Assign that character to position i

- Increment its count: counts[char] +=1

- Move the character from position_lists[a_i] to position_lists[a_i+1]

This should work.

Wait, but in the earlier example, there was confusion about the trace values. Assuming the trace is correct as per the problem's assurance, this approach should yield a valid string.

Let's test this approach with the first example:

n=11, trace=[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

Initialize:

counts: [0,0,0,...,0] for a to z

position_lists:

position_lists[0]: ['a','b','c',...,'z']

position_lists[1-10]: empty

Process each position:

1. a_1=0: choose any from position_lists[0], say 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=1, move 'a' to position_lists[1]

2. a_2=0: choose any from position_lists[0], 'b', assign 'b', counts['b']=1, move 'b' to position_lists[1]

3. a_3=0: choose 'c', assign 'c', counts['c']=1, move to position_lists[1]

4. a_4=1: choose any from position_lists[1], 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=2, move 'a' to position_lists[2]

5. a_5=0: choose 'd', assign 'd', counts['d']=1, move to position_lists[1]

6. a_6=2: choose from position_lists[2], 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=3, move to position_lists[3]

7. a_7=0: choose 'e', assign 'e', counts['e']=1, move to position_lists[1]

8. a_8=3: choose from position_lists[3], 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=4, move to position_lists[4]

9. a_9=1: choose from position_lists[1], 'b' or 'c' or 'd' or 'e'. Choose 'b', assign 'b', counts['b']=2, move to position_lists[2]

10. a_10=1: choose from position_lists[1], 'c' or 'd' or 'e'. Choose 'c', assign 'c', counts['c']=2, move to position_lists[2]

11. a_11=4: choose from position_lists[4], 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=5, move to position_lists[5]

So, the string would be "abca dec a", but according to the example, it's "abracadabra". This suggests that my choice of characters is not matching the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose characters in a specific order, like alphabetically.

In the first step, when choosing from position_lists[0], I should choose the smallest available character.

Let me try that:

1. a_1=0: choose 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=1, move to position_lists[1]

2. a_2=0: choose 'b', assign 'b', counts['b']=1, move to position_lists[1]

3. a_3=0: choose 'c', assign 'c', counts['c']=1, move to position_lists[1]

4. a_4=1: choose 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=2, move to position_lists[2]

5. a_5=0: choose 'd', assign 'd', counts['d']=1, move to position_lists[1]

6. a_6=2: choose 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=3, move to position_lists[3]

7. a_7=0: choose 'e', assign 'e', counts['e']=1, move to position_lists[1]

8. a_8=3: choose 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=4, move to position_lists[4]

9. a_9=1: choose 'b', assign 'b', counts['b']=2, move to position_lists[2]

10. a_10=1: choose 'c', assign 'c', counts['c']=2, move to position_lists[2]

11. a_11=4: choose 'a', assign 'a', counts['a']=5, move to position_lists[5]

So, the string is "abc daeca", which is different from "abracadabra". This suggests that choosing the smallest available character doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps in the example, they are choosing characters in a different order.

But the problem says "any string s that corresponds to the given trace", so multiple strings might be valid, as long as they satisfy the trace conditions.

In this case, "abc daeca" might be a valid string for the given trace, but the example provides "abracadabra". Both could be valid, depending on the choices made at each step.

But according to my earlier manual counting, "abracadabra" doesn't match the provided trace [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4], because in position 10, 'a' has appeared 4 times before, but a_10=1 in the trace, which doesn't match.

This suggests that either the example is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Given that, I'll proceed with the approach of choosing the smallest available character at each step, which should ensure that the string is lexicographically smallest, but according to the problem, any valid string is acceptable.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to implement the above logic efficiently.

I can represent the position_lists as lists of characters for each count.

But since n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total n over all test cases is up to 2e5, it's manageable.

To optimize, I can represent position_lists as lists or queues.

In Python, using lists and appending/popping from them should be efficient enough.

Also, to map characters to their counts, I can use a list of size 26.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, the length of the string.

- Read the trace array a of size n.

- Initialize counts for each character 'a' to 'z' as 0.

- Initialize position_lists as a list of lists, where position_lists[i] contains characters with count i.

- Initially, all characters have count 0, so position_lists[0] = ['a','b',...,'z']

- Initialize an empty string s.

- For each a_i in the trace:

- Choose a character from position_lists[a_i].

- Assign that character to s.

- Increment the count of that character.

- Move the character from position_lists[a_i] to position_lists[a_i+1].

- Print the string s.

In Python, to implement position_lists, I can use lists of lists.

To choose a character from position_lists[a_i], I can pop the first character from that list.

To move it to position_lists[a_i+1], I can append it to position_lists[a_i+1].

But I need to ensure that position_lists has enough lists. I can initialize it with n+1 lists, since a_i < n.

Wait, a_i can be up to n-1, since it's the number of previous occurrences, and n can be up to 2e5, so position_lists needs to handle up to n lists.

But in practice, the maximum a_i would be less than n, but to be safe, I can initialize position_lists with n+1 empty lists.

Also, to map characters to their counts, I can use a list of size 26, with indices corresponding to 'a' to 'z'.

Wait, actually, in this approach, I don't need a separate counts list, because the position_lists take care of the counts.

Wait, no, I do need to keep track of the current count of each character to know which list to pick from.

Wait, perhaps I need to maintain both: the position_lists and the counts list.

Wait, actually, the position_lists already group characters by their counts. So, if I have position_lists[i], it contains all characters with count i.

So, I can use position_lists to both group characters by their counts and to assign characters based on a_i.

When I assign a character from position_lists[a_i], I increment its count and move it to position_lists[a_i+1].

This way, I don't need a separate counts list, as position_lists take care of the counts.

Wait, but to know which list to move the character to, I need to know its current count, which is a_i.

So, yes, position_lists[a_i] contains characters with count a_i.

When I assign one, I increment its count to a_i+1 and move it to position_lists[a_i+1].

This seems correct.

Let me try to implement this in code.

But in code, I need to handle the position_lists efficiently.

In Python, using lists for this purpose should be fine.

I can initialize position_lists as a list of n+1 lists.

But since n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but total n over all test cases is up to 2e5, it should be manageable.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

First, read t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the trace array a.

- Initialize counts for each character as 0.

- Initialize position_lists: position_lists = [ [] for _ in range(n+1) ]

- Populate position_lists[0] with 'a' to 'z'.

- Initialize an empty string s.

- For each a_i in a:

- Choose a character from position_lists[a_i].

- Assign it to s.

- Increment its count to a_i +1.

- Move it to position_lists[a_i +1].

- Print s.

In Python, to choose a character from position_lists[a_i], I can pop the first character from the list.

But to ensure that I'm choosing characters in a consistent order, I should sort the position_lists[a_i] each time before choosing.

Wait, no, since I'm popping the first character, and the lists are initialized with characters in order 'a' to 'z', it should naturally choose the smallest available character.

Yes, that should work.

Let me try this with the first example:

n=11, trace=[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

Initialize:

So, the string is "abca daeca", which is different from the example's "abracadabra". But as discussed earlier, multiple strings may satisfy the trace, so this is acceptable.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

def func():

a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for t in range(int(input())):

b = [0] * 26

n = int(input())

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

r = ''

for i in s:

x = b.index(i)

r += a[x]

b[x] += 1

print(r)

This program does the following:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the trace array s.

- Initialize a list b with 26 zeros, representing the counts of 'a' to 'z'.

- Initialize an empty string r.

- For each a_i in s:

- Find the index x of the first occurrence of a_i in b.

- Append the corresponding character a[x] to r.

- Increment b[x] by 1.

- Print r.

So, it's trying to find the first character whose current count matches a_i, append it to the result, and increment its count.

This seems similar to my earlier approach, but instead of using position_lists, it directly uses the counts list b and finds the first character with count a_i.

This should also work, as it ensures that for each position, the chosen character has the exact number of previous occurrences as specified by a_i.

In the earlier manual example, this approach would have chosen 'a' for a_i=0, then 'b' for a_i=0, then 'c' for a_i=0, then 'a' for a_i=1, and so on, which matches the earlier manual construction.

Therefore, the given program seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
