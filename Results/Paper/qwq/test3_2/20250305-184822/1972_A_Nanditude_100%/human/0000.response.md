Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n problems in a contest, each with a difficulty a_i, and each expected difficulty is b_i. Both arrays a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. The goal is to make sure that each a_i is less than or equal to the corresponding b_i by proposing new problems with certain difficulties. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, it gets inserted into array a, the array is sorted again, and then the most difficult problem (the last one after sorting) is removed.

I need to find the minimum number of new problems to propose to achieve a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. Each time I propose a new problem with difficulty w:

1. Insert w into array a.

2. Sort a in non-decreasing order.

3. Remove the last element (the largest one).

So, essentially, this operation allows me to replace the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

The question is, how do I choose w to minimize the number of operations needed to satisfy a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

2

6

1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700

800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000

Output:

2

Explanation:

- Propose w=800: a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

- Propose w=1800: a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

In this case, they proposed two problems, and it worked.

Another test case:

Input:

6

4 5 6 7 8 9

1 2 3 4 5 6

Output:

3

Explanation:

- Propose w=1: a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8]

- Propose w=2: a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7]

- Propose w=3: a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

So, in this case, three proposals were needed.

I need to find a general approach to determine the minimum number of proposals required.

Let me think about the problem step by step.

Given that both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, I can compare elements directly.

I need to ensure that for each i, a_i ≤ b_i.

If a_i > b_i, I need to reduce a_i to be ≤ b_i.

But since I can only propose new problems, which involve inserting w into a, sorting a, and removing the largest element, I need to find a way to reduce the largest elements in a.

Wait, actually, each operation allows me to insert w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, effectively, I'm replacing the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- Insert w into a.

- Sort a in non-decreasing order.

- Remove the last element, which is the largest after sorting.

So, if w is less than the current largest in a, the largest element in a will be removed and w will be inserted, potentially changing the array.

But it's not a direct replacement; it depends on the value of w.

I need to choose w such that after inserting and removing the largest element, the array a gets closer to satisfying a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

But choosing w seems flexible; I can choose any w, but presumably, to minimize the number of operations, I should choose w wisely.

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, they chose w=800 and w=1800.

After first operation:

- Insert 800 into a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700,800]

- Sort: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

- Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

After second operation:

- Insert 1800 into a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,1800]

- Sort: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200]

- Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

Similarly, in the second test case, they chose w=1, w=2, w=3.

After each operation, the array a is adjusted accordingly.

So, the strategy seems to be choosing w such that it helps in reducing the largest elements in a that are exceeding their corresponding b_i.

But is there a smarter way to minimize the number of operations?

Let me consider the following approach:

Iterate through the array b, and for each b_i, if a_i > b_i, I need to reduce a_i.

But since operations involve inserting w, sorting, and removing the largest element, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of elements in a that are greater than their corresponding b_i.

Initially, for each i, if a_i > b_i, it's a problem that needs to be fixed.

Each operation allows me to insert w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

This operation can potentially reduce the largest elements in a.

So, maybe each operation can fix one problem (i.e., make one a_i ≤ b_i that wasn't before).

But that might not always be the case, as one operation could affect multiple elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to count how many a_i > b_i, and that would be the number of operations needed.

But in the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Comparing:

- a1=1000 > b1=800 → problem

- a2=1400 > b2=1200 → problem

- a3=2000 > b3=1500 → problem

- a4=2000 > b4=1800 → problem

- a5=2200 > b5=2200 → no problem

- a6=2700 > b6=3000 → no problem (since 2700 ≤ 3000)

Wait, but in the explanation, they performed two operations and fixed it.

But according to my count, there are four problems that need to be fixed.

But in the explanation, only two operations were needed.

So, my initial thought that each operation fixes one problem is incorrect.

There must be a way that one operation can fix multiple problems.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that the operations allow me to reduce the largest elements in a.

Each operation effectively lets me replace the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the difference between a and b.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach.

Let's try that.

Initialize two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning of a and b.

Iterate through a and b, and count how many times a[i] > b[j].

But in the first example, a has four elements greater than their corresponding b, but only two operations are needed.

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of elements in a that are greater than the corresponding b, but in a way that accounts for the sorting.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of elements in a that are greater than any b[i] for all i.

Wait, no.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a and b, both sorted.

I need a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

If a_i > b_i for some i, I need to reduce a_i.

But I can only do this by proposing new problems, which involve inserting w into a, sorting a, and removing the largest element.

Each operation allows me to effectively replace the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted way.

So, perhaps each operation allows me to replace the largest element in a with a smaller value w.

But since a is sorted after insertion and then the largest is removed, it's equivalent to inserting w and then removing the largest element.

So, if w < a[n], the largest element a[n] is removed, and w is inserted.

Thus, the new array a will have w in place of a[n], but sorted appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a priority queue or heap.

But maybe a two-pointer approach can help me count the minimum number of operations required.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

Initialize a counter cnt = 0.

Initialize two pointers, i for a and j for b.

Start from the beginning of both arrays.

While i < n and j < n:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem to fix this

cnt += 1

# Effectively, we're replacing the largest element in a with w

# But since a is sorted, and we're removing the largest element,

# it's like reducing the largest element to w.

# To minimize operations, we should try to fix the smallest a[i] that are greater than b[j].

# So, we should pair the smallest a[i] > b[j] with the smallest possible w.

# Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from the end.

Actually, maybe I should start from the end of a and b.

Let me try that.

Initialize i = n-1, j = n-1.

While i >=0 and j >=0:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem

cnt +=1

# After proposing w, the largest element in a is removed.

# So, the new a will have one less element, and w is inserted.

# To minimize operations, I should choose w such that it fixes as many a[i] > b[j] as possible.

# But since w can be any value, perhaps I should choose w to be b[j], to ensure that a[i] <= b[j].

# So, set w = b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

# This effectively replaces the largest element in a with w.

# So, in each operation, I can reduce the largest element in a to b[j].

# By choosing w = b[j], I ensure that a[i] <= b[j].

# After this operation, I can move j -=1 and i -=1.

else:

# a[i] <= b[j], no need to propose a new problem.

i -=1

j -=1

Continue until all elements are checked.

In the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Start with i=5, j=5:

a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000 → propose w=3000, a becomes [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,3000] after insertion and sorting, then remove the largest, which is 3000, so a remains [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]. Wait, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps choosing w=b[j] isn't the best choice.

In the explanation, they chose w=800 and w=1800, which worked.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose w to be as small as possible to minimize the number of operations.

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of a[i] that are greater than b[i], but considering the sorted nature.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach where I count how many a[i] are greater than b[j], considering the positions.

Wait, maybe I need to find the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i-1], for all i.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of elements in a that are greater than their corresponding b.

In the first example, there are four elements in a that are greater than their corresponding b.

But only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps the number of operations is equal to the number of a[i] > b[i], but considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are greater than b[i], but starting from the end.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i] for the largest i where this holds.

Wait, maybe it's the number of a[i] that are not yet <= b[i], considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of operations by finding how many a[i] are greater than b[i], but in a way that accounts for the sorted nature of a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's the difference between the number of elements in a that are greater than their corresponding b, but considering the positions.

Wait, maybe I should look for the number of a[i] that are greater than b[i], starting from the highest i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end and count how many a[i] > b[i].

In the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Comparing from the end:

- a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000 → no problem, since 2700 ≤ 3000

- a[4]=2200 ≤ b[4]=2200 → okay

- a[3]=2000 > b[3]=1800 → problem

- a[2]=2000 > b[2]=1500 → problem

- a[1]=1400 > b[1]=1200 → problem

- a[0]=1000 > b[0]=800 → problem

Wait, but in the explanation, only two operations are needed.

So, my initial thought that the number of problems is equal to the number of a[i] > b[i] is incorrect, because in this case, there are four a[i] > b[i], but only two operations are needed.

So, there must be a way that one operation can fix multiple a[i] > b[i].

Let me think about how one operation can affect multiple elements.

When I propose a new problem with difficulty w, I insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

This operation can potentially reduce multiple a[i] > b[i], depending on the value of w and where it's inserted.

In the first example, they chose w=800 and w=1800.

After first operation (w=800):

- a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Now, comparing with b:

- a[0]=800 > b[0]=800 → no problem

- a[1]=1000 > b[1]=1200 → problem

- a[2]=1400 > b[2]=1500 → problem

- a[3]=2000 > b[3]=1800 → problem

- a[4]=2000 > b[4]=2200 → problem

- a[5]=2200 > b[5]=3000 → no problem

Wait, after first operation, there are still four problems.

Wait, that doesn't make sense, because according to the explanation, after two operations, it's fixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the operations work.

Wait, in the explanation:

- Propose w=800: a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

- Propose w=1800: a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, comparing with b:

- a[0]=800 <= b[0]=800

- a[1]=1000 <= b[1]=1200

- a[2]=1400 <= b[2]=1500

- a[3]=1800 <= b[3]=1800

- a[4]=2000 <= b[4]=2200

- a[5]=2000 <= b[5]=3000

So, all conditions are satisfied.

But in my earlier step, after the first operation, I thought there were still problems, but actually, after two operations, it's fixed.

So, perhaps one operation can fix multiple problems, depending on the value of w chosen.

In this case, choosing w=800 fixed some problems, and choosing w=1800 fixed the remaining problems.

So, perhaps the number of operations needed is equal to the number of times a[i] > b[i], but considering that one operation can fix multiple a[i] > b[i] if w is chosen appropriately.

Wait, maybe it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are greater than b[i], starting from the highest i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i] for i from 1 to n, but considering that each operation can fix one a[i] > b[i].

But in the first example, there are four a[i] > b[i], but only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps operations can fix multiple a[i] > b[i] at once.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a and b, both sorted.

I need to make a_i <= b_i for all i.

I can think of it as, for each i, a_i should not exceed b_i.

But since a is sorted, and b is sorted, there might be some relationship between the elements.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach to count the number of a[i] that are greater than b[j], and determine the minimal number of operations needed.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i-1], for all i.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the second example:

a: [4,5,6,7,8,9]

b: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Comparing:

- a[0]=4 > b[0]=1 → problem

- a[1]=5 > b[1]=2 → problem

- a[2]=6 > b[2]=3 → problem

- a[3]=7 > b[3]=4 → problem

- a[4]=8 > b[4]=5 → problem

- a[5]=9 > b[5]=6 → problem

So, all six a[i] > b[i].

But according to the explanation, only three operations are needed.

Wait, but in the explanation, they performed three operations:

- Propose w=1: a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8]

- Propose w=2: a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7]

- Propose w=3: a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a_i <= b_i for all i.

So, with three operations, they fixed all six problems.

Thus, each operation fixed two problems on average.

So, again, one operation can fix multiple problems.

So, I need to find a way to minimize the number of operations by maximizing the number of problems fixed per operation.

Perhaps I need to choose w such that it fixes as many a[i] > b[i] as possible.

But how to choose w optimally?

Wait, perhaps I can choose w to be the smallest b[j] where a[i] > b[j], and fix as many a[i] > b[j] as possible.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate through b and see how many a[i] > b[j], and choose w accordingly.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a multiset of a, and I can replace the largest element in a with any w, by performing the operation of inserting w, sorting, and removing the largest element.

Each operation allows me to effectively replace the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

So, perhaps I can model this as replacing the largest element in a with w, and choosing w as small as possible to satisfy a_i <= b_i for all i.

But I need to find the minimal number of such replacements.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], considering the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of operations needed to make a[i] <= b[i] for all i, by replacing the largest elements in a with smaller w's.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], but considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], where i ranges from 1 to n.

But in the first example, there are four a[i] > b[i], but only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], divided by some factor.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], divided by the number of a[i] that can be fixed by one operation.

But in the first example, four problems fixed by two operations, so two per operation.

In the second example, six problems fixed by three operations, so two per operation.

Is it always two per operation?

No, probably not.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], divided by the number of operations needed, but that's circular.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i-1], for all i.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me look for a pattern in the examples.

In the first example, n=6.

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

After two operations, it's fixed.

In the second example, n=6.

a: [4,5,6,7,8,9]

b: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

After three operations, it's fixed.

Is there a relationship between the number of operations and some property of a and b?

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly greater than b[i], minus the number of a[i] that are already <= b[i].

But in the first example, all a[i] > b[i], except a[4]=2200 <= b[4]=2200 and a[5]=2700 <= b[5]=3000.

Wait, no, a[4]=2200 <= b[4]=2200 → okay

a[5]=2700 <= b[5]=3000 → okay

But in reality, a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000 → no, 2700 <= 3000, so it's okay.

Wait, no, 2700 <= 3000 is true.

Wait, in the first example, a[0]=1000 > b[0]=800 → problem

a[1]=1400 > b[1]=1200 → problem

a[2]=2000 > b[2]=1500 → problem

a[3]=2000 > b[3]=1800 → problem

a[4]=2200 <= b[4]=2200 → okay

a[5]=2700 <= b[5]=3000 → okay

So, four problems.

But only two operations are needed.

So, perhaps the number of operations is equal to the number of a[i] > b[i], divided by 2.

But in the second example, six problems, three operations.

Again, divided by 2.

Is this a general rule?

Wait, perhaps.

In both examples, the number of operations is half the number of a[i] > b[i].

In the first example, four problems, two operations.

In the second example, six problems, three operations.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is ceil(number of a[i] > b[i] / 2).

Wait, but why divided by 2?

Wait, perhaps because each operation can fix two problems.

But in the first example, two operations fix four problems.

In the second example, three operations fix six problems.

Yes, it seems that each operation can fix two problems.

Is that always the case?

Wait, perhaps it's because each operation replaces the largest element in a with a new value w, which can be chosen to fix two problems.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i], and each operation can fix one problem, but in the examples, it's half.

Wait, no, in the examples, it's divided by 2.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i], and the minimal number of operations is ceil((number of a[i] > b[i]) / 2).

But I need to verify this.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i], and the minimal number of operations is the ceiling of (number of a[i] > b[i]) / 2.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the difference between a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of elements in a that are strictly larger than b[i], considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i-1], for all i.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the operations allow me to reduce the largest elements in a.

Each operation lets me insert w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, effectively, I can choose w to be as small as possible to replace the largest element in a with w.

To minimize the number of operations, I should choose w to be as small as possible, to fix as many a[i] > b[i] as possible in one operation.

Wait, perhaps I should choose w to be the smallest b[j] where a[i] > b[j].

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

Initialize a counter cnt = 0.

Initialize two pointers, i and j, pointing to the end of a and b.

While there are elements in a that need fixing:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem

cnt +=1

# Choose w to be b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

# This effectively replaces the largest element in a with b[j].

# So, a[i] is now b[j], which is <= b[j]

# Move j -=1 and i -=1

else:

# a[i] <= b[j], no need to propose a new problem.

i -=1

Continue until all elements are checked.

But in the first example, this would require four operations, but only two are needed.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to group the problems and fix them in batches.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the maximum number of a[i] > b[i] at any position.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[i], considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i], divided by how many can be fixed per operation.

But I need a better way to think about this.

Let me look for an algorithmic approach.

Suppose I have two sorted arrays a and b.

I need to make a_i <= b_i for all i.

I can perform operations to replace the largest element in a with any w, by inserting w, sorting, and removing the largest element.

Each operation allows me to effectively replace the largest element in a with w.

So, perhaps I can model this as replacing the largest elements in a with values from b.

But I need to choose w optimally to fix as many a[i] > b[i] as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach to match a[i] with b[j].

Let me try that.

Initialize two pointers, i and j, starting from the end of a and b.

Initialize cnt = 0.

While i >=0 and j >=0:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem

cnt +=1

# Choose w = b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

# This effectively replaces the largest element in a with b[j].

# So, a[i] is now b[j], which is <= b[j]

# Move i -=1 and j -=1

else:

# a[i] <= b[j], no need to propose a new problem.

i -=1

Continue until all elements are checked.

In the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Start with i=5, j=5:

a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000 → propose w=3000, a becomes [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,3000] after insertion and sorting, then remove the largest, which is 3000. So, a remains [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]. Wait, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps choosing w=b[j] isn't the right choice.

In the explanation, they chose w=800 and w=1800.

So, perhaps I need to choose w to be as small as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose w to be the smallest b[j] where a[i] > b[j].

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through a and b, and count how many times a[i] > b[j], and group them in pairs.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a multiset of a, and I can replace the largest element with any w by performing operations.

Each operation allows me to insert w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

This is similar to replacing the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

So, effectively, I can set the largest element in a to be w, but ensuring that w is less than or equal to the previous largest element.

But I need to make a_i <= b_i for all i.

Given that a and b are sorted, perhaps I can find the point where a[i] > b[i], and fix those.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of elements in a that are strictly larger than b[i], considering the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i-1], for all i.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of operations is equal to the maximal number of a[i] > b[j] that cannot be paired with a[i] <= b[j].

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i], considering the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's the difference between the number of a[i] > b[i] and the number of a[i] <= b[i].

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i], divided by the number of problems fixed per operation.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me look for a standard algorithm or concept that relates to this problem.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the problem of finding the number of elements that are not in their correct positions in a sorted array.

But not quite.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

But I don't see the direct connection.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of inversions between a and b.

But inversions are between pairs of elements, and here, it's about making a_i <= b_i for all i.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i], considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's the difference between the number of a[i] > b[i] and the number of a[i] <= b[i].

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I can use binary search to find, for each a[i], the position in b where b[j] >= a[i], and count the operations needed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the two-pointer approach to count the minimal number of operations.

Let me try that.

Initialize cnt = 0.

Initialize two pointers, i=0 and j=0.

While i < n and j < n:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem

cnt +=1

# Choose w to be b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

# This effectively replaces the largest element in a with b[j].

# So, a[i] is now b[j], which is <= b[j]

# Move i +=1 and j +=1

else:

# a[i] <= b[j], no need to propose a new problem.

i +=1

Continue until all elements are checked.

In the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Start with i=0, j=0:

a[0]=1000 > b[0]=800 → propose w=800, cnt=1, i=1, j=1

Now, a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] after insertion and removal.

a[1]=1000 > b[1]=1200 → propose w=1200, cnt=2, i=2, j=2

Now, a becomes [800,1000,1200,1400,2000,2000]

a[2]=1200 > b[2]=1500 → propose w=1500, cnt=3, i=3, j=3

Now, a becomes [800,1000,1200,1400,1500,2000]

a[3]=1400 > b[3]=1800 → propose w=1800, cnt=4, i=4, j=4

Now, a becomes [800,1000,1200,1400,1500,1800]

a[4]=1500 <= b[4]=2200 → no problem, i=5, j=4

a[5]=1800 <= b[5]=3000 → no problem, i=6, j=5

So, cnt=4, but in the explanation, only two operations are needed.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose w more strategically.

In the explanation, they chose w=800 and w=1800.

After first operation (w=800):

a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

After second operation (w=1800):

a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, a_i <= b_i for all i.

So, perhaps choosing w=800 fixes multiple a[i] > b[i].

Wait, choosing w=800 replaces the largest element in a with 800, which affects multiple elements in a.

Wait, no, it replaces the largest element with w, but in a sorted manner.

Wait, perhaps each operation can fix multiple a[i] > b[j] if w is chosen appropriately.

So, perhaps I need to choose w to be the smallest b[j] where a[i] > b[j], and fix as many a[i] > b[j] as possible with one w.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to merging intervals.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set of inequalities a_i <= b_i for all i.

Given that a and b are sorted, perhaps I can use a sliding window or some cumulative count.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] that are strictly larger than b[i], but considering that each operation can fix multiple a[i] > b[i].

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times a[i] > b[i], divided by the number of a[i] that can be fixed per operation.

But I need to find a way to maximize the number of problems fixed per operation.

Wait, perhaps each operation can fix up to two problems.

In the first example, two operations fix four problems.

In the second example, three operations fix six problems.

So, perhaps each operation can fix exactly two problems.

Is that always the case?

Wait, perhaps it's because each operation replaces the largest element in a, which can affect multiple a[i] > b[i].

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is ceil(number of a[i] > b[i]) / 2).

In the first example, ceil(4/2) = 2.

In the second example, ceil(6/2) = 3.

Which matches the number of operations in the explanations.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is ceil(number of a[i] > b[i]) / 2).

But I need to verify if this is always true.

Let me consider a simple test case.

Test case 1:

n=2

a: [1,2]

b: [1,2]

Here, a_i <= b_i for all i, so no operations are needed.

Number of a[i] > b[i] is 0, ceil(0/2) = 0. Correct.

Test case 2:

n=3

a: [1,2,3]

b: [1,2,3]

Similarly, no operations needed.

Test case 3:

n=3

a: [2,3,4]

b: [1,2,3]

Here, a[0]=2 > b[0]=1 → problem

a[1]=3 > b[1]=2 → problem

a[2]=4 > b[2]=3 → problem

Number of problems: 3

According to the formula, ceil(3/2) = 2 operations are needed.

But can it be fixed with two operations?

Let's see:

First operation: choose w=1, insert into a: [1,2,3,4], sort: [1,2,3,4], remove largest: [1,2,3]

Now, a: [1,2,3]

All a_i <= b_i. So, fixed with one operation.

Wait, but according to the formula, ceil(3/2)=2, but in reality, one operation suffices.

So, the formula is incorrect.

Hence, my previous assumption is wrong.

So, perhaps it's not always ceil(number of a[i] > b[i])/2).

In this case, ceil(3/2)=2, but only one operation suffices.

So, the formula overestimates the number of operations needed.

Hence, I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of a[i] > b[i], minus the number of operations that can fix multiple problems.

But this is too vague.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through a and b from the end, and count how many a[i] > b[j], considering that one operation can fix multiple a[i] > b[j].

Wait, perhaps it's the number of a[i] > b[j], where j is the corresponding position.

But I need a clear algorithm.

Let me look back at the problem description.

Given that a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, and we need to make a_i <= b_i for all i.

Each operation allows us to insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

So, effectively, we're replacing the largest element in a with w.

We need to choose w optimally to minimize the number of operations.

Perhaps, to minimize the number of operations, we should choose w to be as small as possible, to fix as many a[i] > b[j] as possible.

Wait, perhaps choosing w to be the smallest b[j] where a[i] > b[j].

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end, and for each a[i] > b[j], choose w = b[j], and fix as many a[i] > b[j] as possible.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a multiset of a, and I can replace the largest element with any w in each operation.

I need to make sure that after all operations, a_i <= b_i for all i.

I need to find the minimal number of such replacements.

Given that a and b are sorted, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

Initialize cnt = 0.

Initialize a pointer j = n-1 for array b.

For i from n-1 downto 0:

if a[i] > b[j]:

# Need to propose a new problem

cnt +=1

# Choose w = b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

# This effectively replaces the largest element in a with b[j].

# So, a[i] is now b[j], which is <= b[j]

# Move j -=1

else:

# a[i] <= b[j], no need to propose a new problem.

Continue

In the first example:

a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b:
