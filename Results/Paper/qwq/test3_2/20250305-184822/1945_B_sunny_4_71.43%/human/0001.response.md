Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: one every 'a' minutes and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. The first installation launches fireworks at times a, 2a, 3a, and so on. Similarly, the second installation launches at times b, 2b, 3b, and so on. Each firework is visible from the time it's launched up to m minutes after its launch, inclusive. So, if a firework is launched at time t, it's visible at times t, t+1, t+2, ..., up to t+m.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any single minute. To do this, I should consider the launch times and the visibility periods of the fireworks from both installations.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to consider the launch times and see how many visibility periods overlap at any given time. But since the numbers can be very large (up to 10^18), I need an efficient way to calculate this without simulating every possible time.

I recall that when dealing with intervals, to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals, one common approach is to sort the start and end times and then iterate through them while keeping track of the current number of active intervals.

But given the potentially large values of a, b, and m, sorting all possible launch times isn't feasible. I need a smarter way.

Let's consider the launch times of both installations:

- Installation 1: a, 2a, 3a, ...

- Installation 2: b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each firework from installation 1 is visible from t to t + m, where t is a multiple of a.

Similarly, for installation 2, from t to t + m, where t is a multiple of b.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these intervals overlap.

First, I should consider if there are any times when fireworks from both installations are launching close enough that their visibility periods overlap.

To maximize the number of visible fireworks at a single time, I need to find a time where as many fireworks as possible are within their visibility periods.

Let me consider the launch times and see how many fireworks are visible at those times.

For installation 1, at time ka (where k is a positive integer), a firework is launched and is visible from ka to ka + m.

Similarly, for installation 2, at time lb (where l is a positive integer), a firework is launched and is visible from lb to lb + m.

I need to find a time t where the number of fireworks visible at t is maximized.

To find t, I need to find a time that falls within as many visibility intervals as possible.

Since the launches are periodic with periods a and b, and visibility durations m, I need to find t such that t is in the range [ka, ka + m] for as many k as possible, and similarly for l and b.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let's think about how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any time t.

For installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of integers k such that ka <= t <= ka + m.

Similarly, for installation 2, it's the number of integers l such that lb <= t <= lb + m.

So, for each installation, I need to count the number of launch times whose visibility intervals include t.

Then, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these counts for both installations.

To maximize this sum, I need to find t where both counts are as high as possible.

But since the installations are launching at different intervals, their visibility intervals will overlap in certain patterns.

I need to find a time t where the number of overlapping visibility intervals is maximized.

This seems tricky, especially with large values of a, b, and m.

Maybe I can think in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, since that's when the launch times of both installations align.

But even then, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Let me try to consider small examples to get some intuition.

Take the first sample input:

6

6 7 4

So, a=6, b=7, m=4

Installation 1 launches at 6, 12, 18, 24, ...

Installation 2 launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, ...

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes: from t to t+4.

Let's see when these visibility periods overlap.

At t=7:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at t=6 is visible from 6 to 10

- Firework from installation 2 launched at t=7 is visible from 7 to 11

So, at t=7, both fireworks are visible. That's 2 fireworks.

The sample output is 2, so in this case, the maximum is 2.

Another sample input:

3 4 10

Installation 1: launches at 3, 6, 9, 12, ...

Each firework visible from t to t+10.

Installation 2: launches at 4, 8, 12, 16, ...

Similarly, visible from t to t+10.

Let's see at t=12:

- From installation 1: fireworks launched at 3, 6, 9, 12

  - 3: 3-13

  - 6: 6-16

  - 9: 9-19

  - 12:12-22

- From installation 2: fireworks launched at 4, 8, 12

  - 4:4-14

  - 8:8-18

  - 12:12-22

At t=12, all these fireworks are visible:

From installation 1: 3,6,9,12

From installation 2:4,8,12

That's 4 + 3 = 7 fireworks, which matches the sample output.

Okay, so in this case, the maximum number is 7.

Similarly, for the third sample input:

7 8 56

Installation 1: launches at 7,14,21,28,...

Each firework visible from t to t+56.

Installation 2: launches at 8,16,24,32,...

At t=56:

- Installation 1: fireworks launched at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56

  - 7:7-63

  -14:14-70

  -21:21-77

  -28:28-84

  -35:35-91

  -42:42-98

  -49:49-105

  -56:56-112

- Installation 2: fireworks launched at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56

  -8:8-64

  -16:16-72

  -24:24-80

  -32:32-88

  -40:40-96

  -48:48-104

  -56:56-112

At t=56, all these fireworks are visible:

From installation 1: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56 (8 fireworks)

From installation 2:8,16,24,32,40,48,56 (7 fireworks)

Total: 8 + 7 = 15 fireworks.

But the sample output is 17, so maybe I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more launch times.

Let's calculate how many launch times from each installation have visibility periods covering t=56.

For installation 1:

ka <= t <= ka + m

ka <= 56 <= ka + 56

So, ka <=56 and ka >=56 -56 => ka >=0, but ka is at least 7.

So, ka can be 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56.

That's 8 fireworks.

For installation 2:

lb <=56 <= lb +56

lb <=56 and lb >=0.

lb is at least 8.

So, lb can be 8,16,24,32,40,48,56.

That's 7 fireworks.

Total: 8 +7=15.

But the sample output is 17, so maybe there's an overlap or something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps some fireworks are launched at times that are multiples of both a and b, meaning ka = lb for some k and l, which would be the LCM of a and b.

In this case, a=7 and b=8, which are co-prime, so LCM is 56.

So, at t=56, there is a launch from both installations, but I already included that.

Still, 8 +7=15, but sample output is 17.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider a different t.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider t beyond just the LCM.

Wait, perhaps at t=112.

Let's see:

For installation 1:

ka <=112 <= ka +56

ka <=112 and ka >=112 -56=56.

So, ka from 56 to 112 in steps of 7.

ka=56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112.

That's 9 fireworks.

Installation 2:

lb <=112 <= lb +56

lb <=112 and lb >=112 -56=56.

lb from 56 to 112 in steps of 8.

lb=56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112.

That's 8 fireworks.

Total:9 +8=17, which matches the sample output.

So, at t=112, there are 17 visible fireworks.

Okay, now I need a general way to calculate this for any a, b, and m.

From these examples, it seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of the number of launch times from each installation whose visibility periods include some optimal t.

So, for each installation, I need to count how many launch times have t in their visibility period, and then sum these counts for both installations, choosing t to maximize this sum.

Given that, I need to find t such that the sum is maximized.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all possible t.

Let's think about how to calculate, for a given installation, the number of launch times whose visibility periods include t.

For installation 1:

Number of k such that ka <= t <= ka + m, which is equivalent to t - m <= ka <= t.

Since ka is a multiple of a, this is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a).

Similarly, for installation 2: floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b).

So, for any t, the total number of visible fireworks is:

floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over t.

But t can be very large, so I need to find the optimal t without iterating through all possibilities.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to directly compute the maximum.

First, note that the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

I recall that floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) can be simplified.

In general, floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

So, this is counting how many launch times from each installation fall within [t - m, t].

To maximize the sum, I need to choose t where the combined number of launch times from both installations in [t - m, t] is maximized.

This sounds similar to finding the time interval where the most launch events occur from both installations.

But since the launch schedules are periodic, perhaps there is a mathematical way to find this maximum without iterating through all t.

Let me consider the launch times as two arithmetic sequences: a, 2a, 3a, ... and b, 2b, 3b, ...

I need to count how many terms from each sequence fall within [t - m, t], and sum these counts.

To maximize the sum, I need to find t where the union of these intervals contains the most launch events.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to calculate the maximum by considering the possible overlaps.

Let me consider the possible t values where launches occur from either installation, as these are the points where the number of visible fireworks can change.

So, potential t values are multiples of a and b.

I need to check these points and see which one gives the maximum sum.

But with a and b up to 10^18, iterating through all multiples isn't feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps I can find a formula based on the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

Let’s denote L = LCM(a, b).

The launch times repeat every L minutes.

Within each L-minute interval, the launch patterns repeat.

Therefore, I can consider t within [0, L), and the maximum number of visible fireworks will be the same as in any interval of length L.

But L can be up to 10^18 * 10^18, which is way too big, so this approach isn't practical.

I need another way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t and express the number of visible fireworks from each installation.

For installation 1:

Number of k such that ka <= t <= ka + m, which is equivalent to floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/ a)

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks at t is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/ a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/ b)

I need to maximize this sum over t.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I recall that floor(t / a) can be expressed in terms of division, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the possible values of floor(t / a) and floor(t / b), and see how they change as t increases.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for installation 1, the number of visible fireworks is the number of launch times k*a in [t - m, t].

Similarly for installation 2.

So, for installation 1, the number of k such that k*a >= t - m and k*a <= t.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, for installation 1, the number of k is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/ a)

Similarly for installation 2.

I need to maximize the sum of these two expressions over t.

I need to find t that maximizes floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/ a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/ b)

This seems complicated, but perhaps there is a way to find t that maximizes each term individually and then see if they can be maximized simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when t is a multiple of a and b, or at some other specific points.

Wait, in the third sample input, the maximum occurred at t=112, which is a multiple of both a and b (since LCM(7,8)=56, and 112 is 2*56).

Similarly, in the first sample input, t=7 is a multiple of b but not a, and in the second sample input, t=12 is a multiple of both.

Maybe the maximum occurs at a multiple of LCM(a,b), or at some other specific points.

But I need to consider general cases.

Let me consider the case where a and b are equal.

Suppose a = b = c, and m is some value.

Then, both installations launch at c, 2c, 3c, etc.

The number of visible fireworks at time t is the number of launch times k*c in [t - m, t] from both installations.

So, it's 2 * (number of k such that k*c in [t - m, t])

But if t is chosen such that [t - m, t] includes as many multiples of c as possible, then the maximum would be 2 * floor(m / c) + 2 (since t and t - m could both be multiples of c).

Wait, but this might overcount if t is exactly a multiple of c.

I need to be careful.

Alternatively, perhaps in general, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1 from installation 1 plus floor(m / b) +1 from installation 2.

But in the first sample input, m=4, a=6, floor(4/6)+1=1, and floor(4/7)+1=1, total 2, which matches the sample.

In the second sample input, m=10, a=3, floor(10/3)+1=4, and floor(10/4)+1=3, total 7, which matches the sample.

In the third sample input, m=56, a=7, floor(56/7)+1=9, and floor(56/8)+1=8, total 17, which matches the sample.

Wait, but earlier I thought t=56 gave 8 +7=15, but according to this, it's 9 +8=17.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Let me recalculate for t=56:

Installation 1: floor(56 /7) +1 =8 +1=9

Installation 2: floor(56 /8) +1=7 +1=8

Total:17, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the formula is simply floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But let's check with the first sample:

m=4, a=6, floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, total=0+0+2=2, which matches the sample.

Second sample: m=10, a=3, floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, total=3+2+2=7, matches.

Third sample: m=56, a=7, floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, total=8+7+2=17, matches.

Fourth sample: m=78123459896, a=5, floor(78123459896 /5)=15624691979, floor(78123459896 /6)=13020576649, total=15624691979 +13020576649 +2=28645268630, matches the sample.

Fifth sample: m=1, a=1, floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, total=1+1+2=4, matches the sample.

Sixth sample: m=1000000000000000000, a=1, floor(1000000000000000000 /1)=1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000 /1)=1000000000000000000, total=1000000000000000000 +1000000000000000000 +2=2000000000000000002, matches the sample.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is correct.

But wait, in the first sample, floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0 + 0 + 2 =2, which matches.

In the second sample, floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, 3 + 2 + 2=7, matches.

In the third sample, floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, 8 +7 +2=17, matches.

So, this seems to be the correct formula.

Therefore, the program should compute floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 and print that.

Looking back at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

A = int(m / a) + 1

B = int(m / b) + 1

print(A + B)

This computes floor(m / a) +1 for installation 1 and floor(m / b) +1 for installation 2, and sums them up.

So, it's computing floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2, which matches the formula I derived.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
