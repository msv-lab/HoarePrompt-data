Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

There are n cows with distinct ratings, each in a position from 1 to n. The tournament works by starting with a match between the first two cows, and then the winner continues to match against the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow in the line, or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand how the tournament proceeds without any swaps.

Let's consider the initial arrangement:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, ..., n

Cows: a1, a2, a3, ..., an

Where ai is the rating of cow i.

The first match is between position 1 and 2. The higher-rated cow wins and proceeds to the next match against position 3, and so on, until all cows have been matched.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

Optionally, I can swap cow k with any other cow in the line, only once.

I need to decide whether to swap, and if so, with whom, to maximize cow k's wins.

Let me think about how cow k can participate in the tournament.

Case 1: Without swapping.

- Cow k is in position k.

- To win matches, it needs to reach the matches where it can participate.

- The tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner of the previous match plays the next cow in line.

- So, for cow k to get a chance to play, it needs to be in a position where the previous matches have led to it.

- Essentially, cow k can only play if it's in a position after the current winner has been determined.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins cow k can get in the original arrangement.

But that might be inefficient for large n.

Let me think differently.

In the tournament, the process is:

1. Match position 1 and 2, winner proceeds to match with position 3, and so on.

So, it's like a single elimination tournament where the winner continues.

In this setup, the number of wins a cow can achieve depends on how many cows it can defeat in sequence before losing to a higher-rated cow.

Given that all ratings are distinct, there are no ties.

My cow k has rating a_k.

I need to maximize the number of wins it achieves.

Optionally, I can swap cow k with any other cow in the line, only once.

So, I need to decide:

- Should I swap cow k with another cow to a better position?

- Or is it better to keep it in its original position?

I need to find the optimal choice that maximizes cow k's wins.

Let me consider the original arrangement first.

In the original arrangement, cow k is in position k.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2, the higher-rated wins and proceeds.

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs position 3.

- And so on, until all cows have been matched.

Cow k can only participate if it's in a position where it's chosen to play against the current winner.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many cows have higher ratings than cow k.

Because cow k can only win against cows with lower ratings.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that it can encounter before facing a cow with a higher rating.

But in the tournament structure, the matches are sequential, and the winner continues.

So, cow k can only win if it's chosen to play and its rating is higher than the opponent.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of wins by considering the position of cow k and the ratings of the cows before it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the tournament in terms of a sequence of matches where the winner continues.

Let me try to simulate a small example.

Example 1 from the problem:

n=6, k=1

a = [12,10,14,11,8,3]

So, positions: 1:12, 2:10, 3:14, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

Tournament:

Match 1: 1 vs 2 -> 12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 2: winner (12) vs 3 (14) -> 14 wins.

Match 3: 14 vs 4 (11) -> 14 wins.

Match 4: 14 vs 5 (8) -> 14 wins.

Match 5: 14 vs 6 (3) -> 14 wins.

So, cow 1 (rating 12) wins only once.

But in the explanation, it says that by not swapping, cow 1 wins once, and swapping doesn't help.

Wait, in the explanation, they say it's optimal to do nothing, and cow 1 wins once.

But in the simulation above, cow 1's rating is 12, which loses to 14 in the second match.

So, cow 1 wins only once.

Now, let's see if swapping cow 1 with another cow could help.

Suppose I swap cow 1 with cow 3 (rating 14).

Then, positions: 3:14, 2:10, 1:12, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

Wait, no. If I swap cow 1 with cow 3, then positions become:

1:14, 2:10, 3:12, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

Tournament:

Match 1: 14 vs 10 -> 14 wins.

Match 2: 14 vs 12 -> 14 wins.

Match 3: 14 vs 11 -> 14 wins.

Match 4: 14 vs 8 -> 14 wins.

Match 5: 14 vs 3 -> 14 wins.

So, cow 1 (now rating 14) wins 5 times.

But wait, cow k is still cow 1, but now it has rating 14.

But in the problem statement, k refers to the original cow, not the position.

Wait, no. k is the index of my cow.

Wait, the problem says: "cow k", which is in position k.

So, if I swap cow k with another cow, I'm swapping the positions.

Wait, let's clarify:

- I own cow k, which is initially in position k.

- I can choose to swap cow k with another cow in the line, meaning I can choose to move cow k to another position by swapping it with the cow in that position.

- Or, I can choose not to swap.

So, in the above example, n=6, k=1.

a = [12,10,14,11,8,3]

If I choose not to swap, cow 1 stays in position 1, and as per the tournament, it wins once.

If I choose to swap cow 1 with cow 3, then positions become:

position 1: 14, position 3:12.

Wait, no. If I swap cow 1 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 14), then:

- position 1: cow 3 with rating 14

- position 3: cow 1 with rating 12

Then, the tournament proceeds as:

Match 1: position 1 (14) vs position 2 (10) -> 14 wins.

Match 2: position 1 (14) vs position 3 (12) -> 14 wins.

Match 3: position 1 (14) vs position 4 (11) -> 14 wins.

Match 4: position 1 (14) vs position 5 (8) -> 14 wins.

Match 5: position 1 (14) vs position 6 (3) -> 14 wins.

So, cow 1, which is now in position 3 with rating 12, doesn't get to play anymore because the winner is always position 1 with rating 14.

Wait, but according to the problem, in each match, it's the winner of the previous match vs the next cow in line.

So, in this case, position 1 vs position 2, then winner vs position 3, and so on.

So, in this swapped scenario, position 1 (rating 14) vs position 2 (10), 14 wins.

Then, 14 vs position 3 (12), 14 wins.

Then, 14 vs position 4 (11), 14 wins.

Then, 14 vs position 5 (8), 14 wins.

Then, 14 vs position 6 (3), 14 wins.

So, cow 1, which is now in position 3 with rating 12, doesn't get to play at all.

Hence, it wins 0 times.

But in the original arrangement, it wins once.

Hence, in this case, it's better not to swap.

Wait, but in the explanation, they say that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing, and cow 1 wins once.

But in the swapped scenario, cow 1 wins zero times, which is worse.

Hence, indeed, it's better not to swap.

Now, let's look at the second test case.

n=6, k=5

a = [7,2,727,10,12,13]

So, cow 5 has rating 12.

Optionally, I can swap cow 5 with any other cow.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow 5.

In the original arrangement:

Positions: 1:7, 2:2, 3:727, 4:10, 5:12, 6:13

Tournament:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 -> 7 wins.

Match 2: 7 vs 727 -> 727 wins.

Match 3: 727 vs 10 -> 727 wins.

Match 4: 727 vs 12 -> 727 wins.

Match 5: 727 vs 13 -> 727 wins.

So, cow 5 (rating 12) doesn't get to play at all.

Hence, wins = 0.

But in the explanation, they swap cow 5 (12) with position 3 (727).

So, positions become:

1:7, 2:2, 5:12, 3:727, 4:10, 6:13

Wait, no.

Wait, if I swap cow 5 with position 3, then:

position 3: cow 5 with rating 12

position 5: cow 3 with rating 727

Wait, but in the explanation, they swap cow 5 to position 3, meaning swap cow 5 with cow 3.

So, positions become:

1:7, 2:2, 5:727, 3:12, 4:10, 6:13

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, cow k is cow 5, with rating 12.

Swapping cow k with another cow means swapping its position with another cow.

So, if I swap cow 5 with position 3 (cow with rating 727), then:

- position 3 now has cow 5 with rating 12

- position 5 now has cow 3 with rating 727

Wait, but in the explanation, they say swap cow k to position 3, meaning move cow k to position 3 by swapping with the cow in position 3.

Hence, positions become:

position 1:7, position 2:2, position 3:12, position 4:10, position 5:727, position 6:13

Then, tournament proceeds as:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 -> 7 wins.

Match 2: 7 vs 12 -> 12 wins.

Match 3: 12 vs 10 -> 12 wins.

Match 4: 12 vs 727 -> 727 wins.

Match 5: 727 vs 13 -> 727 wins.

So, cow 5 (now in position 3 with rating 12) wins twice.

Then, in the original arrangement, cow 5 wins zero times.

Hence, by swapping, it wins twice.

So, in this case, swapping is beneficial.

Another example:

n=2, k=2

a=[1000000000,1]

So, cow 2 has rating 1.

Tournament:

Match 1: position 1 (1000000000) vs position 2 (1) -> 1000000000 wins.

Hence, cow 2 wins zero times.

If I swap cow 2 with position 1, then positions become:

position 1:1, position 2:1000000000

Tournament:

Match 1:1 vs 1000000000 -> 1000000000 wins.

So, cow 2 (now in position 2 with rating 1000000000) wins once.

Hence, by swapping, cow k wins once, which is better than zero.

Hence, in this case, swapping is beneficial.

So, in summary:

- In the first test case, swapping doesn't help, and it's better not to swap.

- In the second test case, swapping helps, and cow k can win more matches.

- In the third test case, swapping helps, increasing the wins from zero to one.

Hence, I need to find a way to determine the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve, either by swapping or not swapping.

Now, I need to find a general approach to solve this problem efficiently, considering the constraints:

- t <= 10^4 test cases

- n <= 10^5 per test case

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 10^5

Hence, the total time should be O(t*n) = O(10^5), which is acceptable.

I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand how many wins cow k can achieve in the original arrangement.

Then, consider the effect of swapping cow k with another position.

I need to choose the best position to swap cow k to, to maximize its wins.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate this without trying all possible swaps.

Let me think about the tournament process.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs position 3

- ...

- Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs position n

So, the winner of each match proceeds to the next match against the next cow in line.

Hence, the tournament can be viewed as the initial winner (between position 1 and 2) fighting its way through the line, defeating each subsequent cow until it loses.

Similarly, if I swap cow k with another position, I'm effectively changing the position of cow k in this sequence.

I need to find the position where, if cow k is placed there, it can win the maximum number of matches.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many cows with lower ratings are before cow k in the sequence.

But it's not just about the number of lower-rated cows before it, because the tournament structure affects who cow k gets to play against.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where cow k can be placed such that it can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow.

Given that, perhaps I can find the maximum number of consecutive cows after the chosen position that have lower ratings than cow k.

But I need to consider the tournament structure, where the winner continues to the next match.

Hence, perhaps I need to find the position where, starting from that position, cow k can defeat the maximum number of cows before facing a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider two scenarios:

1. Not swapping: calculate the number of wins cow k achieves in the original position.

2. Swapping: choose a position to swap cow k to, and calculate the number of wins it achieves from that position.

Then, take the maximum between these two.

Now, how to calculate the number of wins for cow k in a given position.

Given that the tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner continues, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

Hence, if I place cow k in position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, it's not just about the cows after position p, because the winner has to continue fighting the next cows in line.

Hence, perhaps I need to find, for each possible position p where I can place cow k, the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

But this seems inefficient for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the original arrangement first.

In the original arrangement, cow k is in position k.

I can simulate the tournament and see how many wins cow k achieves.

But simulating the tournament for each test case would be O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.

But I need to optimize it.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position, how many wins cow k would achieve if it were placed at that position.

Then, choose the position that maximizes cow k's wins.

But precomputing for each position might be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to calculate, for a given position p, the number of wins cow k would achieve if placed at p.

Given that, I can iterate through possible positions to swap cow k to, calculate the wins for each, and choose the maximum.

But with n up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I don't swap cow k, then in the original arrangement, I can calculate how many wins cow k achieves.

Then, consider swapping cow k with another cow, say cow m, and calculate how many wins cow k achieves in position m.

Then, choose the maximum between the two.

Now, how to calculate the number of wins for cow k in a given position.

Let me consider that.

If I place cow k in position p, then in the tournament, cow k will participate in matches starting from position p.

It will win against all cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Hence, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

This is similar to finding the number of elements less than cow k's rating in the suffix starting from position p, until the first element that is greater than cow k's rating.

Wait, but in the tournament, it's not exactly that, because the winner has to proceed to the next match.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

But that might be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner continues to the next match.

Hence, the number of wins for cow k is equal to how many cows it can defeat in a row before it loses.

So, if I place cow k in position p, then the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Hence, for each possible p, I need to find the number of cows after p with lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Then, choose the p that maximizes this number.

But iterating over all p is too slow for n up to 1e5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position p where cow k should be placed to maximize the number of lower-rated cows after p before encountering a higher-rated cow.

This sounds like finding the best position to place cow k to maximize the number of cows it can defeat in sequence.

Let me think about sorting.

But the positions are in a specific order, and I can only swap cow k with one other cow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where the cow has the lowest rating possible, but higher than cow k, and place cow k just before that position.

But I need to maximize the number of wins, which is the number of cows with lower ratings after position p before encountering a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position p where the cows after p have the maximum number of cows with ratings less than cow k, before encountering a cow with rating greater than cow k.

Hence, I need to find, in the array, the position p where the suffix from p has the maximum number of cows with ratings less than cow k, before encountering a cow with rating greater than cow k.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place cow k.

Then, the number of wins is equal to the length of the sequence of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Hence, for each p, I need to find the length of the sequence from p onwards where a_i < a_k, until the first a_i > a_k.

I need to maximize this length over all possible p.

But again, iterating over all p is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from left to right, keeping track of the maximum rating seen so far, and for each position, determine how many cows can be defeated by cow k if placed there.

Wait, perhaps I need to find, for each position p, the number of cows from p to n that have a_i < a_k, until the first a_i > a_k.

This sounds like computing, for each p, the length of the suffix from p where a_i < a_k until a_i > a_k.

To compute this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate from right to left, keeping track of the number of cows with a_i < a_k until I encounter a cow with a_i > a_k.

Then, for each p, I can have this count.

But I need to do this efficiently.

Let me try to think about it.

Let me iterate from right to left, and keep a counter that increments by 1 for each cow with a_i < a_k, and resets when I encounter a cow with a_i > a_k.

Then, for each p, I can have the number of cows after p that are less than a_k until the first cow greater than a_k.

This can be done in O(n).

Then, for each possible p, I can have the number of wins if I place cow k at p.

Then, I can choose the p that maximizes this number, and also consider not swapping.

Hence, the maximum number of wins is the maximum between:

- The number of wins in the original position k.

- The maximum number of wins over all possible positions p.

But I need to make sure that I can only swap cow k with one other cow.

Wait, no, I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow, meaning I can choose any position p to place cow k, as long as I swap it with the cow in position p.

Hence, I can choose any position p != k, or choose not to swap.

Hence, I need to consider all positions p, including p = k (not swapping), and find the maximum number of wins over all p.

But in the problem, swapping means choosing to swap cow k with another cow, meaning changing its position.

Hence, p can be any position from 1 to n, including staying in the original position.

Wait, no. If I choose not to swap, cow k remains in position k.

If I choose to swap, I choose to swap cow k with another cow, meaning moving cow k to another position.

Hence, p can be any position from 1 to n, including p = k (not swapping).

Hence, I need to consider all p from 1 to n, and find the maximum number of wins over all p.

Hence, I need to compute, for each p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p.

Then, take the maximum over all p.

But computing this for each p separately would be too slow.

Hence, I need a way to compute this efficiently for all p.

Let me think about how to compute the number of wins for cow k placed at position p.

It's equal to the number of cows after p (positions p+1 to n) that have a_i < a_k, until the first a_i > a_k.

This is similar to computing, for each p, the length of the suffix from p where a_i < a_k until the first a_i > a_k.

To compute this efficiently, I can iterate from right to left, keeping a counter that increments by 1 for each a_i < a_k, and resets to 0 when a_i > a_k.

Then, for each p, the number of wins is the precomputed value at p.

Hence, I can precompute an array wins[p], which is the number of wins if cow k is placed at position p.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value in the wins array.

But I need to ensure that I'm not swapping cow k with itself, but in this approach, p can be any position, including p = k.

Hence, this should be fine.

Wait, but in reality, if I swap cow k with another cow, I'm swapping the positions of cow k and the other cow.

Hence, if I choose to place cow k at position p, I need to make sure that I'm swapping it with the cow currently at position p.

But in this approach, I'm considering placing cow k at any position p, which is equivalent to swapping it with the cow at position p.

Hence, this seems valid.

Hence, I can proceed with this approach.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, and the array a of size n.

b. Find the rating of cow k: a_k = a[k-1] (0-indexed).

c. Precompute an array wins[p], which is the number of wins if cow k is placed at position p.

- Initialize a counter, say count = 0.

- Iterate from p = n-1 down to 0:

- If a[p] < a_k:

- count += 1

- Else if a[p] > a_k:

- count = 0

- wins[p] = count

d. The maximum number of wins is the maximum value in the wins array.

2. Output the maximum number of wins for each test case.

Wait, but in the problem, t can be up to 10^4, and n up to 10^5, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5.

Hence, the total time should be O(sum of n) = O(10^5), which is acceptable.

Now, let's verify this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

a_k = 12

Compute wins[p] for p from 0 to 5:

p=5: a[5]=3 <12 => count=1, wins[5]=1

p=4: a[4]=8 <12 => count=2, wins[4]=2

p=3: a[3]=11 <12 => count=3, wins[3]=3

p=2: a[2]=14 >12 => count=0, wins[2]=0

p=1: a[1]=10 <12 => count=1, wins[1]=1

p=0: a[0]=12 ==a_k, but since a_i are distinct, this shouldn't happen.

Wait, a_i are distinct, so a[0]=12, which is greater than a_k=12? Wait, no, a_k=a[0]=12.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they say that without swapping, cow 1 wins once.

But in this approach, wins[0]=1, which seems correct.

But in reality, in the tournament:

Match 1: 12 vs 10 -> 12 wins.

Match 2: 12 vs 14 -> 14 wins.

Hence, cow 1 wins once.

Hence, wins[0]=1 is correct.

If I swap cow 1 with position 3 (rating 14):

Positions: 14,10,12,11,8,3

Tournament:

Match 1:14 vs 10 ->14 wins.

Match 2:14 vs 12 ->14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11 ->14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 8 ->14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3 ->14 wins.

Hence, cow 1 (now rating 14) wins 5 times.

But in the explanation, they say it's better not to swap, and cow 1 wins once.

Wait, but according to this approach, wins[0]=1, wins[1]=1, wins[2]=0, wins[3]=3, wins[4]=2, wins[5]=1

Hence, the maximum is 3, which corresponds to placing cow k at position 3.

But in reality, placing cow k at position 3 (rating 12) would result in:

Tournament:

Match 1: position 1 (original a[0]=12) vs position 2 (10) ->12 wins.

Match 2:12 vs position 3 (original a[2]=12) -> equal ratings? But ratings are distinct.

Wait, in the swap, cow k (original a[0]=12) is placed at position 3, and cow original at position 3 (a[2]=14) is placed at position 0.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is flawed.

I need to ensure that when I place cow k at position p, I need to replace the cow at position p with cow k, and keep the rest of the cows in their positions.

Hence, in the array a, for position p, a[p] is now a_k, and the original cow k is now at position p.

Wait, no, if I swap cow k with position p, then:

- The cow at position p goes to position k.

- Cow k goes to position p.

Hence, in the array a, a[p] becomes a_k, and a[k-1] becomes a[p].

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the array a when swapping.

But in my earlier approach, I assumed that I can place cow k at any position p, and set a[p] = a_k, but that might not be accurate because swapping affects both positions.

Hence, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider two scenarios:

1. Not swapping: calculate the number of wins cow k achieves in its original position.

2. Swapping: choose to swap cow k with another cow m, and calculate the number of wins cow k achieves in position m.

Then, take the maximum between these two.

Now, how to calculate the number of wins in the original position.

Simulate the tournament until cow k gets a chance to play, and count how many wins cow k achieves.

Similarly, for swapping, choose to swap cow k with cow m, place cow k at position m, and simulate the tournament to see how many wins cow k achieves.

But simulating for each possible m is too slow.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match continues to the next match.

Hence, the number of wins for cow k is equal to how many cows with lower ratings than cow k it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

Hence, if I place cow k in position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Hence, I can precompute for each position p, the number of wins if cow k is placed at p.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings than cow k.

Whenever I encounter a cow with a higher rating, I reset the counter.

Then, for each p, the number of wins is the precomputed value.

Hence, I can compute this in O(n).

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value among all p.

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seemed to give an incorrect result.

Wait, in the first test case:

n=6, k=1

a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

a_k=12

Compute wins[p]:

p=5: a[5]=3 <12 => wins[5]=1

p=4: a[4]=8 <12 => wins[4]=2

p=3: a[3]=11 <12 => wins[3]=3

p=2: a[2]=14 >12 => wins[2]=0

p=1: a[1]=10 <12 => wins[1]=1

p=0: a[0]=12 ==a_k => wins[0]=1 (since a[0] == a_k, but a_i are distinct, so this shouldn't happen)

Hence, maximum wins is 3, but according to the explanation, it's only 1.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when placing cow k at position p, the tournament proceeds with the new arrangement.

Hence, I need to simulate the tournament with cow k at position p, and see how many wins it achieves.

In the first test case, placing cow k at position 3 would result in:

a=[12,10,12,11,8,3]

Wait, but ratings are distinct, so a=[12,10,14,11,8,3], swapping k=1 with p=3 would make a=[14,10,12,11,8,3]

Then, tournament:

Match 1:14 vs 10 ->14 wins.

Match 2:14 vs 12 ->14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11 ->14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 8 ->14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3 ->14 wins.

Hence, cow k (original k=1, now rating 12 in position 3) doesn't get to play after match 2.

Hence, it only wins once.

But according to my earlier approach, wins[3]=3, which is incorrect.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when placing cow k at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, but also considering that the winner has to proceed through the matches.

Hence, perhaps I need to find the number of cows with lower ratings after p that are defeated before cow k faces a cow with a higher rating.

But this is still unclear.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.

Hence, the number of wins for cow k is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are between the position where cow k is placed and the position where it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Hence, perhaps I need to find, for each possible position p where I place cow k, the number of cows after p with lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Then, choose the p that maximizes this number.

To compute this efficiently, I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings than cow k, and reset when I encounter a cow with a higher rating.

Then, for each p, the number of wins is the precomputed value.

In the first test case:

a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

a_k=12

Compute wins[p]:

p=5: a[5]=3 <12 => wins[5]=1

p=4: a[4]=8 <12 => wins[4]=2

p=3: a[3]=11 <12 => wins[3]=3

p=2: a[2]=14 >12 => wins[2]=0

p=1: a[1]=10 <12 => wins[1]=1

p=0: a[0]=12 ==a_k => wins[0]=1

Hence, maximum wins is 3, but in reality, placing cow k at position 3 results in only 1 win.

Hence, my approach is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner has to proceed to the next match.

Hence, the number of wins for cow k placed at position p is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, but also considering that the winner has to defeat these cows in sequence.

Hence, perhaps I need to find the length of the decreasing sequence after p, where a_i < a_k, until the first a_i > a_k.

Hence, it's similar to finding the length of the decreasing sequence from p onwards, bounded by a cow with a higher rating.

Hence, I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings than a_k, and reset when I encounter a cow with a higher rating.

Then, for each p, wins[p] is this count.

In the first test case:

p=5: a[5]=3 <12 => wins[5]=1

p=4: a[4]=8 <12 => wins[4]=2

p=3: a[3]=11 <12 => wins[3]=3

p=2: a[2]=14 >12 => wins[2]=0

p=1: a[1]=10 <12 => wins[1]=1

p=0: a[0]=12 ==a_k => wins[0]=1

But in reality, placing cow k at p=3 results in only 1 win, not 3.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when placing cow k at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, but also considering that the winner has to proceed through these matches.

Hence, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, minus one, because cow k itself is placed at p.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner has to proceed to the next match, so the number of wins for cow k placed at p is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

But in reality, when I place cow k at p, I need to see how many cows after p it can defeat before facing a cow it can't defeat.

Hence, it's indeed the number of cows after p with lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Hence, my earlier approach seems correct, but in the first test case, it's giving wins[3]=3, while in reality, cow k only wins once when placed at p=3.

Hence, there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when placing cow k at p, the tournament proceeds with the new arrangement, and cow k only gets to play if it's chosen in the sequence.

In the first test case, placing cow k at p=3:

a=[14,10,12,11,8,3]

Tournament:

Match 1:14 vs 10 ->14 wins.

Match 2:14 vs 12 ->14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11 ->14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 8 ->14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3 ->14 wins.

Hence, cow k (rating 12) only wins once, in match 2.

Hence, wins=1.

But according to my earlier approach, wins[3]=3, which is incorrect.

Hence, my approach overcounts the wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract 1 from the count, because cow k only wins against the cows that are after it and have lower ratings, but it doesn't count the win against the cow it's placed at.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p with lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, minus one, if p >1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about another approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for cow k placed at p is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, minus one, because the first win is against the cow at position p.

But in the above example, placing cow k at p=3, a[3]=11 <12, so cow k would win against it, but then the winner (cow k) proceeds to match 4 against a[4]=8, which is less than 12, so another win, and then against a[5]=3, another win.

Hence, it should win 3 times, but in reality, in the swapped arrangement, cow k only wins once, in match 2.

Hence, my approach is still incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when I place cow k at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating, but only if cow k gets to play against those cows.

But in the swapped arrangement, cow k might not get to play against all those cows.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the path that cow k takes in the tournament.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cow k placed at p will play against the winner of the previous matches.

Hence, to maximize cow k's wins, I need to place it in a position where the previous winner has a lower rating than cow k, and there are as many lower-rated cows after that.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to find a different way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner is the cow with the highest rating among the first i cows that have been matched.

Hence, the winner of the tournament is the cow with the highest rating.

But for cow k, I want to maximize its number of wins.

Hence, I need to place cow k in a position where it can participate in as many matches as possible, defeating lower-rated cows before facing a higher-rated cow.

Hence, perhaps I need to place cow k as early as possible, but not before higher-rated cows.

Wait, perhaps I need to place cow k just after the highest-rated cow, so it can defeat all the lower-rated cows after that.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that the number of wins for cow k placed at p is equal to the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than cow k, until the first cow with a higher rating.

Hence, to maximize this, I need to find the position p where this count is maximum.

Hence, I can precompute this array as before.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum value in this array.

In the first test case, this approach gives wins[3]=3, but in reality, cow k only wins once when placed at p=3.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

I need to find a better way.
