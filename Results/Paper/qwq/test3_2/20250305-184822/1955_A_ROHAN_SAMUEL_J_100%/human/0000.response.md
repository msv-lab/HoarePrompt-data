Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. There are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of money Maxim has to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which tells me how many scenarios I need to handle. For each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price per yogurt if bought individually, and b is the price for buying two yogurts together under the promotion.

My goal is to output the minimum cost for each test case.

Let me think about how to approach this problem. I need to decide whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs under the promotion.

One way to think about it is to see if the promotional price for two yogurts is better than buying two yogurts individually. So, if b is less than 2*a, then it's cheaper to buy them in pairs under the promotion. Otherwise, it's better to buy them individually.

But there's a catch here. Sometimes, even if b is less than 2*a, depending on the value of n, it might be better to buy some yogurts in pairs and some individually.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that when buying two yogurts, he can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price. But I think the intention is that he can choose to buy any number of pairs under the promotion and the remaining individually, but he has to buy exactly n yogurts.

Let me consider some examples to understand better.

Take the first example from the input:

2 5 9

So, n=2, a=5, b=9.

If he buys two yogurts individually, it would cost 2*5=10 burles.

But there's a promotion where he can buy two yogurts for 9 burles, which is less than 10. So, he should choose the promotion, and the total cost is 9 burles.

That makes sense.

Next example:

3 5 9

n=3, a=5, b=9.

If he buys one pair under promotion for 9 burles and one individually for 5 burles, the total is 14 burles.

Alternatively, if he buys all three individually, it would be 3*5=15 burles, which is more.

So, the minimum is 14 burles.

Another example:

3 5 11

n=3, a=5, b=11.

If he buys one pair under promotion for 11 burles and one individually for 5 burles, the total is 16 burles.

But if he buys all three individually, it's 15 burles.

So, in this case, it's better to buy all three individually.

Wait, but in the example output, it shows 15 burles for this case.

Wait, no. Looking back, the third output in the example is 15, which corresponds to n=3, a=5, b=11.

So, buying one pair for 11 and one individually for 5 totals 16, but buying all three individually is 15, which is cheaper.

Hence, the minimum is 15 burles.

Last example:

4 5 11

n=4, a=5, b=11.

If he buys two pairs under promotion, that's 2*11=22 burles.

If he buys all four individually, it's 4*5=20 burles.

So, buying individually is cheaper at 20 burles.

Wait, but in the example output, it shows 20 burles.

Wait, no. Looking back, the fourth output in the example is 20, which corresponds to n=4, a=5, b=11.

So, buying all four individually costs 20 burles, which is cheaper than buying two pairs at 22 burles.

Hence, the minimum is 20 burles.

From these examples, it seems that when n is even, he can buy n/2 pairs under promotion, and when n is odd, he can buy (n-1)/2 pairs under promotion and one individually.

But, he should also consider whether buying individually is cheaper than the promotion.

Wait, in the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11.

If he buys one pair under promotion (11 burles) and one individually (5 burles), total is 16 burles.

But buying all three individually is 15 burles, which is cheaper.

So, in this case, it's better to buy all individually.

Similarly, in the fourth example, n=4, a=5, b=11.

Buying two pairs under promotion would cost 22 burles, while buying all four individually costs 20 burles, which is cheaper.

So, sometimes buying all individually is better, even if n is even.

Hence, I need to compare the cost of buying as many pairs as possible under promotion plus any remaining individual yogurts, versus buying all individually.

Wait, but in the first example, n=2, a=5, b=9.

Buying one pair under promotion costs 9 burles, while buying two individually costs 10 burles. So, promotion is better.

In the second example, n=3, a=5, b=9.

Buying one pair under promotion and one individually costs 9+5=14 burles, while buying all three individually costs 15 burles. So, promotion is better.

In the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11.

Buying one pair under promotion and one individually costs 11+5=16 burles, while buying all three individually costs 15 burles. So, buying all individually is better.

In the fourth example, n=4, a=5, b=11.

Buying two pairs under promotion costs 22 burles, buying all four individually costs 20 burles. So, buying individually is better.

So, it seems that I need to consider both options and choose the one with the minimum cost.

Wait, but in the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11.

The output is 15, which is buying all individually.

But according to the code provided, it would do n//2 * b + a for odd n.

So, n=3, n//2=1, so 1*11 +5=16, which is more than buying all individually.

Hence, the code seems to be missing the comparison between buying as many pairs as possible plus remaining individually versus buying all individually.

Similarly, in the fourth example, n=4, a=5, b=11.

The code would do n//2 * b = 2*11=22, which is more than buying all individually at 4*5=20.

But according to the code, it seems that for even n, if 2*a < b, it buys all individually, else buys n//2 pairs under promotion.

Wait, looking back at the code:

if n % 2:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b + a)

elif 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b)

So, for odd n, it checks if 2*a < b, if yes, buys all individually, else buys n//2 pairs under promotion and one individually.

For even n, if 2*a < b, buys all individually, else buys n//2 pairs under promotion.

This seems to align with what I thought earlier.

Let me verify with the third example: n=3, a=5, b=11.

n is odd, so it checks if 2*a < b, which is 10 < 11, which is True, so it prints a*n, which is 15 burles.

Which matches the example output.

Similarly, for n=4, a=5, b=11.

n is even, 2*a=10 < 11, so it prints a*n=20 burles.

Again, matches the example.

Another test case: n=2, a=5, b=9.

n is even, 2*a=10 > 9, so it prints n//2 * b =1*9=9 burles.

Matches the first example.

And for n=3, a=5, b=9.

n is odd, 2*a=10 >9, so it prints n//2 * b +a=1*9 +5=14 burles.

Which matches the second example.

So, the code seems to be correct.

But wait, in the third example, n=3, a=5, b=11.

According to the code, since n is odd, it checks if 2*a < b, which is 10 <11, True, so it prints a*n=15 burles.

Which is correct, as buying all individually is cheaper than buying one pair under promotion and one individually.

Similarly, for n=4, a=5, b=11.

n is even, 2*a=10 <11, so it buys all individually for 20 burles, which is cheaper than buying two pairs under promotion for 22 burles.

Hence, the code seems to handle both cases correctly.

I think the code is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly n yogurts given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts.

## Approach
1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the values of n (number of yogurts), a (price per yogurt), and b (promotional price for two yogurts).
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If n is odd:
     - Check if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them under the promotion. 
     - If 2*a < b, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
     - Otherwise, buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion and the remaining yogurt individually.
   - If n is even:
     - Check if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them under the promotion.
     - If 2*a < b, buy all yogurts individually.
     - Otherwise, buy yogurts in pairs under the promotion.
3. **Output the Results**: For each test case, print the minimum cost calculated.

## Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print((n // 2) * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b)

func()
```

## Explanation
- **Odd Number of Yogurts**: 
  - If buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion (2*a < b), it's better to buy all yogurts individually.
  - Otherwise, buy as many pairs as possible under the promotion and the remaining yogurt individually.
- **Even Number of Yogurts**:
  - If buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion (2*a < b), buy all yogurts individually.
  - Otherwise, buy yogurts in pairs under the promotion.
  
This approach ensures that Maxim spends the minimum possible amount for each test case by dynamically choosing between individual and promotional prices based on the given parameters.
