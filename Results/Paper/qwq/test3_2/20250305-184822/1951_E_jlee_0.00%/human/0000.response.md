Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of substrings that, when concatenated, give me the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], right?

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Okay, let's think about when such a partition would not exist. If every possible substring of the string is a palindrome, then I couldn't partition it in a way that none of the parts is a palindrome. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Even if the entire string is a palindrome, I could still partition it into smaller substrings that might not be palindromes.

For example, take "aaa". The whole string is a palindrome, but if I partition it into ["a", "a", "a"], each part is a single "a", which is a palindrome. So that doesn't satisfy the condition. Another partition could be ["aa", "a"], but "aa" is a palindrome. So in this case, no matter how I partition "aaa", every substring will be a palindrome because all substrings of "aaa" are "a", "aa", and "aaa", all of which are palindromes. Therefore, for "aaa", the answer should be "NO".

On the other hand, for a string like "abc", I can partition it into ["abc"], and "abc" is not a palindrome, so "YES" with one part.

What about "abba"? It's a palindrome, so partitioning it into ["abba"] wouldn't work because "abba" is a palindrome. But I could partition it into ["a", "bba"], but "a" is a palindrome. Alternatively, ["ab", "ba"], but "ab" is not a palindrome and "ba" is not a palindrome, so this would be a valid partition.

Wait, is "ba" a palindrome? Wait, "ba" is not a palindrome because it's not the same forwards and backwards. "ba" backwards is "ab", which is different. So ["ab", "ba"] is a valid partition where neither part is a palindrome.

So, for "abba", the answer is "YES" with two parts: "ab" and "ba".

Another example: "aabbaa". This is also a palindrome. Can I partition it into substrings that are not palindromes?

One way is to partition it into ["aab", "baa"]. Is "aab" a palindrome? No, because "aab" backwards is "baa", which is different. Similarly, "baa" backwards is "aab", which is different. So both parts are not palindromes. So "YES" with two parts.

Another partition could be ["a", "abba", "a"], but "a" is a palindrome, so that's invalid. Or ["aa", "bbaa"], but "aa" is a palindrome. So the first partition I thought of, ["aab", "baa"], is valid.

So, from these examples, it seems that if the string itself is not a palindrome, I can just take the whole string as one part. If the string is a palindrome, I need to try partitioning it into smaller substrings that are not palindromes.

But, as seen in "abba", I can partition it into ["ab", "ba"], which are both not palindromes.

Wait, but in "aaa", no matter how I partition it, each substring is a palindrome. So, for strings where all possible substrings are palindromes, the answer is "NO".

So, I need to find a way to check if it's possible to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome.

Let me think about the properties of the string.

First, if the string is not a palindrome, I can take the whole string as one part, and it's done.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to partition it into at least two parts, and none of those parts should be palindromes.

So, for a palindrome string, I need to check if I can split it into two or more substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abba", I could split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "aaa", any split like "a" and "aa", but "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, so no good. Or "aa" and "a", same issue. Or "a", "a", "a", all are palindromes.

So, for "aaa", it's impossible.

Similarly, for "aabbaa", I can split it into "aab" and "baa", both not palindromes.

Wait, but "aab" is "aab", which is not a palindrome, and "baa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "baa" is "baa", which is not the same as "aba", so it's not a palindrome.

Yes, that works.

What about "racecar"?

It's a palindrome. If I try to split it into "r", "aceca", "r", but "r" is a palindrome, which is bad.

Alternatively, "ra", "cec", "ar". "ra" is not a palindrome, "cec" is a palindrome, "ar" is not a palindrome. So, "cec" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Another way: "rac", "ecar". "rac" is not a palindrome, "ecar" is not a palindrome. So, this works.

So, for "racecar", the answer is "YES" with two parts: "rac" and "ecar".

So, seems like for any palindrome string, as long as its length is greater than 1, I can split it into two parts that are not palindromes.

Wait, but in "aaa", splitting into "a" and "aa", both are palindromes.

So, maybe for strings where all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition without having at least one palindrome.

Wait, but in "aabbaa", which has mixed characters, I could split it into "aab" and "baa", both not palindromes.

In "abba", I could split it into "ab" and "ba".

In "racecar", I could split it into "rac" and "ecar".

So, perhaps the key is whether all characters in the string are the same.

If all characters are the same, then any substring is a palindrome, so "NO".

Otherwise, "YES", and I can split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abba", all characters are not the same, and I can split it into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

In "aabbaa", same logic.

In "racecar", it's similar.

What about "aaa", all characters are the same, so "NO".

What about "aaabaaa"?

It's not a palindrome, but has many 'a's.

If I take the whole string as one part, it's not a palindrome, so "YES".

Wait, but the problem says to partition into some substrings, so taking the whole string as one part is allowed if it's not a palindrome.

But if the whole string is a palindrome, then I need to split it into smaller parts, each not a palindrome.

And in that case, as long as I can find a split where neither part is a palindrome, it's "YES".

But in "aaa", no matter how I split it, each part is a palindrome, so "NO".

So, perhaps the condition is: if the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one part being the whole string.

If the string is a palindrome, then check if I can split it into two parts, neither of which is a palindrome.

And to check that, I can try splitting it into two parts in different ways and see if I can find at least one way where neither part is a palindrome.

But for efficiency, maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about palindromes.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

So, for a string to be a palindrome, s[0] == s[-1], s[1] == s[-2], and so on.

So, if s[0] != s[-1], then it's not a palindrome.

If s[0] == s[-1], but some other characters don't match, it's not a palindrome.

But in the case where s[0] == s[-1], and the string is a palindrome, then I need to split it.

So, perhaps I can check:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part.

- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts, and check if neither part is a palindrome.

- If I can find such a split, output "YES" with those two parts.

- If not, output "NO".

But I need to make sure that both parts are not palindromes.

So, for example, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works, because neither is a palindrome.

In "aaa", splitting into "a" and "aa" doesn't work, because both are palindromes.

What about splitting "aaa" into "aa" and "a"? Same issue.

Or "a", "a", "a". Still all palindromes.

So, for strings where all characters are the same, it's impossible.

Otherwise, I can try to split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

But how do I ensure that neither part is a palindrome?

Well, for example, in "abba", both "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

In "racecar", splitting into "rac" and "ecar", neither is a palindrome.

In "aabbaa", splitting into "aab" and "baa", neither is a palindrome.

Wait, but "baa" is "baa", which is not a palindrome.

Yes, because "baa" reversed is "aab", which is different.

So, in general, for a palindrome string of length n, if I split it into two parts of lengths k and n-k, I need to ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

What properties should k and n-k have for this to be true?

Well, for example, in "abba", splitting into k=2 and n-k=2, both parts are not palindromes.

In "racecar", splitting into k=3 and n-k=4, neither part is a palindrome.

In "aaa", splitting into k=1 and n-k=2, both parts are palindromes.

Similarly, k=2 and n-k=1, both are palindromes.

So, for "aaa", no matter how I split, both parts are palindromes.

Similarly, for "aaabaaa", it's not a palindrome, so I can take the whole string as one part, which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "aaabaaa" is not a palindrome because it's "aaabaaa", and reversed is "aaabaaa", which is different.

So, in that case, I can take the whole string as one part.

But let's consider a palindrome string like "aaabaaa", but actually, it's not a palindrome.

Wait, "aaabaaa" reversed is "aaa.ba.a", which is "aaabaaa", wait no, "aaabaaa" reversed is "aaa ba a", but in code, it's treated as a single string without spaces.

Wait, "aaabaaa" reversed is "aaa baa", which is different from "aaabaaa", so it's not a palindrome.

Hence, I can take the whole string as one part.

So, in summary:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts, ensuring neither part is a palindrome.

- If I can find such a split, output "YES" with those two parts.

- If I cannot find such a split, output "NO".

Now, how do I implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints: t test cases, each with a string up to 10^6 characters, and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

So, I need an efficient way to check if a string is a palindrome and to find a suitable split if it is a palindrome.

First, checking if a string is a palindrome can be done in O(n) time by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.

If the string is not a palindrome, I can immediately output "YES" with one part.

If it is a palindrome, I need to try splitting it into two parts, and check if neither part is a palindrome.

To do this efficiently, I need to find a way to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

One approach is to iterate through possible split points and check if both parts are not palindromes.

But this would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome, and I split it into two parts, what conditions must be met for both parts to not be palindromes?

Let's consider that for a string s of length n, if I split it at position k (1 <= k < n), then the two parts are s[0..k-1] and s[k..n-1].

I need to ensure that neither s[0..k-1] nor s[k..n-1] is a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[0] == s[n-1], s[1] == s[n-2], and so on.

So, for s[0..k-1] to not be a palindrome, there must be at least one pair of characters in s[0..k-1] that do not match when compared from the ends.

Similarly for s[k..n-1].

But checking this directly for each possible k is too slow.

Is there a way to precompute the longest prefix that is a palindrome, or something like that?

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

But how do I find such a k efficiently?

Let me consider that for a palindrome string, if I split it into two parts where one part is a palindrome and the other is not, it might still not satisfy the condition that neither part is a palindrome.

I need both parts to not be palindromes.

So, perhaps I can find a split where one part is shorter than the other, and use some property based on the lengths.

Wait, maybe I can look for a split where one part has an odd length and the other has an even length, or something like that.

But that might not necessarily make them non-palindromes.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that if the string is a palindrome and consists of all identical characters, then any split will have parts that are palindromes.

For example, "aaa" split into "aa" and "a", both are palindromes.

Similarly, "aa" and "aa" would both be palindromes.

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's impossible to split without having palindromes.

Similarly, "abba" can be split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps the key is whether all characters in the string are the same.

If all characters are the same, then any substring is a palindrome, so "NO".

Otherwise, I can split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abba", all characters are not the same, and I can split it into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

In "aabbaa", which has mixed characters, I can split it into "aab" and "baa", both not palindromes.

In "racecar", I can split it into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

So, it seems that if the string is a palindrome and consists of repeated characters, like "aaa", then "NO".

Otherwise, "YES".

Wait, but "abba" is a palindrome and consists of repeated character pairs, but I can split it into non-palindromes.

So, perhaps the condition is that if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, then "NO", else "YES".

Let me test this.

- "aaa": palindrome, all characters same -> "NO"

- "abba": palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES"

- "abc": not palindrome -> "YES"

- "aabbaa": palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES"

- "aaabaaa": not palindrome -> "YES"

- "a": palindrome, all characters same -> "NO"

- "bb": palindrome, all characters same -> "NO"

- "abcba": palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES"

Seems consistent.

So, the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one part being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Otherwise (string is a palindrome but not all characters are the same), output "YES" with a suitable split into two parts, neither of which is a palindrome.

Now, how do I implement this efficiently?

First, check if the string is a palindrome.

If not, output "YES" and the whole string.

If it is a palindrome, check if all characters are the same.

If they are, output "NO".

Otherwise, output "YES" and provide a split into two parts, neither of which is a palindrome.

To find such a split, I can look for a k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

Since the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, such a k must exist.

To find such a k efficiently, I can iterate through possible split points and check if both parts are not palindromes.

But this would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that since the string is a palindrome, s[0] == s[-1], s[1] == s[-2], and so on.

If I split the string into two parts of lengths k and n-k, then for neither part to be a palindrome, I need:

- s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome

- s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome

Given that s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] is equal to the reverse of s[0..n-1-k].

So, if s[0..k-1] is not equal to its reverse, then s[k..n-1] will also not be equal to its reverse, because s is a palindrome.

Wait, is that necessarily true?

Let me think about "abba".

It's a palindrome.

If I split it into "ab" and "ba", "ab" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, in "racecar", splitting into "rac" and "ecar", "rac" is not a palindrome, and "ecar" is not a palindrome.

So, perhaps, for any split where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, s[k..n-1] will also not be a palindrome, because s is a palindrome.

Is that always true?

Wait, consider "aabbaa", which is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aab" and "baa", "aab" is not a palindrome, and "baa" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, "aaabaaa", but it's not a palindrome, so I don't need to consider splits for it.

Wait, but "aabbaa" is a palindrome.

Wait, is "aabbaa" a palindrome?

Wait, "aabbaa" reversed is "aabbaa", so yes, it's a palindrome.

So, splitting into "aab" and "baa", neither is a palindrome.

Similarly, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba", neither is a palindrome.

So, perhaps, for any palindrome string that doesn't consist of all identical characters, I can always find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

How can I find such a k efficiently?

One way is to find the smallest k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, such a k must exist.

To find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, I can iterate k from 1 to n-1 and check for each k if s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

But this would be O(n^2) in the worst case.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix palindrome lengths.

That is, compute for each position i, the length of the longest palindrome prefix ending at i.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there must be some k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

To find such a k efficiently, perhaps I can find the minimal k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[0] == s[n-1], s[1] == s[n-2], and so on.

So, for s[0..k-1] to not be a palindrome, there must be some position i < k-1 such that s[i] != s[k-1-i].

Wait, but k-1-i >= 0.

This seems complicated.

Is there a way to find the minimal k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome in O(n) time?

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the longest palindromic prefix.

Compute the longest prefix that is a palindrome, and then choose k such that k > length of the longest palindromic prefix.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, in "abba", the longest palindromic prefix is the whole string, since "abba" is a palindrome.

In "aabbaa", same thing.

In "aaabaaa", it's not a palindrome, so I don't need to split it.

Wait, but for strings that are palindromes, I need to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

I need to find k such that neither s[0..k-1] nor s[k..n-1] is a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, such a k must exist.

To find it efficiently, perhaps I can look for a k where s[0..k-1] is not equal to s[n-k..n-1], which would imply that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, since s[n-k..n-1] is equal to s[0..k-1] reversed.

Wait, but s is a palindrome, so s[n-k..n-1] = s[0..k-1].

Wait, that's confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix k, then s[0..k-1] should not be equal to its reverse, and s[k..n-1] should not be equal to its reverse.

But s is a palindrome, so s[k..n-1] is equal to s[0..n-1-k].

So, if s[0..k-1] != s[0..k-1][reversed], and s[k..n-1] != s[k..n-1][reversed], then both parts are not palindromes.

But since s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] = s[0..n-1-k].

Wait, maybe I should look for k such that s[0..k-1] != s[n-k..n-1], which would mean s[0..k-1] != s[0..k-1][reversed], implying s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, s[k..n-1] != s[k..n-1][reversed].

But since s[k..n-1] = s[0..n-1-k], and s[0..n-1-k] should be equal to s[k..n-1][reversed] because s is a palindrome.

This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps a better approach is to observe that if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where splitting would result in two non-palindromic parts.

To find such a k efficiently, perhaps I can iterate k from 1 to n-1 and find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, such a k must exist.

To check if s[0..k-1] is a palindrome, I can precompute the prefix palindromic lengths using some string matching algorithm like Manacher's algorithm, but that might be too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use hashing to check if s[0..k-1] is a palindrome in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

But that might be overkill.

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Given that s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I can choose k such that s[0..k-1] contains at least two different characters, which would make it not a palindrome.

But this might not always be true.

Wait, for example, in "abba", choosing k=2, s[0..1] = "ab", which is not a palindrome.

Similarly, in "aabbaa", choosing k=3, s[0..2] = "aab", which is not a palindrome.

In "racecar", choosing k=3, s[0..2] = "rac", which is not a palindrome.

So, perhaps choosing k such that s[0..k-1] contains at least two different characters would work.

But in "aaa", all characters are the same, so any s[0..k-1] is a palindrome.

So, in general, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where s[0..k-1] contains different characters, making it not a palindrome.

To find such a k efficiently, I can iterate through the string and find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] contains at least two different characters.

This can be done in O(n) time by keeping track of the unique characters in the prefix.

Once I find such a k, I can split the string into s[0..k-1] and s[k..n-1], both of which are not palindromes.

Because s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome by construction, and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome because s is a palindrome, so s[k..n-1] = s[0..n-1-k], which is the reverse of s[k..n-1], and since s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1], s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, s[k..n-1] = s[0..n-1-k], but s[0..n-1-k] is the reverse of s[k..n-1].

So, if s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1], then s[k..n-1] != s[k..n-1][reversed], meaning it's not a palindrome.

Therefore, choosing k such that s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1] would ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

But since s is a palindrome, s[0..k-1] == s[n-k..n-1].

Wait, s is a palindrome, so s[0..k-1] == s[n-k..n-1].

Therefore, if s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1], then s[k..n-1] != s[0..k-1], which implies that s[k..n-1] != s[k..n-1][reversed], so it's not a palindrome.

Similarly, s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1], so s[0..k-1] != s[0..k-1][reversed], meaning it's not a palindrome.

Therefore, choosing any k where s[0..k-1] != s[k..n-1] would work.

But since s is a palindrome, s[0..k-1] == s[n-k..n-1].

Therefore, s[0..k-1] == s[k..n-1] only if s[k..n-1] == s[n-k..n-1], which is true only if k == n/2 and n is even, or something like that.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps a better approach is to iterate through possible k values and find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, such a k must exist.

To find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, I can:

- Iterate k from 1 to n-1.

- For each k, check if s[0..k-1] is a palindrome.

- The first k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome is the one I need.

But this would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a way to find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome in O(n) time.

To do this, I can precompute the longest prefix that is a palindrome.

Then, any k greater than this length will have s[0..k-1] not being a palindrome.

To compute the longest prefix that is a palindrome, I can use the KMP algorithm to find the longest prefix that is also a suffix.

Wait, but that gives the longest prefix that is also a suffix, not necessarily a palindrome.

Wait, no, the KMP failure function gives the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix.

But I need the longest prefix that is a palindrome.

That's different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use hashing to compute whether s[0..k-1] is a palindrome in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

I can compute the hash of s[0..k-1] and its reverse, and check if they are equal.

If not, then it's not a palindrome.

This way, I can find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome in O(n) time.

This seems feasible.

So, the plan is:

- For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If s is not a palindrome, output "YES" and the whole string.

- If s is a palindrome:

- Check if all characters are the same.

- If they are, output "NO".

- Otherwise, find the smallest k (1 <= k < n) where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

- Output "YES", followed by two parts: s[0..k-1] and s[k..n-1].

To implement this efficiently, I need to:

- Check if s is a palindrome in O(n) time.

- Check if all characters are the same in O(n) time.

- Find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome in O(n) time.

For the last part, I can precompute the hash of each prefix and its reverse, and compare them.

Let's outline the steps in code:

- For each test case:

- Read s.

- Check if s is a palindrome:

- If not, print "YES", 1, s.

- Else:

- Check if all characters in s are the same:

- If yes, print "NO".

- Else:

- Find the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome:

- Precompute hash of s[0..k-1] and its reverse.

- Find the smallest k where hash(s[0..k-1]) != hash(reversed s[0..k-1]).

- Print "YES", 2, s[0..k-1], s[k..n-1].

This should work in O(n) time per test case.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

- Single character: "a"

- It's a palindrome, all characters are the same -> "NO"

- Two characters: "aa"

- Palindrome, all characters same -> "NO"

- Two characters: "ab"

- Not a palindrome -> "YES", 1, "ab"

- Three characters: "aba"

- Palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES", can split into "ab" and "ba"

- Four characters: "abba"

- Palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES", split into "ab" and "ba"

- String with all characters same except one: "aaabaaa"

- Not a palindrome -> "YES", 1, "aaabaaa"

- Long palindrome string with mixed characters: "racecar"

- Palindrome, not all characters same -> "YES", split into "rac" and "ecar"

Seems covered.

Another thing to consider is the efficiency of the hash function to avoid collisions.

I can use a pair of hashes with different bases to minimize the chance of collision.

But for simplicity, I can use a single hash with a large prime modulus.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently, ensuring that the total time does not exceed the limits.

Given that the sum of |s| over all test cases is up to 10^6, and each operation is O(n), it should be fine.

I need to implement hashing functions for the prefixes and their reverses.

Let's define a rolling hash function.

Choose a large prime, say P = 1e9 + 7, and a base, say B = 31.

Compute the hash of s[0..k-1] as (s[0]*B^{k-1} + s[1]*B^{k-2} + ... + s[k-1]*B^0) mod P.

Compute the hash of reversed s[0..k-1] as (s[k-1]*B^{k-1} + s[k-2]*B^{k-2} + ... + s[0]*B^0) mod P.

Then, compare these two hashes.

If they are different, then s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.
