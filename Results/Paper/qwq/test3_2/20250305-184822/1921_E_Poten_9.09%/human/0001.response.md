Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob move their chips according to specific rules, and I need to determine who wins if both play optimally. The board has h rows and w columns, and each player starts at a given position. Alice moves down or diagonally down, while Bob moves up or diagonally up. The goal is to capture the opponent's chip or force a draw.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. Alice can move her chip one cell down, down-right, or down-left, as long as she doesn't go beyond the board boundaries. Similarly, Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left, also without going off the board.

The game ends immediately if a player moves to the cell occupied by the opponent's chip, and that player wins. If a player cannot make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—the game ends in a draw.

Given that both players play optimally, I need to determine the outcome for each test case based on the initial positions and the board dimensions.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle multiple test cases in a loop. For each test case, it reads six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, which represent the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

The program then seems to evaluate various conditions to decide whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or it's a draw. It categorizes the outcomes based on the positions and movements possible.

I need to verify if this program correctly determines the winner or if it's a draw for each test case, given the rules.

Let me break down the logic of the program step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, test_cases.

2. It initializes an empty list, answers, to store the results for each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the input as a list of integers: clues = list(map(int, input().split(' '))).

4. It then checks several conditions to determine the outcome.

Let's look at the first condition:

if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:

answers.append('Draw')

This checks if Alice's initial row (x_a) is greater than Bob's initial row (x_b), or if the board has only one row (clues[0] == 1). In either case, it concludes that the game ends in a draw.

Is this correct?

- If x_a > x_b, that means Alice is already below Bob. Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, they are moving towards each other. However, depending on their column positions, they might be able to meet or not.

- If h == 1, both players are in the same row, and neither can make a move, resulting in a draw. This seems correct.

But, is it always a draw if x_a > x_b? Maybe not, because even if Alice is below Bob, their column positions might allow one to capture the other before reaching the edge.

So, this condition might be too broad.

Next, there are conditions based on the parity of x_a and x_b:

elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0):

This seems to check if both x_a and x_b are even or both are odd.

Then, it checks if y_a == y_b:

if clues[3] == clues[5]:

answers.append('Bob')

If they are in the same column, it concludes that Bob wins.

Is this accurate?

- If they are in the same column, and Alice is moving down, Bob is moving up. Depending on their row positions, they might meet at some point.

- However, if Alice is below Bob, and they are in the same column, Alice can move straight up to Bob's position if she could, but since she can only move down, this seems contradictory.

Wait, Alice moves down, Bob moves up. So, if they are in the same column, and Alice is below Bob, Alice can move up diagonally to approach Bob, but since she can only move down, perhaps they can never meet.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me think again.

Given that Alice moves down or diagonally down, and Bob moves up or diagonally up, if they are in the same column, their paths might cross at some point.

But, since they are moving towards each other, they might meet at a certain row.

However, the program concludes that Bob wins in this scenario, but I'm not sure if that's always true.

Next, there are more conditions based on y_a and y_b:

elif clues[3] < clues[5]:

if abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1:

Check some conditions involving absolute differences and append 'Draw' or 'Bob' accordingly.

Similarly for clues[3] > clues[5].

This seems overly complicated, and I'm having trouble following the logic.

Let me try a different approach.

I think to solve this problem correctly, I need to model the game as a race between Alice and Bob to reach each other's paths.

Given that Alice moves down or diagonally down, and Bob moves up or diagonally up, their movements are independent unless they collide at the same cell at the same time.

Since they move alternately, with Alice starting first, I need to calculate if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach hers, or vice versa.

Alternatively, since the board can be large, and h and w can be up to 10^6 and 10^9 respectively, I need an efficient way to determine the outcome without simulating the game.

I recall that in such games, it's often useful to calculate the minimum number of moves each player needs to reach the other's position and see who can get there first.

Let's define:

- Alice's position: (x_a, y_a)

- Bob's position: (x_b, y_b)

- Alice moves down or diagonally down: (x_a + 1, y_a), (x_a + 1, y_a - 1), (x_a + 1, y_a + 1)

- Bob moves up or diagonally up: (x_b - 1, y_b), (x_b - 1, y_b - 1), (x_b - 1, y_b + 1)

First, since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, their x-coordinates are moving towards each other if x_a < x_b.

If x_a >= x_b, as in the first condition of the program, it concludes a draw. But is this always true?

Consider x_a > x_b: Alice is below Bob. Since Alice can only move down, and Bob can only move up, they are moving away from each other, so indeed, it's a draw.

But in the case x_a < x_b, they are moving towards each other.

Now, I need to calculate if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

Given that they move alternately, with Alice starting first, I need to find out who can reach the intersection point first.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the number of moves required for each to reach the other's position.

Let me define the difference in rows:

delta_x = x_b - x_a

This is the number of rows Alice needs to move down to reach Bob's row.

Similarly, Bob needs to move up delta_x rows to reach Alice's row.

Since Alice moves first, she can make the first move, then Bob, and so on.

Each move, Alice can change her row by 1 and her column by -1, 0, or +1.

Similarly, Bob can change his row by -1 and his column by -1, 0, or +1.

To capture each other, they need to be at the same cell at the same time.

I think a better way is to calculate the minimum number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position, considering their movement capabilities.

However, since they are moving towards each other, and their paths can cross, I need to find out if Alice can intercept Bob's path before Bob can intercept Alice's path.

Alternatively, since the board can be very large, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I recall that in such games, it's often about the relative positions and the parity of the moves.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. If x_a >= x_b, then Alice cannot catch up to Bob since she can only move down and Bob moves up. So, it's a draw.

2. If x_a < x_b, then they are moving towards each other.

- Calculate the number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's row: delta_x moves down.

- In delta_x moves, Bob can move up delta_x rows.

- Since Alice moves first, she can make delta_x moves down, and Bob can make (delta_x - 1) moves up.

- So, after Alice's delta_x moves, she reaches row x_b, and Bob reaches row (x_b - (delta_x - 1)).

- If Bob has already reached or passed Alice's initial row, then Bob can capture Alice.

- Otherwise, Alice can capture Bob.

Wait, this seems too simplistic.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the difference in rows: delta_x = x_b - x_a

Alice needs to make delta_x moves to reach Bob's row.

Bob, in that time, can make (delta_x - 1) moves (since Alice moves first).

So, Bob can move up (delta_x - 1) rows.

Therefore, when Alice reaches row x_b, Bob will be at row (x_b - (delta_x - 1)) = x_b - (x_b - x_a - 1) = x_a + 1

So, Alice reaches row x_b, and Bob is at row (x_a + 1).

If their columns coincide at some point during their moves, then one can capture the other.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I should consider the possible paths.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a game where Alice tries to intercept Bob's position, and Bob tries to intercept Alice's position.

Given that, I can think in terms of game theory and determine who has a winning strategy.

Alternatively, since the board is a grid and movements are constrained, perhaps I can model it as a graph and find the shortest path for both players to reach each other's positions.

However, given the time constraints, I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me look back at the provided program's logic.

In the first condition:

if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:

answers.append('Draw')

This checks if Alice is already below Bob or if the board has only one row, concluding a draw.

This seems correct because:

- If Alice is below Bob (x_a > x_b), they are moving away from each other.

- If h == 1, neither can move, resulting in a draw.

Next, it has an elif clause for when both x_a and x_b are even or both are odd.

This seems arbitrary and might not hold generally.

Then, it checks if y_a == y_b, concluding that Bob wins.

But, considering the directions they move, if they are in the same column, and moving towards each other, they will meet at some row, but who reaches first?

I think I need to calculate the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and for Bob to reach Alice's row.

Let’s define:

- Moves for Alice to reach Bob's row: delta_x = x_b - x_a

- Moves for Bob to reach Alice's row: (x_b - x_a) moves, but since he moves up, he can reach Alice's row in (x_b - x_a) moves.

However, since Alice moves first, Bob's moves are one less than Alice's.

Wait, no.

Let’s think in terms of turns.

- Turn 1: Alice moves

- Turn 2: Bob moves

- Turn 3: Alice moves

- ...

So, after k turns:

- Alice has moved ceil(k / 2) times

- Bob has moved floor(k / 2) times

Wait, more precisely:

- If k is odd: Alice has moved (k + 1) / 2 times, Bob has moved k / 2 times

- If k is even: Alice has moved k / 2 times, Bob has moved k / 2 times

This seems messy.

Perhaps a better way is to consider the total number of moves each can make.

Given that Alice moves first, she can make one more move than Bob.

So, if the total number of moves is m, Alice can make ceil(m / 2) moves, Bob floor(m / 2) moves.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice wants to reach Bob's position.

She needs to cover delta_x rows and adjust her column position accordingly.

Similarly, Bob wants to reach Alice's position.

He needs to cover delta_x rows and adjust his column position.

The key is to see who can reach the intersection point first.

Let’s define delta_y = y_b - y_a

This is the difference in columns.

Now, Alice can adjust her column position by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column position by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

So, in delta_x moves, Alice can adjust her column position by up to delta_x positions (since she can move left or right each move).

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column position by up to delta_x positions in delta_x moves.

Wait, but Bob has one less move because Alice moves first.

Wait, no, Bob has delta_x - 1 moves if Alice makes delta_x moves.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let’s try to formalize it.

Let’s define:

- Alice needs to make at least delta_x moves to reach Bob's row.

- In delta_x moves, Alice can adjust her column position by up to delta_x positions (since she can move left or right each move).

- Similarly, Bob can make delta_x - 1 moves to reach Alice's row (since Alice moves first).

- In delta_x - 1 moves, Bob can adjust his column position by up to delta_x - 1 positions.

Now, for Alice to capture Bob:

- After delta_x moves, Alice is at row x_b.

- Bob has made delta_x - 1 moves.

- So, Bob is at row x_b - (delta_x - 1)

- For Alice to capture Bob, she needs to be at Bob's position at some point.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the exact positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference in their row positions and column positions.

Let’s consider that Alice is moving down and adjusting columns, and Bob is moving up and adjusting columns.

I need to see if their paths cross before either reaches the edge of the board.

This seems complex.

Let me consider some examples from the sample input and see what the expected output is.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

6 5 2 2 5 3 -> Alice

4 1 2 1 4 1 -> Bob

1 4 1 3 1 1 -> Draw

5 5 1 4 5 2 -> Draw

4 4 1 1 4 4 -> Draw

10 10 1 6 10 8 -> Alice

10 10 2 6 10 7 -> Draw

10 10 9 1 8 1 -> Draw

10 10 8 1 10 2 -> Bob

10 10 1 1 2 1 -> Alice

10 10 1 3 4 1 -> Alice

10 10 3 1 1 1 -> Draw

Output:

Alice

Bob

Draw

Draw

Draw

Alice

Draw

Draw

Bob

Alice

Alice

Draw

Looking at the first test case:

h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3 -> Alice wins

Here, Alice starts at (2,2), Bob at (5,3). Alice needs to reach row 5, moving down 3 rows.

In 3 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 3 positions.

Bob starts at row 5 and needs to move up to row 2 in 3 moves.

In 3 moves, Bob can adjust his column by up to 3 positions.

Initially, y_a=2, y_b=3, so delta_y = 1.

Alice needs to reach row 5, column 3 to capture Bob.

In 3 moves, Alice can move down to row 5 and adjust her column by up to 3 positions, so she can reach column 3 from column 2 in 1 move, but she has 3 moves to do so.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to 2 positions in 2 moves (since he has 2 moves to reach row 2).

So, Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

Hence, Alice wins.

This seems consistent with the sample output.

Another test case:

h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1 -> Bob

Here, the board has only one column.

Alice starts at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Alice needs to move down to row 4, but Bob can move up to row 2.

Since they are in the same column, their paths will cross at some point.

Alice needs 2 moves to reach row 4, while Bob can make 1 move up in those 2 turns.

So, after Alice's 2 moves, she reaches row 4, and Bob reaches row 3.

They don't meet.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Bob wins.

Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, Bob moves up on his turn.

So, starting from row 4, Bob can move up to row 3 on his first move.

Then Alice moves from row 2 to row 3 (down).

Now, both are at row 3, column 1, so Bob captures Alice's position.

Wait, but according to the rules, the player who moves to the opponent's position wins.

So, in this case, Bob moves to Alice's position, capturing her chip.

Hence, Bob wins.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1 -> Draw

Here, both are in the same row (only one row), so neither can move, resulting in a draw.

This is straightforward.

Another test case:

h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2 -> Draw

Alice needs to move down 4 rows to reach row 5.

Bob needs to move up 4 rows to reach row 1.

In 4 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 4 positions.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to 3 positions in 3 moves.

Alice starts at (1,4), Bob at (5,2).

Alice needs to reach row 5, column 2 to capture Bob.

She can adjust her column from 4 to 2 in 2 moves (left twice).

But she has 4 moves to do so, which is sufficient.

Bob, in 3 moves, can adjust his column by up to 3 positions.

But he needs to reach column 4 to capture Alice.

However, since Alice can reach Bob's position in fewer moves than Bob can reach hers, Alice can capture Bob.

But according to the sample output, it's a draw.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps their paths don't align in a way that allows capture.

Alternatively, maybe both can reach each other's positions at the same time, leading to a draw.

I need to think more carefully.

Given the complexity of the problem and the time constraints, I think the provided program might have some flaws in its logic.

Specifically, the initial condition that if x_a > x_b or h == 1, it's a draw seems partially correct but may not cover all scenarios.

Additionally, the subsequent conditions based on the parity of x_a and x_b seem arbitrary and may not hold in general.

Given that, I would conclude that the program is incorrect because it doesn't accurately determine the winner in all cases.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
