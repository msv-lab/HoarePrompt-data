Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n x n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, each cell represented by its coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these n cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. It's essentially the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between two points. So, in a grid, it's the number of steps you'd need to take moving only horizontally and vertically to get from one point to another.

The problem provides some examples for n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6, showing specific arrangements of cells and the resulting distinct Manhattan distances.

Looking at n=2:

- Cells: (1,1) and (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- Distinct distances: {0,1} — size 2

For n=3:

- Cells: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances: various combinations resulting in {0,1,2,3} — size 4

For n=4:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

- Presumably results in a larger set of distinct distances

Similarly for n=5 and n=6.

So, the task is, for each test case with a given n, output n cells that maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances among them.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        print('1 1')

        print('1 2')

        if n == 3:

            print('2 3')

        else:

            print('2 4')

            for j in range(4, n + 1):

                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))

```

Let's analyze this step by step.

The function reads the number of test cases, t, and then for each test case, it reads n and outputs n cells.

For each test case:

1. It always prints (1,1) and (1,2).

2. If n == 3, it prints (2,3).

3. For n > 3:

- It prints (2,4).

- Then, for each j from 4 to n, it prints (j,j).

So, for n=2:

- (1,1) and (1,2)

For n=3:

- (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

For n=4:

- (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

For n=5:

- (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

For n=6:

- (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Now, I need to verify if this selection of cells maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for each n.

Let me consider n=2:

- Cells: (1,1) and (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- Distinct distances: {0,1} — size 2

Is this the maximum possible? For n=2, the maximum possible distinct distances are 0 and 1, so yes.

For n=3:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Let's calculate all pairwise distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1) to (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) to (2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3}

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, for n=3, they have cells (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), which give distances {0,1,2,3}. So, both arrangements achieve the same set of distances.

But in the program, for n=3, it's choosing (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), which also achieves the same set of distinct distances.

So, for n=3, it's correct.

Now, for n=4:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Calculate all pairwise distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2)-(2,4): |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

- (2,4)-(4,4): |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} — size 7

Is this the maximum possible for n=4?

Looking back at the problem's example for n=4, it shows cells (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), which likely also achieve a similar set of distinct distances.

So, for n=4, the program's selection seems correct.

For n=5:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Calculate pairwise distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8} — size 8

Wait, but (2,4)-(4,4) and (4,4)-(5,5) both give distance 2, so it's still {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}.

Is this the maximum possible for n=5?

Looking at the problem's example for n=5, it shows a different arrangement, but likely achieves a similar number of distinct distances.

So, for n=5, it seems correct.

For n=6:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Pairwise distances:

- Continue calculating similarly to n=5, but it should include more distances.

Assuming similar patterns, it should achieve a large set of distinct distances.

Now, a general pattern seems to be:

- Always include (1,1) and (1,2)

- For n >= 4, include (2,4)

- Then, for j from 4 to n, include (j,j)

But is this the optimal way for all n?

Let me think about n=3 again. The program includes (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), which works, but the problem's example uses (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Both achieve the same number of distinct distances.

Is there a better arrangement for n=3? Let's see:

- If I choose (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4

- (2,2)-(3,3): |2-3| + |2-3| = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,2,4} — only 3 distinct distances, which is worse than the previous arrangement's 4.

So, the program's arrangement is better.

Another arrangement for n=3:

- (1,1), (1,3), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(3,1): 2

- (1,3)-(3,1): |1-3| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4

- Distinct distances: {0,2,4} — same as above.

Wait, but in the problem's example for n=3, they have cells (2,1), (2,3), (3,1):

- (2,1)-(2,3): 2

- (2,1)-(3,1): 1

- (2,3)-(3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3} — size 4

So, their arrangement achieves more distinct distances.

Similarly, the program's arrangement for n=3 achieves the same.

Now, for n=4, the program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4):

- As calculated earlier, achieves 7 distinct distances.

Is there a better arrangement for n=4 that achieves more than 7 distinct distances?

Let me try to see the maximum possible number of distinct distances for n=4.

Total possible pairs for n cells is C(n,2) = 6 pairs, but including 0 distances for overlapping points, but since all points are distinct, no 0 distances except for self-pairs.

Wait, no, Manhattan distance between a point and itself is 0, but since we are considering pairs of distinct cells, 0 shouldn't be considered.

Wait, in the initial example for n=2, they included 0 in the set, which is the distance from a point to itself. But since the problem says "any pair of cells", it might imply pairs of distinct cells.

In that case, perhaps 0 should not be included.

Wait, in the n=2 example, they included 0, which might be from the same point.

But to be consistent, perhaps we should consider only distinct pairs.

If that's the case, then for n=2, only one distance: 1.

But in the example, they have {0,1}, which might include the self-distance.

The problem says "any pair of cells", which could include a cell paired with itself, resulting in 0 distance.

So, perhaps 0 is always included.

But in practical terms, for distinct cells, the distances are positive integers.

Wait, need to clarify this.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Let H be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells."

And in the first example for n=2:

H = {0,1}

But in that case, n=2, with cells (1,1) and (1,2):

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Distance between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

So, H = {0,1}

But typically, when considering pairs of distinct cells, we exclude the self-pairs.

If we exclude self-pairs, then for n=2, H = {1}

Similarly, for n=3, H = {1,2,3}

But in the example, they include 0.

So, perhaps the problem includes 0 in H.

Therefore, for n cells, H includes n zeros (from each cell to itself) and the distances between distinct pairs.

But including 0, the size of H is n plus the number of distinct positive distances.

But since H is the set of distinct distances, and 0 is included, the size is the number of unique distances including 0.

So, to maximize the size of H, we need to maximize the number of distinct positive distances and include 0.

Therefore, the size of H is 1 (for 0) plus the number of distinct positive distances.

Hence, to maximize H, we need to maximize the number of distinct positive distances.

So, the task is to choose n distinct cells in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct positive Manhattan distances between any two distinct cells is maximized.

Now, with this clarification, let's re-examine the program's approach.

For n=2:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: 1

- H: {0,1} — size 2

For n=3:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances: 1, 3, 2

- H: {0,1,2,3} — size 4

For n=4:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Distances: 1,4,6,3,5,2

- H: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} — size 7

For n=5:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Distances: 1,4,6,3,5,2,4,7,8

- H: {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8} — size 8

For n=6:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Distances: extending the previous, likely {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} — size 10

Now, is this the maximum possible?

Let's consider that in an n x n grid, the maximum possible Manhattan distance between any two cells is 2(n-1), which occurs between corners like (1,1) and (n,n).

So, the possible distinct positive Manhattan distances range from 1 to 2(n-1), which is 2n - 2 distinct positive distances.

Adding 0, the size of H would be 2n - 1.

Is this achievable?

For n=2: 2*2 -1 = 3, but earlier we have H={0,1} size 2 < 3.

Wait, is 3 achievable?

Let's see:

- Choose (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: 0,1

- To get another distance, need to include a third point.

- For n=2, only 2 points, so H={0,1}

- For n=3, can we achieve 2*3 -1 =5?

In earlier arrangements, for n=3, H={0,1,2,3} size 4 <5.

Is 5 achievable?

Let's try:

Choose (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,2)-(2,1):2

- H={0,1,2} — size 3

Alternatively, (1,1), (1,3), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3):2

- (1,1)-(3,1):2

- (1,3)-(3,1):4

- H={0,2,4} — size 3

Alternatively, (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2):2

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (2,2)-(3,3):2

- H={0,2,4} — size 3

Seems like for n=3, the maximum H size is 4, as in the program's arrangement.

Similarly, for n=4, 2*4 -1=7, which matches the program's arrangement achieving 7.

For n=5, 2*5 -1=9, but the program achieves 8.

Wait, is 9 achievable for n=5?

Let's see:

- Possible distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

- But 0 is included, so need 9 distinct positive distances.

Is that possible?

Looking at the program's arrangement for n=5: H={0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, size 8.

Can we arrange 5 points to get 9 distinct positive distances?

Let's try:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Distances: 1,4,6,3,5,2,4,7,8

- H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} — size 9

Wait, earlier I thought it was size 8, but actually, it's size 9, including 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

So, it achieves 9 distinct distances, which matches 2*5 -1=9.

Earlier, I missed including 6 in the list.

So, for n=5, it's achievable.

Similarly, for n=6, 2*6 -1=11, and the program's arrangement likely achieves this.

Therefore, the program's approach seems to be correct for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Hence, the answer is **True**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
