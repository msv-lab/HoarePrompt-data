Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them. I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "block" means in this context. A block of chips means that all the chips are consecutive with no free cells between them. So, ideally, all the chips are together in a continuous sequence.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, to the closest free cell, I need to think about how to rearrange the chips to form this block with the least number of moves.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

5

8

0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

6

0 1 0 0 0 0

6

1 1 1 1 1 1

5

1 0 1 0 1

9

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output:

1

0

0

2

3

In the first case, n=8, and the array is 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0. After one operation, moving the chip from position 7 to position 5, the array becomes 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0, which is a single block.

In the second case, n=6, and the array is 0 1 0 0 0 0. All chips are already in a block (just one chip), so no operations are needed.

In the third case, n=6, and the array is 1 1 1 1 1 1. All cells are occupied, so it's already a single block.

In the fourth case, n=5, and the array is 1 0 1 0 1. To form a block, we might need to move the chips to positions 1,2,3 or 2,3,4, etc. It seems that two operations are needed.

In the fifth case, n=9, and the array is 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0. We need to move some chips to form a continuous block, and it takes three operations.

Looking at these examples, it seems that the goal is to collect all the chips into a consecutive sequence with no gaps.

Now, thinking about how to approach this programmatically. I need to process multiple test cases, each consisting of n and a sequence of 0s and 1s.

First, for each test case, I need to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip. Between these positions, I need to ensure there are no free cells.

Wait, but moving chips only to the left, I need to consider the positions carefully.

An optimal strategy would be to move the rightmost chips to the left as much as possible to fill the gaps on the left.

Alternatively, think of it as moving chips to the left to fill the leftmost positions where there are free cells.

But perhaps a better way is to find the range where the chips need to be placed and count the number of free cells within that range.

Wait, in the first example, the leftmost chip is at position 2 (0-indexed, since input starts from 1), and the rightmost is at position 6. Between positions 2 and 6, there is one free cell at position 5. So, to make it a block, I need to fill that one free cell with a chip, which requires one operation.

Similarly, in the fourth example, positions of chips are 1,3,5. To make them consecutive, I need to move the chips at positions 5 and 3 to fill the gaps. But it's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to find the leftmost and rightmost chips and count the number of free cells between them. That would be the number of operations needed.

Let me test this hypothesis with the first example: leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 6, free cells between them are position 5 (only one). So, operations needed are 1, which matches the example.

In the second example, only one chip, so no operations needed.

In the third example, all cells are occupied, so no operations needed.

In the fourth example, chips at positions 1,3,5. Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5. Free cells between them are positions 2 and 4. So, operations needed are 2, which matches the example.

In the fifth example, chips at positions 2,3,7,8. Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8. Free cells between them are positions 4,5,6. So, operations needed are 3, which matches the example.

Seems like this approach works.

So, the plan is:

1. For each test case, find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip.

2. Extract the subarray between these positions (inclusive).

3. Count the number of free cells (0s) in this subarray.

4. That count is the number of operations needed.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input(''))

arr = str(input(''))

x = arr.find('1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1')

z = arr[x:n - y]

print(z.count('0'))

This seems to implement the plan I just outlined.

- t is the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- n is the number of cells.

- arr is the sequence of 0s and 1s.

- x is the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip).

- y is the index of the first '1' in the reversed array, which corresponds to the rightmost chip in the original array.

- z is the subarray from x to n - y, which should be the range between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

- z.count('0') gives the number of free cells in that range, which is the number of operations needed.

This seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.

However, I need to make sure that the indices are being handled correctly.

In Python, string indexing starts at 0. So, arr.find('1') returns the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip), and arr[::-1].find('1') returns the index of the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the position from the end.

So, n - y would be the position from the start corresponding to the rightmost chip.

Wait, let's verify this with the first example:

arr = '0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0'

x = arr.find('1') = 2 (position of first '1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = position in reversed string: '0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0'

The first '1' in reversed string is at position 1.

n = 8

n - y = 8 - 1 = 7

So, z = arr[2:7] = '1 1 1 0 1'

count of '0' in z is 1, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Another example:

arr = '1 0 1 0 1'

x = 0 (first '1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = '1 0 1 0 1' reversed, first '1' at position 0.

n - y = 5 - 0 = 5

z = arr[0:5] = '1 0 1 0 1'

count of '0' is 2, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

One more example:

arr = '0 1 0 0 0 0'

x = 1 (first '1')

y = arr[::-1].find('1') = '0 0 0 0 1 0' reversed, first '1' at position 4.

n - y = 6 - 4 = 2

z = arr[1:2] = '1'

count of '0' is 0, which matches the example.

Looks good.

Hence, the program seems to be correctly implementing the required logic.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips on a ribbon such that they form a single block without any free cells between them. The operations allow moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Range of Chips:**
   - Find the leftmost position of a chip.
   - Find the rightmost position of a chip.

2. **Count Free Cells in the Range:**
   - Extract the subarray between the leftmost and rightmost chip positions.
   - Count the number of free cells (denoted by '0') in this subarray.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any gaps.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling:**
  - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
  - For each test case, read the number of cells, `n`, and the array configuration as a string, `arr`.

- **Finding Chip Positions:**
  - Use `arr.find('1')` to find the leftmost chip position.
  - Use `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the rightmost chip position by reversing the array and finding the first '1'.

- **Extract Relevant Subarray:**
  - Extract the subarray `z` from the leftmost to the rightmost chip positions.

- **Count Free Cells:**
  - Count the number of '0's in the subarray `z`, which gives the number of operations needed.

- **Output the Result:**
  - Print the count of '0's for each test case, representing the minimum operations required.

This approach ensures an efficient and straightforward solution to form a single block of chips with the least number of operations.
