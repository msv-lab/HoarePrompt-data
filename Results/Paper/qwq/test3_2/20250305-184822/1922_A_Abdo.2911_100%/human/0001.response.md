Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to find a template t such that:

1. For each position i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

2. If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Actually, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

But for a and b to match the template, they must satisfy the conditions for all positions.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can consider each position independently and see what constraints they impose on the template t.

Let's consider position i.

Case 1: a[i] == b[i]

- For a and b to match the template, if t[i] is lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i] (since a[i] == b[i]).

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i]. But since a[i] == b[i], this would require that a[i] != t[i].lower().

Now, for c[i]:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower().

Given that, I need to choose t[i] such that a and b match, and c does not match.

Let's think about possible choices for t[i].

Subcase 1: a[i] == b[i] == c[i]

- If t[i] is lowercase, then t[i] must be equal to a[i], but c[i] must not be equal to t[i]. But since c[i] == a[i], this is impossible.

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from t[i].lower(), which is t[i]. But a[i] == c[i], so c[i] == a[i] != t[i].lower(), which contradicts the condition that c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower() if t[i] is uppercase.

Therefore, in this subcase, it's impossible to find such a template.

Subcase 2: a[i] == b[i] != c[i]

- If t[i] is lowercase, set t[i] = a[i]. Then, a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i], so c does not match.

- If t[i] is uppercase, set t[i] = a[i].upper(). Then, a[i] != t[i].lower(), b[i] != t[i].lower(), and c[i] != a[i] == t[i].lower(), so c does not match.

Wait, but in this subcase, a[i] == b[i] != c[i], so if t[i] is lowercase and equal to a[i], then c[i] != t[i], which is good. If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower() only if a[i] != a[i], which is not possible. So, t[i] must be lowercase and equal to a[i].

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, t[i].lower() == a[i], but a[i] != t[i].lower() must hold, which is a contradiction because a[i] == t[i].lower(). So, in this subcase, only t[i] being lowercase and equal to a[i] works.

Case 2: a[i] != b[i]

This seems more complicated. Let's consider it.

If a[i] != b[i], then for both a and b to match the template, we need to see what constraints this imposes on t[i].

Subcase 1: t[i] is lowercase.

- Then, a[i] must be equal to t[i], and b[i] must be equal to t[i]. But a[i] != b[i], so this is impossible.

- Therefore, t[i] cannot be lowercase.

Subcase 2: t[i] is uppercase.

- Then, a[i] must be different from t[i].lower(), and b[i] must be different from t[i].lower().

- So, t[i].lower() cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i].

- For c[i], if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower() to not match the template.

So, in this subcase, t[i] must be uppercase, and t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i] or b[i], but equal to c[i].

Therefore, for position i where a[i] != b[i], t[i] must be uppercase, and t[i].lower() must be different from a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

This imposes that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], because t[i].lower() cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i].

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], it's only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, no. If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], which is a[i], but t[i].lower() cannot be equal to a[i], because t[i].lower() must be different from a[i] and b[i]. So, only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], can I set t[i].lower() = c[i].

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], it's possible only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

In summary:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If a[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

- If a[i] != c[i], set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Only possible if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- Set t[i] = c[i].upper().

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, to solve the problem, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- If a[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

- Else, set t[i] = a[i] (lowercase).

- Else (a[i] != b[i]):

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], set t[i] = c[i].upper().

- Else, impossible.

If for all positions, we can make such choices, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but in the case where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible for that position, so the whole template is impossible.

In other positions, as long as the conditions are met, we can set t[i] accordingly.

Therefore, to implement this, for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], then it's impossible.

- Else, it's possible.

Wait, but in the case where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], it's impossible for that position.

So, overall, it's possible if for all positions:

- If a[i] == b[i], then a[i] != c[i].

- Or, if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If this holds for all positions, then it's possible; otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, no. In the case where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it's possible.

In the case where a[i] == b[i], and a[i] != c[i], it's possible.

In all other cases, it's impossible.

But actually, in the case where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

In the case where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], it's possible.

In the case where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it's possible.

In the case where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], it's impossible.

So, to summarize, it's possible if for all positions i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then a[i] != c[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If this condition holds for all positions, then it's possible; otherwise, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the case where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it's possible.

So, in code, I can iterate through each position and check these conditions.

If all positions satisfy the conditions, then print "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but in the given program, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the given program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

possible = False

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

break

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, in this code, for each test case, it reads n, a, b, c.

Then, it initializes possible = False.

Then, it loops through each position i from 0 to n-1.

If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], it sets possible = True and breaks.

Else, if a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it sets possible = True and breaks.

Else, it continues.

Finally, if possible is True, it prints "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait a minute, according to my earlier reasoning, to be possible, all positions must satisfy the conditions, not just at least one position.

In the code, it seems to set possible = True if there exists at least one position where the conditions are satisfied, and then breaks.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should check that all positions satisfy the conditions.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me think again.

What the code is doing is checking if there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

If such a position exists, it sets possible = True and breaks.

Then, it prints "YES" if possible is True, else "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, we need all positions to satisfy certain conditions for the template to exist.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

Maybe the problem can be reduced to checking if there exists at least one position where a and b match and c differs, or a and b differ and c differs from both.

But, actually, the template must satisfy the conditions for all positions, not just at least one position.

So, the given code is incorrect because it's checking for the existence of at least one such position, not for all positions.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example provided:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's see for the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

So, position 1: a != b, and c != a and c != b (c != a and c != b).

So, it's possible.

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Position 1: a != b, and c == a, so impossible.

Position 2: a != b, and c == a, so impossible.

So, it's impossible.

Third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

I need to check for each position:

If a[i] == b[i], then a[i] != c[i].

Or, if a[i] != b[i], then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Position 1: m != l, c == a (a: m, b: l, c: a) -> c != a and c != b? a != m and a != l? Yes.

Position 2: a != u, c == d -> d != a and d != u? Yes.

Position 3: t != c, c == h -> h != t and h != c? Yes.

Position 4: h != k, c == o -> o != h and o != k? Yes.

Position 5: f == f, c == c -> f == f and c != f? No, c == f would be needed, but c == c != f, so yes.

Wait, f == f and c == c != f? Wait, f == f and c != f? If f == f and c != f, it's okay.

But here, f == f and c == c != f, which is true.

Position 6: o == o, c == c -> o == o and c != o? c == c != o, which is true.

Position 7: r == r, c == o -> r == r and o != r? Yes.

Position 8: c == c, c == d -> c == c and d != c? d != c, so yes.

Position 9: e == e, c == e -> e == e and e != e? No, e == e and e == e, which violates the condition.

So, for position 9, it's impossible.

But according to the sample output, it's YES, which contradicts my analysis.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, according to the problem, the template must be such that a and b match it, and c does not.

For position 9:

a[9] == e

b[9] == e

c[9] == e

So, a and b have the same letter, and c has the same letter.

According to my earlier reasoning, this is impossible because if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

But in the sample output, it's YES, which suggests that it's possible.

Wait, maybe there's something wrong with my reasoning.

Let me look again.

In the third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

Looking at position 9:

a[9] = e

b[9] = e

c[9] = e

According to my earlier reasoning, if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

But the sample output is YES, which means there must be a way to set the template.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Let me think again.

In position 9, a[i] == b[i] == c[i] = 'e'

For the template t[i]:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i]. But c[i] == t[i], which violates c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower(), b[i] != t[i].lower(), and c[i] == t[i].lower().

But t[i].lower() == t[i], since t[i] is uppercase.

So, t[i].lower() == e.

Then, a[i] != e, which is not true, since a[i] == e.

Similarly, b[i] != e, which is not true.

So, it's impossible for position 9.

But the sample output is YES, which means that perhaps not all positions need to satisfy the conditions.

Wait, maybe I need to find a template that makes a and b match, and c does not match in at least one position.

So, even if there are positions where it's impossible, as long as there's at least one position where c does not match, it's considered YES.

Wait, no, the template must be such that a and b match it in all positions, and c does not match it in at least one position.

But in the third test case, position 9 makes it impossible because for a and b to match, and c to not match in that position, it's impossible when a[i] == b[i] == c[i].

But the sample output is YES, which contradicts my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the template's behavior.

Let me look back at the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

Possible template: "C"

Then:

- a: 'a' matches "C" because 'C' is uppercase, so a != 'c' (a != 'c'), which is true.

- b: 'b' matches "C" because 'b' != 'c'.

- c: 'c' does not match "C" because 'c' == 'c', so it doesn't match.

So, it's YES.

In the second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Possible template:

- For position 1: a != b, c == a.

- If t[1] is uppercase, t[1].lower() != a and t[1].lower() != b, and c == t[1].lower().

- But c == a, so t[1].lower() == a, but t[1].lower() != a (from a != t[1].lower()), which is impossible.

- For position 2: similar issue.

So, it's NO.

In the third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

Looking at position 9: a=e, b=e, c=e.

As before, seems impossible.

But sample output is YES.

Wait, maybe the template only needs to make c not match in at least one position, while a and b match in all positions.

So, even if in some positions c matches the template, as long as there's at least one position where c does not match, it's acceptable.

But in the position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to have c not match, because whatever template I choose, c will either match or not based on that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that c does not match the template in at least one position, but a and b match in all positions.

So, if there is at least one position where c does not match, and a and b match in all positions, then it's YES.

In the third test case, position 9 is problematic because a == b == c, making it impossible to have c not match the template in that position.

But the sample output is YES, which suggests that perhaps other positions can make c not match, even if in some positions c matches.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that a and b match the template in all positions, and c does not match the template in at least one position.

So, for the template to be valid:

- For all i, a matches t and b matches t.

- There exists at least one i where c does not match t.

In the third test case, positions where a != b can be set in a way that c does not match in some of those positions, making overall c not match the template.

But in positions where a == b == c, setting the template in a way that a and b match, but c does not, is impossible.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's YES, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider the template for the third test case.

For positions where a != b:

- Set t[i] to c[i].upper(), provided c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

For positions where a == b:

- Set t[i] to a[i], and ensure c[i] != a[i].

But in position 9, a == b == c == 'e', which is impossible.

However, maybe if I set t[9] in a way that a and b match, but c does not match in some other position, it's still considered YES.

Wait, no. The problem states that the template must make a and b match in all positions, and c does not match in at least one position.

But in position 9, it's impossible to have c not match while a and b match.

So, the sample output being YES suggests that even with some positions being impossible, as long as c does not match in at least one position, it's acceptable.

But in practice, for the template to exist, it must satisfy the conditions for all positions.

Hence, in the third test case, position 9 makes it impossible, but the sample output is YES, which suggests that my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to reconsider the conditions.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not."

Match the template means:

- For all i, if t[i] is lowercase, s[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, s[i] != t[i].lower().

Does not match means that there exists at least one i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, s[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, s[i] == t[i].lower().

So, for a and b, they must match the template in all positions.

For c, it must not match the template, meaning there exists at least one position where it does not match.

In the third test case, position 9 seems problematic because a == b == c == 'e', making it impossible to have c not match the template in that position if a and b match.

But the sample output is YES, which suggests that even if c matches in some positions, as long as there's at least one position where c does not match, it's acceptable.

Wait, but in position 9, it's impossible to have c not match while a and b match.

But in other positions, maybe c does not match.

Wait, in position 1:

a=m, b=l, c=a

Set t[1] to 'A' (uppercase).

Then:

- a: m != 'a' (since t[1] is uppercase, check m != 'a'), which is true.

- b: l != 'a', which is true.

- c: a == 'a', so c does not match because t[1] is uppercase and c[i] == 'a'.

So, in this position, c does not match.

Similarly, in position 2:

a=a, b=u, c=d

Set t[2] to 'D' (uppercase).

- a: a != 'd'

- b: u != 'd'

- c: d == 'd', so c does not match.

Wait, but in position 9, it's impossible.

But in the sample output, it's YES, which suggests that even with position 9 being impossible, the overall answer is YES because there exists at least one position where c does not match.

But according to the problem, the template must make a and b match in all positions, and c does not match in at least one position.

In position 9, it's impossible to have c not match while a and b match.

So, the template cannot exist for this test case.

But the sample output is YES, which contradicts my analysis.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not."

"Match" means that for all i, the conditions hold.

"Not match" means that there exists at least one i where the condition does not hold.

So, for the template t:

- a matches t: for all i, if t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i]; if t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != t[i].lower().

- b matches t: similarly.

- c does not match t: there exists at least one i where, if t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i], or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower().

In the third test case, for position 9:

a=e, b=e, c=e

If t[9] is lowercase, set to 'e', then:

- a matches: e == 'e'

- b matches: e == 'e'

- c does not match: e == 'e', so c matches, which is bad.

If t[9] is uppercase, set to 'E', then:

- a matches: e != 'e' (false, since e == 'e')

- So, a does not match.

But for the template to be valid, a must match in all positions.

Hence, no valid t[9] exists.

Therefore, it's impossible.

But the sample output is YES, which suggests that despite position 9 being impossible, the overall answer is YES because there are other positions where c does not match.

Wait, but the template must make a and b match in all positions, and c does not match in at least one position.

If position 9 makes it impossible, then overall, it's impossible.

But the sample output is YES, which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that c not matching in at least one position is sufficient, even if in some positions it's impossible.

But in that case, for the template to be valid, a and b must match in all positions, and c must not match in at least one position.

In the third test case, position 9 makes it impossible to have a and b match while c does not match in that position.

But positions 1 through 8 and position 10 can be set in a way that c does not match in those positions.

But in position 9, it's impossible.

Hence, it should be NO, but the sample output is YES.

This suggests that my reasoning is flawed.

Perhaps the problem allows the template to make c not match in any position, regardless of other positions.

In other words, as long as there exists at least one position where c does not match, and a and b match in all positions, it's YES.

But in the third test case, position 9 makes it impossible to have a and b match while c does not match in that position.

Hence, it should be NO.

But the sample output is YES, which suggests that the template can be such that c does not match in at least one position, even if in other positions c matches.

Wait, but according to the problem, c must not match the template, meaning that there exists at least one position where c does not match.

So, if in at least one position, c does not match, and in all positions a and b match, it's YES.

In the third test case, positions 1 through 8 and position 10 can be set in a way that c does not match in those positions, while a and b match.

In position 9, set t[9] to 'E' (uppercase), then:

- a: e != 'e' (false, since e == 'e'), so a does not match.

But for the template to be valid, a must match in all positions.

Hence, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I need to set t[9] to 'E' (uppercase), and in positions where a != b, set t[i] to c[i].upper().

But in position 9, a == b == c == 'e', and setting t[9] to 'E' makes a not match, which is bad.

Alternatively, set t[9] to 'E' lowercase, 'e', then:

- a: e == 'e'

- b: e == 'e'

- c: e == 'e', so c matches.

Hence, c matches in position 9.

In other positions, set t[i] to c[i].upper() where a != b and c != a and c != b.

So, in those positions, c does not match.

Hence, overall, c does not match in those positions, and matches in position 9.

But since c does not match in at least one position, it's YES.

Wait, but in position 9, c matches, which is bad, because for the template to be valid, c must not match in at least one position, and a and b must match in all positions.

But in position 9, c matches, which is fine, as long as there's at least one position where c does not match.

Wait, no. The condition is that c does not match the template, which means there exists at least one position where c does not match.

So, if in some positions c does not match, and in others it matches, it's still considered that c does not match the template.

Hence, it's acceptable.

But in position 9, c matches, which is fine, as long as in at least one position c does not match.

Hence, in the third test case, it's possible to have a and b match in all positions, and c not match in at least one position.

Therefore, it's YES.

So, my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect because it checks for the existence of at least one position where the conditions are satisfied, whereas it should check that for all positions, the conditions can be satisfied to construct such a template.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
