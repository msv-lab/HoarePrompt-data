Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an undirected weighted graph, and I need to find a simple cycle where the lightest edge is as minimal as possible. A simple cycle means no repeated vertices or edges in the cycle.

First, I need to understand what a cycle is in a graph. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and in an undirected graph, it's pretty straightforward. A simple cycle doesn't visit any vertex more than once except for the starting and ending vertex.

So, the task is to find such a cycle where the smallest edge in that cycle is as small as possible. Among all possible simple cycles in the graph, I need to find one where the minimum edge weight is the smallest among all those cycles.

Looking at the input format, it's clear that there are multiple test cases, each with a different graph defined by the number of vertices (n) and edges (m), followed by the list of edges with their weights.

The constraints are interesting: n is at least 3, and m is at least n, up to a maximum of 2*10^5 edges in total across all test cases. So, the graphs can be pretty large, which means that any solution needs to be efficient, probably linear or nearly linear in time complexity.

Now, thinking about how to approach this. One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a traversal like DFS or BFS and look for back edges, which would indicate a cycle.

But since I need to find a cycle with a specific property—the minimal lightest edge—I need to think carefully about how to select such a cycle efficiently.

Let's consider the following plan:

1. Sort the edges in decreasing order of their weights. This seems counterintuitive at first because I'm interested in the minimal lightest edge. But maybe there's a reason to start from the highest weights.

2. Process the edges in this sorted order and build a forest (a set of trees) using these edges, making sure not to form cycles.

3. When I encounter an edge that would connect two nodes already in the same tree, that means adding this edge would create a cycle.

4. Among all such cycles found in this way, I need to select the one where the minimal edge is as small as possible.

Wait, but if I'm sorting the edges in decreasing order of weight and adding them to the forest, then when I find an edge that would create a cycle, that cycle must include all the edges that are heavier than the current edge.

But I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible. So, perhaps I need to find a cycle where the smallest edge is minimized.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe I should consider all possible cycles and find the one with the smallest minimum edge, but that sounds inefficient for the given constraints.

An alternative approach could be to iterate through possible candidates for the smallest edge and check if there's a cycle where the smallest edge is that candidate.

In other words, perform a binary search on the possible values of the smallest edge in the cycle.

Wait, but the edge weights can be up to 10^6, and m can be up to 2*10^5, so a binary search might not be efficient enough.

Let me think again.

Another idea: use Krusky's algorithm to build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and then for each edge not in the MST, adding it to the MST would create a cycle. Among these cycles, I can find the one with the smallest lightest edge.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps me find the cycle with the overall smallest lightest edge.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the edges in increasing order of their weights and try to find the first cycle where the lightest edge is minimized.

But I need to ensure that the cycle I find has the smallest possible lightest edge.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, the edges are sorted in decreasing order of their weights. Then, it uses a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components.

As it processes each edge in decreasing order, it unites the vertices connected by that edge, unless they are already in the same component, in which case adding that edge would create a cycle.

So, for each such edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it records the cycle and checks if the weight of this edge is smaller than the current minimum.

Wait, but in this approach, it's keeping track of the minimum weight encountered in such cycles.

But I need to ensure that in the cycle formed, the lightest edge is minimized.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me trace the steps in the reference solution.

1. Read the number of test cases, T.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n (number of vertices) and m (number of edges).

b. Read the m edges, each with vertices u, v and weight w.

c. Sort the edges in decreasing order of their weights.

d. Initialize an empty graph representation as adjacency lists.

e. Initialize a Union-Find data structure for the vertices.

f. Initialize variables to track the minimum weight in a cycle and the vertices involved in that cycle.

g. For each edge in the sorted order:

i. Add the edge to the graph.

ii. If the two vertices are already in the same component (found using Union-Find), then adding this edge would create a cycle.

iii. Record the weight of this edge and the vertices involved.

iv. If the two vertices are not in the same component, unite them using the Union-Find.

3. After processing all edges, perform a DFS starting from one of the vertices in the cycle to find the actual cycle path.

4. Output the minimum weight and the cycle path.

Wait, but there are a few issues here.

First, sorting the edges in decreasing order of weights and then finding cycles by checking for edges that connect vertices already in the same component.

But in this approach, it's possible that the cycle found has a lighter edge than the current edge being considered.

Because we're sorting in decreasing order, the edges we're considering are heavier, but the lightest edge in the cycle could be lighter.

So, simply taking the weight of the current edge as the lightest in the cycle might not be accurate.

Wait, maybe the approach is to keep track of the minimum lightest edge among all possible cycles found.

But in the code, it seems like it's just taking the weight of the edge that forms the cycle, without considering the actual lightest edge in the cycle.

This might not be correct.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose we have a graph with vertices 1,2,3,4.

Edges:

1-2: weight 5

2-3: weight 4

3-4: weight 3

4-1: weight 2

1-3: weight 1

If I sort the edges in decreasing order:

1-2:5, 2-3:4, 3-4:3, 4-1:2, 1-3:1

Processing in this order:

- Add 1-2:5, union 1 and 2.

- Add 2-3:4, union 2 and 3 (which are not connected yet).

- Add 3-4:3, union 3 and 4.

- Add 4-1:2, now 4 and 1 are already connected through 3-4 and 2-3 and 1-2, so adding 4-1 would create a cycle.

- The cycle found would be 1-2-3-4-1, where the lightest edge is 2, but there is another cycle 1-2-3-1, where the lightest edge is 1 from 1-3.

So, in this case, the approach would report the cycle 1-2-3-4-1 with lightest edge 2, but there is a cycle 1-2-3-1 with lightest edge 1, which is better.

Therefore, this approach might not find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

So, it seems like the reference solution is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
