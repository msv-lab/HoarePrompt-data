Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k. N is the number of vertices in a graph, numbered from 1 to n, and initially, there are no edges between them. I need to assign each vertex a unique integer from 1 to n. Then, based on these assignments, I add edges between vertices if the sum of the absolute differences of their indices and their assigned values is less than or equal to k. My goal is to assign these values in such a way that when I create the graph, it can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, and I have to output this partition.

First, I need to understand what a clique is. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent, meaning there's an edge between every pair. So, in the context of this problem, I need to group the vertices into as few such subsets as possible, where within each subset, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

Given that, I need to find a way to assign the values a_i to the vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the fewest possible cliques. The problem allows me to choose any permutation of 1 to n for the a_i values, as long as they are distinct and within the range.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

2 3

5 4

8 16

Output:

2 1

1

1 1

3 1 5 2 4

2

1 1 2 1 2

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In the first test case, n=2 and k=3. The output assigns a_1=2 and a_2=1. Then, it says there's only one clique containing both vertices. That makes sense because with n=2, the entire graph is a clique if there's an edge between the two vertices.

In the second test case, n=5 and k=4. The assignment is a=[3,1,5,2,4], and the graph is partitioned into two cliques: vertices 1,2,4 in one clique and vertex 5 in another.

In the third test case, n=8 and k=16. The assignment is a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], and all vertices are in one clique.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to group vertices in such a way that within each group, the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k holds for every pair.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to attempt to solve this by dividing the vertices into a certain number of cliques based on the value of k.

Let's analyze the program step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one, reading n and k.

Then, it calls func_1(n, k).

In func_1, it calculates the number of cliques as ceil(n / k). This suggests that it's trying to divide the n vertices into roughly n/k cliques. That makes sense if k represents some sort of boundary for connecting vertices.

It initializes two arrays: arr to hold the assigned values a_i, and cliquess to hold the clique assignments for each vertex.

Then, it loops from 0 to cliques - 1 and calls make_array for each clique, passing the left and right indices for that clique group.

In make_array, it seems to be assigning values to arr and cliquess for the range from left to right.

It calculates small_element as left + 1 and big_element as right + 1.

Then, it calculates mid as half the difference between big_element and small_element, rounded down.

Not_mid is the remaining number of elements in the range.

It assigns the first mid elements in the range to values from small_element to small_element + i.

The remaining not_mid elements are assigned decreasing values from big_element - i.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let's see with an example.

Take n=5, k=4.

cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2.

First clique: i=0, left=0, right=min(0*4, 5-1)=0, so left=0, right=0.

Call make_array(0,0,1).

small_element = 0 + 1 = 1

big_element = 0 + 1 = 1

mid = (1 - 1)//2 = 0

not_mid = 1 - 0 = 1

So, for i in range(0): nothing happens.

Then, for i in range(1):

arr[0 + 0] = 1 - 0 = 1

cliquess[0] = 1

So arr=[1], cliquess=[1]

Second clique: i=1, left=4, right=min(4,5-1)=4.

Call make_array(4,4,2).

small_element = 4 + 1 = 5

big_element = 5

mid = (5 - 5)//2 = 0

not_mid = 1 - 0 = 1

For i in range(0): nothing

For i in range(1):

arr[4 + 0] = 5 - 0 = 5

cliquess[4] = 2

So arr=[1,0,0,0,5], cliquess=[1,0,0,0,2]

Then, for the remaining vertices, it seems like they are not being assigned any values. Wait, no, in the func_1, arr and cliquess are initialized with n zeros, and then only the specified ranges are filled in make_array.

But in the example with n=5, k=4, the output is:

3 1 5 2 4

2

1 1 2 1 2

But according to this program, it would output:

1 0 0 0 5

2

1 0 0 0 2

Which is not matching. So there's an issue here.

Moreover, the program seems to have a mistake because arr and cliquess are modified within make_array, but they are local to func_1, and make_array is trying to modify them, but in Python, if arr and cliquess are defined in func_1 and make_array tries to assign to them, it would be local to make_array unless declared global or nonlocal.

Wait, in this code, arr and cliquess are defined in func_1, and make_array is a nested function, so it should have access to them unless it tries to assign to them, in which case it would need nonlocal declaration.

But in the given code, arr and cliquess are assigned to in make_array without nonlocal keyword, which would cause UnboundLocalError or similar.

Wait, actually, in Python 3, nested functions can access variables from the enclosing function without nonlocal keyword, as long as they don't try to reassign the variable. But assigning to arr or cliquess in make_array would require nonlocal declaration.

But in the given code, it seems to be assigning to arr and cliquess in make_array, which would require nonlocal keyword.

However, in the code provided, there is no nonlocal declaration.

Wait, looking back, in func_1, arr and cliquess are defined after the nested function make_array, which is incorrect because the nested function should be defined before it's used.

Wait, no, in Python, nested functions can be defined after they are called as long as the definition is within the enclosing function.

But in this code, make_array is defined after it's called in func_1.

Wait, no, in the code, make_array is defined before it's called in func_1.

Wait, actually, in the code provided, make_array is defined after the call to it in func_1.

In Python, function definitions are hoisted, so it should be okay.

But coming back, the main issue is that the program is not producing the correct output as per the example.

In the example, for n=5, k=4, the output is:

3 1 5 2 4

2

1 1 2 1 2

But according to the program, it's producing:

1 0 0 0 5

2

1 0 0 0 2

Which is clearly incorrect.

Moreover, the program has several issues:

1. The way cliques are calculated: ceil(n / k). Is this the correct way to determine the minimum number of cliques? Not necessarily. The minimum number of cliques needed to partition a graph is equal to its chromatic number, which can be more complex to calculate.

2. The way values are assigned to arr in make_array seems arbitrary and not ensuring that the edges are created correctly.

3. The program is not ensuring that all a_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

4. The clique assignments are not guaranteed to form valid cliques.

An alternative approach is needed.

Let's think differently.

One way to minimize the number of cliques is to maximize the size of each clique. To do that, we need to maximize the number of vertices that are connected to each other.

Given the condition for edges: |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k.

We need to choose a_i such that this condition holds for as many pairs as possible, thereby forming larger cliques.

One strategy could be to assign a_i = i, i.e., keep the assigned values in increasing order with the vertex indices. This minimizes |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| since |a_i - a_j| = |i - j|, so |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = 2|i - j|.

Thus, an edge exists between i and j if 2|i - j| <= k, which means |i - j| <= k/2.

So, in this case, vertices are connected to others within a certain index distance.

This might not necessarily lead to the minimum number of cliques, but it's a starting point.

Another strategy could be to arrange the a_i in such a way that the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k is maximized.

Perhaps arranging the a_i in a way that minimizes the differences |a_i - a_j| for adjacent i and j.

Wait, perhaps arranging a_i in a sorted order.

Wait, but a_i must be a permutation of 1 to n.

An alternative idea is to arrange a_i in ascending order with a certain step to maximize connections.

Wait, maybe arranging a_i in increasing order, but spaced out based on k.

Actually, the problem seems similar to coloring a graph where we need to partition into cliques, which is equivalent to coloring the complement graph.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the examples:

In the first test case, n=2, k=3.

Assigning a=[2,1], and forming one clique.

For n=2, k=3, since |1-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 <= 3, so there is an edge between them, so they can be in the same clique.

In the second test case, n=5, k=4.

Assigning a=[3,1,5,2,4], and partitioning into two cliques: [1,2,4] and [5].

Let's verify the edges:

For vertices 1 and 2:

|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = |1-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 1 and 4:

|1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 2 and 4:

|2-4| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 1 and 3:

|1-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 1 and 5:

|1-5| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 >4 → no edge.

Vertices 2 and 3:

|2-3| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5 >4 → no edge.

Vertices 2 and 5:

|2-5| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6 >4 → no edge.

Vertices 3 and 4:

|3-4| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 3 and 5:

|3-5| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 <=4 → edge exists.

Vertices 4 and 5:

|4-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 <=4 → edge exists.

So, in this assignment, the cliques are [1,2,4] and [3,5].

Wait, but in the example output, it's [1,2,4] and [5], but according to the edges, 3 and 5 are connected, so they can be in the same clique.

Maybe the example output is not optimal, but according to the problem, any correct partition is acceptable.

Now, in the third test case, n=8, k=16.

Assigning a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], and all vertices are in one clique.

Given k=16, which is larger than n, so |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = |i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|.

So, 2|i - j| <=16 ⇒ |i - j| <=8.

For n=8, the maximum |i - j| is 7 (between 1 and 8), so 2*7=14 <=16.

Therefore, all pairs are connected, so one clique is sufficient.

That makes sense.

So, perhaps for k >= 2(n-1), one clique suffices.

For smaller k, we need more cliques.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, n=5, and it's using two cliques.

So, perhaps the number of cliques needed is ceil(n / ceil(k / 2)).

Wait, in the second test case, ceil(5 / ceil(4/2)) = ceil(5 / 2) = 3, but they used 2 cliques.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of cliques is ceil(n / (k - n + 1)).

Wait, for n=5, k=4: ceil(5 / (4 - 5 +1)) = ceil(5 /0), which is undefined.

That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <=k.

If I arrange a_i in increasing order, then |a_i - a_j| = |i - j|, assuming a_i = i.

Then, |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = 2|i - j| <=k ⇒ |i - j| <=k/2.

So, vertices i and j are connected if |i - j| <= floor(k/2).

Therefore, the graph consists of connected components where each component has vertices within a distance of floor(k/2).

Hence, the number of cliques needed would be the number of such connected components.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, k=3, floor(k/2)=1, so vertices 1 and 2 are connected since |1-2|=1 <=1, so one clique.

In the second test case, n=5, k=4, floor(k/2)=2.

So, vertices within |i - j| <=2 are connected.

So, vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.

Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1,3,4.

Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1,2,4,5.

Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2,3,5.

Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 3,4.

So, the graph is connected, meaning all vertices are in one big clique.

But in the example, it's using two cliques: [1,2,4] and [5].

Wait, but according to this, it should be possible to have one clique for all vertices.

Maybe the assignment a=[3,1,5,2,4] is causing some edges to be missing.

Wait, earlier I checked the edges with that assignment, and there are edges connecting all vertices except some, but still, it's possible to have one big clique.

So, perhaps the example is using two cliques for simplicity, but one clique is also acceptable.

In the third test case, n=8, k=16, which is larger than 2(n-1)=14, so all vertices are connected, forming one clique.

So, perhaps for k >= 2(n-1), one clique suffices.

For smaller k, we need more cliques.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4 and n=5, 2(n-1)=8, but k=4 <8, yet the example uses two cliques, but according to the earlier reasoning, all vertices are connected, so one clique suffices.

So, perhaps the formula is ceil(n / m), where m is floor(k/2).

So, for n=5, k=4, m=2, ceil(5/2)=3, but the example uses 2 cliques.

Hmm, maybe that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of cliques is ceil((n -1)/ m) +1, where m= floor(k/2).

Wait, for n=5, m=2, ceil(4/2)=2, plus 1 is 3, which is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the diameter of the graph.

Given that vertices are connected if |i - j| <= floor(k/2), then the graph is a path where each vertex is connected to vertices within floor(k/2) distance.

So, for k=4, floor(k/2)=2, so each vertex is connected to vertices within 2 steps.

Therefore, the graph is connected, and hence, one clique suffices.

But in the example, they used two cliques.

So, perhaps their strategy is different.

Maybe they are using a different assignment for a_i to minimize the number of cliques.

Wait, perhaps arranging a_i in a way that minimizes the connections, thereby increasing the number of cliques.

But the problem is to minimize the number of cliques, so we need to maximize connections.

Wait, no, to minimize the number of cliques, we need to maximize the connections, so that fewer cliques are needed.

So, perhaps arranging a_i to maximize the number of edges.

But in the example, they seem to be using a different strategy.

Wait, maybe I should look for a general approach.

One way is to arrange a_i in increasing order, i.e., a_i =i.

Then, |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = 2|i - j| <=k ⇒ |i - j| <= floor(k/2).

So, vertices are connected if their indices are within floor(k/2) distance.

Therefore, the graph consists of connected components where each component has vertices within floor(k/2) distance.

Hence, the number of cliques needed is equal to the number of such connected components.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=5 and k=4, floor(k/2)=2, so vertices are connected if |i - j| <=2.

Thus, the graph is connected, and one clique suffices.

But in the example, they used two cliques.

So, perhaps their approach is different.

Alternatively, maybe their approach is to divide the vertices into groups of size m=ceil(n/k), and assign a_i accordingly.

Wait, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Perhaps I should consider that the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <=k can be manipulated by choosing a_i such that |a_i - a_j| is small when |i - j| is large.

For example, if I arrange a_i in increasing order, then |a_i - a_j| = |i - j|, so |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| = 2|i - j| <=k ⇒ |i - j| <= floor(k/2).

Alternatively, if I arrange a_i in a way that |a_i - a_j| is minimized for larger |i - j|, perhaps by arranging them in a different order.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to realize that the problem allows us to choose any permutation of 1 to n for a_i, and we need to choose it in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

Given that, perhaps choosing a_i =i is sufficient, and then determining the cliques based on the connections.

But in the example, they chose a_i=[3,1,5,2,4], which seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing a_i in a way that groups certain vertices together.

But this seems heuristic.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the simplest approach is to choose a_i =i, and then group vertices into cliques based on their connections.

Given that, for k >=2(n-1), one clique suffices, as all vertices are connected.

For smaller k, the number of cliques needed is ceil(n / m), where m is the maximum number of vertices that can be connected in a clique.

Given that, m can be calculated based on the maximum number of vertices where any two are within the edge condition.

Wait, but this is getting too vague.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to divide the vertices into ceil(n/k) cliques, and assign a_i in a certain way within each clique.

But as seen in the example, this doesn't match the expected output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the Correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
