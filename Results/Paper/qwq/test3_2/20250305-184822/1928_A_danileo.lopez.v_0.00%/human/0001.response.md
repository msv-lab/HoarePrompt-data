Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle with dimensions a by b, both integers. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a single cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to rearrange these two smaller rectangles, possibly rotating them, to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one in terms of its dimensions considered up to rotation.

First, I need to understand what it means for two rectangles to be considered the same. The problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, for example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle. Got it.

Now, Bob is trying to cut his original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one. I need to determine, for given a and b, whether this is possible.

Let me think about the cutting process. Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides. So, he can either cut parallel to the a-side or parallel to the b-side.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the a-side. This would mean making a cut along the length b, dividing it into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b. Then, the two smaller rectangles would be a by b1 and a by b2.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b-side, he divides the length a into two parts, a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a, resulting in two rectangles a1 by b and a2 by b.

After cutting, Bob can rotate these smaller rectangles and arrange them to form a new rectangle. The goal is to form a rectangle that is different from the original one, i.e., its dimensions are not the same as the original up to rotation.

I need to figure out, for given a and b, whether there exists a way to make such a cut and rearrangement to achieve a different rectangle.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the problem: a 2x6 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side (length 2): divide b=6 into, say, 3 and 3. So, two rectangles of 2x3.

- Then, rearranging them, I can place them side by side to get a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 up to rotation).

- Alternatively, I could stack them to get a 2x6 rectangle again, but that's the same as the original.

- So, in this case, it's possible to get a different rectangle.

Another example: 2x1 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side (length 2): divide b=1 into 1 and 0, but 0 is invalid.

- Cut parallel to b-side (length 1): divide a=2 into 1 and 1. So, two 1x1 rectangles.

- Rearranging them, I can place them side by side to get a 2x1 rectangle or stack them to get a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x1 up to rotation.

- So, no different rectangle can be formed.

Another example: 3x2 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side (length 3): divide b=2 into, say, 1 and 1. Two rectangles of 3x1.

- Rearranging them, placing side by side gives a 3x2 (same as original), or stacking them gives a 1x6, which is different from the original 3x2.

- So, yes, a different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, from 3x2, you can cut into two 3x1 and form a 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

But hold on, 1x6 is the same as 6x1, but it's different from 3x2 because 3x2 rotated is 2x3, which is not the same as 1x6.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Another example: 2x2 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side: divide b=2 into 1 and 1. Two rectangles of 2x1.

- Rearranging them, placing side by side gives a 2x2 (same as original), or stacking them gives a 1x4, which is different from the original 2x2.

- So, yes, a different rectangle can be formed.

Another example: 2x4 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side: divide b=4 into, say, 2 and 2. Two rectangles of 2x2.

- Rearranging them, placing side by side gives a 2x4 (same as original), or stacking them gives a 1x8, which is different from the original 2x4.

- So, yes, a different rectangle can be formed.

Last example: 6x3 rectangle.

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side: divide b=3 into, say, 1 and 2. Two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2.

- Rearranging them, placing side by side gives a 6x3 (same as original), or stacking them gives a 1x12 and 2x12, which are 12x1 and 12x2, none of which are the same as 6x3 up to rotation.

- Wait, but the problem says that from 6x3, you cannot form a different rectangle. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem's example, it says:

"However, from the 2x1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1x1, and from these, only the 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same."

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, from 2x4, I can form a 1x8, which is different from 2x4. But in the problem's example, from 6x3, it's saying no other rectangle can be formed.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the problem more carefully.

Wait, in the problem's example, it says:

"from the 6x3 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed."

But in my earlier thought, from 6x3, cutting into 6x1 and 6x2, and stacking them would give 1x12 and 2x12, which are different from 6x3.

But perhaps I'm missing something about the problem's constraints.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have integer sides, and the total area must remain the same.

Yes, the area must remain the same, but the dimensions must be different up to rotation.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, the area is 18. Possible rectangle dimensions with area 18 are:

- 1x18

- 2x9

- 3x6

- 6x3

- 9x2

- 18x1

But considering rotation, 1x18 is the same as 18x1, 2x9 is the same as 9x2, and 3x6 is the same as 6x3.

So, the possible distinct rectangles are 1x18, 2x9, and 3x6.

Now, from a 6x3 rectangle, can we cut and rearrange to form any of these?

- Original: 6x3

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side (length 6): divide b=3 into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = 3.

- So, for example, b1=1, b2=2.

- Two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

- Now, rearranging them:

- Placing them side by side along the a-side: 6x(1+2)=6x3 (same as original).

- Placing them side by side along the b-side: for 6x1 and 6x2, if I place them side by side along the b-side, I'd have to consider their a-sides.

- Wait, to place them side by side along the b-side, I'd be placing the a-sides together.

- So, if I have two rectangles of 6x1 and 6x2, and I place them side by side along the b-side, I'd get a new rectangle with a-side being 6 and b-side being 1 + 2 = 3, which is again 6x3, same as original.

- Alternatively, I can rotate the rectangles.

- If I rotate the 6x1 rectangle to 1x6, and the 6x2 rectangle to 2x6.

- Then, placing them side by side along the a-side (1 + 2 = 3) gives a rectangle of 3x6, which is the same as 6x3 up to rotation.

- Placing them side by side along the b-side (6 + 6 = 12) gives a rectangle of 12x2, which is different from the original 6x3.

- Wait, but in the problem's example, it says that from 6x3, another rectangle cannot be formed.

- But according to this, it seems like I can form a 12x2 rectangle from the two rotated rectangles of 1x6 and 2x6.

- But 12x2 is different from 6x3, as 12x2 rotated is 2x12, which is not the same as 6x3.

- So, why does the problem say "No" for 6x3?

- Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, not just in rotation but in actual size.

Wait, no, the problem says "obtain another rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time."

And in the example, for 6x3, it's "No", meaning he cannot obtain another rectangle.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think again.

From the 6x3 rectangle:

- Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side (length 6): divide b=3 into b1 and b2.

- For example, b1=1, b2=2.

- Two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

- Option 1: Place them side by side along the a-side: 6x(1+2)=6x3 (same as original).

- Option 2: Place them side by side along the b-side: (6 + 6)=12x1 and 12x2.

- Wait, no.

- If I have two rectangles, 6x1 and 6x2, and I place them side by side along the b-side, I need to consider their a-sides.

- So, placing the 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles side by side along their b-sides would mean their a-sides are added.

- Wait, no.

- Let me think differently.

- If I have two rectangles, one of 6x1 and one of 6x2, and I place them side by side along their b-sides, then the new rectangle would have a height of 1 + 2 = 3 and width of 6.

- Which is again 6x3, same as original.

- Alternatively, if I rotate both rectangles by 90 degrees, 6x1 becomes 1x6 and 6x2 becomes 2x6.

- Then, placing them side by side along the a-side: 1 + 2 = 3x6 (same as original up to rotation).

- Placing them side by side along the b-side: 6 + 6 = 12x2, which is different from the original 6x3.

- So, in this case, it seems possible to form a different rectangle.

- But the problem's example says "No" for 6x3.

- Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's example, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that if the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation, it's not considered different.

But in this case, 12x2 is different from 6x3 even up to rotation, since 12x2 rotated is 2x12, which is not the same as 6x3.

So, according to this, it should be "Yes".

But in the problem's example, it's "No".

Hmm, maybe there's a constraint that the new rectangle must have the same area and different dimensions, but I think that's already covered.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, not just up to rotation.

Wait, no, the problem says "obtain another rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time."

And in the note, it explains that two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, in the case of 6x3 and 12x2, they are different up to rotation, so it should be "Yes".

But the problem's example says "No".

Maybe I'm missing some constraint.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the new rectangle has the same area and different dimensions, but the dimensions are not the same up to rotation.

Wait, but 12x2 has the same area as 6x3 (both are 18), and their dimensions are different up to rotation.

So, according to this, it should be "Yes".

I'm confused because the problem's example says "No" for 6x3.

Wait, perhaps in the problem's example, they don't allow rotating the smaller rectangles before rearranging them.

Wait, no, the problem says "Bob can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

So, rotation is allowed.

I must be missing something.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in the 6x3 case, forming a 12x2 rectangle, which is different from 6x3 up to rotation, should be considered a different rectangle.

But the problem's example output for 6x3 is "No".

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's example.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a constraint that the new rectangle must have both dimensions greater than zero and different from the original dimensions up to rotation.

But in the 6x3 case, forming a 12x2, which is different, should be "Yes".

I'm starting to think that the problem's example might have a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem considers that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions, even up to rotation.

Wait, no, the problem says that two rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, in the 6x3 and 12x2 case, they are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, but the way I'm arranging the smaller rectangles is invalid.

Wait, perhaps when rearranging the smaller rectangles, their sides must align in a certain way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the two smaller rectangles after cutting.

I can rotate each of them by 0 or 90 degrees, and then place them side by side either horizontally or vertically to form a new rectangle.

I need to see if the resulting rectangle has different dimensions from the original up to rotation.

In the 6x3 case:

- Cut into 6x1 and 6x2.

- Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally: 6x(1+2)=6x3 (same as original).

- Option 2: Place them side by side vertically: (6+6)x1 and (6+6)x2, which would be 12x1 and 12x2.

- Now, combining 12x1 and 12x2, I can place them side by side horizontally: 12x(1+2)=12x3.

- Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, after cutting and rotating, I have two rectangles, say 1x6 and 2x6.

- Placing them side by side horizontally: along the a-side, which would be (1+2)x6=3x6, which is the same as original up to rotation.

- Placing them side by side vertically: along the b-side, which would be 1x(6+6)=1x12, and 2x(6+6)=2x12, but I have only two rectangles, so I need to place two rectangles together.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify how I'm placing them.

Let me consider that after cutting and rotating, I have two rectangles of sizes s1 and s2.

Then, I can place them side by side either horizontally or vertically.

- Horizontally: their a-sides are added, and b-side remains the same.

- Vertically: their b-sides are added, and a-side remains the same.

But in reality, after rotating, their a and b sides can be interchanged.

Wait, perhaps I need a general approach.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles with dimensions a x b1 and a x b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Or, if cutting parallel to the b-side, b x a1 and b x a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

Then, after rotating each of these rectangles by 0 or 90 degrees, their dimensions become either original or rotated.

So, for each smaller rectangle, its dimensions after rotation can be either a x b1, b1 x a, a x b1, or b1 x a, which are the same.

Wait, rotation doesn't change the set of possible dimensions up to rotation.

Wait, no, rotation can change the orientation, but since the problem considers rotations as the same, maybe I need to think in terms of sorted dimensions.

Let me think in terms of forming a new rectangle with the combination of the two smaller rectangles.

The total area remains a*b.

When combining two smaller rectangles, their dimensions after rotation can be chosen, and they can be placed side by side either horizontally or vertically.

I need to see if the resulting rectangle has dimensions different from the original, up to rotation.

Perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the possible new dimensions.

Let me consider that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle will have dimensions that are a combination of the cuts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the new rectangle's dimensions are determined by the sum of the appropriate sides of the two smaller rectangles.

For example, if I have two smaller rectangles with dimensions c x d and e x f, and I place them side by side horizontally, the new rectangle would have dimensions (c + e) x max(d, f).

Similarly, placing them vertically, it would be max(c, e) x (d + f).

But in reality, it's more nuanced because after rotating, the dimensions can be switched.

Let me try to find a general condition for when it's possible to form a different rectangle.

I need to find if there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them (with possible rotations) to form a new rectangle with dimensions different from the original up to rotation.

Let me consider the total area, which is a*b.

The new rectangle must have the same area, so its dimensions must multiply to a*b.

Also, the new dimensions must be different from a x b up to rotation, meaning that the new dimensions should not be equal to a and b or b and a.

So, the condition is: is there a way to form a rectangle with dimensions p x q, where p*q = a*b, and (p, q) is not the same as (a, b) up to rotation?

But this seems too broad, as there could be many ways to form such a rectangle.

I need to consider the constraints imposed by the cutting and rearranging process.

Let me consider that when I cut the original rectangle, I'm dividing one of its sides into two parts.

Suppose I cut parallel to the a-side, dividing b into b1 and b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

Then, the two smaller rectangles are a x b1 and a x b2.

Now, when rearranging them, I can place them side by side either horizontally or vertically, and I can rotate them.

Similarly, if I cut parallel to the b-side, dividing a into a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a, resulting in two rectangles b x a1 and b x a2.

Again, I can rearrange them by placing side by side horizontally or vertically, with possible rotations.

I need to consider all possible ways of arranging these two rectangles to form a new rectangle and check if any of these arrangements result in dimensions different from the original up to rotation.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical condition that can simplify this.

Let me consider the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a*b.

The area of the new rectangle must also be a*b.

So, the possible dimensions of the new rectangle are pairs (p, q) such that p*q = a*b, and p <= q (to avoid duplicates due to rotation).

Now, I need to check if there exists such a pair (p, q) where p != a or q != b (considering rotation).

But more specifically, I need to check if there's a way to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form such a (p, q).

Given that, perhaps I can find a condition based on the divisibility of a and b.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: Both a and b are odd.

For example, a=3, b=5.

Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to a-side: divide b=5 into, say, 1 and 4.

- Two rectangles: 3x1 and 3x4.

- Arranging them side by side horizontally: 3x5 (same as original).

- Arranging them side by side vertically: (3+3)=6 x max(1,4)=4, so 6x4.

- 6x4 is different from 3x5 up to rotation.

- So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but according to this, it's possible.

But earlier, in the 6x3 case, which has one even and one odd, it's "No" according to the problem's example.

Wait, but in this case, both a and b are odd.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, which is both odd, it's "No".

Wait, in the problem's input, 1x1 is "No", which makes sense because you can't cut it.

Wait, no, 1x1 can be cut into two 1x0.5, but since dimensions are integers, you can't cut 1 into two positive integers.

Wait, but 1 can't be divided into two positive integers that sum to 1, since 1 can only be divided into 1 and 0, but 0 is invalid.

So, for 1x1, no cut is possible, hence "No".

Similarly, for 1x2, you can cut b=2 into 1 and 1, resulting in two 1x1 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally: 1x2 (same as original).

Vertically: (1+1)x1=2x1, which is the same as 1x2 up to rotation.

So, no different rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, for 2x1, same as above.

For 2x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles.

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

So, "Yes".

For 2x4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles.

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 2x4 (same as original).

Vertically: (2+2)x2=4x2, which is the same as 2x4 up to rotation.

Wait, but earlier I thought of forming a 1x8, but that might not be possible.

Wait, if I have two 2x2 rectangles, I can rotate one of them to 2x2 (rotation doesn't change dimensions).

Then, placing them side by side horizontally: 2x4.

Vertically: 4x2.

But both are the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, so in this case, it seems like I can't form a different rectangle.

But in my earlier thought process, I thought I could form a 1x8.

But how?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

If I have two 2x2 rectangles, and I place them side by side horizontally, it's 2x4.

If I place them vertically, it's 4x2.

Rotating them doesn't change their dimensions.

So, in this case, I can't form a different rectangle.

But according to the problem's example, for 2x4, it's "Yes".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I can cut differently.

Wait, for 2x4, I can cut parallel to the a-side (length 2): divide b=4 into, say, 1 and 3.

Then, two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x3.

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 2x4 (same as original).

Vertically: (2+2)x1=4x1 and (2+2)x3=4x3.

So, 4x1 is the same as 1x4, and 4x3 is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, I can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x4 up to rotation.

Hence, "Yes".

Wait, but earlier I thought that for 6x3, I can form a 12x2, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the problem's example, it's "No".

I'm getting conflicting results.

Perhaps there's a pattern based on whether a or b is even.

Looking back at the problem's examples:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking at these, it seems that if at least one of a or b is even, then it's "Yes", otherwise "No".

Wait, in the 1x1 case, both are odd, and it's "No".

2x1: one even, one odd, "No".

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, one odd, one even, it's "Yes".

2x6: both even, "Yes".

2x2: both even, "Yes".

2x4: both even, "Yes".

6x3: one even, one odd, "No".

Wait, this contradicts my earlier hypothesis.

Wait, according to this pattern, if a is even or b is even, then "Yes", except for some cases like 2x1.

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), and it's "No".

But in 2x2, a=2 (even), b=2 (even), "Yes".

In 2x4, a=2 (even), b=4 (even), "Yes".

In 3x2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), "Yes".

In 6x3, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd), "No".

Wait, so when a is even and b is odd, it's "No".

But in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), "No".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd), "No".

In the 3x2 case, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), "Yes".

Wait, this seems inconsistent with my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if both a and b are even, or if one of them is even and the other is odd, but with some exceptions.

Wait, no, in 2x1 (a even, b odd), it's "No".

In 3x2 (a odd, b even), it's "Yes".

In 6x3 (a even, b odd), it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if both are even, or if one is even and the other is a multiple of 4.

Wait, in 3x2, 2 is even, but 3 is not a multiple of 4; it's "Yes".

In 2x1, 2 is even, 1 is not a multiple of 4; it's "No".

In 6x3, 6 is even, 3 is not a multiple of 4; it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if both are even, or if one is even and the other is divisible by 2 but not by 4.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

If the GCD of a and b is 1, then it's "No", else "Yes".

But in the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, and it's "Yes".

Wait, no, GCD of 3 and 2 is 1, and it's "Yes".

In the 2x1 case, GCD is 1, and it's "No".

In the 6x3 case, GCD is 3, and it's "No".

Wait, doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on whether a*b is even or odd.

If a*b is even, then "Yes", else "No".

But in the 1x1 case, a*b=1, which is odd, "No".

In the 2x1 case, a*b=2, even, "No".

In the 2x2 case, a*b=4, even, "Yes".

So, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even, except for some specific cases like 2x1.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a is even, but it's "No".

In the 3x2 case, b is even, and it's "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a is even, and it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a is even and a >= some value.

Wait, a=2 in 2x1 is "No", but a=2 in 2x2 is "Yes".

So, maybe it's "Yes" if a or b is even and a, b >= some minimum values.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even and neither a nor b is 1.

In the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), but b=1, so "No".

In the 2x2 case, a=2 (even), b=2, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, b=2 (even), a=3, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 (even), b=3, but b=3 is odd, and a=6 is even, but it's "No".

Wait, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if both a and b are even, or if one is even and the other is divisible by some factor.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even and a or b is not 1 or 2.

In the 2x1 case, a=2 is even, but b=1, and it's "No".

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, b=2 even, a=3, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even and a and b are both greater than 1.

In the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1, but b=1, so "No".

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, b=2 even, a=3, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3, but b=3, which is greater than 1, but it's "No" according to the problem's example.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even and a and b are not both powers of 2.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, 2 is a power of 2, b=1 is a power of 2, and it's "No".

In the 2x2 case, both are powers of 2, and it's "Yes".

Wait, no, 2 is a power of 2, but in this case, it's "Yes".

I'm getting more confused.

Maybe I should look for a mathematical condition.

Let me consider that to form a different rectangle, the new dimensions p and q must satisfy p*q = a*b, and p != a or q != b up to rotation.

Moreover, p and q must be achievable by arranging the two smaller rectangles after cutting and rotating.

So, p and q must be such that there exist integers c, d, e, f with c*d + e*f = a*b, where c and d are dimensions of one smaller rectangle, and e and f are dimensions of the other, after possible rotation.

But since rotation allows c and d to be interchanged, and e and f to be interchanged, it's a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after cutting, the two smaller rectangles have areas that sum to a*b, and their dimensions are constrained by the cut.

Wait, more specifically, if I cut parallel to the a-side, dividing b into b1 and b2, then the two rectangles are a x b1 and a x b2.

If I rotate them, they become a x b1 or b1 x a, which are the same up to rotation.

Similarly for b x a1 and b x a2 if cutting parallel to the b-side.

Then, when arranging them to form a new rectangle, I can place them side by side either horizontally or vertically.

- Horizontally: their a-sides are added, and the b-side remains the same.

- Vertically: their b-sides are added, and the a-side remains the same.

Wait, no.

Actually, if I have two rectangles with dimensions c x d and e x f, and I place them side by side horizontally, the new rectangle has dimensions
