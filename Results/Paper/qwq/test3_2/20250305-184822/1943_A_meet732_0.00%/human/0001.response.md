Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array of integers. Alice starts with an empty array c. In each turn, Alice picks an element from the original array a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from a, and just deletes it from a. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in c. Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final score will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for minimum excludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not. MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4, as 0,1,2,3 are present, but 4 is not.

So, the goal is to find the MEX of array c after the game ends, with both players playing optimally. Alice wants to maximize this MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

Let me think about how the game progresses. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. Alice picks an element to add to c and removes it from a, while Bob just removes an element from a without adding it to c. The game ends when a is empty.

I need to consider how the elements are chosen and how they affect the final composition of c, which determines the MEX.

Let me consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's look at the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

One possible game play is:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

So, c = [1,0], MEX is 2.

Is this the optimal play? Let's see.

Another possible play:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0,1,1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0,1], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

c = [0,1], MEX is 2 again.

Seems like regardless of their choices, MEX is 2.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he might try to force a lower MEX.

Let me think differently.

If Alice picks 0 first:

- c = [0], a = [0,1,1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0,1], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

c = [0,1], MEX = 2

If Alice picks 1 first:

- c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

c = [1,0], MEX = 2

Same result.

Is there a way for Bob to force a lower MEX? Suppose in the first scenario, after Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1 instead of 0:

- c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0,0]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

c = [1,0], MEX = 2 again.

Seems like MEX is always 2 in this case.

Looking at the second test case:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

Possible play:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a = [2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [0,2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

c = [0,2], MEX = 1

Another play:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a = [2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [1,2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

c = [1,2], MEX = 0

Wait, but in the output, it's 1. So, 1 is the optimal MEX.

But in the second play, MEX is 0, which is lower.

So, perhaps Bob can force a lower MEX, but in optimal play, it's 1.

I need to understand the optimal strategies.

Looking at the third test case:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

Possible play:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

c = [1], MEX = 0

Another play:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

c = [1], MEX = 0

Same result.

So, MEX is always 0 in this case.

From these examples, it seems that the MEX depends on which numbers are present in c at the end, and the players' choices affect which numbers are included in c.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants to have as many small integers present in c as possible, up to a certain point, to make the MEX higher.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain numbers in c, preferably the smaller ones, to make the MEX lower.

I need to find a way to model their optimal play.

Let me think about the game mechanics.

Total number of turns is n, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting.

Alice gets to choose elements to include in c, while Bob just removes elements.

So, Alice has some control over what goes into c, but Bob can influence by removing elements that Alice might want to include.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements, not choose what Alice picks.

Wait, no: Bob removes an element from a, but he chooses which one to remove.

So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want to include in c, thereby forcing her to pick from the remaining elements.

Wait, but Alice picks first, then Bob, alternately, until a is empty.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that in each turn, Alice picks an element to add to c and removes it from a, and Bob picks an element to remove from a.

So, in total, in each full round (Alice and Bob's turn), two elements are removed from a: one by Alice (which goes to c) and one by Bob (which doesn't).

This continues until a is empty.

Wait, but n can be up to 2e5, which is large, so I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to compute the final MEX efficiently for multiple test cases, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(n), but since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 2e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, it should be manageable.

Now, to model the game.

I need to think about what numbers are included in c and which are not, based on the players' choices.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants to have as many small numbers in c as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain small numbers in c.

I need to find out, for each number from 0 to n, whether it will be present in c or not, based on optimal play.

Wait, but MEX is the smallest missing number in c, starting from 0.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many consecutive numbers starting from 0 in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of which numbers are available and how many times they appear.

Let me consider counting the frequency of each number in a.

Let me denote cnt[i] as the number of times i appears in a.

Now, for each number i from 0 to n, I need to decide whether it will be included in c or not, based on the players' strategies.

Alice will try to include the smallest possible numbers in c, while Bob will try to prevent that.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements from a, not directly from c.

Wait, no: Bob removes elements from a, which are not added to c.

So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want to include in c, thereby forcing her to pick other elements.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

If a number appears only once, and Alice picks it, it goes to c.

If it appears multiple times, Alice can choose to pick it multiple times, but Bob can remove some instances.

I need to model this more carefully.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Let me sort the numbers and see.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many times each number is available to be included in c.

Since Alice picks elements to include in c and both players pick elements to remove from a, I need to see how many times each number can be included in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number is available to be included in c, considering the number of times it appears in a and the number of times it can be picked by Alice.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical way to compute the MEX.

Looking back at the examples:

First test case:

a = [0,0,1,1]

n = 4

Possible c = [1,0], MEX = 2

Second test case:

a = [0,1,2,3]

Possible c = [0,2], MEX = 1

Third test case:

a = [1,1]

c = [1], MEX = 0

Looking at the frequencies:

First test case:

cnt = [2,2,0,0]

Second test case:

cnt = [1,1,1,1]

Third test case:

cnt = [0,2,0,0]

In the first test case, both 0 and 1 appear twice.

Alice can include both in c, so MEX is 2.

In the second test case, all numbers from 0 to 3 appear once.

Alice can include two of them, but Bob can choose to prevent certain numbers from being included.

In the optimal play, c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

In the third test case, only 1 appears twice.

c = [1], MEX = 0.

So, in the second test case, if Alice includes 0 and 2, MEX is 1.

If she includes 0 and 1, MEX is 2.

But the output is 1, so perhaps Bob can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, but if Alice includes 0 and 1, c = [0,1], MEX = 2.

If she includes 0 and 2, c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

So, Bob can force MEX to be 1 by removing 1 and 3, or something.

Wait, let's think step by step.

In the second test case:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

Alice starts:

- Chooses 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

- Bob removes 1, a = [2,3]

- Alice chooses 2, c = [0,2], a = [3]

- Bob removes 3, a = []

So, c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice chooses 1, c = [1], a = [0,2,3]

- Bob removes 0, a = [2,3]

- Alice chooses 2, c = [1,2], a = [3]

- Bob removes 3, a = []

c = [1,2], MEX = 0

But in the output, it's 1, so perhaps the first play is the optimal one.

Wait, but in the first play, MEX is 1, in the second play, MEX is 0.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would prefer MEX=0.

But the output is 1, so perhaps there is a better strategy.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning that Alice tries to maximize MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it, considering all possible moves.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players play optimally.

I need to find the optimal MEX that results from their plays.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the number of times each number appears.

If a number appears only once, and Alice picks it, it goes to c.

If it appears multiple times, Alice can pick it multiple times, but Bob can remove some instances.

I need to find out how many times each number can be included in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number can be included in c, considering the number of times it appears and the number of times it can be picked by Alice.

Let me consider that Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting.

Total number of turns is n, with Alice and Bob each getting floor(n/2) turns, and Alice getting one extra if n is odd.

Wait, more precisely:

- If n is even: Alice has n/2 turns, Bob has n/2 turns.

- If n is odd: Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, Bob has floor(n/2) turns.

In each of Alice's turns, she picks an element to include in c and removes it from a.

In each of Bob's turns, he picks an element to remove from a.

So, the total number of elements included in c is the number of Alice's turns.

For example, if n is even, c will have n/2 elements.

If n is odd, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, no, because in each turn, Alice picks one element to include in c and removes it, and Bob picks one element to remove.

So, in total, in each full round (Alice and Bob's turn), two elements are removed: one goes to c, one is removed.

If n is even, there are n/2 full rounds, so c will have n/2 elements.

If n is odd, there are floor(n/2) full rounds and one extra Alice's turn, so c will have floor(n/2) + 1 elements.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total turns:

- Alice has ceil(n/2) turns.

- Bob has floor(n/2) turns.

Because Alice starts and has one extra turn if n is odd.

So, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, but in each of Alice's turns, she picks one element to include in c and removes it.

In each of Bob's turns, he removes one element.

So, total elements removed per full round (Alice and Bob's turn): 2.

Number of full rounds: floor(n/2).

Elements removed in full rounds: 2 * floor(n/2).

If n is even, all elements are removed.

If n is odd, one element is left, which Alice picks in her extra turn.

So, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

Yes, that's correct.

So, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

Now, I need to choose which elements go into c to maximize or minimize the MEX.

But Alice chooses which elements to include in c, and Bob can only remove elements.

Wait, no: Alice picks an element to include in c and removes it, and Bob picks an element to remove.

So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want to include in c, thereby affecting her choices.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the frequency count of each number.

For each number i, cnt[i] is the number of times it appears in a.

Now, Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in c to maximize MEX.

Bob wants to prevent that by removing elements that Alice might want to include.

I need to find out, for each number i, whether it can be included in c or not, considering the optimal play.

Perhaps I can iterate through the numbers in order, from 0 to n, and decide how many times each number should be included in c.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define that Alice can include a number i in c if she picks it before Bob removes all instances of it.

Bob, on the other hand, can choose to remove instances of i to prevent Alice from including them in c.

I need to model this as a game where Alice and Bob make choices optimally.

This seems complex, so maybe I can look for a pattern based on the frequency counts.

Looking back at the test cases:

First test case:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

cnt = [2,2,0,0]

c has ceil(4/2) = 2 elements.

Possible c: [0,1], MEX = 2

Second test case:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

cnt = [1,1,1,1]

c has 2 elements.

Possible c: [0,2], MEX = 1

Third test case:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

cnt = [0,2]

c has 1 element.

c = [1], MEX = 0

From these, it seems that the MEX depends on which numbers are included in c.

I need to find a way to determine which numbers will be included in c based on optimal play.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include the smallest possible numbers to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to prevent that.

Wait, actually, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible, up to a certain point.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain small numbers.

Let me think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

If a number appears multiple times, Alice can include it multiple times, but Bob can remove some instances.

Wait, but since MEX only cares about the presence of numbers, not their frequency, including multiple instances of the same number doesn't help in increasing the MEX.

So, for MEX purposes, including a number once is sufficient.

Therefore, for each number, we only care about whether it is included in c at least once or not.

So, I can think in terms of whether each number from 0 to n is present in c or not.

Alice wants as many small numbers as possible to be present in c to maximize the MEX.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each number i from 0 to n, I need to determine if it will be present in c or not, based on optimal play.

Let me consider that.

Let’s sort the numbers from 0 to n based on their importance for MEX.

The smallest numbers are the most important.

Alice will try to include the smallest numbers possible, while Bob will try to prevent that.

So, for each number i from 0 to n, I need to see if it can be included in c despite Bob's attempts to prevent it.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) choices to include elements in c, and Bob has floor(n/2) choices to remove elements, I need to see which numbers can be included in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number appears and how many times it can be included in c.

If a number appears cnt[i] times, and Bob can remove up to floor(n/2) elements, but he can only remove elements that are not included in c.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some game theory problems involving choosing elements to maximize or minimize some value, it can be modeled using greedy strategies or by considering the parity of the counts.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have the frequency counts of each number.

I need to select ceil(n/2) elements to include in c, while Bob tries to prevent certain selections.

Perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and decide whether to include them in c or not, based on their frequencies and the number of selections left.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of available selections and the frequency of each number.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s sort the numbers from 0 to n in increasing order.

For each number i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can choose to include i in c, provided that Bob hasn't removed all instances of i.

- Bob can choose to remove instances of i to prevent Alice from including them.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the total number of selections Alice can make: ceil(n/2).

Let’s denote the number of selections Alice can make as a = ceil(n/2).

Similarly, Bob can make b = floor(n/2) selections.

Now, for each number i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > b, then Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes b instances, there will still be cnt[i] - b instances left for Alice to include.

- If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can potentially prevent Alice from including i in c by removing all cnt[i] instances.

But Alice has a = ceil(n/2) selections to include elements in c.

So, for the numbers i from 0 to n, in order:

- If cnt[i] > b, Alice can include i in c.

- If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can choose to remove cnt[i] instances to prevent Alice from including i.

But Alice has a selections to include elements, so she can include up to a numbers in c.

I need to find the smallest i such that, given the frequencies, Alice cannot include i in c, even if she tries.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and for each i, check if cnt[i] > b.

If cnt[i] > b, then Alice can include i in c, and she should, to maximize MEX.

If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can choose to remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

But, Alice has a selections to include elements.

So, she can include up to a different elements, but Bob can prioritize removing elements to prevent Alice from including certain i.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in similar problems, the optimal MEX can be determined by finding the smallest i such that the number of available selections for Alice is less than the number of times i is needed to be included.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of times each i appears and how many selections Alice has.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times each i appears and the number of selections Alice can make.

Let’s denote a = ceil(n/2), the number of elements Alice can include in c.

Now, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small i as possible.

So, she will try to include i starting from 0 upwards.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including small i.

Given that, perhaps the optimal MEX is the smallest i such that the cumulative sum of cnt[j] for j from 0 to i is less than a + b, where b = floor(n/2).

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the frequencies cnt[i] for i from 0 to n.

Total elements: n.

Alice includes a = ceil(n/2) elements in c.

Bob removes b = floor(n/2) elements.

So, total elements removed are a + b = n.

But Alice chooses which elements to include in c, and Bob chooses which to remove.

I need to find out which elements are included in c.

This seems similar to selecting a subset of elements under some constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as selecting the top a elements that Alice wants, considering Bob's interference.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a pattern based on the test cases.

In the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

cnt = [2,2,0,0]

a = ceil(4/2) = 2

Alice can include two elements in c.

She can include 0 and 1, so MEX is 2.

In the second test case:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

cnt = [1,1,1,1]

a = 2

Alice can include any two different numbers.

If she includes 0 and 1, c = [0,1], MEX = 2

If she includes 0 and 2, c = [0,2], MEX = 1

If she includes 0 and 3, c = [0,3], MEX = 1

If she includes 1 and 2, c = [1,2], MEX = 0

If she includes 1 and 3, c = [1,3], MEX = 0

If she includes 2 and 3, c = [2,3], MEX = 0

Bob can force MEX to be 1 by removing elements strategically.

Wait, but in the output, it's 1.

So, perhaps the optimal MEX is 1.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

cnt = [0,2]

a = 1

Alice includes one element in c, which is 1.

MEX is 0.

So, in general, it seems that the MEX is determined by how many small numbers Alice can include in c.

I need to find the smallest i such that the cumulative sum of cnt[j] for j from 0 to i is less than a.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try.

In the first test case:

i=0: cnt[0]=2 >= a=2, so include 0.

i=1: cnt[1]=2 >= a=2, so include 1.

So, MEX is 2.

In the second test case:

i=0: cnt[0]=1 < a=2, so cannot include 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the cumulative sum of cnt[j] for j from 0 to i and compare it with a.

If the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to a + b, then Alice can include j from 0 to i in c.

Wait, not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall a similar problem where two players alternately pick elements from a set, and the goal is to maximize or minimize some function of the selected elements.

In such problems, often the solution involves greedy strategies where players pick the best available option at each step.

In this case, Alice wants to include the smallest possible numbers to maximize MEX, and Bob wants to prevent that.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and decide for each number whether it can be included in c or not, based on the frequency and the number of selections left.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s sort the numbers from 0 to n in increasing order.

Initialize a counter for the number of elements Alice can include in c: a = ceil(n/2).

For each i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > 0:

- If cnt[i] > b (where b = floor(n/2)), then Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes b instances, there are still cnt[i] - b instances left for Alice to include.

- Else, if cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can choose to remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

But this seems similar to what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the remaining selections that Alice and Bob can make.

Let’s define a = ceil(n/2) (Alice's selections) and b = floor(n/2) (Bob's selections).

For each i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > b:

- Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes b instances, there are still cnt[i] - b instances left for Alice to include.

- So, include i in c and reduce a by 1 (since one selection is used).

- Else:

- Bob can remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

- So, do not include i in c.

- If a <= 0, stop, as Alice has no more selections left.

Then, the MEX is the smallest i where either cnt[i] <= b or a becomes 0.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me test this with the first test case.

n = 4

a = ceil(4/2) = 2

b = floor(4/2) = 2

cnt = [2,2,0,0]

For i=0:

cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

So, Bob can prevent Alice from including 0 in c.

So, MEX is 0.

But in the example, MEX is 2.

This contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, maybe it's cnt[i] > b.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

So, according to this, MEX is 0, but in reality, it's 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include up to a elements in c, and Bob can remove up to b elements.

I need to select a subset of a elements from a, considering Bob's removals.

This seems similar to selecting a elements from a set where Bob can remove b elements.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of elements that Alice can guarantee to include, despite Bob's removals.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different perspective.

I recall that in some games, the outcome can be determined by the number of available moves and the parity of the counts.

Perhaps I can consider the parity of cnt[i] and the number of selections.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements.

The total number of elements is n = a + b.

I need to find which elements are included in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each element appears and how many times it can be included in c.

If cnt[i] >= b + 1, then Alice can include i in c, because even if Bob removes b instances, one instance remains for Alice to include.

If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] >= b + 1, then i is included in c.

Otherwise, it's not.

Then, the MEX is the smallest i where cnt[i] < b + 1.

Wait, let's test this with the first test case.

n = 4

a = 2

b = 2

cnt = [2,2,0,0]

For i=0:

cnt[0]=2 >= b + 1 = 3? No.

So, cnt[0] < 3, so not included in c.

So, MEX is 0.

But in reality, MEX is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's cnt[i] > b.

In the first test case:

cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No.

So, not included.

cnt[1]=2 > b=2? No.

So, not included.

So, c is empty, MEX is 0.

But in reality, MEX is 2.

Contradiction.

So, this approach is wrong.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements.

I need to select a subset of a elements such that the MEX is maximized.

But Bob is trying to minimize the MEX.

So, it's like a game where Alice picks a elements, and Bob picks b elements to remove.

I need to find the MEX of the subset that Alice can guarantee to achieve, considering Bob's interference.

This seems similar to a minimax problem, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.

To solve this, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and decide for each number whether it can be included in c or not.

Let me try to think in terms of greedy selection.

Suppose I sort the numbers from 0 to n in increasing order.

Then, for each i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > 0, and Alice can include it in c, then she includes it.

- Otherwise, it's not included.

But I need to consider Bob's removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number is available after Bob's removals.

If cnt[i] > b, then after Bob removes b instances, there are still cnt[i] - b instances left for Alice to include.

So, if cnt[i] > b, Alice can include i in c.

If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i.

So, the numbers that can be included in c are those with cnt[i] > b.

Then, c will contain all i with cnt[i] > b.

The MEX is the smallest i such that cnt[i] <= b.

Wait, but in the first test case:

b = 2

cnt[0]=2 > 2? No.

So, MEX is 0.

But in reality, MEX is 2.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a instead of b.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No.

But in reality, MEX is 2.

So, perhaps the condition is cnt[i] > b - something.

This is not working.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c.

She wants to include the smallest possible numbers to maximize the MEX.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from including certain small numbers.

So, perhaps I can sort the numbers in increasing order and try to include as many as possible, considering the frequencies and the number of selections Alice has.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n, and for each number, check if Alice can include it in c.

If she can, she includes it and decreases her remaining selections.

If not, it's not included.

The MEX is the smallest i where Alice cannot include i in c.

Let me formalize this.

Initialize a = ceil(n/2), b = floor(n/2)

For i from 0 to n:

if cnt[i] > b:

Alice can include i in c, even if Bob removes b instances.

Include i in c, decrease a by 1.

else:

Bob can remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

If a <= 0, stop.

The MEX is the smallest i where either cnt[i] <= b or a becomes 0.

But in the first test case, b=2, cnt[0]=2 <= 2, so not included.

MEX is 0, but actual MEX is 2.

This approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include multiple instances of a number, but as MEX only cares about presence, it's irrelevant.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include up to a elements, and she should include the smallest possible numbers to maximize MEX.

So, she should try to include 0 first, then 1, and so on, up to the point where she runs out of selections.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to prevent this by removing elements that Alice wants to include.

Given that, perhaps the optimal MEX is the smallest i such that the cumulative sum of cnt[j] for j from 0 to i is less than a + 1.

Wait, not sure.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements from a.

I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset of a elements such that the MEX is maximized, but Bob can remove b elements from the original set.

This seems similar to selecting a elements from the remaining set after Bob's removals.

But it's getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some game theory problems, the outcome can be determined by the number of moves each player has and the structure of the game.

In this case, perhaps I can consider the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can include them despite Bob's removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number appears and the number of selections Alice has.

Let’s define that for each number i, if cnt[i] > b, then Alice can include i in c.

Because even if Bob removes b instances, there is still at least one instance left for Alice to include.

If cnt[i] <= b, then Bob can remove all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including i in c.

So, the numbers that can be included in c are those with cnt[i] > b.

Then, the MEX is the smallest i such that cnt[i] <= b.

Wait, but in the first test case, b=2, cnt[0]=2 <= 2, so MEX should be 0, but actual MEX is 2.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, in the first test case, cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No, 2 > 2 is False.

So, according to this, MEX is 0, but actual MEX is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements from a.

I need to select a subset of a elements from the remaining set after Bob's removals.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different perspective.

I recall that in some games, the outcome can be determined by the minimal number of moves required to achieve a certain state.

In this case, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of elements that Alice needs to include to achieve a certain MEX.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through possible MEX values and check if Alice can include enough elements to achieve that MEX.

Let’s define that for a given MEX k, Alice needs to include all j < k in c.

So, the number of elements Alice needs to include is the number of j from 0 to k-1 that are present in a, i.e., cnt[j] > 0.

But she can only include a elements in c.

Also, Bob can remove b elements.

So, for a given k, the number of j < k with cnt[j] > 0 should be less than or equal to a.

But in reality, it's more complicated because Bob can remove elements strategically.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each j < k, the number of times j appears in a should be greater than b, so that Alice can include j in c.

Wait, but in the first test case, for k=2, j=0 and j=1.

cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No.

So, according to this, k=2 is not achievable, but in reality, MEX=2 is achievable.

Contradiction.

This approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and she wants to include as many small numbers as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that by removing elements that Alice wants to include.

So, perhaps I can sort the numbers in increasing order and try to include as many as possible, considering the frequencies and the number of selections Alice has.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n, and for each number, if cnt[i] > 0, and Alice has selections left, she includes it in c.

Bob can remove elements that Alice wants to include.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the frequencies cnt[i] for i from 0 to n.

I need to select a subset of a elements such that the MEX is maximized.

But Bob can remove b elements to minimize the MEX.

I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's interference.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Perhaps I can model it as follows:

- Alice tries to maximize the MEX.

- Bob tries to minimize the MEX.

- The final MEX is the result of their optimal play.

I need to find that value.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that for a given k, I can check if Alice can include all j < k in c, despite Bob's removals.

If she can, then MEX can be at least k.

Otherwise, MEX is less than k.

Then, I can perform a binary search on k to find the minimal k where Alice cannot include all j < k in c.

Wait, perhaps.

Let’s define a function canAchieve(k):

- For all j from 0 to k-1:

- If cnt[j] <= b, then Bob can remove all cnt[j] instances, preventing Alice from including j in c.

- Else, Alice can include j in c.

- The number of j < k where cnt[j] > b should be at least a.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps:

- For a given k, the number of j < k with cnt[j] > b should be at least a.

- Because for each such j, Alice can include j in c.

- If the number of such j is greater than or equal to a, then Alice can include a elements from j < k, achieving MEX = k.

- Otherwise, MEX is less than k.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=2, j=0 and j=1.

cnt[0]=2 > b=2? No.

cnt[1]=2 > b=2? No.

So, number of j < 2 with cnt[j] > b is 0, which is less than a=2.

So, according to this, MEX is less than 2.

But in reality, MEX is 2.

Contradiction.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements.

I need to select a subset of a elements such that the MEX is maximized.

But Bob can remove elements to minimize the MEX.

I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's interference.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some similar problems, the MEX can be determined by the number of available elements and the number of selections.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can include them.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include up to min(cnt[i], a) elements for each i.

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include a elements in c, and Bob can remove b elements.

I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's removals.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 0 to n and for each number, decide if it can be included in c or not.

Let me try to think in terms of the frequency of each number.

If a number appears only once, and Alice picks it, it goes
