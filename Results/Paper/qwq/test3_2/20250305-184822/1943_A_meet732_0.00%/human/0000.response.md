Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array of size n. Alice starts with an empty array c. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from a, and deletes it from a. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in c. Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find the final score if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the MEX concept clearly. MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example, MEX of [2,2,1] is 0, since 0 is missing. MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, as 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing. MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4, since 0,1,2,3 are present.

So, the goal is to find the MEX of array c, which is built by Alice and Bob taking turns to remove elements from a, with Alice trying to maximize MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

Let me think about how Alice and Bob will play.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many small integers as possible in c, to make the MEX as large as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having those small integers in c.

Since Alice can choose which element to add to c on her turn, and Bob can choose any element to remove on his turn, their strategies will involve selecting elements that benefit their objectives.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0,0,1,1]

Possible game play:

- Alice picks 1 and adds to c. Now, a = [0,0,1], c = [1]

- Bob picks 0 from a. Now, a = [0,1], c = [1]

- Alice picks 0 and adds to c. Now, a = [1], c = [1,0]

- Bob picks 1 from a. Now, a = [], c = [1,0]

MEX of c = [1,0] is 2, which is what's in the sample output.

Another possible game play:

- Alice picks 0 and adds to c. Now, a = [0,1,1], c = [0]

- Bob picks 1 from a. Now, a = [0,1], c = [0]

- Alice picks 1 and adds to c. Now, a = [0], c = [0,1]

- Bob picks 0 from a. Now, a = [], c = [0,1]

MEX of c = [0,1] is 2 again.

It seems like regardless of how they play, the MEX is 2 in this case.

Looking at the second test case:

n = 4

a = [0,1,2,3]

Possible game play:

- Alice picks 0 and adds to c. Now, a = [1,2,3], c = [0]

- Bob picks 1 from a. Now, a = [2,3], c = [0]

- Alice picks 2 and adds to c. Now, a = [3], c = [0,2]

- Bob picks 3 from a. Now, a = [], c = [0,2]

MEX of c = [0,2] is 1, which matches the sample output.

Another possible play:

- Alice picks 1 and adds to c. Now, a = [0,2,3], c = [1]

- Bob picks 0 from a. Now, a = [2,3], c = [1]

- Alice picks 2 and adds to c. Now, a = [3], c = [1,2]

- Bob picks 3 from a. Now, a = [], c = [1,2]

MEX of c = [1,2] is 0.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1. So, perhaps Alice and Bob can influence the MEX differently based on their choices.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully about their strategies.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, which means she wants c to have as many small integers as possible. Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having those small integers in c.

Given that, perhaps the key is to look at the frequency of each number in a, especially the small ones.

Let's think in terms of counts of each number.

Suppose we count how many times each number from 0 to n appears in a.

Then, Alice and Bob will be picking these numbers, with Alice trying to include certain numbers in c, and Bob trying to exclude them.

I need to find a way to determine, for each number, whether it will be in c or not, considering their optimal play.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of who has more control over including or excluding numbers.

Since Alice picks first and can choose to include a number in c, and Bob can only remove a number without choosing what goes into c, Alice has some advantage in deciding what goes into c.

But Bob can influence what remains in a, potentially affecting Alice's choices in later turns.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

If a number appears an even number of times, Bob can ensure that an even number of them are removed, meaning that an even number are left for c.

If a number appears an odd number of times, Alice can decide whether to include one more in c or not.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of parity of counts.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's consider the counts of each number in a.

For each number i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] is even:

- Bob can ensure that an even number of them are removed, so the number of i in c is even.

- If cnt[i] is odd:

- Alice can choose to include one more in c, making the total in c odd.

Wait, is that accurate?

Actually, since Alice picks first and can choose what to include in c, and Bob can only remove elements, perhaps the parity argument isn't directly applicable here.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I try to determine, for each number i, whether it's possible to have i in c.

Starting from i=0, which is the smallest number.

If cnt[0] > 0, Alice can choose to include 0 in c on her first turn, since she picks first.

Bob might try to prevent this, but since Alice picks first, she can force 0 to be in c if she wants.

Wait, but Bob can also remove 0 on his turn, but only if it's still in a.

Wait, no. On Bob's turn, he picks and deletes an element from a, but doesn't add it to c.

Alice is the one who decides what goes into c.

So, if Alice wants 0 in c, she can pick 0 and add it to c on her turn.

Bob can't directly prevent that, unless he removes all 0s before Alice gets a chance to pick one.

But Alice goes first, so she can pick a 0 immediately if available.

Wait, but Bob can remove a 0 on his turn, reducing the count.

Let's say cnt[0] = k.

Each time Bob removes a 0, he decreases cnt[0] by 1.

Alice can pick a 0 and add it to c, also decreasing cnt[0] by 1.

So, the total number of 0s that can be added to c is roughly ceil(k / 2), since Alice and Bob take turns, and Alice goes first.

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but something similar.

Wait, let's think in terms of the number of turns.

Total turns are n, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting first.

So, Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob has floor(n/2) turns.

In each of Alice's turns, she can choose to add a 0 to c, provided that 0 is still available in a.

Similarly, Bob can choose to remove a 0 from a on his turns.

So, the net effect is that for each 0 in a, Alice can choose whether to include it in c or not, depending on her and Bob's choices.

This seems complex to model directly.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice wants as many small numbers in c as possible, while Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each i from 0 to n, I need to determine if i can be in c when both play optimally.

Starting with i=0.

If cnt[0] > 0, Alice can choose to include 0 in c on her first turn, since she goes first.

Bob can try to prevent this by removing 0s, but Alice can prioritize adding 0 to c.

So, if cnt[0] is at least 1, Alice can ensure that 0 is in c.

Wait, but what if cnt[0] is 1, and Bob removes it?

No, Bob can only remove one element per turn, but Alice picks first.

So, if cnt[0] >=1, Alice can pick 0 and add it to c, ensuring that 0 is in c.

Hence, 0 will be in c, and MEX will be the smallest i not in c.

So, MEX will be at least 1.

Similarly, for i=1, if cnt[1] >=1, Alice can pick 1 and add it to c, ensuring 1 is in c.

Wait, but Bob might try to prevent that by removing 1s.

Wait, but Alice goes first, so she can pick 1 first.

So, perhaps for each i, if cnt[i] >=1, Alice can ensure that i is in c.

Hence, MEX would be n, which is not the case in the sample input.

Wait, but in the first sample input, n=4, a=[0,0,1,1], and output is 2.

But according to this, since cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0, cnt[3]=0.

So, MEX should be 2, which matches.

In the second sample, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], output is 1.

Here, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

According to above logic, Alice can pick 0 and 1 and add to c, so c=[0,1], MEX=2, but sample output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, so my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Apparently, even if cnt[i]>=1, Alice may not be able to ensure that i is in c, because Bob can interfere.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of times each number appears and how Alice and Bob can influence their inclusion in c.

Let's consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, with Alice trying to maximize MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

The MEX is determined by the smallest missing number in c.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants c to contain as many small numbers as possible.

Conversely, Bob wants to prevent Alice from having those small numbers in c.

Given that Alice can choose what to add to c, and Bob can only remove elements from a, Alice has some control over what goes into c.

However, Bob can influence what remains in a for Alice to choose from.

This seems like a competitive game where both players make optimal moves.

Perhaps I can model this as a game where Alice tries to include certain numbers in c, and Bob tries to exclude them.

Let me try to think in terms of the frequency of each number.

Suppose I have the count of each number from 0 to n in a.

For each number i, if cnt[i] is greater than 0, Alice can try to include i in c.

But Bob can try to reduce cnt[i] by removing i from a.

Since Alice goes first, she can prioritize including certain numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include a number in c.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob has floor(n/2) turns.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical way to compute the MEX based on the counts.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

First test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0, cnt[3]=0

Output: 2

Second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1

Output:1

Third test case:

n=2, a=[1,1]

cnt[0]=0, cnt[1]=2

Output:0

From these, it seems that:

- If cnt[0] > 0, Alice can include 0 in c, so MEX is at least 1.

- For cnt[1] > 0, Alice can include 1 in c, so MEX is at least 2.

- And so on, until a point where cnt[i] = 0, meaning i cannot be in c.

But in the second test case, even though cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1, the output is 1, meaning MEX=1.

But according to the above, since cnt[0]=1 and cnt[1]=1, Alice should be able to include both 0 and 1 in c, making MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from including one of the numbers.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the key is to see how many times each number appears, and determine if Alice can include enough of them in c despite Bob's interference.

Let's consider that each number i needs at least one occurrence in c for MEX to be higher than i.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she needs to include as many small i's as possible in c.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including some small i's in c.

Given that, perhaps for each i, if the count of i is greater than what Bob can eliminate, Alice can include i in c.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include i in c.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) moves and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

But it's not directly applicable.

Let me consider that for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include i in c, because she has more moves than Bob can eliminate.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=4, cnt[0]=1, which is not greater than floor(4/2)=2, but according to the sample, MEX=1, meaning that 0 is included in c.

Wait, but cnt[0]=1, which is not greater than floor(4/2)=2, so this condition doesn't hold.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider the total number of available moves and the counts.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the minimal i where cnt[i] <= floor((total remaining turns)/2).

Wait, that might be too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider building c by including numbers in order, starting from 0, and see up to which i Alice can include all required numbers despite Bob's interference.

Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize c as empty.

Simulate the game:

- While a is not empty:

- Alice picks an element and adds it to c, then deletes it from a.

- If a is not empty, Bob picks an element and deletes it from a.

Repeat until a is empty.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of c, Bob wants to minimize it.

Both play optimally.

I need to find the final MEX.

This seems too vague to simulate directly, especially since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 2e4.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include certain numbers in c, and Bob can try to disrupt this by removing elements.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Alice can include them in c.

Let's consider that for each number i, if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can try to include it in c.

But Bob can try to reduce cnt[i] by removing i from a.

Since Alice goes first, she has an advantage in choosing what to include.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal i where cnt[i] is insufficient for Alice to include it in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor((total turns)/2).

But in the second test case, cnt[0]=1, and floor(4/2)=2, so cnt[0] <= 2, but according to the sample, MEX=1, meaning that 0 is included in c.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Maybe I need to consider the cumulative counts.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n, and keep track of the total number of elements needed to ensure that i is in c.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Perhaps I can consider that Alice can include floor((cnt[i]+1)/2) instances of i in c, since she has ceil(n/2) moves.

Wait, perhaps not directly, but something similar.

Let me think about it.

Total moves: n

Alice's moves: ceil(n/2)

Bob's moves: floor(n/2)

For each i, the number of times Alice can include i in c is floor((cnt[i]+1)/2), because she gets the first pick.

Wait, perhaps.

For example, if cnt[i]=1, Alice can include 1 in c.

If cnt[i]=2, Alice can include 1 in c (since Bob can remove one).

If cnt[i]=3, Alice can include 2 in c.

And so on.

Wait, but in the second test case, cnt[0]=1, so Alice can include 0 in c.

Similarly, cnt[1]=1, so Alice can include 1 in c.

But according to the sample, MEX=1, which suggests that c does not contain 1.

Wait, that contradicts.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider that for each i, Alice needs to have cnt[i] > floor(n/2) to ensure that she can include i in c.

Wait, but in the second test case, cnt[0]=1, floor(4/2)=2, which is less than cnt[0], but according to the sample, MEX=1, meaning that c does not have 1.

Wait, cnt[1]=1, which is equal to floor(4/2)=2, but that doesn't hold.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can consider that for each i, starting from 0, Alice and Bob are trying to control whether i is in c.

If cnt[i] >=1, Alice can choose to include i in c on her turn, provided that Bob doesn't remove all instances of i before she can pick one.

But Alice goes first, so she can pick i first.

Bob can try to remove i to prevent Alice from including it.

So, for cnt[i]=1, Alice can include it, since she picks first.

For cnt[i]=2, Alice can include one, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can pick the remaining one.

Similarly, for cnt[i]=3, Alice can include two, and so on.

Wait, perhaps for each i, Alice can include ceil((cnt[i])/2) instances of i in c.

Because she gets ceil(n/2) moves.

Wait, but this seems arbitrary.

Let me try to calculate for the second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt=[1,1,1,1]

So, for each i from 0 to 3, cnt[i]=1.

Alice can include floor((1)+1)/2)=1 for each i.

So, she can include one of each in c.

Hence, c could be [0,1,2,3], MEX=4.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps the issue is that Bob can force some numbers to be excluded from c, even if Alice wants them included.

Given that, maybe I need to find the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, in the second test case, floor(4/2)=2, and cnt[0]=1 <=2, cnt[1]=1 <=2, etc.

But according to the sample, MEX=1, meaning that 0 is included, but 1 is not.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times Alice can include a number in c.

Suppose that for a number i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can ensure that at least one i is in c.

Because she has ceil(n/2) moves, and Bob has floor(n/2) moves.

So, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one i in c.

In the second test case, cnt[0]=1, floor(4/2)=2, which is less than cnt[0], but cnt[0]=1 < floor(n/2)=2, wait, no, cnt[0]=1 < floor(n/2)=2.

So, according to this, Alice cannot include 0 in c, but according to the sample, MEX=1, which implies that 0 is included in c.

This is contradictory.

Perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me try to look for a different pattern.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

Output:2

So, c=[0,1], MEX=2

Test case 2:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Output:1

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1

Test case 3:

n=2, a=[1,1]

Output:0

So, c=[1], MEX=0

From these, it seems that:

- In test case 1, both 0 and 1 are present twice, so Alice can include both in c.

- In test case 2, each number is present once, so perhaps Alice can include only some of them, and Bob can force some to be excluded.

- In test case 3, only 1 is present twice, so Alice can include one in c, but 0 is not present, so MEX=0.

Perhaps the key is to see how many times each number is present and how many turns Alice has.

Alice has ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob has floor(n/2) turns.

For each number i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least one in c.

Because Bob can remove up to floor(n/2) elements, but if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), at least one will remain for Alice to include.

In test case 1, floor(n/2)=2, cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, so Alice can include both 0 and 1.

In test case 2, floor(n/2)=2, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

Here, cnt[i] <= floor(n/2) for i=0 to 3.

So, Alice cannot guarantee to include all of them.

Hence, Bob can prevent Alice from including one of them.

So, MEX is 1, meaning that 0 is included, but 1 is not.

Wait, but in the sample, output is 1, which is the MEX, meaning that 0 is in c, but 1 is not.

So, Alice can include 0 and another number, but not 1.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, c=[0,2], MEX=1, which means that 1 is missing.

But according to my earlier logic, since cnt[1]=1 <= floor(n/2)=2, Bob can prevent Alice from including 1 in c.

Hence, MEX is 1.

Similarly, in test case 3, n=2, floor(n/2)=1, cnt[1]=2, cnt[0]=0.

Alice can include one 1 in c, but 0 is not present, so MEX is 0.

Hence, the general approach seems to be:

- For each i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include i in c.

- Else, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

- Find the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), that will be the MEX.

But in test case 2, cnt[0]=1 <= floor(n/2)=2, so according to this, MEX should be 0, but it's 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's cnt[i] < ceil(n/2).

In test case 2, ceil(n/2)=2, cnt[0]=1 < 2, so MEX is 1.

But in test case 1, ceil(n/2)=2, cnt[0]=2 >=2, which might allow Alice to include 0.

Similarly, cnt[1]=2 >=2, allowing Alice to include 1.

Hence, MEX=2.

In test case 3, ceil(n/2)=1, cnt[0]=0 <1, so MEX=0.

This seems to fit.

Hence, the condition is:

- For each i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] >= ceil(n/2), Alice can include i in c.

- Else, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

- The smallest i where cnt[i] < ceil(n/2) is the MEX.

Wait, but in test case 2, cnt[0]=1 < ceil(n/2)=2, so MEX=1.

Yes, that matches.

Hence, the condition is cnt[i] < ceil(n/2).

So, to implement this, I need to calculate ceil(n/2), then iterate through i from 0 to n, and find the smallest i where cnt[i] < ceil(n/2).

That should be the MEX.

Let me verify this with the sample inputs.

Test case 1:

n=4, ceil(4/2)=2

cnt[0]=2 >=2

cnt[1]=2 >=2

cnt[2]=0 <2

Hence, MEX=2

Test case 2:

n=4, ceil(4/2)=2

cnt[0]=1 <2

Hence, MEX=1

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1, but according to this, MEX should be 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was [0,2], MEX=1, which matches.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, in the sample explanation for test case 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1, which matches cnt[0]=1 <2.

Hence, MEX=1.

In test case 3:

n=2, ceil(2/2)=1

cnt[0]=0 <1

Hence, MEX=0

Which matches the sample output.

So, this seems correct.

Hence, the approach is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and a.

- Compute cnt[i] for i from 0 to n.

- Compute ceil(n/2), which is (n+1)//2 in integer division.

- Iterate i from 0 to n:

- If cnt[i] < ceil(n/2), then MEX=i

- Break and print MEX.

This should work within the time constraints, since the total n
