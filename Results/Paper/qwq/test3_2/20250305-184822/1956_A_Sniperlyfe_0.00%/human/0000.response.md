Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game invented by Nene, where there are initially n players lined up in a row. The game proceeds through multiple rounds, and in each round, certain players are kicked out based on their positions in the line, as specified by a sequence of integers a.

The sequence a is an increasing sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., ak, and in each round, the a1-th, a2-th, ..., ak-th players in the current line are kicked out simultaneously. If a player should be kicked out but there are fewer players than the specified position, that kick is skipped.

This process repeats until a round where no players are kicked out, and the remaining players are declared winners.

My task is to determine, for each of q given values of n, how many players would be declared as winners in the game.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. Let's look at the example provided to grasp how the game progresses.

Example:

k = 2, q = 1

a = [3, 5]

n = 5

Players: A, B, C, D, E

Round 1:

- Kick out 3rd (C) and 5th (E) players.

- Remaining: A, B, D

Round 2:

- Now, the line is A, B, D.

- Kick out the 3rd player (D), and there's no 5th player.

- Remaining: A, B

Round 3:

- No players are kicked out.

- Winners: A and B

So, for n=5, the number of winners is 2.

Another example in the second test case:

k = 5, q = 3

a = [2,4,6,7,9]

n1=1, n2=3, n3=5

Let's simulate each:

1. n=1

- Players: A

- Round 1: Kick out 2nd player (none), 4th (none), etc.

- No one is kicked out.

- Winner: A

- So, 1 winner.

2. n=3

- Players: A, B, C

- Round 1: Kick out 2nd (B), 4th (none)

- Remaining: A, C

- Round 2: Kick out 2nd (C)

- Remaining: A

- Round 3: No one to kick out.

- Winner: A

- So, 1 winner.

3. n=5

- Players: A, B, C, D, E

- Round 1: Kick out 2nd (B), 4th (D), 6th (none), 7th (none), 9th (none)

- Remaining: A, C, E

- Round 2: Kick out 2nd (C), 4th (none)

- Remaining: A, E

- Round 3: No one to kick out.

- Winners: A and E

- So, 2 winners.

But according to the sample output, for n=1,3,5, the output is 1 1 1. Wait, that doesn't match my simulation for n=5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is 1 1 1, but according to my simulation for n=5, it should be 2. Maybe I miscounted.

Let me try again:

n=5, a=[2,4,6,7,9]

Round 1:

- Kick out 2nd (B), 4th (D), 6th (none), 7th (none), 9th (none)

- Remaining: A, C, E

Round 2:

- Now, the line is A, C, E

- Kick out 2nd (C), 4th (none), etc.

- Remaining: A, E

Round 3:

- Kick out 2nd (E), 4th (none)

- Remaining: A

Round 4:

- No one to kick out

- Winner: A

So, only 1 winner. Okay, I must have miscounted earlier. So, for n=5, it's 1 winner.

Got it.

Now, I need to generalize this for any k, q, a, and n_i.

Constraints:

- t (number of test cases): 1 <= t <= 250

- k and q: 1 <= k, q <= 100

- a: 1 <= a1 < a2 < ... < ak <= 100

- n_i: 1 <= n_i <= 100

So, for each test case, I have k, q, the sequence a, and q values of n.

I need to process each n_i and find out how many players remain after the game ends.

Given the constraints, a brute-force simulation might be efficient enough, since n and k are small (up to 100).

Let's think about how to simulate the game for a given n.

Approach:

1. Start with a list of players from 1 to n.

2. Repeat the following steps until no players are kicked out in a round:

a. Create a list of players to be kicked out: for each a_j in a, if a_j <= current number of players, kick out the a_j-th player.

b. Remove these players from the line.

c. Reindex the remaining players.

3. Count the number of remaining players.

But in step 2a, players are kicked out simultaneously, meaning that their positions are based on the current line before any removals.

So, in one round, I need to identify all the players to be kicked out based on their current positions, without considering the removal of others in that same round.

For example, in the first round with n=5 and a=[3,5]:

- Kick out 3rd (C) and 5th (E).

- Then, in the next round, the line is A, B, D.

- Kick out the 3rd player (D).

- Next round, A and B remain, no one is kicked out.

So, I need to be careful to handle the positions correctly in each round.

One way to implement this is:

- Maintain a list of current players.

- In each round, collect the players to be kicked out based on their positions in the current list.

- Remove those players from the list.

- Repeat until no players are kicked out in a round.

But since n and q can be up to 100, and t up to 250, this should be efficient enough.

Alternatively, I can try to find a mathematical pattern or formula to compute the number of winners directly, without simulating each round. But given time constraints, I'll stick with simulation for now.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

Sample Input:

6

2 1

3 5

5

5 3

2 4 6 7 9

1 3 5

5 4

3 4 5 6 7

69 96

1 10 100

1 1

1 10 100

Sample Output:

2

1 1 1

1 2 2 2

1 10 68

50

1 9 9

Wait, in the first test case, with n=5 and a=[3,5], the output is 2, which matches my earlier simulation.

In the second test case, with a=[2,4,6,7,9] and n=1,3,5, the output is 1 1 1, which matches my corrected simulation.

In the third test case, with a=[3,4,5,6,7] and n=1,2,3,4, the output is 1 2 2 2.

Let's verify n=3:

- Players: A, B, C

- Round 1: Kick out 3rd (C)

- Remaining: A, B

- No more kicks, winners: A and B

- So, 2 winners.

For n=4:

- Players: A, B, C, D

- Round 1: Kick out 3rd (C) and 4th (D)

- Remaining: A, B

- No more kicks, winners: A and B

- So, 2 winners.

For n=2:

- Players: A, B

- Round 1: Kick out 3rd (none), 4th (none), etc.

- No one kicked out

- Winners: A and B

- So, 2 winners.

For n=1:

- Players: A

- Round 1: Kick out 3rd (none), etc.

- No one kicked out

- Winner: A

- So, 1 winner.

Matches the sample output: 1 2 2 2

Next test case:

k=2, q=3

a=[69,96]

n=1,10,100

Output: 1 10 68

Let's see:

n=1:

- Only one player, can't kick out 69th or 96th.

- So, 1 winner.

n=10:

- Can't kick out 69th or 96th.

- So, all 10 remain.

n=100:

- Kick out 69th and 96th players in the first round.

- Remaining: 98 players.

- No more kicks, so 98 winners.

But the output is 1 10 68, which suggests 68 winners for n=100.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in multiple rounds.

Wait, with a=[69,96] and n=100.

Round 1:

- Kick out 69th and 96th players.

- Remaining: 98 players.

Round 2:

- Now, the line has 98 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th of the remaining.

- 69th and 96th in 98 players.

- So, kick out the 69th and 96th.

- But 96th is within 98, so kick out two more.

- Remaining: 96 players.

Round 3:

- Now, 96 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- Both within 96, so kick out two more.

- Remaining: 94 players.

Round 4:

- 94 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- 96th is beyond 94, so only kick out 69th.

- Remaining: 93 players.

Round 5:

- 93 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- 96th is beyond 93, so only kick out 69th.

- Remaining: 92 players.

Round 6:

- 92 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- Both beyond current count, so no one kicked out.

- Winners: 92 players.

But the sample output is 68, not 92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps positions are based on the current line after each kick, but kicked simultaneously.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:

- Nene finds the a1-th, a2-th, ..., ak-th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i-th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped."

So, positions are based on the current line before any removals in that round.

So, in each round, identify the players to be kicked out based on their positions in the current line, and remove them all simultaneously.

So, for n=100 and a=[69,96]:

Round 1:

- Kick out 69th and 96th players.

- Remaining: 98 players.

Round 2:

- Now, the line has 98 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th of the remaining 98.

- Both within 98, so kick out two more.

- Remaining: 96 players.

Round 3:

- 96 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- Both within 96, so kick out two more.

- Remaining: 94 players.

Round 4:

- 94 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- 96th is beyond 94, so only kick out 69th.

- Remaining: 93 players.

Round 5:

- 93 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- 96th is beyond 93, so only kick out 69th.

- Remaining: 92 players.

Round 6:

- 92 players.

- Kick out 69th and 96th.

- Both beyond current count, so no one kicked out.

- Winners: 92 players.

But according to the sample output, it's 68 winners. So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe positions are adjusted after each round.

Wait, no, "They are kicked out of the game simultaneously."

So, positions are based on the current line before any removals in that round.

But in my calculation, I end up with 92 players remaining, but sample output is 68.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find a pattern or formula.

Looking at the last test case:

k=3, q=3

a=[10,20,30]

n=1,10,100

Output: 1 9 9

For n=1:

- Can't kick out 10th, so 1 winner.

For n=10:

- Kick out 10th (none), so 10 winners.

But according to the sample output, it's 9 winners for n=10.

Wait, n=10, a=[10,20,30]

- Round 1: Kick out 10th (last player)

- Remaining: 9 players

- No more kicks, since 10th doesn't exist in the next round.

- So, 9 winners.

Got it.

Wait, but in the previous case with n=100 and a=[69,96], the sample output is 68, but my simulation gives 92.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to compute the number of winners without simulating each round.

But given time constraints, I'll proceed with the simulation approach.

I need to implement a function that, given n and a, simulates the game and returns the number of winners.

Let's think about how to implement this function efficiently.

One way is to maintain a list of current players and repeatedly remove the specified positions until no one is removed in a round.

But since n can be up to 100 and q up to 100, and t up to 250, it should be efficient enough.

However, in Python, repeatedly removing elements from a list by index can be inefficient, but since n is small, it should be acceptable.

Alternatively, I can use a deque for faster pop operations, but a list should suffice.

Let's outline the steps in code:

def func_1(n, p):

current = list(range(1, n+1))  # or just current = list(range(n))

while True:

to_remove = [current[a-1] for a in p if a <= len(current)]

if not to_remove:

break

for player in to_remove:

current.remove(player)

return len(current)

But this is inefficient because list.remove() is O(n), and we might have up to n rounds in the worst case.

To optimize, I can keep track of indices to remove and then remove them in one pass.

A better approach is to collect the indices to remove in a sorted order and then remove them all at once.

Here's an improved version:

def func_1(n, p):

current = list(range(n))

while True:

to_remove = [a-1 for a in p if a <= len(current)]

if not to_remove:

break

# Remove the players in reverse order to avoid index shifting issues

to_remove.sort(reverse=True)

for idx in to_remove:

del current[idx]

return len(current)

This should work efficiently.

Let's test this function with the first sample input:

n=5, p=[3,5]

current = [0,1,2,3,4]

Round 1:

to_remove = [2,4]

current = [0,1,3]

Round 2:

to_remove = [2]

current = [0,1]

Round 3:

No one to remove

Winners: 2 players

Matches the sample.

Another test: n=5, p=[2,4,6,7,9]

current = [0,1,2,3,4]

Round 1:

to_remove = [1,3]

current = [0,2,4]

Round 2:

to_remove = [1]

current = [0,4]

Round 3:

to_remove = [1]

current = [0]

Round 4:

No one to remove

Winners: 1 player

Matches the sample.

Another test: n=100, p=[69,96]

current = [0 to 99]

Round 1:

to_remove = [68,95]

current = [0 to 99] minus 68 and 95 => 98 players

Round 2:

to_remove = [68,95]

current = 98 players minus 68 and 95 => 96 players

Round 3:

to_remove = [68,95]

current = 96 players minus 68 and 95 => 94 players

Round 4:

to_remove = [68,95]

current = 94 players minus 68 and 95 => 92 players

Round 5:

to_remove = [68,95]

current = 92 players minus 68 and 95 => 90 players

...

Continuing this way, it seems like 2 players are removed each round until the positions exceed the current number of players.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I ended up with 92 players, but sample output is 68.

Perhaps I need to see how many rounds it takes for the positions to exceed the current number of players.

Let's compute how many rounds are there before no one is removed.

Each round, 2 players are removed until the 95th position is beyond the current number of players.

Let me calculate:

Initial n=100

After round 1: 98

After round 2: 96

...

Each round removes 2 players until the current number of players is less than 96.

So, when current n <= 95, no one is removed.

So, we need to find how many rounds are there before n <= 95.

Starting from 100, subtract 2 each round until n <=95.

100 -2 =98

98 -2=96

96 -2=94

94 >95? No, so next round, n=94, 94 <95, so no one is removed.

So, 3 rounds, ending with n=94.

But sample output is 68, not 94. Something's wrong.

Wait, maybe positions are adjusted differently.

Wait, perhaps after each removal, the positions are renumbered.

Wait, but the problem says "They are kicked out simultaneously based on their positions in the current line before any removals in that round."

So, positions are based on the current line before any removals in that round.

So, in each round, identify the players to be removed based on their positions before any removals in that round.

So, in the first round, remove 69th and 96th.

Then, in the next round, remove the 69th and 96th of the remaining players.

And continue until no one is removed.

Given that, perhaps there's a pattern where in each round, 2 players are removed until the number of players is less than the smallest position to be removed.

Wait, a=[69,96], so in each round, 69th and 96th are removed if they exist.

So, in the first round, remove 69th and 96th from 100 players, leaving 98.

In the second round, remove the 69th and 96th from the remaining 98 players, leaving 96.

...

Continue this until the number of players is less than 69.

So, the number of rounds is (100 - 68) / 2 = 16 rounds, each removing 2 players, until n=68, which is less than 69, so no more removals.

Hence, n=68.

Ah, I see. So, in each round, 2 players are removed until n <69.

So, 100 -2*16 = 100-32=68.

So, after 16 rounds, n=68, which is less than 69, so no more removals.

Hence, 68 winners.

That matches the sample output.

So, my earlier simulation was incorrect because I miscounted the number of rounds.

So, the correct approach is to remove floor(n - min(a) +1, step size based on the number of positions to remove).

But perhaps it's easier to simulate it as I did earlier.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func_1(n, p):

while n >= min(p):

n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))

return n

This seems to be trying to simulate the game.

Let's see how it works for n=5, p=[3,5]:

n=5 >=3

n -= sum(1 for x in p if x<=5) => sum(1 for x in [3,5] if x<=5) => 2

n=5-2=3

n=3 >=3

n -= sum(1 for x in p if x<=3) => sum(1 for x in [3,5] if x<=3) =>1

n=3-1=2

n=2 >=3? No, stop.

Return 2.

Matches the sample.

Another test: n=5, p=[2,4,6,7,9]

n=5 >=2

n -= sum(1 for x in [2,4,6,7,9] if x<=5) => sum(1 for x in [2,4]) =>2

n=5-2=3

n=3 >=2

n -= sum(1 for x in [2,4,6,7,9] if x<=3) => sum(1 for x in [2]) =>1

n=3-1=2

n=2 >=2

n -= sum(1 for x in [2,4,6,7,9] if x<=2) => sum(1 for x in [2]) =>1

n=2-1=1

n=1 >=2? No, stop.

Return 1.

Matches the sample.

Another test: n=100, p=[69,96]

n=100 >=69

n -= sum(1 for x in [69,96] if x<=100) =>2

n=100-2=98

n=98 >=69

n -= sum(1 for x in [69,96] if x<=98) =>2

n=98-2=96

...

Continue until n <69.

So, n decreases by 2 each time until n <69.

So, n=100 -2*16=68.

Matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

So, the function func_1 seems to correctly simulate the game.

Now, looking at func_2:

def func_2():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(k, q) = map(int, input().split())

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

qs = list(map(int, input().split()))

res = []

for n in qs:

res.append(func_1(n, p))

print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

This reads the input for t test cases, reads k and q, reads the sequence a, reads the q values of n, computes func_1 for each n, and prints the results space-separated.

Seems correct.

So, overall, the program appears to be correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
