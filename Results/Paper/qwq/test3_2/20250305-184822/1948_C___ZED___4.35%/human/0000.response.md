Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, up, or down. It can't move outside the grid or skip the move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach (2,n) from (1,1).

First, I need to understand how the robot moves. It has a choice of direction in the first step, and then it follows the arrow in the cell it ends up in after that move.

Given that, I need to model the possible paths the robot can take. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, where cells are nodes, and moves are edges.

But considering the constraints, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without building a full graph.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n = 4

First row: >><<

Second row: >>><

So, the grid looks like:

Row 1: > < > <

Row 2: > > < >

The explanation says one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's simulate that:

- Start at (1,1): move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow '<' which would move left to (1,1). But that's not what the explanation says. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.

Let me read the explanation again.

It says: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Perhaps the robot is making a different choice each step.

I need to understand the rules more carefully.

Rule 1: The robot chooses to move left, right, up, or down.

- It can't move outside the grid.

- It can't skip the move.

Rule 2: Then, it moves along the arrow in the current cell.

So, in each step:

1. Robot chooses a direction and moves there.

2. Then, it follows the arrow in the new cell.

This seems a bit tricky because the arrow move is compulsory after choosing a direction.

I need to think about how to model this movement.

Maybe I should consider the possible states the robot can be in, and how it transitions between states.

Let me consider that the state of the robot is its current position.

At each step, it can choose to move in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down), but only to neighboring cells.

After moving, it must then move again according to the arrow in that cell.

So, effectively, each move consists of two parts: the chosen move and then the arrow move.

I need to model this combined movement.

Perhaps I can precompute for each cell and each possible chosen direction where the robot ends up after the two moves.

That way, I can build a graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent possible transitions after a combined move.

Then, I can perform a graph traversal (BFS or DFS) to see if (1,1) is connected to (2,n).

Given the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5, and t (number of test cases) up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Building a full graph and traversing it for each test case would be too slow because of the large n and t.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of the grid.

There are only two rows, and n columns.

Arrows can only point left or right, not up or down.

Wait, no, arrows are in the cells, and the robot moves left or right according to the arrow.

Wait, the problem says: "Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid."

So, arrows only point left or right, never up or down.

That's important.

So, when the robot is in a cell, after choosing a direction and moving, it then moves left or right according to the arrow in the new cell.

I need to consider the combined effect of the chosen move and the arrow move.

Let me try to enumerate the possible combined moves.

Suppose the robot is in cell (r,c).

It chooses to move in one of four directions:

- Left: to (r, c-1), then follows the arrow in (r, c-1).

- Right: to (r, c+1), then follows the arrow in (r, c+1).

- Up: to (r-1, c), then follows the arrow in (r-1, c).

- Down: to (r+1, c), then follows the arrow in (r+1, c).

But, arrows only point left or right, so the second move is always horizontal.

So, effectively, after choosing a direction and moving, the robot will always move horizontally again based on the arrow.

Therefore, the combined move is a movement in a combination of directions.

Let me think about each possible chosen direction and the resulting position after the arrow move.

Case 1: Choose to move left.

- Move to (r, c-1).

- Then, follow the arrow in (r, c-1):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r, c-2).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r, c).

Case 2: Choose to move right.

- Move to (r, c+1).

- Then, follow the arrow in (r, c+1):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r, c).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r, c+2).

Case 3: Choose to move up.

- Move to (r-1, c).

- Then, follow the arrow in (r-1, c):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r-1, c-1).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r-1, c+1).

Case 4: Choose to move down.

- Move to (r+1, c).

- Then, follow the arrow in (r+1, c):

- If the arrow is '<', move to (r+1, c-1).

- If the arrow is '>', move to (r+1, c+1).

So, in summary, the possible combined moves are:

- Choose left: ends up at (r, c-2) if arrow is '<', or (r, c) if arrow is '>'.

- Choose right: ends up at (r, c) if arrow is '<', or (r, c+2) if arrow is '>'.

- Choose up: ends up at (r-1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r-1, c+1) if arrow is '>'.

- Choose down: ends up at (r+1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r+1, c+1) if arrow is '>'.

Interesting.

So, from each cell, there are up to 4 possible destinations, depending on the chosen direction and the arrow in the intermediate cell.

Given that, I need to model these transitions and see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

Given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that n is even, as per the problem statement.

Wait, no, it says n is even in the additional constraints.

Wait, no, it says "n is even" in the input section, but in the problem statement, it says "2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5".

Wait, checking the problem statement again:

"Additional constraints on the input:

- n is even;

- there are no arrows pointing outside the grid;

- the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2·10^5."

Okay, so n is always even.

That might be useful.

Given that, perhaps there's a pattern or property that holds for even n.

Now, considering the combined moves I outlined earlier, some of these moves can lead to the same cell or loop back.

I need to find a way to model these moves efficiently.

Another approach is to consider that the robot can move between cells in certain ways, and I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that connects (1,1) to (2,n).

Given that n is large and t is large, but the total sum of n is limited, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think about BFS or DFS, but they would be too slow for n up to 2e5 per test case.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a cell, and edges represent possible moves.

But building such a graph for each test case would be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can find patterns or properties that allow me to determine reachability without simulating each possible move.

Let me consider that the arrows only point left or right, and the grid has only two rows.

Maybe I can find a way to model the movement between rows based on the arrows.

Let me consider that the robot can switch rows only by choosing to move up or down, and then following the arrow in the new row.

Wait, no, after moving up or down, it follows the arrow in that new cell.

So, if it moves up to row 1, it then moves left or right based on the arrow in row 1.

Similarly, if it moves down to row 2, it moves left or right based on the arrow in row 2.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement between rows and columns based on these rules.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I try to see if the robot can reach column n in row 2.

I need to consider how the robot can move between rows and columns.

Perhaps I can consider that the robot can only switch rows by choosing to move up or down, and then it moves horizontally based on the arrow.

So, maybe I can model the movement in terms of possible column positions for each row.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the movement in terms of possible column shifts when moving between rows.

Let me consider defining for each cell in row 1, where it can lead to in row 2, and vice versa, considering the arrow movements.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Since n is even, perhaps there is a way to pair columns or find some periodicity.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some insights.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

Looking at the first test case:

n=4

Row 1: > < > <

Row 2: > > < >

Explanation: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see how this path works:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), then follow the arrow '<' in (1,2), which moves left to (1,1). Not matching the explanation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.

Maybe the robot chooses different directions each time.

Let me try again:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose to move down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose to move right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose to move up to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose to move right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- ...

This doesn't seem to lead to (2,4). Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the explanation has a different sequence.

Let me read the explanation again carefully.

"In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)."

Perhaps the robot can choose directions in a way that allows it to progress diagonally or in a specific pattern.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot can only switch rows if it moves up or down and then follows the arrow in the new row.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible transitions between rows and columns.

Let me try to formalize the movement.

Define the state as (row, column).

Define possible moves from each state.

From (r,c), the robot can:

- Choose to move left to (r, c-1), then follow the arrow in (r, c-1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r, c-2)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r, c)

- Choose to move right to (r, c+1), then follow the arrow in (r, c+1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r, c)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r, c+2)

- Choose to move up to (r-1, c), then follow the arrow in (r-1, c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r-1, c-1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r-1, c+1)

- Choose to move down to (r+1, c), then follow the arrow in (r+1, c):

- If arrow is '<', move to (r+1, c-1)

- If arrow is '>', move to (r+1, c+1)

Given that, from each cell, there are up to 4 possible destinations.

But modeling this as a graph with up to 4 transitions per cell would still be too slow for large n and t.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the grid has only two rows.

Maybe I can represent the movement between rows and columns in a way that allows me to track possible positions efficiently.

Perhaps I can consider the movement in terms of possible column shifts when switching rows.

Wait, maybe I can model the movement in row 1 and row 2 separately, and see how they are connected.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrows, or it can switch rows by choosing to move up or down and then following the arrow in the new row.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of possible "tracks" or paths that the robot can take across the grid.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that since n is even, perhaps there is a way to pair columns or find some periodicity.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the arrows only point left or right, and the grid has only two rows, maybe I can model the movement as a finite state machine with states representing the row and some properties of the columns.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I try to see if the robot can reach column n in row 2, starting from column 1 in row 1.

I need to see if there's a sequence of moves that allows the robot to get from (1,1) to (2,n).

Given the movement rules, perhaps I can model this as some form of reachability in a graph where nodes represent cells, and edges represent possible moves.

But building such a graph for large n is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrow, which effectively moves it by two columns in the direction of the arrow, or stays in place.

Wait, not exactly.

From the earlier analysis:

- Choosing left: ends up at (r, c-2) if arrow is '<', or (r, c) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing right: ends up at (r, c) if arrow is '<', or (r, c+2) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing up: ends up at (r-1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r-1, c+1) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing down: ends up at (r+1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r+1, c+1) if arrow is '>'

Given that, moving within a row can potentially skip columns, while moving between rows shifts the column by one.

This seems tricky to model directly.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column parities.

Let me consider that columns are numbered from 1 to n, and n is even.

Let me consider the parity of the column indices.

Columns can be either odd or even.

Given that, let's see how the movement affects the parity.

From the combined moves:

- Choosing left: ends at (r, c-2) if arrow is '<', or (r, c) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing right: ends at (r, c) if arrow is '<', or (r, c+2) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing up: ends at (r-1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r-1, c+1) if arrow is '>'

- Choosing down: ends at (r+1, c-1) if arrow is '<', or (r+1, c+1) if arrow is '>'

So, within the same row:

- Choosing left or right can keep the column parity the same or change it by two steps.

- Choosing up or down switches rows and shifts the column by one, changing the parity.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of column parity relative to the row.

Wait, maybe I can consider that moving up or down always switches the row and shifts the column by one, thus changing the parity.

While moving within the row can keep the parity the same or change it by two steps.

Given that n is even, perhaps there are patterns based on column parities.

This seems promising, but I need to think more about it.

Let me consider defining for each row, which columns can be reached from the starting column in that row, considering the movement within the row.

Then, see if there's a way to switch rows in a way that allows progression to the target column.

This might be a way to structure the problem.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, for row 1:

Define the set of columns reachable from column 1 in row 1, considering only movements within row 1.

Similarly, for row 2:

Define the set of columns reachable from any column in row 1 to row 2, and vice versa.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Perhaps I can model the movement within each row separately, and then see how switching rows affects reachability.

In other words:

- Within row 1, the robot can move left or right according to the arrows, with the combined move effect.

- Similarly, within row 2.

- Additionally, the robot can switch rows by moving up or down, and then following the arrow in the new row.

Given that, perhaps I can model the grid as two separate rows, with possible transitions between them.

Let me consider defining for each column in row 1, the possible columns in row 2 that can be reached by moving down and following the arrow.

Similarly, for each column in row 2, the possible columns in row 1 that can be reached by moving up and following the arrow.

Then, within each row, define which columns are reachable from the starting column.

Finally, see if there's a path that allows the robot to reach the target column in row 2.

This seems more structured.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For row 1, determine which columns are reachable from column 1, considering movements within row 1.

2. For each column in row 1, determine which columns in row 2 can be reached by moving down and following the arrow.

3. For row 2, determine which columns are reachable from the columns that can be reached from row 1.

4. Check if column n in row 2 is among the reachable columns in row 2.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, given the constraints.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think about how to implement steps 1-4 efficiently.

Step 1: Determine reachable columns in row 1 from column 1.

Given that movements within row 1 can be modeled by choosing to move left or right, and then following the arrow, which effectively moves the robot by two columns in certain directions or keeps it in place.

Wait, from the earlier analysis:

- Choosing left in row 1: move to (1, c-1), then follow arrow in (1, c-1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (1, c-2)

- If arrow is '>', move to (1, c)

- Choosing right in row 1: move to (1, c+1), then follow arrow in (1, c+1):

- If arrow is '<', move to (1, c)

- If arrow is '>', move to (1, c+2)

- Choosing up in row 1: move to row 0, which doesn't exist, so invalid.

- Choosing down in row 1: move to row 2, then follow arrow in row 2.

Wait, row 1 is row r=1, row 2 is r=2.

So, from row 1, choosing up is invalid since there's no row 0.

Choosing down takes the robot to row 2, then follows the arrow in row 2.

Similarly, from row 2, choosing up takes it to row 1, choosing down takes it to row 3, which doesn't exist.

Given that, in row 1, choosing up is invalid, and choosing down takes it to row 2.

Similarly, in row 2, choosing down is invalid, and choosing up takes it to row 1.

So, within row 1, the robot can only choose to move left or right, and follow the arrow in the new cell, effectively moving within row 1.

Similarly, within row 2.

Only by choosing to move down from row 1 or up from row 2 can the robot switch rows.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row separately, and then see how switching rows affects reachability.

Let me try to model the movement within row 1.

Within row 1:

- From column c, choosing left: move to c-1, then follow arrow in c-1:

- If arrow is '<', move to c-2

- If arrow is '>', move to c

- Choosing right: move to c+1, then follow arrow in c+1:

- If arrow is '<', move to c

- If arrow is '>', move to c+2

So, from column c in row 1, possible moves within row 1 are to c-2, c, or c+2, depending on the arrows.

Wait, but choosing left could lead to c or c-2, and choosing right could lead to c or c+2.

Similarly, choosing down from row 1 takes it to row 2, column c, and then follows the arrow in row 2, column c.

From there, it would move to c-1 or c+1 in row 2, depending on the arrow.

So, from row 1, column c, choosing down takes it to row 2, column c, then to c-1 or c+1 in row 2.

Similarly, from row 2, column c, choosing up takes it to row 1, column c, then to c-1 or c+1 in row 1, depending on the arrow.

This is getting a bit complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that switching rows allows the robot to connect columns in row 1 to columns in row 2, and vice versa.

Given that, perhaps I can model the grid as a graph where nodes are (row, column) pairs, and edges represent possible moves.

But building such a graph for large n is not efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing left or right and following the arrow, which can be modeled as jumps of size 2 or staying in place.

Additionally, it can switch rows by choosing down or up, which moves to the other row and shifts by one column.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within each row and see how switching rows affects the column positions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that switching rows allows the robot to shift its column position by one.

Let me think about that.

From row 1, column c, choosing down takes it to row 2, column c, then follows the arrow in row 2, column c, which moves it to c-1 or c+1 in row 2.

Similarly, from row 2, column c, choosing up takes it to row 1, column c, then follows the arrow in row 1, column c, which moves it to c-1 or c+1 in row 1.

Wait, no.

From row 1, column c, choosing down:

- Move to row 2, column c

- Then follow the arrow in row 2, column c:

- If arrow is '<', move to row 2, column c-1

- If arrow is '>', move to row 2, column c+1

Similarly, from row 2, column c, choosing up:

- Move to row 1, column c

- Then follow the arrow in row 1, column c:

- If arrow is '<', move to row 1, column c-1

- If arrow is '>', move to row 1, column c+1

So, switching rows allows the robot to shift its column position by one when moving between rows.

This seems like a key observation.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement between rows as a way to shift columns by one.

Additionally, within each row, the robot can move by jumps of two columns or stay in place.

Wait, not exactly.

Within a row, the movement depends on the arrows.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that within a row, the robot can move to certain columns based on the arrows, and switching rows allows it to shift columns by one.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that the robot can move between rows and shift columns by one, and within rows, it can move by two columns or stay.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column differences when switching rows multiple times.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps I can model the movement as a set of possible column offsets when switching rows.

For example, each time the robot switches rows, it shifts its column position by one.

If it switches rows multiple times, it can accumulate shifts.

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me consider that each switch between rows allows a column shift of one, and movements within a row allow jumps of two columns or staying.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach columns in row 2 that are odd or even based on the starting column and the number of row switches.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the sample input again.

First test case:

n=4

Row 1: > < > <

Row 2: > > < >

Explanation: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- And so on.

It's not clear how to reach (2,4) from here.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different directions.

Let me try another sequence:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- And so on.

It seems like I'm stuck in a loop.

But according to the explanation, there is a path to (2,4).

I must be missing something.

Perhaps there's a way to reach (1,3) first and then go down to (2,3) and then to (2,4).

Let me try that:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- And so on.

Still stuck in a loop.

I must be misunderstanding the movement rules.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, up or down (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move);

2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, in each step:

- First, the robot chooses a direction (left, right, up, down) and moves one cell in that direction.

- Then, it moves according to the arrow in the cell it just moved to.

For example:

- If it chooses right from (1,1), it moves to (1,2), then follows the arrow in (1,2).

- If the arrow in (1,2) is '<', it moves to (1,1); if it's '>', it moves to (1,3).

Wait, but in the first test case, row 1 is "> < > <"

So, (1,1): '>', (1,2): '<', (1,3): '>', (1,4): '<'

Row 2: "> > < >"

So, (2,1): '>', (2,2): '>', (2,3): '<', (2,4): '>'

Let me try the path again:

- Start at (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose right to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Choose down to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose right to (2,3), follow arrow '<' to (2,2)

- Choose down to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- And so on.

Still stuck in a loop.

But according to the explanation, there is a path.

Maybe I need to choose different directions.

Let me try:

- Start at (1,1)

- And so on.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where nodes represent cells, and edges represent possible transitions after choosing a direction and following the arrow.

Then, perform a BFS from (1,1) to see if (2,n) is reachable.

But given the constraints, this would be too slow for large n and t.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that n is even, and perhaps there's a way to pair columns or find some periodicity.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps I can model the movement within each row as a finite automaton, where transitions are defined by the arrows and the chosen directions.

Then, find connections between the two rows via up and down moves.

This might be too complex.

Let me consider that in row 1, the robot can move to certain columns based on the arrows, and similarly in row 2.

Then, it can switch between rows at any column, provided that the arrow in the new row allows it to move to an adjacent column.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of possible column positions in each row and see if there's a way to transition between them.

This still seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of possible column positions in row 2 that can be reached from row 1.

From row 1, column c, choosing down takes it to row 2, column c, then follows the arrow in row 2, column c, which moves it to c-1 or c+1 in row 2.

Similarly, from row 2, column c, choosing up takes it to row 1, column c, then follows the arrow in row 1, column c, which moves it to c-1 or c+1 in row 1.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement between rows as a way to shift columns by one when switching rows.

So, to reach column n in row 2, the robot needs to reach column n-1 or n+1 in row 1, but since row 1 doesn't have column n+1, it must reach column n-1 in row 1.

Then, from column n-1 in row 1, choose down to go to row 2, column n-1, then follow the arrow in row 2, column n-1, which could take it to column n-2 or n in row 2.

If the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>', it would move to column n in row 2, which is the target.

So, in this case, to reach (2,n), the robot needs to reach column n-1 in row 1, and the arrow in row 2, column n-1 must be '>'.

Similarly, to reach column n-1 in row 1, the robot needs to be able to reach it from column 1 in row 1, considering the movements within row 1.

Wait, this seems more promising.

Let me formalize this.

To reach (2,n), the following must hold:

1. The arrow in row 2, column n-1 must be '>', so that choosing down from row 1, column n-1 takes the robot to row 2, column n-1, and then following the arrow '>' takes it to row 2, column n.

2. The robot must be able to reach column n-1 in row 1 from column 1 in row 1, considering the movements within row 1.

Additionally, the robot can switch between rows at any column, provided that the arrow in the new row allows it to move to an adjacent column.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm only considering reaching column n-1 in row 1 and ensuring that the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>'.

But perhaps there are other ways to reach (2,n), for example, by reaching column n in row 2 from row 1 at column n.

But in row 1, column n may not be directly reachable, and n is even.

Wait, n is at least 2, and even.

Let me consider that.

Given that n is even, perhaps there are patterns based on column parities.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column n in row 2 only if it can reach column n-1 in row 1 and the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>', or if it can reach column n in row 1 and the arrow in row 1, column n allows it to switch rows and reach row 2, column n.

But in row 1, column n, choosing down would take it to row 2, column n, and then following the arrow in row 2, column n.

If the arrow in row 2, column n is '>', it would move to column n+1, which doesn't exist, so that's invalid.

If it's '<', it would move to column n-1 in row 2.

So, in this case, to reach (2,n), it's only feasible via column n-1 in row 1, provided that the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>'.

Therefore, the condition simplifies to:

- The arrow in row 2, column n-1 must be '>'

- The robot must be able to reach column n-1 in row 1 from column 1 in row 1, considering the movements within row 1.

Now, I need to determine if the robot can reach column n-1 in row 1 from column 1 in row 1.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement within row 1 as a graph where edges represent possible moves within the row.

Given that n is large, I need an efficient way to determine reachability within row 1.

Let me consider that within a row, the robot can choose to move left or right and follow the arrow, which effectively moves it by two columns in certain directions or stays in place.

From earlier analysis:

- Choosing left in row 1: move to c-1, follow arrow in c-1:

- If '<', move to c-2

- If '>', move to c

- Choosing right in row 1: move to c+1, follow arrow in c+1:

- If '<', move to c

- If '>', move to c+2

So, from column c in row 1, possible moves are:

- To c-2, if choosing left and arrow in c-1 is '<'

- To c, if choosing left and arrow in c-1 is '>', or choosing right and arrow in c+1 is '<'

- To c+2, if choosing right and arrow in c+1 is '>'

Similarly, in row 2:

- Choosing left in row 2: move to c-1, follow arrow in c-1:

- If '<', move to c-2

- If '>', move to c

- Choosing right in row 2: move to c+1, follow arrow in c+1:

- If '<', move to c

- If '>', move to c+2

- Choosing up in row 2: move to row 1, column c, then follow arrow in row 1, column c to c-1 or c+1 in row 1

- Choosing down in row 2: invalid, since there's no row 3

So, within row 2, similar movement as in row 1.

But since we're only interested in reaching row 2, column n, perhaps focusing on row 1 is sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement within row 1 as a graph where edges represent possible moves within the row, and see if column n-1 is reachable from column 1.

Then, check if the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>', which would allow the robot to reach row 2, column n.

If both conditions are satisfied, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

But in the first test case, n=4, row 1: "> < > <", row 2: ">>><"

So, column n-1 = column 3 in row 1 is '>', and arrow in row 2, column 3 is '<'

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's possible to reach (2,4).

Wait, but according to my current logic, it should be NO because the arrow in row 2, column 3 is '<', which would take the robot to column 2 in row 2, not to column 4.

But in the explanation, it says it's possible.

So, perhaps my current logic is incomplete.

Wait, maybe there are multiple ways to reach row 2, column n.

Perhaps the robot can reach column n in row 2 from column n-1 in row 1, provided the arrow in row 2, column n-1 is '>', or from column n in row 1, if it can switch to row 2 and the arrow in row 2, column n allows it.

But in this case, column n in row 2 has arrow '>', which would take it to column n+1, which doesn't exist.

So, perhaps only column n-1 in row 1 is useful for reaching column n in row 2.

But in the first test case, column n-1 in row 1 is column 3, which is '<', but according to the explanation, it's possible.

I'm getting confused.

Let me check the arrows again.

Wait, in row 1, column 3 is '>', and row 2, column 3 is '<'.

Wait, perhaps I misread the grid.

Wait, in
