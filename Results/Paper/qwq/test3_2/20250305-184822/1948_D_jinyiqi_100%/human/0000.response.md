Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string that consists of lowercase Latin letters and question marks. The goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in such a way that the length of the longest substring which is a tandem repeat is maximized.

First off, I need to understand what a tandem repeat is. From the problem, it says that a tandem repeat is a string of even length where the first half is equal to the second half. For example, "aa" is a tandem repeat because "a" equals "a", and "abab" is a tandem repeat because "ab" equals "ab". Make sense.

So, my task is to find the maximum possible length of such a substring after replacing all the question marks with letters. If it's impossible to have any tandem repeat, I should output 0.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

zaabaabz

?????

code?????s

codeforces

Output:

6

4

10

0

Let's analyze the first one: "zaabaabz"

If I look for the longest substring that is a tandem repeat, considering that question marks can be any letter, I need to replace them appropriately.

Wait, but in this first string, there are no question marks. So, I just need to find the longest substring that is a tandem repeat using the existing letters.

Looking at "zaabaabz", let's see:

- "za" and "za" again later, but not immediately following each other.

- "aa" is a tandem repeat: "aa" equals "aa", so length 4.

- "aab" and "aab" again? No, "aab" is followed by "abz", which is different.

Wait, but the output is 6, which is longer than 4. So maybe there's a longer tandem repeat here that I'm missing.

Wait, "aabaab" is "aab" repeated twice, so "aab" equals "aab", length 6. That makes sense.

So, the correct answer is 6 for the first one.

Second input: "?????"

All question marks, length 5. The longest possible tandem repeat must be even length, so the maximum possible even length less than or equal to 5 is 4. So, we can make a tandem repeat of length 4, like "aabaab" but since it's 5 characters, we can make "aabaab" but that's 6 characters, which is longer than 5. So, perhaps the maximum possible is 4, like "aabaab" but truncated to "aabaab", but that's 6. Wait, but the string is length 5, so we can only have up to length 4 for a tandem repeat.

Wait, but the output is 4, which matches.

Third input: "code?????s"

This is "code" followed by 7 question marks and then "s". So, total length is 11.

We need to find the longest possible tandem repeat after replacing the question marks.

The maximum possible length would be 10, since the string is length 11, and 10 is even.

Can we achieve a tandem repeat of length 10? Yes, for example, "codeabcd" and "codeabcd", but I need to make sure that the first half matches the second half.

Wait, "code" is 4 characters, then 7 question marks, and "s" is 1 character. So, the string is "code?????s", which is 4 + 7 + 1 = 12 characters? Wait, the problem says the string consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, so maybe I miscounted.

Wait, "code?????s" is "c o d e ? ? ? ? ? s", which is 10 characters. So, length 10.

Wait, but in the input, it's written as "code?????s", which seems like 4 + 5 + 1 = 10 characters.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as "code?????s", which might be a typo, or perhaps it's 6 question marks. But in any case, according to the sample output, the answer is 10, which suggests that we can make a tandem repeat of length 10.

So, if we replace the question marks appropriately, we can make the entire string a tandem repeat of length 10.

Fourth input: "codeforces"

No question marks, just "codeforces". We need to find the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.

Looking at "codeforces":

- "co" and "co" again? No.

- "ode" and "ode" again? No.

- "force" and "force" again? No.

- Any overlapping or other substrings? Seems not.

So, it's impossible to have any tandem repeat in this string, hence the output is 0.

Alright, now looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

s = list(input())

n = len(s)

for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):

count = 0

for k in range(0, n - j):

if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:

count += 1

else:

count = 0

if count == j:

print(count * 2)

return

print(0)

So, the program defines a function func_1() that reads a string, converts it to a list, gets its length, and then iterates over possible half-lengths of tandem repeats, starting from the largest possible half-length down to 1.

For each half-length j, it initializes a count to 0 and then iterates over the string, checking pairs of characters that are j positions apart.

If either character is a question mark or they are equal, it increments the count; otherwise, it resets the count to 0.

If the count reaches j, it means there is a tandem repeat of length 2*j, and it prints that length and returns.

If no such tandem repeat is found for any j, it prints 0.

Looking back at the first sample input "zaabaabz", let's see what this program would do.

n = 8

It starts with j = 8//2 = 4

Then, it iterates k from 0 to 8 - 4 = 4

For k=0: s[0]='z' and s[4]='a'; 'z' != 'a' and neither is '?', so count=0

For k=1: s[1]='a' and s[5]='a'; 'a' == 'a', so count=1

For k=2: s[2]='a' and s[6]='a'; 'a' == 'a', so count=2

For k=3: s[3]='b' and s[7]='z'; 'b' != 'z', so count=0

Since count never reaches j=4, it moves to j=3

For j=3, it iterates k from 0 to 8-3=5

k=0: 'z' and 'b'; different, count=0

k=1: 'a' and 'a'; equal, count=1

k=2: 'a' and 'a'; equal, count=2

k=3: 'b' and 'z'; different, count=0

k=4: 'a' and '?'; '?' is allowed, count=1

k=5: '?' and 'z'; '?' is allowed, count=2

Since j=3 and count reaches 3, it prints 6 and returns.

Which matches the sample output.

For the second input "?????", n=5, so n//2=2

j=2:

k from 0 to 5-2=3

k=0: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=1: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=2

since count reaches j=2, prints 4 and returns.

Which matches the sample output.

For the third input "code?????s", assuming it's length 10.

j=5:

k from 0 to 10-5=5

k=0: 'c' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=1: 'o' and '?'; allowed, count=2

k=2: 'd' and '?'; allowed, count=3

k=3: 'e' and '?'; allowed, count=4

k=4: '?' and 's'; allowed, count=5

since count reaches j=5, prints 10 and returns.

Which matches the sample output.

For the fourth input "codeforces", n=10

j=5:

k from 0 to 10-5=5

k=0: 'c' and 'f'; different, count=0

k=1: 'o' and 'o'; equal, count=1

k=2: 'd' and 'r'; different, count=0

k=3: 'e' and 'c'; different, count=0

k=4: 'f' and 'e'; different, count=0

j=4:

k from 0 to 6

k=0: 'c' and 'e'; different

k=1: 'o' and 'r'; different

k=2: 'd' and 'c'; different

k=3: 'e' and 'o'; different

k=4: 'f' and 'r'; different

k=5: 'o' and 'c'; different

k=6: 'r' and 'e'; different

...

Until j=1:

k from 0 to 9

k=0: 'c' and 'o'; different

k=1: 'o' and 'd'; different

...

No count reaches j, so prints 0.

Seems correct.

But wait, is this logic always correct?

Let's think about it.

The program iterates j from n//2 down to 1, and for each j, it looks for a sequence where s[k] and s[k+j] are either both '?' or equal.

If such a sequence of length j is found, it prints 2*j and exits.

This seems to be finding the largest possible tandem repeat.

But is there any case where this might not work?

Let's consider a string like "ab?ab?"

n=6

j=3:

k from 0 to 3

k=0: 'a' and 'a'; equal, count=1

k=1: 'b' and 'b'; equal, count=2

k=2: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=3

So, count reaches j=3, prints 6.

But the string is "ab?ab?", and if we replace '?' with, say, 'c', we get "abcabc", which is a tandem repeat "abc" and "abc", so length 6.

That seems correct.

Another test case: "a?a"

n=3

j=1:

k from 0 to 2

k=0: 'a' and 'a'; equal, count=1

k=1: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=2

But j=1, so count reaches 1, it would print 2.

But actually, "a?a" can be "aaa", which has "aa" as a tandem repeat of length 2, and "aaa" is not a tandem repeat since it's odd length.

Wait, but the program would print 2 for j=1.

Is that correct? Well, the longest tandem repeat is "aa", length 2.

So, yes.

Another test case: "??"

n=2

j=1:

k=0: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=1

Since j=1 and count=1, prints 2.

Which is correct, as "??"
can be "aa", which is a tandem repeat.

Seems correct.

Edge case: single character, like "a"

n=1

n//2=0

So, j starts from 0, loop doesn't run, prints 0.

Which is correct, since tandem repeat needs even length.

Another edge case: "???"

n=3

j=1:

k from 0 to 2

k=0: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=1: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=2

Since j=1, count reaches 1, prints 2.

But the string is length 3, so possible tandem repeat is "aa" within "aaa", which is length 2.

Yes, correct.

Another case: "abc?def?"

n=8

j=4:

k from 0 to 4

k=0: 'a' and 'd'; different

k=1: 'b' and 'e'; different

k=2: 'c' and 'f'; different

k=3: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=4: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=2

Since j=4 and count=2 < j, so moves to j=3

k from 0 to 5

k=0: 'a' and 'd'; different

k=1: 'b' and 'e'; different

k=2: 'c' and 'f'; different

k=3: '?' and 'd'; different

k=4: '?' and 'e'; different

k=5: '?' and 'f'; different

No count reaches j=3

j=2:

k from 0 to 6

k=0: 'a' and 'c'; different

k=1: 'b' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=2: 'c' and 'd'; different

k=3: '?' and 'e'; different

k=4: '?' and 'f'; different

k=5: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=1

k=6: '?' and '?'; allowed, count=2

Since j=2 and count=2, prints 4.

But in reality, the string is "abc?def?", which can be "abcadefa" if '?' are replaced with 'a'.

Then, "aaaa" is a tandem repeat of length 4.

So, the program correctly identifies it.

Seems like the program is correct.

I can't find any mistake in the logic.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
