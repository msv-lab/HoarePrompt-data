Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and being assigned positions based on some k. The way the positions are assigned is a bit tricky. For the first k positions, they get numbers 1 through k. Then the next k-2 positions get numbers k-1 through 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

I need to help Vasya remember possible values of k given his position n and the number x he received.

First, I need to understand how the positions are assigned.

Let's look at the example for n=10 and x=2.

The table shows for different k, the numbers assigned to positions 1 through 10.

For k=2:

1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

For k=3:

1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2

For k=5:

1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 2

For k=6:

1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2

So, for each k, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

I need to find all k > 1 such that in position n, the number assigned is x.

Constraints:

- k > 1

- 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t ≤ 100 test cases

Output for each test case is the number of different k that fit the constraints.

Looking at the code provided:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, reads n and x.

- Initializes ans to 1, but then it's set to a set of k's that satisfy certain conditions.

- There's a func_1(n) that seems to factorize n.

- There's a generate function that generates factors.

So, the code is trying to find factors of some h, which is calculated in two different ways, and then checking conditions on k.

Wait, I need to understand what's happening here.

First, I need to understand the settling pattern.

Given k, the pattern is:

- First k positions: 1 to k

- Next k-2 positions: k-1 to 2

- This repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, the period is 2k-2.

Given n, to find x, I need to find k such that at position n, the number is x.

First, I need to find n modulo the period 2k-2.

Let’s denote p = 2k - 2.

Then, the pattern within each period is:

- Positions 1 to k: 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: k-1 to 2

So, within one period:

- For position m in [1, k]: number is m

- For position m in [k+1, 2k-2]: number is 2k - m

Now, to find x at position n, I need to find k such that:

- If n mod p <= k, then x = n mod p

- Else, x = 2k - (n mod p)

But need to handle n mod p == 0 as p.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let’s consider the entire sequence is periodic with period p=2k-2.

So, for any n, n mod p determines the position within the period.

If n mod p == 0, it corresponds to position p in the period.

Now, within the period:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a given n and x, I need to find k such that:

If 1 <= (n mod p) <= k, then x = (n mod p)

Else, x = 2k - (n mod p)

And p = 2k - 2.

Also, since p = 2k - 2, k = (p + 2)/2.

So, perhaps it's easier to iterate over possible p, then compute k.

But the problem is to find k for given n and x.

Looking back at the code:

- It calculates h = n - x and h = n + x - 2 for two cases.

- Then finds factors of h and checks conditions on k.

I need to understand why h is calculated as n - x and n + x - 2.

Let’s derive the conditions.

Case 1: n mod p <= k

Then, x = n mod p

So, n mod p = x

Which means n ≡ x mod p

Or, n - x ≡ 0 mod p

So, p divides n - x.

But p = 2k - 2, so 2k - 2 divides n - x.

Thus, 2k - 2 is a divisor of n - x.

So, k = (p + 2)/2, where p is a divisor of n - x.

Similarly, in the else case:

x = 2k - (n mod p)

Let m = n mod p

Then x = 2k - m

But m = n - p * floor(n/p)

But since m = n mod p, and p divides n - x in the first case, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the two cases separately.

Case 1: n mod p <= k

Then, x = n mod p

So, n mod p = x

Which implies p divides n - x

So, p is a divisor of n - x

Given p = 2k - 2, we have 2k - 2 divides n - x

So, 2k - 2 is a divisor of n - x

Thus, k = (p + 2)/2, where p is a divisor of n - x

Case 2: n mod p > k

Then, x = 2k - (n mod p)

Let m = n mod p

So, x = 2k - m

But m = n - p * floor(n/p)

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, since m = n mod p, and p divides n - x in case 1, in case 2, perhaps there's a different relation.

Looking back at the code, it seems to consider h = n - x and h = n + x - 2.

Wait, perhaps in case 2, it's solving for h = n + x - 2.

Let me see.

From x = 2k - m, and m = n mod p, and p = 2k - 2

Then, x = 2k - (n mod p)

But p = 2k - 2, so n mod (2k - 2) = n - (2k - 2)*floor(n/(2k-2))

Not sure.

Maybe it's better to express n in terms of p.

Let’s consider n = a*p + b, where 0 <= b < p

Then, m = b = n mod p

Case 1: b <= k, x = b

Case 2: b > k, x = 2k - b

So, in case 2, x = 2k - b

But b = n - a*p

So, x = 2k - (n - a*p)

Given p = 2k - 2, substitute p:

x = 2k - (n - a*(2k - 2))

x = 2k - n + a*(2k - 2)

Rearrange:

x + n = a*(2k - 2) + 2k

x + n - 2k = a*(2k - 2)

Not sure.

Wait, maybe solve for a.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to consider h = n - x and h = n + x - 2.

Perhaps these correspond to the two cases.

Let me check for the first test case:

n=10, x=2

Possible k: 2,3,5,6

Let's see h = n - x = 8

Possible k where 2k - 2 divides 8: 2k - 2 divides 8

So, 2k - 2 is a divisor of 8.

Divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8

So, 2k - 2 = 1 => k=1.5 (not integer)

=2 => k=2

=4 => k=3

=8 => k=5

So, k=2,3,5

But in the explanation, k=6 is also valid.

Wait, 2*6 - 2 = 10, which doesn't divide 8.

Wait, maybe I need to consider both h = n - x and h = n + x - 2.

h = n + x - 2 = 10 + 2 - 2 = 10

Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10

2k - 2 =1 => k=1.5 (invalid)

=2 => k=2

=5 => k=3.5 (invalid)

=10 => k=6

So, k=2 and k=6 from h=n-x, and k=3 and k=5 from h=n+x-2.

Wait, but in the first case, k=3 and k=5 come from h=n-x=8, and k=2 and k=6 from h=n+x-2=10.

But in the code, it's taking the union of both sets.

So, it seems that both h=n-x and h=n+x-2 are considered.

Now, I need to understand why both are considered.

Let me think about the two cases again.

Case 1: n mod p <= k, x = n mod p

So, n mod p = x => p divides n - x => h = n - x

Case 2: n mod p > k, x = 2k - (n mod p)

Let m = n mod p

Then, x = 2k - m

So, m = 2k - x

But m = n mod p = n - a*p

So, n - a*p = 2k - x

Rearrange: n + x - 2k = a*p

But p = 2k - 2

So, n + x - 2k = a*(2k - 2)

Let me solve for a:

a = (n + x - 2k)/(2k - 2)

For a to be integer, (n + x - 2k) must be divisible by (2k - 2)

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps set h = n + x - 2 and find k such that 2k - 2 divides h.

Wait, let's see:

If p = 2k - 2 divides h = n + x - 2, then h mod p = 0

So, n + x - 2 - a*p = 0

n + x - 2 = a*p

But p = 2k - 2

So, n + x - 2 = a*(2k - 2)

Now, solving for k:

n + x - 2 = a*(2k - 2)

n + x - 2 = 2a*k - 2a

2a*k = n + x - 2 + 2a

k = (n + x - 2 + 2a)/(2a)

This seems messy.

Perhaps instead, consider that in case 2, p divides n + x - 2.

Wait, in the code, it's considering h = n + x - 2 and finding k such that 2k - 2 divides h.

So, p = 2k - 2 divides h = n + x - 2

Thus, p divides n + x - 2

So, for case 2, p divides n + x - 2

Similarly, in case 1, p divides n - x

Therefore, the code is considering both possibilities: p divides n - x and p divides n + x - 2.

Then, for each p that divides h = n - x or h = n + x - 2, compute k = (p + 2)/2 and check if k is integer and satisfies certain conditions.

Now, in the code, it defines ans as set of k's where k is even and k/2 + 1 >= x.

Wait, k should be integer greater than 1.

But in the code, it's checking if k is even and k/2 + 1 >= x.

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Looking back, in the first test case, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

For k=2:

p = 2*2 - 2 = 2

Check if p divides h1 = n - x = 8 or h2 = n + x - 2 = 10

2 divides 8 and 10, so k=2 is valid.

Similarly, k=3:

p=4, divides h1=8 and h2=10 (4 divides 8 but not 10), so k=3 is valid from h1=8.

k=5:

p=8, divides h1=8 and h2=10 (8 divides 8 but not 10), so k=5 is valid from h1=8.

k=6:

p=10, divides h1=8 and h2=10 (10 divides 10), so k=6 is valid from h2=10.

So, in total, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

Now, in the code, it's using func_1(h) to get factors of h.

Then, for h1 = n - x and h2 = n + x - 2, it's getting factors and then computing k = (p + 2)/2.

It's checking if k is integer and satisfies certain conditions.

But in the code, it's checking if k is even and k/2 + 1 >= x.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting k.

Wait, let's see.

Given p = 2k - 2, then k = (p + 2)/2.

So, for p to be a valid divisor, p must be even because p = 2k - 2, and k is integer greater than 1.

Wait, k is integer, so p must be even.

Therefore, when factoring h, only even factors p are considered, because p must be even.

Then, k = (p + 2)/2 must be integer.

Given p is even, (p + 2)/2 is integer.

So, for each even p that divides h1 or h2, compute k = (p + 2)/2 and check if it satisfies the conditions.

Now, in the code, it's checking if k is even and k/2 + 1 >= x.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct condition.

Looking back at the settling pattern, for k given, it needs to ensure that x is within the possible numbers assigned.

In the first k positions, numbers are from 1 to k.

In the next k-2 positions, numbers are from k-1 to 2.

So, the maximum number assigned is k.

The minimum is 1.

But in the code, it's checking k/2 + 1 >= x.

This seems off.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the first test case, k=2,3,5,6 are valid, and x=2.

For k=2: maximum number is 2, which is >= x=2

For k=3: maximum number is 3 >=2

For k=5: maximum number is 5 >=2

For k=6: maximum number is 6 >=2

So, perhaps the condition is that k >= x.

Wait, in the code, it's checking k/2 + 1 >= x, which for k=2:1 +1=2 >=2

For k=3:1.5 +1=2.5 >=2

For k=5:2.5 +1=3.5 >=2

For k=6:3 +1=4 >=2

So, in this case, it holds, but maybe it's too loose.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be k >=x.

Because in the settling pattern, the numbers assigned are from 1 to k.

So, for x to be assigned, k must be at least x.

Otherwise, x wouldn't be in the pattern.

Wait, but in the first test case, k must be at least 2, since k>1.

But x=2, so k must be at least 2.

Wait, in the second test case, n=3, x=1.

Possible k?

h1 = 3-1=2

h2 = 3+1-2=2

p must divide h1 or h2, which is 2.

So, p=2 => k=2

Check if k >=x, which is 2 >=1

So, k=2 is valid.

Indeed, in the settling for k=2:

Positions:1,2,1,2,1,2,...

n=3: number=1, which matches x=1.

So, in this case, ans=1.

Third test case: n=76, x=4

h1=76-4=72

h2=76+4-2=78

Find p that divides 72 or 78, p even.

p=2: k=2

Check if k >=x, 2 >=4? No.

p=4: k=3 >=4? No.

p=6: k=4 >=4? Yes.

p=12: k=7 >=4? Yes.

p=24: k=13 >=4? Yes.

p=36: k=19 >=4? Yes.

p=72: k=37 >=4? Yes.

From h2=78:

p=2: k=2 >=4? No.

p=6: k=4 >=4? Yes.

p=26: k=14 >=4? Yes.

p=78: k=40 >=4? Yes.

So, k=4,7,13,14,19,37,40

Total 7, but in the sample output, it's 9.

Wait, perhaps I missed some p's.

From h1=72: p=2,4,6,12,24,36,72

From h2=78: p=2,6,26,78

So, k=(p+2)/2 for each p:

From h1=72:

p=2: k=2

p=4: k=3

p=6: k=4

p=12: k=7

p=24: k=13

p=36: k=19

p=72: k=37

From h2=78:

p=2: k=2

p=6: k=4

p=26: k=14

p=78: k=40

Now, remove duplicates: k=2,3,4,7,13,14,19,37,40

Now, check which k >=x=4:

k=4,7,13,14,19,37,40

So, 7 k's, but sample output is 9.

Wait, sample output is 9, but I have 7.

Maybe I missed some p's.

Wait, p must be positive even divisors.

From h1=72: p=2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

From h2=78: p=2,6,26,78

Wait, I missed p=8 and p=18 from h1=72.

So, p=8: k=5 >=4? Yes.

p=18: k=10 >=4? Yes.

So, additional k=5 and k=10.

Thus, total k's:4,5,7,10,13,14,19,37,40 =>9 k's.

Okay, so the code must be considering all even p's that divide h1 or h2, compute k=(p+2)/2, and check if k >=x.

In the code, it's checking if k is even and k/2 +1 >=x.

Wait, k/2 +1 >=x is equivalent to k >= 2(x-1)

So, for x=4, k >=6

But in the sample, k=4 is allowed, which is less than 6.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the first test case, k=2,3,5,6 are allowed, and x=2.

k >=x=2, which is true for all these k's.

In the second test case, k=2 >=1, which is true.

In the third test case, k >=4.

In the fourth test case, k >=99, but n=100, x=99.

Let's see:

h1=100-99=1

h2=100+99-2=197

Divisors of 1: p=1, but p must be even, so no valid p from h1.

Divisors of 197: 197 is prime, p=2 (if 2 divides 197? No), p=197 (odd, invalid)

So, no valid k's, ans=0.

Fifth test case: n=1000000000, x=500000000

k must be >=500000000.

h1=1000000000 -500000000=500000000

h2=1000000000 +500000000 -2=1499999998

Find even p's that divide h1 or h2.

For h1=500000000, find even p's that divide 500000000.

p=2,4,..., up to 500000000.

Compute k=(p+2)/2, and check if k >=x=500000000.

For p=2: k=2 <500000000, invalid.

p=4: k=3 <500000000, invalid.

...

p=500000000: k=250000001 >=500000000? No.

Similarly for h2=1499999998, find even p's that divide 1499999998.

p=2,4,... up to 1499999998.

p=2: k=2 <500000000, invalid.

...

p=1499999998: k=749999999 +1=750000000 >=500000000, valid.

So, only k=750000000 is valid.

But in the sample output, it's 1, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, for n=76, x=4, ans=9, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, in the code, it's considering all even p's that divide h1 or h2, computing k=(p+2)/2, and checking if k >=x.

In the code, it's checking if k is even and k/2 +1 >=x.

Wait, k/2 +1 >=x is equivalent to k >= 2x -2.

So, in the first test case, k >=2*2 -2=2, which matches.

In the third test case, k >=2*4 -2=6, but in reality, k >=4 is sufficient.

So, perhaps the condition is too strict.

Wait, in the first test case, k=3 is allowed, but 3 >=6? No, but in the sample, k=3 is allowed.

So, perhaps the condition is wrong in the code.

Wait, in the code, it's checking k/2 +1 >=x, which is k >=2x -2.

But in reality, the condition should be k >=x.

So, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Wait, but in the first test case, with x=2, k=2,3,5,6 are allowed, all of which are >=2.

But with the condition k >=2*2 -2=2, which is the same as k >=2, so it works.

In the third test case, k >=2*4 -2=6, but in reality, k >=4 is sufficient.

But in the sample, k=4 is allowed, even though 4 <6, but in the code, it's checking k >=6.

Wait, perhaps the condition is too strict.

Looking back, perhaps the condition should be k >=x, not k >=2x -2.

In the code, it's k/2 +1 >=x, which is k >=2x -2.

But in reality, we only need k >=x.

So, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Wait, let's check for the first test case.

For k=3: 3 >=2*2 -2=2, which is true.

k=5:5>=2, true.

k=
