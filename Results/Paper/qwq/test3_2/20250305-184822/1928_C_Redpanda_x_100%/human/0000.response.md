Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned numbers based on a specific pattern involving a parameter k, where k > 1. Vasya remembers his position in the line, n, and the number he received, x, but he forgot the value of k. My task is to figure out how many natural numbers k (greater than 1) satisfy the conditions given n and x.

First, I need to understand the pattern of how the numbers are assigned based on k. According to the problem, the first k people get numbers 1 through k, then the next k-2 people get numbers k-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions.

So, for a given k, the pattern is:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1, k-2, ..., 2

- Then it repeats: positions 2k-2+1 to 3k-2: 1, 2, 3, ..., k

- Positions 3k-2+1 to 4k-4: k-1, k-2, ..., 2

- And so on.

I need to find all k > 1 such that in position n, the number assigned is x.

Let me try to find a general formula or a way to calculate, for a given k, what number is assigned to position n.

First, observe the repeating cycle length is 2k - 2.

So, for any position n, I can find out which cycle it falls into and what's its position within that cycle.

Let's denote m = 2k - 2.

Then, the cycle index is floor((n-1)/m), and the position within the cycle is (n-1) mod m + 1.

Within each cycle:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a position p within the cycle (p ranging from 1 to m):

- If 1 <= p <= k, number is p

- If k < p <= 2k-2, number is 2k - p

So, for a given k, the number at position n is:

- If (n-1) mod m + 1 <= k, then number = (n-1) mod m + 1

- Else, number = 2k - [(n-1) mod m + 1]

And this number should be equal to x.

I need to find all k > 1 such that this condition holds.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look at the examples provided in the problem.

In the first test case:

n = 10, x = 2

k = 2, 3, 5, 6 satisfy.

Let's verify:

For k=2:

Cycle length m = 2*2 - 2 = 2

So positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:1, 8:2, 9:1, 10:2

So position 10: number 2, which matches x=2.

For k=3:

m = 4

Positions: 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1, 10:2

Position 10: number 2, matches x=2.

For k=5:

m=8

Positions: 1:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,...

Position 10: number 2, matches x=2.

For k=6:

m=10

Positions:1:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2

Position 10: number 2, matches x=2.

So, these k values are correct.

Another test case:

n=3, x=1

Only k=2 works.

For k=2:

m=2

Positions:1:1,2:2,3:1

Position 3: number 1, matches x=1.

So, only one k satisfies.

I need to find a general method to find all such k for given n and x.

Let me try to derive a mathematical condition for k.

Given:

- m = 2k - 2

- p = (n-1) mod m + 1

- If p <= k, number = p

- Else, number = 2k - p

And this number should be equal to x.

So, we have two cases:

1. p <= k and p = x

2. p > k and 2k - p = x

Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: p <= k and p = x

Which implies p = x and p <= k.

Since p = (n-1) mod m + 1, we have:

x = (n-1) mod m + 1 and x <= k

But m = 2k - 2, so:

x = (n-1) mod (2k - 2) + 1 and x <= k

This seems tricky to solve directly for k.

Case 2: p > k and 2k - p = x

Which implies p = 2k - x and p > k.

Since p = (n-1) mod m + 1, we have:

2k - x = (n-1) mod (2k - 2) + 1 and 2k - x > k

Simplifying:

(n-1) mod (2k - 2) + 1 = 2k - x

Let me denote m = 2k - 2, then:

(n-1) mod m + 1 = 2k - x

But m = 2k - 2, so 2k = m + 2

Thus:

(n-1) mod m + 1 = m + 2 - x

Which simplifies to:

(n-1) mod m = m + 1 - x

But (n-1) mod m <= m - 1, so m + 1 - x <= m - 1

Which implies x >= 2

Also, since p > k, and p = 2k - x, we have 2k - x > k, which implies x < k

So, x < k

Combining with x >= 2, we have x >= 2 and x < k

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the periodicity of the pattern.

The pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions.

So, for a given k, the number assigned to position n is determined by the position within the cycle.

I need to find k such that in the cycle, the number at position n mod m is equal to x, considering the pattern within the cycle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of congruences.

Let me try to express the condition for the number at position n being equal to x in terms of k.

From the two cases:

1. If p <= k, then p = x

2. If p > k, then 2k - p = x

Where p = (n-1) mod m + 1 and m = 2k - 2

Let me consider both cases together.

So, for case 1: p = x and p <= k

Which is:

(n-1) mod m + 1 = x and x <= k

For case 2: p = 2k - x and p > k

Which is:

(n-1) mod m + 1 = 2k - x and 2k - x > k, which simplifies to x < k

So, combining both cases:

(n-1) mod m + 1 equals either x (with x <= k) or 2k - x (with x < k)

So, (n-1) mod m + 1 = x or 2k - x, depending on conditions.

This seems messy.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of congruences.

Let me denote m = 2k - 2

Then, (n-1) mod m = r, where r = (n-1) - floor((n-1)/m) * m

So, (n-1) mod m = r

Then, p = r + 1

Then, number at position n is:

- If p <= k, number = p

- Else, number = 2k - p

And this should be equal to x.

So, we have:

If p <= k, then p = x

Else, 2k - p = x

Which means:

Either:

1. p <= k and p = x

2. p > k and 2k - p = x

Substituting p = r + 1:

1. r + 1 <= k and r + 1 = x

2. r + 1 > k and 2k - (r + 1) = x

Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1:

r + 1 <= k and r + 1 = x

Which implies r = x - 1 and x - 1 <= k - 1

Since r = (n-1) mod m, and m = 2k - 2, we have:

(n-1) mod (2k - 2) = x - 1

And x - 1 <= k - 1, which is equivalent to x <= k

So, (n-1) mod (2k - 2) = x - 1, with x <= k

Case 2:

r + 1 > k and 2k - (r + 1) = x

Which implies r + 1 > k and r + 1 = 2k - x

So, r + 1 > k and r + 1 = 2k - x

Thus, 2k - x > k, which implies x < k

Also, since r = (n-1) mod m, we have:

(n-1) mod (2k - 2) = 2k - x - 1

And x < k

So, in summary:

We have two scenarios:

1. (n-1) mod (2k - 2) = x - 1, with x <= k

2. (n-1) mod (2k - 2) = 2k - x - 1, with x < k

I need to find all k > 1 such that either of these two conditions holds.

This seems a bit tricky because m = 2k - 2 depends on k, and I need to solve for k in the congruence equations.

Perhaps I can express these congruences in terms of equations.

Let me recall that a mod b = r is equivalent to a = q*b + r, where 0 <= r < b, for some integer q.

So, for case 1:

(n-1) = q*(2k - 2) + (x - 1), for some integer q >= 0, with x - 1 < 2k - 2

And x <= k

Similarly, for case 2:

(n-1) = q*(2k - 2) + (2k - x - 1), for some integer q >= 0, with 2k - x - 1 < 2k - 2

And x < k

Let me simplify these equations.

Case 1:

(n-1) = q*(2k - 2) + (x - 1)

Rearranging:

n - 1 - (x - 1) = q*(2k - 2)

n - x = q*(2k - 2)

So, 2k - 2 divides n - x

Similarly, for case 2:

(n-1) = q*(2k - 2) + (2k - x - 1)

Rearranging:

n - 1 - (2k - x - 1) = q*(2k - 2)

n - 1 - 2k + x + 1 = q*(2k - 2)

n - 2k + x = q*(2k - 2)

So, 2k - 2 divides n - 2k + x

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, let's double-check:

From:

n - 1 - (2k - x - 1) = q*(2k - 2)

Simplify:

n - 1 - 2k + x + 1 = q*(2k - 2)

Which simplifies to:

n - 2k + x = q*(2k - 2)

So, 2k - 2 divides n - 2k + x

Alternatively, we can write this as:

n - 2k + x â‰¡ 0 mod (2k - 2)

But this seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for k in terms of q.

From case 1:

n - x = q*(2k - 2)

Similarly, from case 2:

n - 2k + x = q*(2k - 2)

These are linear Diophantine equations in terms of k and q.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can express k in terms of q.

Let me attempt to solve for k in both cases.

Starting with case 1:

n - x = q*(2k - 2)

Let me solve for k:

n - x = 2qk - 2q

2qk = n - x + 2q

k = (n - x + 2q)/(2q)

Similarly, for case 2:

n - 2k + x = q*(2k - 2)

Let me rearrange:

n - 2k + x = 2qk - 2q

Bring all terms involving k to one side:

-2k - 2qk = -n - x - 2q

Factor k:

k*(-2 - 2q) = -n - x - 2q

Multiply both sides by -1:

k*(2 + 2q) = n + x + 2q

So, k = (n + x + 2q)/(2 + 2q)

This seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that m = 2k - 2, so k = (m + 2)/2

If I can find m such that m divides either n - x or n - 2k + x, I can find k.

Wait, perhaps I can consider m as a variable and find m that divides certain expressions, then relate back to k.

Let me set m = 2k - 2, so k = (m + 2)/2

Then, for case 1:

n - x = q*m

And for case 2:

n - 2k + x = q*m

Substituting k = (m + 2)/2:

n - 2*(m + 2)/2 + x = q*m

Simplify:

n - m - 2 + x = q*m

So, n + x - m - 2 = q*m

Which implies m*(q + 1) = n + x - 2

Thus, m divides n + x - 2

Similarly, from case 1:

m divides n - x

So, in both cases, m divides either n - x or n + x - 2

Then, since m = 2k - 2, and k = (m + 2)/2, I can find m such that m divides either n - x or n + x - 2, and then find k from m.

But m must be a positive even integer because k > 1 and m = 2k - 2 >= 0

Wait, k > 1, so m >= 0

But m = 2k - 2, and for k > 1, m >= 0

Actually, for k = 1, m = 0, but k > 1, so m >= 0

But in the problem, it's specified that k > 1

So, m >= 0

But m = 2k - 2, and k is a natural number greater than 1

So, m is a non-negative even integer.

Now, I need to find all m such that m divides either n - x or n + x - 2, and m is of the form 2k - 2 for some integer k > 1.

Wait, actually, m = 2k - 2, so k = (m + 2)/2

Since k is an integer greater than 1, m must be an even non-negative integer.

Wait, m = 2k - 2, and k is integer > 1, so m is even and m >= 0

So, m is an even positive integer (since k > 1 implies m >= 0)

Wait, for k > 1, m >= 0

But k > 1, so m >= 0

But m must be even, since m = 2(k - 1), which is even.

So, m is a positive even integer (since k >= 2 implies m >= 2)

Wait, for k = 2, m = 2

For k = 3, m = 4, etc.

So, m is a positive even integer >= 2

Now, in both cases:

- m divides n - x

- m divides n + x - 2

So, I need to find all m >= 2, even, such that m divides either n - x or n + x - 2

Then, for each such m, k = (m + 2)/2

But k must be an integer > 1, which it is, since m >= 2 and even.

Also, need to ensure that in both cases, the conditions x <= k for case 1 and x < k for case 2 are satisfied.

Wait, in case 1: x <= k

In case 2: x < k

So, for each m, k = (m + 2)/2

Then, for case 1: x <= k = (m + 2)/2

For case 2: x < k = (m + 2)/2

So, for a given m, I need to check if x <= (m + 2)/2 for case 1, or x < (m + 2)/2 for case 2.

But since m divides either n - x or n + x - 2, I can iterate over all possible m that divide n - x or n + x - 2, and check if m >= 2 and even, and then check the conditions on x and k.

Wait, but m divides n - x or m divides n + x - 2.

So, I can find all m that divide n - x, and all m that divide n + x - 2, and then intersect them with m >= 2 and even.

Then, for each such m, compute k = (m + 2)/2, and check if x <= k for m dividing n - x, and x < k for m dividing n + x - 2.

Wait, but in case 1, m divides n - x and x <= k

In case 2, m divides n + x - 2 and x < k

So, I need to consider both cases separately.

So, the plan is:

1. Find all m such that m divides n - x and m >= 2 and even

For each such m, compute k = (m + 2)/2, and check if x <= k

If yes, count this k

2. Find all m such that m divides n + x - 2 and m >= 2 and even

For each such m, compute k = (m + 2)/2, and check if x < k

If yes, count this k

Then, the total number of valid k is the number of m satisfying either of the above conditions.

But need to make sure that the same k is not counted twice.

Wait, m is unique for each k, since m = 2k - 2

So, each m corresponds to a unique k, and vice versa.

Therefore, I can collect all such m from both cases, ensure they are unique, and then count the corresponding k.

Hence, the number of valid k is equal to the number of valid m.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to find all even m >= 2 that divide n - x or n + x - 2, and then check the conditions on x and k.

But in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar.

Let me look at the given code.

The code is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

ans = 1

h = n - x

ans = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans2 = set()

if x != 1:

h = n + x - 2

ans2 = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans = ans.union(ans2)

print(len(ans))

def func_1(n):

factors = {}

nn = n

i = 2

while i * i <= nn:

while nn % i == 0:

factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1

nn //= i

i += 1

if nn > 1:

factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1

primes = list(factors.keys())

for factor in generate(0):

yield factor

def generate(k):

if k == len(primes):

yield 1

else:

rest = generate(k + 1)

prime = primes[k]

for factor in rest:

prime_to_i = 1

for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):

yield (factor * prime_to_i)

prime_to_i *= prime

Okay, so the main logic is in the loop over test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and x.

Then, it computes h = n - x

Then, it seems to be finding some set of k values based on h, using func_1(h), and filtering k where k is even and k/2 + 1 >= x

Then, if x != 1, it computes h = n + x - 2 and does similar processing, and takes the union of the two sets.

Finally, it prints the length of the set.

Now, func_1(n) seems to be generating all divisors of n.

Looking at func_1, it factors n and then generates all possible products of its prime factors, which are essentially all divisors of n.

The generate function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors raised to their possible exponents.

So, func_1(n) yields all divisors of n.

In the main loop:

- For h = n - x, it finds all even divisors m of h that are >= 2, and compute k = m / 2 + 1, and check if k >= x

Wait, no, in the code, it's k for k in func_1(h), where func_1(h) yields divisors of h.

Then, it filters k where k is even and k / 2 + 1 >= x

Wait, k / 2 + 1 >= x

But in our earlier derivation, m = 2k - 2, and k = (m + 2)/2

So, in the code, it seems to be iterating over m (divisors of h = n - x), and then computing k from m.

But in the code, it's iterating k over divisors of h, which seems incorrect.

Wait, no, in the code, it's iterating k over divisors of h = n - x, but k is supposed to be m, the divisor.

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion in variable names.

In the code, k is used to iterate over divisors of h, but in our earlier notation, m is the divisor.

So, perhaps in the code, k represents m.

Then, it computes k = m, and then checks if k is even and k / 2 + 1 >= x

But k = m, and m = 2k - 2, which seems confusing because k is used for two different purposes.

Wait, in our notation, m = 2k - 2

But in the code, k is used for m.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I should rename variables in the code to match our notation.

Let me denote m as the divisor, and k as k.

So, in the code:

h = n - x

Then, it iterates m over divisors of h, and for each m, computes k = (m + 2)/2, and checks if m is even and k >= x

Wait, in the code, it's k / 2 + 1 >= x, but k is m in our notation.

Wait, no, in the code, k represents m.

So, in the code, k / 2 + 1 >= x, which translates to m / 2 + 1 >= x

But m = 2k - 2, so k = (m + 2)/2

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to see what the code is doing step by step.

First, for h = n - x, it finds all even divisors m of h that are >= 2, and then computes k = (m + 2)/2, and checks if k >= x

Similarly, if x != 1, for h = n + x - 2, it finds all even divisors m of h that are >= 2, and computes k = (m + 2)/2, and checks if k > x

Then, it takes the union of these two sets of k and outputs the count.

Wait, in the code, for the first case, it's k / 2 + 1 >= x

Given that k = m, and m = 2k - 2, which is confusing because k is used for m.

Wait, perhaps I should rename variables in my mind.

Let me denote:

- Let d be the divisor, corresponding to m in our earlier notation.

- Then, k = (d + 2)/2

So, in the code, k represents d, the divisor.

Then, the condition is d is even, and (d / 2 + 1) >= x

Which matches k >= x, since k = (d + 2)/2

Wait, k = (d + 2)/2

Then, k >= x is equivalent to d >= 2x - 2

Similarly, in the second case, d divides n + x - 2, d even >=2, and k > x, which is (d + 2)/2 > x, so d > 2x - 2

Wait, but in the code, it's k / 2 + 1 >= x for both cases, but in the second case, it should be k > x, which is k >= x + 1

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the code, for the first h = n - x, it's k / 2 + 1 >= x

Which is (k / 2 + 1) >= x

But k = d, and d = 2k - 2, so k = (d + 2)/2

So, ((d + 2)/2)/2 + 1 >= x

Which simplifies to (d + 2)/4 + 1 >= x

This seems off.

I think there's a confusion in variable names in the code.

Perhaps the variable k in the code actually represents m, the divisor.

Let me rename k in the code to m.

So, the code is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

ans = 1

h = n - x

ans = set((m for m in func_1(h) if not m % 2 and m / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans2 = set()

if x != 1:

h = n + x - 2

ans2 = set((m for m in func_1(h) if not m % 2 and m / 2 + 1 >= x))

ans = ans.union(ans2)

print(len(ans))

Now, m is the divisor of h.

Then, k = (m + 2)/2

And the condition is m / 2 + 1 >= x

Which is (m + 2)/2 >= x, which is k >= x

Similarly, in the second case, m / 2 + 1 >= x, which is k >= x

But in our earlier derivation, for the second case, we need x < k, which is k > x, or k >= x + 1

So, there seems to be a discrepancy here.

Moreover, in the first case, it's m divides n - x, which corresponds to our case 1.

In that case, x <= k

Which is already covered by m / 2 + 1 >= x, since k = (m + 2)/2 >= x

Similarly, in the second case, m divides n + x - 2, and x < k, which is k > x

Which is covered by m / 2 + 1 >= x + 1, but in the code, it's m / 2 + 1 >= x

So, perhaps it's off by one.

Wait, let's check with an example.

Take n=10, x=2

From the example, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

Let's see:

For k=2: m=2

For k=3: m=4

For k=5: m=8

For k=6: m=10

So, m=2,4,8,10

Now, h1 = n - x = 8

h2 = n + x - 2 = 10

So, find even divisors of 8 and 10 that are >=2.

Divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8

Even ones >=2: 2,4,8

Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10

Even ones >=2:2,10

Now, for h1=8, m=2,4,8

k=(m+2)/2: 2,3,5

Check k >= x=2: yes for all

For h2=10, m=2,10

k=(2+2)/2=2, (10+2)/2=6

Check k >= x=2: yes for both

So, total k=2,3,5,6, which matches the first test case.

Another test case: n=3, x=1

h1=2, h2=2

Divisors of 2:2

k=(2+2)/2=2

Check k >=1: yes

So, only k=2, which matches the second test case.

Another test case: n=76, x=4

h1=72, h2=76 + 4 -2=78

Find even divisors of 72 and 78 >=2.

Divisors of 72: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72

Even ones >=2:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

k=(2,4,...,72)+2)/2=2,3,4,5,7,10,13,19,37

Check k >=4: 2,3 excluded, so 4,5,7,10,13,19,37

Divisors of 78:1,2,3,6,13,26,39,78

Even ones >=2:2,6,26,78

k=(2,6,26,78)+2)/2=2,4,14,40

Check k >=4:2 excluded, so 4,14,40

Total k from h1:4,5,7,10,13,19,37

From h2:4,14,40

Union:2,3,4,5,7,10,13,14,19,37,40

But in the example, answer is 9, but here I have 11.

Wait, but in h1, k >=x=4, so exclude k=2,3

In h2, k >x=4, so exclude k=2,3,4?

Wait, in the code, it's m / 2 +1 >=x, which for h2 case should be k >x, but in the code, it's k >=x.

Wait, perhaps that's the mistake.

In the second case, it should be k >x, not k >=x.

In the code, it's k / 2 +1 >=x, which for k=(m+2)/2, is (m+2)/4 +1 >=x

Which doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition in the code.

In the second case, for m dividing n + x -2, we have x < k, which is k >x

Which is k >= x +1

But in the code, it's k / 2 +1 >=x, which is (m +2)/4 +1 >=x

This seems incorrect.

Perhaps I need to adjust the condition in the code.

Wait, maybe I need to set k >x in the second case.

Given that, for the second case, m divides n + x -2, and x <k, which is k >x

So, perhaps in the code, for the second case, it should be k >x, not k >=x

But in the code, it's k / 2 +1 >=x, which for k=(m+2)/2, is (m+2)/4 +1 >=x

This doesn't seem right.

Perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, maybe I need to set m / 2 +1 >x for the second case.

But m =2k -2, so m /2 +1 =k

So, k >x for the second case.

Hence, the condition should be k >x for the second case, and k >=x for the first case.

But in the code, it's k / 2 +1 >=x for both cases.

This seems inconsistent.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the code's condition.

Let me recast the conditions.

From earlier:

- For m dividing n -x, k >=x

- For m dividing n +x -2, k >x

But in the code, it's k / 2 +1 >=x for both cases.

This suggests that the condition is not correctly implemented for the second case.

Perhaps I need to adjust the condition for the second case to k >x, which is k >=x +1

Given that, for the second case, I need to have k >=x +1

Which corresponds to m /2 +1 >=x +1, which is m >=2x

But m =2k -2, so 2k -2 >=2x, which is k >=x +1

So, perhaps in the code, for the second case, it should be m >=2x

But in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

Which is not exactly m >=2x

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition in the code.

Let me set for the second case: m >=2x

Given that m =2k -2, and k >x, which is m >=2x -2

But in the second case, we need k >x, which is m >=2x -2

But to have k >x, we need m >=2x -2 +2, which is m >=2x

Wait, k >x implies 2k -2 >2x -2, which is m >2x -2

Since m is even and >=2, we can set m >=2x -2 +2 -1 =2x -1, but this is getting messy.

Perhaps it's easier to set m >=2x for the second case.

So, in the code, for the second case, instead of m /2 +1 >=x, it should be m >=2x

Then, k = (m +2)/2 >=x +1, which is k >x

Which is what we need.

Hence, perhaps the condition should be m >=2x for the second case.

But in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

Which is not matching.

This suggests that there is a mistake in the code's condition for the second case.

Perhaps the code should have m >=2x for the second case.

But in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

This seems inconsistent with what's required.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me recall that m =2k -2, and k >=x for the first case, and k >x for the second case.

So, for the first case:

k >=x implies 2k -2 >=2x -2, which is m >=2x -2

But m must be even and >=2

Similarly, for the second case:

k >x implies m >=2x

So, for the first case, m >=2x -2

For the second case, m >=2x

But in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

Which matches the first case, but not the second case.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrectly using the same condition for both cases.

Perhaps for the second case, it should be m >=2x

Then, in the code, for the second case, it should have m >=2x

But in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

Which is not the same as m >=2x

Hence, there seems to be a mistake in the code's condition for the second case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between m and k.

Let me try to re-express the conditions directly in terms of m.

Given that m =2k -2, and k >=2

Then, k = (m +2)/2

For the first case:

m divides n -x, and x <=k

Which is x <= (m +2)/2, which is m >=2x -2

For the second case:

m divides n +x -2, and x <k, which is x < (m +2)/2, which is m >2x -2

Since m is integer, m >=2x -1

But m is even and >=2

So, m >=2x -1 and m is even and >=2

But m must be even, so if 2x -1 is odd, m >=2x

If 2x -1 is even, m >=2x -1

But this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps in the code, to simplify, they are using m >=2x -2 for both cases, which covers both conditions.

Given that m >=2x -2 satisfies both m >=2x -2 for the first case and m >=2x for the second case.

But m >=2x -2 includes m >=2x, so it might be okay.

Wait, m >=2x -2 includes m >=2x, since 2x -2 <=2x

Hence, using m >=2x -2 for both cases would cover both conditions.

But need to verify if this is correct.

Wait, for the second case, we need m >=2x

But m >=2x -2 includes m >=2x, since 2x -2 <=2x

Hence, m >=2x -2 is a weaker condition that includes m >=2x

But it also includes m >=2x -2, which might include some m that don't satisfy m >=2x

Hence, it might be including some m that don't satisfy the condition for the second case.

But in the code, it's using m >=2x -2 for both cases, which might be incorrect for the second case.

Wait, in the code, it's m /2 +1 >=x, which is m >=2x -2

But for the second case, we need m >=2x

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrectly using m >=2x -2 for both cases, which might include some m that don't satisfy m >=2x for the second case.

But in the first test case, it gives the correct answer, so maybe it works.

Wait, perhaps for the second case, m >=2x -2 is sufficient because m divides n +x -2, and m >=2x -2

But in reality, for the second case, we need m >=2x

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect in using m >=2x -2 for both cases.

But in the first test case, it gives the correct answer, so maybe it's coincidental.

Wait, in the first test case, n=10, x=2

h1=8, h2=10

For h1=8, m=2,4,8 (divisors of 8 that are even >=2)

k=(2,4,8)+2)/2=2,3,5

Check k >=2: yes for all

For h2=10, m=2,10

k=(2,10)+2)/2=2,6

Check k >=2: yes for both

Hence, k=2,3,5,6, which matches the first test case.

But according to the correct condition, for h2, we need k >x, which is k >2, so k >=3

Hence, for h2, only k=3,6 should be counted, not k=2

But in the code, it includes k=2 for h2 as well, which is incorrect.

However, in the first test case, k=2 is also included in h1, so it's still part of the union.

Hence, the code might still give the correct count, but it's not precise.

In the second test case, n=3, x=1

h1=2, h2=2

For h1=2, m=2

k=(2+2)/2=2

Check k >=1: yes

For h2=2, m=2

k=2

Check k >=1: yes

But according to the second case, x <k, which is 1 <2: yes

Hence, k=2 is valid for both cases, but in reality, it should only be counted once.

Hence, the code is counting it once, which is correct.

In the third test case, n=76, x=4

h1=72, h2=78

Divisors of 72 (even >=2):2,
