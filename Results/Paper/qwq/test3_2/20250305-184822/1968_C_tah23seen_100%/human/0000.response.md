Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements from a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to find any such array a that meets these conditions.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find values for a_1 to a_n that satisfy this relationship for each pair (a_{i-1}, a_i).

Let me consider a simple example to grasp this.

Suppose n=3, and x = [2, 4].

So, x_2 = 2 and x_3 = 4.

I need to find a_1, a_2, a_3 such that:

- a_2 % a_1 = 2

- a_3 % a_2 = 4

And each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

One way to approach this is to choose a_1 first, then determine a_2 based on a_1 and x_2, and then determine a_3 based on a_2 and x_3.

But there might be constraints that make certain choices invalid.

Alternatively, maybe I can start from the end and work my way backwards.

Let's think about starting from a_n.

But wait, in the given code, it seems like they're starting from the end.

Looking at the function func_1, it takes the array arr (which is x_2 to x_n) and n.

It initializes ans with [10^9] * n, so all a_i are set to 10^9 initially.

Then, it starts from i = n-2 and goes down to 0, setting ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i].

Wait, that seems suspicious.

Let me try this with the first example from the problem.

First test case:

n=4

x = [2,4,1]

According to the sample output, one possible a is [3,5,4,9].

Let's see:

- 5 % 3 = 2 → matches x_2=2

- 4 % 5 = 4 → matches x_3=4

- 9 % 4 = 1 → matches x_4=1

Now, according to the code:

Initialize ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]

Then, i starts from n-2 = 2:

Set ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999

Then i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995

Then i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993

So, the resulting a would be [999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]

Let's check if this satisfies the conditions:

- a_2 % a_1 = 999999995 % 999999993

999999995 divided by 999999993 is 1 with a remainder of 2, since 999999995 - 999999993 = 2. So, yes, x_2=2.

- a_3 % a_2 = 999999999 % 999999995

999999999 - 999999995 = 4, so 999999999 % 999999995 = 4, which matches x_3=4.

- a_4 % a_3 = 1000000000 % 999999999 = 1, which matches x_4=1.

So, in this case, the code produces a valid array a.

Let's check another example from the input.

Second test case:

n=3

x=[1,1]

Sample output: 2 5 11

Let's see:

- 5 % 2 = 1

- 11 % 5 = 1

Which matches x=[1,1]

Now, according to the code:

Initialize ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]

Then i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999

Then i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999999 - 1 = 999999998

So, a = [999999998, 999999999, 1000000000]

Check:

- 999999999 % 999999998 = 1 (since 999999999 - 999999998 = 1)

- 1000000000 % 999999999 = 1 (since 1000000000 - 999999999 = 1)

So, it works here too.

Wait, but in the sample output, a=[2,5,11], which is different from what the code produces, but both are valid.

So, multiple a arrays can satisfy the conditions.

Now, let's see if the code always produces a valid a.

Looking at the logic:

It sets a_n = 10^9

Then a_{n-1} = a_n - x_{n-1}

a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} - x_{n-2}

And so on, up to a_1.

So, it's basically setting each a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i

Now, I need to ensure that a_i >=1 and a_i > x_i, since a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}, which implies that a_i > x_{i+1}.

Wait, no, modulo can be equal to a_i if a_i divides a_{i+1}, but in this problem, x_i is given to be between 1 and 500, and a_i is at least 1.

Wait, no, in the problem, 1 <= x_i <= 500, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

Also, in the sample inputs, x_i are positive integers.

So, the condition is a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}

Which implies that a_{i+1} >= x_{i+1}, because remainder is always less than the divisor when the remainder is not zero.

Wait, but in modulo operation, a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}, which means that a_{i+1} >= x_{i+1}, and x_{i+1} < a_i, because if a_{i+1} < a_i, then a_{i+1} % a_i = a_{i+1}, which would be x_{i+1}.

Wait, more precisely:

- If a_{i+1} >= a_i, then a_{i+1} % a_i = a_{i+1} - floor(a_{i+1}/a_i) * a_i

- But in the code, it's setting a_{i} = a_{i+1} - x_{i}

So, let's see if this makes sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Suppose I set a_n to a large number, say 10^9.

Then, set a_{n-1} = a_n - x_{n-1}

Then, a_n % a_{n-1} should be x_{n-1}

Let's check:

a_n % a_{n-1} = (a_{n-1} + x_{n-1}) % a_{n-1} = x_{n-1}

Because (a_{n-1} + x_{n-1}) % a_{n-1} = a_{n-1} % a_{n-1} + x_{n-1} % a_{n-1} = 0 + x_{n-1} = x_{n-1}

Since a_{n-1} is positive and x_{n-1} < a_{n-1} (because a_{n-1} = a_n - x_{n-1}, and a_n is large, so a_{n-1} > x_{n-1}).

Wait, but is a_{n-1} > x_{n-1}?

Given that a_n = 10^9 and x_{n-1} is at least 1, a_{n-1} = 10^9 - x_{n-1}, which is still very large and greater than x_{n-1}.

So, a_n % a_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, which satisfies the condition.

Now, moving to a_{n-2}:

Set a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} - x_{n-2}

Then, a_{n-1} % a_{n-2} should be x_{n-2}

Similarly:

a_{n-1} % a_{n-2} = (a_{n-2} + x_{n-2}) % a_{n-2} = x_{n-2}

Again, as long as a_{n-2} > x_{n-2}, this holds.

Given that a_{n-1} = a_{n-2} + x_{n-2}, and a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} - x_{n-2}, which is fine as long as a_{n-1} > x_{n-2}.

But since a_{n-1} = 10^9 - x_{n-1}, and x_{n-1} can be up to 500, a_{n-1} is at least 10^9 - 500 = 999999500, which is much larger than x_{n-2}, which is up to 500.

So, a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = 999999500 - x_{n-2}, which is still much larger than x_{n-2}.

This pattern continues all the way to a_1.

So, in general, for each i from n-1 down to 1:

Set a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i

And as long as a_i > x_i, the condition a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1} holds.

Given that a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i, which is greater than a_i, and x_i < a_i, this seems correct.

Moreover, since a_n is set to 10^9, and x_i are up to 500, all a_i will be at least 10^9 - (n-1)*500, which for n up to 500, is at least 10^9 - 250*500 = 10^9 - 125000 = 999,875,000, which is still much larger than 1.

So, a_i will always be greater than 1, satisfying the constraints.

Therefore, the given code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}} \]
