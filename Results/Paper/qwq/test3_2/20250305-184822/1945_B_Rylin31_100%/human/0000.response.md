Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals. The first one launches every 'a' minutes, and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, specifically from time x to x + m inclusive.

The task is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- Installation 1 launches at times: a, 2a, 3a, ...

- Installation 2 launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, meaning if a firework is launched at time x, it's visible from x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the visibility periods of all fireworks and find the time when the most of them overlap.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, it's impossible to iterate through all possible times. So, I need a smarter way.

Let's consider the launch times and how visibility periods overlap.

For installation 1, fireworks are launched at multiples of a, and each is visible for m minutes.

Similarly for installation 2, at multiples of b, each visible for m minutes.

I need to find a time t where the number of visible fireworks is maximized.

First, let's think about the number of fireworks from installation 1 that are visible at time t.

A firework launched at time k*a is visible at time t if k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

So, for installation 1, the number of visible fireworks at time t is the number of integers k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

Let me rephrase that.

For installation 1, the number of visible fireworks at time t is the number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Which is equivalent to floor((t - m)/a) < k <= floor(t/a).

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

The number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at time t is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Because floor(t/a) is the number of fireworks launched before or at time t, and floor((t - m - 1)/a) is the number of fireworks launched before time t - m.

So, the difference gives the number of fireworks still visible at time t.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to find the maximum.

Let me consider the possible values this expression can take.

First, consider that floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) is the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m, t].

So, it's at most ceil((m + 1)/x).

Because the number of multiples of x in an interval of length l is floor(l/x) or ceil(l/x), depending on alignment.

Wait, more precisely, in the interval [t - m, t], the number of multiples of x is floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x).

Which is equal to ceil((m + 1)/x).

Because ceil((m + 1)/x) = floor((m + 1)/x) + 1 if (m + 1) mod x != 0, else floor((m + 1)/x).

But in this problem, it's specified that each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes, from x to x + m inclusive, which is m + 1 minutes.

So, the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at time t is ceil((m + 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Wait, no, it's not necessarily ceil((m + 1)/a), because the alignment of t matters.

For example, if t is a multiple of a, then more fireworks might be visible.

Wait, no, let's think with an example.

Take the first test case:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, m + 1 = 5 minutes visibility.

Installation 1 launches at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...

Installation 2 launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, ...

At t = 7:

Firework from installation 1 launched at t=6 is visible from 6 to 10.

Firework from installation 2 launched at t=7 is visible from 7 to 11.

So, at t=7, both are visible.

Similarly, at t=112 for the third test case.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is ceil(5/6) = 1, and from installation 2 is ceil(5/7) = 1, so total 2, which matches the first test case.

But in the third test case, it's 17, which is more than ceil(56/7) + ceil(56/8) = 9 + 8 = 17.

Wait, but in general, it seems that the maximum number is ceil((m + 1)/a) + ceil((m + 1)/b).

But in the second test case, a=3, b=4, m=10.

ceil(11/3) = 4, ceil(11/4) = 3, total 7, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, fifth test case, a=1, b=1, m=1.

ceil(2/1) + ceil(2/1) = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Sixth test case, a=1, b=1, m=10^18.

ceil(10^18 + 1)/1 + ceil(10^18 + 1)/1 = 10^18 + 1 + 10^18 + 1 = 2*10^18 + 2, which seems to match the sample output, but the sample output is 2*10^18 + 2, which is 2000000000000000002, but in the sample output, it's given as 2000000000000000002, which matches.

Wait, but in the third test case, a=7, b=8, m=56.

ceil(57/7) = 9, ceil(57/8) = 8, total 17, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is ceil((m + 1)/a) + ceil((m + 1)/b).

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me check with some other values.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=0.

So, m + 1 = 1.

ceil(1/2) + ceil(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2.

But at t=2, firework from a is launched and visible from 2 to 2.

At t=3, firework from b is launched and visible from 3 to 3.

At t=2, only firework from a is visible.

At t=3, only firework from b is visible.

At t=2.5, none are visible.

So, maximum is 1, but according to the formula, it's 2.

Wait, this contradicts.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, but m=0 means visibility is from x to x, inclusive, so only at time x.

So, at t=2, only a's firework is visible.

At t=3, only b's is visible.

No time where both are visible, since their visibility intervals don't overlap.

So, maximum is 1, but ceil(1/2) + ceil(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the formula gives 2, but actual maximum is 1.

So, the formula is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "if one firework was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute."

In this case, m=0, so if one is launched exactly m=0 minutes after another, they are visible for one minute together.

But in my example, a=2, b=3, m=0.

Launch times are 2,4,6,... and 3,6,9,...

At t=6, both launch, so both are visible at t=6.

So, maximum is 2.

But earlier I thought at t=2 and t=3 only one is visible.

But at t=6, both are visible.

So, maximum is 2, which matches the formula.

Wait, but in my earlier thought process, I thought there was no overlap, but actually, at t=6, both are launched, so both are visible.

So, maximum is indeed 2.

Maybe my earlier assumption was wrong.

Let me think again.

In general, the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of ceil((m + 1)/a) and ceil((m + 1)/b), because at the time when both installations launch fireworks that are visible overlapping, the total visible fireworks would be the sum of each installation's visible fireworks.

But in the case where launches coincide, it might be higher.

Wait, but in the first test case, a=6, b=7, m=4.

ceil(5/6) + ceil(5/7) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a=3, b=4, m=10.

ceil(11/3) + ceil(11/4) = 4 + 3 = 7, which matches.

Third test case, a=7, b=8, m=56.

ceil(57/7) + ceil(57/8) = 9 + 8 = 17, which matches.

Fourth test case, a=5, b=6, m=78123459896.

ceil(78123459897/5) + ceil(78123459897/6) = ceil(15624691979.4) + ceil(13020576649.5) = 15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630, which matches.

Fifth test case, a=1, b=1, m=1.

ceil(2/1) + ceil(2/1) = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches.

Sixth test case, a=1, b=1, m=10^18.

ceil(10^18 + 1)/1 + ceil(10^18 + 1)/1 = 10^18 + 1 + 10^18 + 1 = 2*10^18 + 2, which matches.

So, in all these cases, the formula seems to hold.

Wait, but earlier I thought of a=2, b=3, m=0, and in that case, it also matches.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

Maybe my initial confusion was wrong.

So, the maximum number of visible fireworks is ceil((m + 1)/a) + ceil((m + 1)/b).

Now, in terms of code, since a, b, m can be up to 10^18, I need to handle large numbers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

Also, t can be up to 10^4, so I need an efficient solution for each test case.

Implementing ceil(m + 1)/a can be done as (m + a)//a.

Similarly for b.

So, the expression becomes (m + a - 1)//a + (m + b - 1)//b.

Wait, (m + a)//a is equal to ceil((m + 1)/a), since m + 1 divided by a, ceiling.

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil((m + 1)/a) is equal to (m + 1 + a - 1)//a = (m + a)//a.

Yes, you're right.

So, in code, it's (m + a)//a + (m + b)//b.

Then, print this value for each test case.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

print(m // a + m // b + 2)

Wait, this is using m // a + m // b + 2.

But according to my reasoning, it should be (m + a)//a + (m + b)//b.

Which is equivalent to ceil(m/a) + ceil(m/b).

But in my earlier reasoning, it should be ceil((m + 1)/a) + ceil((m + 1)/b).

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In the problem statement, each firework is visible from x to x + m inclusive, which is m + 1 minutes.

So, the visibility duration is m + 1 minutes.

In my earlier reasoning, I used ceil((m + 1)/a) + ceil((m + 1)/b).

But in the provided code, it's m // a + m // b + 2.

Wait, perhaps they are considering the visibility from x to x + m inclusive as m + 1 minutes, and then calculating ceil((m + 1)/a) as (m + 1 + a - 1)//a = (m + a)//a.

Similarly for b.

So, the correct expression should be (m + a)//a + (m + b)//b.

But in the provided code, it's m // a + m // b + 2.

Wait, let's check with sample input 1:

a=6, b=7, m=4

(m + a)//a = (4 + 6)//6 = 10//6 = 1

(m + b)//b = (4 + 7)//7 = 11//7 = 1

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

With provided code:

m // a + m // b + 2 = 4//6 + 4//7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

Another sample input: a=3, b=4, m=10

(m + a)//a + (m + b)//b = 13//3 + 14//4 = 4 + 3 = 7

Provided code: 10//3 + 10//4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, matches.

Third sample: a=7, b=8, m=56

(56 + 7)//7 + (56 + 8)//8 = 63//7 + 64//8 = 9 + 8 = 17

Provided code: 56//7 + 56//8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, matches.

Fourth sample: a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

(78123459896 + 5)//5 + (78123459896 + 6)//6 = 78123459901//5 + 78123459902//6 = 15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630

Provided code: 78123459896//5 + 78123459896//6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, matches.

Fifth sample: a=1, b=1, m=1

(1 + 1)//1 + (1 + 1)//1 = 2 + 2 = 4

Provided code: 1//1 + 1//1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, matches.

Sixth sample: a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

(10^18 + 1)//1 + (10^18 + 1)//1 = 10^18 + 1 + 10^18 + 1 = 2*10^18 + 2

Provided code: 10^18//1 + 10^18//1 + 2 = 10^18 + 10^18 + 2 = 2*10^18 + 2, matches.

So, both approaches give the same result in all sample inputs.

But according to my earlier reasoning, the correct expression is (m + a)//a + (m + b)//b.

While the provided code uses m//a + m//b + 2.

Both expressions are equal.

Let me verify:

(m + a)//a = floor((m + a)/a) = floor(m/a + 1) = floor(m/a) + 1 (since floor(x + 1) = floor(x) + 1)

Similarly, (m + b)//b = floor(m/b) + 1

So, (m + a)//a + (m + b)//b = floor(m/a) + 1 + floor(m/b) + 1 = floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2

Which is exactly m//a + m//b + 2.

Hence, the provided code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
