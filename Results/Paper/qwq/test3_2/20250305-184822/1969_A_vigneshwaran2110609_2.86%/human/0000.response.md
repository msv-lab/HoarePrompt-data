Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, meaning everyone has exactly one best friend, and no one is their own best friend.

2. A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party, and he wants to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between friends and their best friends. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this forms a permutation of the friends where no element is in its original position. In other words, it's a derangement.

Given that, I can think of the friends and their best friends as forming cycles. For example, if friend A's best friend is B, and B's best friend is A, then A and B form a cycle of length 2. If friend C's best friend is D, D's best friend is E, and E's best friend is C, then C, D, E form a cycle of length 3, and so on.

The problem is to select a subset of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party, and the number of invitations sent is minimized.

Given the condition that a friend comes only if both they and their best friend are invited, I need to invite pairs of friends who are each other's best friends to maximize the number of attendees per invitation.

Wait, but in the example provided, p = [3,1,2,5,4], and inviting [1,2,4,5] results in friends [2,4,5] coming. Friend 1 doesn't come because his best friend (3) wasn't invited, and friend 3 isn't invited at all.

Looking back, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 2's best friend is 1, friend 3's best friend is 2, friend 4's best friend is 5, and friend 5's best friend is 4.

So, in this case, inviting 1 and 2 would mean:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 3 are invited. But 3 isn't invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

- Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 1 are invited. Both are invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4 is invited, but best friend 5 is also invited, so friend 4 comes.

- Friend 5 is invited, and best friend 4 is also invited, so friend 5 comes.

So, friends 2,4,5 come. That's more than 2, but the invitation count is 4.

But in the explanation, it says that inviting 4 and 5 is sufficient, as they are each other's best friends, and hence both will come. So, only 2 invitations are needed.

So, in cycles of length 2, inviting both members of the cycle is sufficient to have both come.

In cycles of length greater than 2, inviting all members of the cycle minus one might not be sufficient.

Wait, in the second test case, p = [2,3,4,1], which forms a cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

In this case, inviting 1,2,3 would mean:

- Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited: yes.

- Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited: yes.

- Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited: no, since 4 isn't invited.

- Friend 4 comes if both 4 and 1 are invited: no, since 4 isn't invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

But according to the example, the output is 3, meaning that inviting 3 friends is necessary to have at least 2 come.

Is there a better way? If I invite 1,2,4:

- Friend 1: invited and best friend 2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and best friend 3 is invited? No, 3 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and best friend 1 is invited, so comes.

So, friends 1 and 4 come. That's only 2, but the problem requires at least 2 to come.

Wait, but in the example, it says that inviting [1,2,3,4] would make friends [1,2,4] come, but according to my reasoning, only friends 1 and 4 would come.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"The i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

So, friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

Note that p_i is the best friend of i, and p_i ≠ i.

So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited.

Now, p_i is the best friend of i, and p_{p_i} is the best friend of p_i.

Wait, in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]:

- friend 1: p_1 = 3

- friend 2: p_2 = 1

- friend 3: p_3 = 2

- friend 4: p_4 = 5

- friend 5: p_5 = 4

So, the best friend relationships are:

1 -> 3

3 -> 2

2 -> 1

4 -> 5

5 -> 4

So, friends 1,3,2 form a cycle of length 3.

Friends 4 and 5 form a cycle of length 2.

In this case, to have friends from the cycle of length 3 come, I need to invite both i and p_i for those friends.

But in the cycle of length 2, inviting both members is sufficient for both to come.

So, in the first test case, inviting 4 and 5 is sufficient to have both 4 and 5 come, which satisfies the condition of at least 2 friends coming.

In the second test case, p = [2,3,4,1], which is a cycle of length 4:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1

In this case, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite at least 3 friends.

For example, inviting 1,2,3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Alternatively, inviting 1,2,4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so comes.

So, friends 1 and 4 come.

In both cases, only 2 friends come, but I had to invite 3 friends.

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come by inviting only 2 friends?

Let's try inviting 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is less than 2. Not sufficient.

Inviting 1 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so comes.

Only friend 4 comes, which is less than 2.

Inviting 2 and 3:

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

Inviting 3 and 4:

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

So, it seems impossible to have at least 2 friends come by inviting only 2 friends in this scenario. Hence, the minimum number of invitations is 3.

In the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1], which is a cycle of length 2.

Inviting both 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=1 is invited, so comes.

So, both friends come, and the number of invitations is 2.

Hence, the output is 2.

From these observations, it seems that in cycles of length 2, inviting both members is sufficient to have both come, which satisfies the condition with minimal invitations.

In cycles of longer length, inviting all but one might not be sufficient, as seen in the second test case.

So, to generalize, I need to find the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come, given the best friend relationships.

Given that p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, the graph formed by friends and their best friends is a collection of disjoint cycles, each of length at least 2.

In each cycle of length k, to have m friends come, I need to invite at least m pairs of friends in the cycle, but considering the dependencies.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a graph where friends are nodes, and best friends are edges.

Then, the graph is a disjoint union of cycles, since each node has exactly one outgoing edge (to their best friend) and one incoming edge (from their best friend).

Given that, in a cycle of length k, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to select at least 2 pairs of friends such that each selected pair forms a coming friend.

But this seems a bit convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select a subset S of friends to invite.

Then, a friend i comes if and only if both i and p_i are in S.

So, the number of friends who come is the number of i such that i and p_i are both in S.

I need to choose S such that this number is at least 2, and |S| is minimized.

This seems like a set cover problem or some sort of selection problem in graphs.

Alternatively, since the graph is a disjoint union of cycles, I can handle each cycle separately and then sum up the invitations.

Wait, but the friends coming are across all cycles, not per cycle.

Wait, no, the friendships are disjoint, so the cycles are disjoint, meaning friends in one cycle don't have best friends in another cycle.

Hence, the problem can be broken down into each cycle independently.

Wait, but the condition is on the total number of friends who come, which is the sum over all cycles of the number of friends who come from each cycle.

So, I need the total number of friends who come from all cycles to be at least 2, while minimizing the total number of invitations across all cycles.

So, I can consider each cycle separately and decide how many invitations to send in each cycle to maximize the number of friends who come, in a way that the total number of friends who come from all cycles is at least 2.

But I need to minimize the total invitations, so perhaps I should focus on selecting the cycles from which to get the friends coming, in a way that minimizes the total invitations.

Let me consider the cost per friend coming in each cycle.

In a cycle of length 2, inviting both friends causes both to come, so 2 friends come at the cost of 2 invitations.

In a cycle of length k > 2, what is the minimal number of invitations to have m friends come?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of selecting which cycles to get friends from.

For instance, if I have multiple cycles, I can choose to have some friends come from one cycle and some from another.

But in the given test cases, there is only one cycle per test case.

Wait, in the first test case, there are two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

Wait, looking back, in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which is two cycles: 1-3-2 and 4-5.

In this case, to have at least 2 friends come, I can have:

- Both friends 4 and 5 come by inviting 4 and 5, which is 2 invitations.

- Or, from the cycle 1-3-2, invite 1 and 3 to have friend 1 come, and invite 2 to have friend 2 come, but that's 3 invitations to have 2 friends come.

So, the minimal is 2 invitations.

Hence, in cycles of length 2, inviting both members causes both to come, so 2 invitations for 2 friends.

In cycles of length >2, inviting k-1 members causes k-1 friends to come, but in the second test case, inviting 3 friends causes only 2 friends to come.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me think in terms of selecting pairs.

In a cycle of length k, the number of possible pairs where both members are invited is equal to the number of edges in the cycle where both endpoints are invited.

In other words, for a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least m friends come can be found by selecting subsets S of the cycle's nodes such that |{i ∈ S and p_i ∈ S}| ≥ m.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of matching.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting edges in the cycle graph where both endpoints are invited, and I need at least 2 such edges.

But I need to minimize the total number of invitations, which is the total number of nodes invited.

This sounds like a set cover problem, where each possible pair that can come covers one friend.

But set cover is NP-hard, and the constraints here are small (n ≤ 50), but t can be up to 5000, so I need an efficient per-test-case solution.

Let me consider the structure of the cycles.

In a cycle of length 2 (a 2-cycle):

- Inviting both members causes both to come, so 2 invitations for 2 friends.

- Inviting only one member causes neither to come.

Hence, for a 2-cycle, to have friends come, I need to invite both members.

In a cycle of length k > 2:

- Inviting k-1 members might not be sufficient, as seen in the second test case.

Wait, in the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 members causes only 2 friends to come.

Is there a general formula for the minimal number of invitations needed in a k-cycle to have at least m friends come?

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to consider that in any cycle, to have a friend come, both the friend and their best friend must be invited.

Given that, in a cycle of length k, the maximum number of friends who can come is floor(k/2), by selecting every other friend to invite, ensuring that no two selected friends are best friends.

Wait, no, in a cycle of length k, if I select floor(k/2) pairs of friends who are best friends, then floor(k/2) friends will come.

But in reality, in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least m friends come might require a different strategy.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider all possible pairs of friends who are best friends.

Inviting both in a pair causes both to come.

Hence, each such pair invited results in two friends coming.

So, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite at least one such pair.

Wait, but in the second test case, there are no such pairs, since it's a 4-cycle: 1-2-3-4-1.

In this cycle, no two friends are each other's best friends; instead, each friend's best friend is the next in the cycle.

Hence, in this case, inviting any two friends who are not best friends won't cause both to come, since each requires their best friend to also be invited.

Hence, in a 4-cycle, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite at least 3 friends.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a 2-cycle (4-5) and a 3-cycle (1-3-2).

In the 2-cycle, inviting both 4 and 5 causes both to come.

In the 3-cycle, inviting any two friends causes only one friend to come, as seen in the second test case.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is the sum of the invitations needed for each cycle, considering the minimal invitations required to have at least m friends come in total.

So, in the first test case, inviting 2 from the 2-cycle gives 2 friends coming, which satisfies the condition.

In the second test case, there's only one cycle of length 4, and inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come.

In the third test case, a 2-cycle, inviting both gives both coming.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 for the first and third test cases, and 3 for the second.

So, in general, for a graph consisting of disjoint cycles, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is the minimal number of invitations across all possible combinations of cycles.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let C1, C2, ..., Cm be the cycles in the graph.

For each cycle Ci of length ki, let fi be the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least mi friends come from Ci.

Then, the total minimal invitations is the minimal sum of fi over all partitions where sum of mi >= 2.

Wait, this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that to have at least 2 friends come, I can either have:

- Both friends from a 2-cycle, requiring 2 invitations.

- Or, in a cycle of length k > 2, invite enough friends to have at least 2 friends come.

But in cycles of length >2, it's not straightforward.

Looking back at the examples:

- In the first test case, with a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle, inviting 2 from the 2-cycle is sufficient.

- In the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends is necessary.

- In the third test case, with a 2-cycle, inviting 2 friends is sufficient.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is 2 for cycles of length 2, and ceil(k/2) for cycles of length k >2.

Wait, in the second test case, ceil(4/2)=2, but the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Hence, this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's k-1 for cycles of length k.

But in the first test case, for the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends wouldn't be sufficient, as seen in the second test case.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends causes only 1 friend to come.

Hence, to have at least 2 friends come from a 3-cycle, I need to invite all 3 friends.

Wait, but in a 3-cycle, if I invite 2 friends, only 1 comes, since the second friend's best friend isn't invited.

Wait, no, in a 3-cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If I invite 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Hence, only friend 1 comes.

If I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

Hence, only friend 3 comes.

If I invite 2 and 3:

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is not invited, so doesn't come.

Hence, only friend 2 comes.

So, to have at least 2 friends come from a 3-cycle, I need to invite all 3 friends.

In that case, friends 1 and 3 will come, since:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

Hence, all three come, but I had to invite all three.

So, for a 3-cycle, inviting all three is necessary to have at least 2 friends come.

Similarly, in a 4-cycle, as in the second test case, inviting 3 friends causes only 2 friends to come, as shown earlier.

Hence, for cycles of length k, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite at least k-1 friends.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, inviting all 3 causes all 3 to come.

But in the 4-cycle, inviting 3 causes 2 to come.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends causes k-1 friends to come.

But in the 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends causes only 2 friends to come.

Wait, no, in the 4-cycle:

- Inviting 1,2,3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

Hence, friends 1 and 2 come.

So, only 2 friends come, even though 3 are invited.

Hence, in this case, inviting k-1 friends doesn't necessarily cause k-1 friends to come.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite k friends.

But in the second test case, inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come, but inviting only 3 friends is sufficient, as per the example.

Wait, but according to the example, inviting 3 friends is sufficient, but inviting 2 isn't.

Hence, for cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is k.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, and inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come.

Is there a way to invite fewer than k friends and have at least 2 friends come?

In the second test case, inviting 3 friends is necessary, as inviting only 2 friends doesn't cause at least 2 friends to come.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is k.

But in the second test case, inviting 3 friends causes only 2 friends to come, but it's still sufficient because at least 2 friends come.

Hence, for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends can sometimes cause only 2 friends to come, as in the second test case.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends is sometimes sufficient, but in some cases, inviting k friends is necessary.

Wait, but in the second test case, inviting 3 friends is sufficient, even though the cycle length is 4.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends is sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

But in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends isn't sufficient, as seen earlier.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends causes only 1 friend to come, so inviting k-1 friends isn't sufficient.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k friends is necessary to have at least 2 friends come.

But in the second test case, with k=4, inviting 3 friends is sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends is sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

But in the 3-cycle, inviting k-1=2 friends isn't sufficient.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come.

In the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends causes only 1 friend to come.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends causes floor((k-1)/2) friends to come.

But in the second test case, floor(3/2)=1, but in reality, inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come.

Hence, this is not accurate.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I have multiple cycles.

To minimize the total number of invitations, I should prioritize inviting from cycles where the ratio of friends coming per invitation is highest.

In cycles of length 2, inviting 2 friends causes 2 friends to come, so 1 friend per invitation.

In cycles of length k >=3, inviting k friends causes k friends to come, so 1 friend per invitation.

But in the second test case, inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come in a 4-cycle, which is less than 1 friend per invitation.

Hence, perhaps cycles of length 2 are more efficient in terms of friends per invitation.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal number needed to have at least 2 friends come, considering the most efficient cycles first.

Hence, if there are any 2-cycles present, inviting 2 friends from a 2-cycle is sufficient to have 2 friends come, which is better than inviting from longer cycles.

In the first test case, there is a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle.

Hence, inviting 2 from the 2-cycle is sufficient.

In the second test case, there is only a 4-cycle, so inviting 3 friends is necessary.

In the third test case, there is only a 2-cycle, so inviting 2 friends is sufficient.

Hence, the general approach is:

- If there are any 2-cycles present, invite 2 friends from any one 2-cycle to have 2 friends come.

- If there are no 2-cycles, or if inviting from 2-cycles doesn't provide enough friends coming, then invite from larger cycles accordingly.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 for test cases that have at least one 2-cycle, and for test cases with only cycles of length >=3, the minimal number is the size of the smallest cycle minus one, but in the second test case, it's 3.

Wait, but in the second test case, the minimal is 3, which is k-1 for k=4.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length >=3, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is k-1.

But in the 3-cycle, inviting k-1=2 friends causes only 1 friend to come, which isn't sufficient.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length >=3, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is k.

But in the second test case, inviting k-1=3 friends causes 2 friends to come, which is sufficient.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length >=3, inviting k-1 friends is sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- If there exists a 2-cycle, then 2.

- Else, for cycles of length >=3, it's k-1 for each cycle.

But in the second test case, there's only one cycle of length 4, so minimal invitations are 3.

Hence, the general minimal number of invitations is:

- If there is at least one 2-cycle, then 2.

- Else, for each cycle of length k >=3, invite k-1 friends.

- Sum over all cycles the minimal invitations needed, ensuring that at least 2 friends come in total.

But in the second test case, there's only one cycle of length 4, so inviting 3 friends is sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is the minimum among:

- 2, if there is at least one 2-cycle.

- Else, the minimal k-1 over all cycles, but ensuring that the total number of friends coming is at least 2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting the smallest subset of cycles to get at least 2 friends coming.

So, select the cycles from which to get friends coming, choosing the minimal number of invitations per cycle, and sum them up to meet the total of at least 2 friends coming.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

Given the time constraints (t <=5000 and n <=50), I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Hence, perhaps I can detect if there are any 2-cycles in the graph.

If there is at least one 2-cycle, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

Else, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal k-1 over all cycles, but ensuring that at least 2 friends come.

But in the second test case, with a single 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends causes 2 friends to come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Hence, the general solution is:

- If there exists at least one 2-cycle, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- Else, find the minimal k-1 over all cycles, where k is the length of the cycle, and sum them up in a way to have at least 2 friends come.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to note that in a cycle of length k, to have at least 2 friends come, I need to invite at least ceil(2 * (k / (k-1))).

But this seems too convoluted.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to observe that:

- In a 2-cycle, inviting both causes both to come.

- In a cycle of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends causes at least 2 friends to come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there is at least one 2-cycle.

- Else, for each cycle, invite k-1 friends, and sum them up to ensure at least 2 friends come.

But in practice, for the second test case, it's 3.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there is at least one 2-cycle.

- Else, the minimal k-1 over all cycles, where k is the length of the cycle.

But in the second test case, k=4, so k-1=3.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Hence, the general formula is:

- If there exists at least one 2-cycle, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- Else, it's the minimal k-1 over all cycles, where k is the length of the cycle.

But in the second test case, there's only one cycle of length 4, so it's 3.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there is at least one 2-cycle.

- Else, the minimal k-1 over all cycles.

But in the third test case, with a 2-cycle, it's 2.

In the first test case, with a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle, it's 2.

In the second test case, with only a 4-cycle, it's 3.

Hence, this seems to hold.

Hence, the solution is:

- Detect if there are any 2-cycles in the graph.

- If yes, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- Else, find the minimal k-1 over all cycles, where k is the length of the cycle.

- Since we need at least 2 friends to come, and in cycles of length k >=3, inviting k-1 friends causes at least 2 friends to come, as in the second test case.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there is at least one 2-cycle.

- Else, the minimal k-1 over all cycles.

Given that, I can implement this logic.

But in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

x = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] -1] == l[i] -1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

This code reads t test cases, then for each test case, reads n and p, then iterates through the friends and checks if p[p[i]] == i-1.

Wait, l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1.

Wait, l is the list p.

So, l[l[i]-1] is p[p_i], and l[i]-1 is i-1.

So, it's checking if p[p_i] == i-1.

But friend indices start from 1, so i ranges from 1 to n.

Hence, l[l[i]-1] == i-1.

But p_i is the best friend of i, and p_{p_i} is the best friend of p_i.

In the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]:

- For i=1, p_1=3, p_3=2, which is not equal to 1-1=0.

- For i=2, p_2=1, p_1=3, which is not equal to 2-1=1.

- For i=3, p_3=2, p_2=1, which is not equal to 3-1=2.

- For i=4, p_4=5, p_5=4, which equals 4-1=3.

Wait, p_5=4, p_4=5, so p[p_4]=5, which is not equal to 4-1=3.

Wait, p[p_4]=p_5=4, which is equal to 4.

But 4-1=3.

Hence, p[p_4]=4 != 3.

Hence, the condition l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1 is not met for any i in the first test case.

Hence, it would print 3 for the first test case, which is incorrect, as the correct answer is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the example, the first test case outputs 2.

But according to the code, it would print 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] -1] == l[i] -1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

In the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, l = [3,1,2,5,4]

for i in range(0,5):

i=0:

l[l[0]-1] = l[2-1]=l[1]=1

l[i]-1 = l[0]-1=3-1=2

So, 1 != 2, condition not met.

i=1:

l[l[1]-1] = l[1-1]=l[0]=3

l[i]-1 = l[1]-1=1-1=0

3 != 0, condition not met.

i=2:

l[l[2]-1] = l[2-1]=l[1]=1

l[i]-1 = l[2]-1=2-1=1

1 ==1, condition met.

Hence, flag=True, print 2, break.

But according to the example, the first test case should print 2, which matches the code's output.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should print 3, but actually, in the first test case, there is a 2-cycle (4-5), so it should print 2, which the code correctly does.

Wait, but in the second test case, p=[2,3,4,1], which is a 4-cycle:

l = [2,3,4,1]

for i in range(0,4):

i=0:

l[l[0]-1] = l[1-1]=l[0]=2

l[i]-1 = l[0]-1=2-1=1

2 !=1, condition not met.

i=1:

l[l[1]-1] = l[3-1]=l[2]=4

l[i]-1 = l[1]-1=3-1=2

4 !=2, condition not met.

i=2:

l[l[2]-1] = l[4-1]=l[3]=1

l[i]-1 = l[2]-1=4-1=3

1 !=3, condition not met.

i=3:

l[l[3]-1] = l[1-1]=l[0]=2

l[i]-1 = l[3]-1=1-1=0

2 !=0, condition not met.

Hence, no condition met, print 3, which matches the example.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

But is this logic correct in general?

The condition l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1 checks if p[p_i] == i-1.

But friend indices start from 1, so i-1 is the friend index adjusted to 0-based indexing.

Wait, but p_i is the best friend of i, and p_{p_i} is the best friend of p_i.

If p_{p_i} == i, then p is a involution, meaning p(p_i)=i.

But in this problem, since p is a derangement with p_i !=i and all p_i distinct, p is a permutation consisting of cycles of length >=2.

Hence, p is an involution if and only if all cycles are of length 2.

In that case, p(p_i)=i for all i.

But in the general case, p may have cycles of length >2.

Hence, checking if p(p_i)==i-1 (0-based) isn't directly related to detecting 2-cycles.

Wait, in 2-cycles, p(p_i)=i, which in 0-based indexing is p(p_i)=i.

But in the code, it's checking p(p_i)==i-1.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, p(p_i)=i.

In 0-based indexing, l[l[i]-1]==i.

But in the code, it's l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Looking back, p_i is the best friend of i, and p_{p_i}=j, where j is the best friend of p_i.

In a 2-cycle, p(p_i)=i.

In a cycle of length >2, p(p_i)!=i.

Hence, to detect 2-cycles, we should check if p(p_i)==i.

In 0-based indexing, l[l[i]-1]==i+1.

But in the code, it's l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1, which is p(p_i)==i-1.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in indexing.

Wait, in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

For i=1, p_1=3, p_3=2, which is not equal to 1-1=0.

For i=2, p_2=1, p_1=3, which is not equal to 2-1=1.

For i=3, p_3=2, p_2=1, which is equal to 3-1=2.

Wait, p_2=1, which is not equal to 2.

Wait, no, in 0-based indexing, l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1.

For i=2 (1-based, index 1 in 0-based list):

l[l[1]-1] = l[1-1]=l[0]=3

l[1]-1=1-1=0

So, 3 ==0? No.

Wait, perhaps it's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the code is intended to detect 2-cycles.

In a 2-cycle, p(p_i)=i.

Hence, in 0-based indexing, l[l[i]-1]-1 == i-1.

Wait, l[l[i]-1]==i.

In the code, it's l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Looking back, perhaps it should be l[l[i]-1]==i.

In 0-based indexing, p(p_i)==i+1.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Perhaps it's better to stick with 1-based indexing.

In 1-based indexing, for a 2-cycle, p(p_i)=i.

Hence, p(p_i)==i.

Hence, in code, l[l[i-1]-1]==i.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, for i from 1 to n:

if p(p_i)==i, then it's part of a 2-cycle.

Hence, in 0-based indexing, for i from 0 to n-1:

if l[l[i]-1]-1 == i:

But l[l[i]-1] is p(p_i), and p(p_i)==i in 1-based.

Hence, l[l[i]-1]==i+1.

Hence, the condition should be l[l[i]-1]==i+1.

But in the code, it's l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Hence, the code is checking for l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1, which isn't equivalent to detecting 2-cycles.

Wait, perhaps it's intended to check for l[l[i]-1]==i.

In that case, it would be p(p_i)==i, which is correct for 2-cycles.

But in the code, it's l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1.

Hence, it's a mistake.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But in the first test case, it correctly identifies the 2-cycle and prints 2.

Wait, in the first test case, for i=3, l[l[3]-1]==l[2]==2, and l[3]-1=5-1=4.

So, 2==4? No.

Wait, perhaps there's some luck in the first test case.

Wait, in the first test case, for i=3, l[l[3]-1]=l[5-1]=l[4]=4, and l[3]-1=5-1=4.

Hence, 4==4, which is true, so it prints 2.

But this corresponds to i=4, p_4=5, p_5=4, which is a 2-cycle.

Hence, perhaps the condition l[l[i]-1]==l[i]-1 is coincidentally working for this test case.

But in general, it's incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Hence, the Correctness is False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the
