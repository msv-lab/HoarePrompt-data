Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n x n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, each cell represented by its coordinates (x, y), where x and y are between 1 and n inclusive.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these n cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. It's essentially the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between two points. So, in a grid, it's the number of steps you'd take if you can only move horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.

Now, I need to choose n cells such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between all pairs of these cells is as large as possible. That means I want as many different distances as possible.

Let me think about small values of n to get a feel for the problem.

For n = 2:

The grid is 2x2, so cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

I need to choose 2 cells. Let's see the possible pairs and their distances:

- (1,1) and (1,2): distance = |1-1| + |2-1| = 1

- (1,1) and (2,1): distance = |2-1| + |1-1| = 1

- (1,1) and (2,2): distance = |2-1| + |2-1| = 2

- (1,2) and (2,1): distance = |2-1| + |1-2| = 2

- (1,2) and (2,2): distance = |2-1| + |2-2| = 1

- (2,1) and (2,2): distance = |2-2| + |2-1| = 1

So, if I choose (1,1) and (1,2), the distances are 1 and 2.

Wait, but in this case, there's only one distance between the pair, which is 1. Wait, no, actually, between two cells, there's only one distance. So for n=2, the maximum number of distinct distances is 2, which are 0 and 1, but 0 would be the distance from a cell to itself, which isn't considered since we're looking at pairs of distinct cells.

Wait, in the example, for n=2, they have cells (1,1) and (1,2), which have a distance of 1. But the note mentions that H = {0,1}, but 0 would be the distance from a cell to itself, which isn't considered in pairs of distinct cells. So maybe there's some confusion here.

Looking back at the problem statement: "Let H be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells." And in the first example, for n=2, they have H = {0,1}, but I think that's a mistake because for two distinct cells, the distance should only be 1, not 0.

Wait, perhaps they are considering the distance from a cell to itself as well, which is 0. But typically, in sets of distances between pairs, we consider only distinct pairs.

I need to clarify this. In the problem statement, it says "between any pair of cells", and in the example, they have H = {0,1}. Maybe they are including the distance from each cell to itself.

If that's the case, then for n cells, H would include 0 and various positive distances.

But in the example for n=2, they have H = {0,1}, and they say the size is 2, and that it's the maximum possible.

Wait, but if we choose two distinct cells, the distance is 1, and if we include the distance from each cell to itself, which is 0, then H = {0,1}.

So, perhaps the problem does consider the distance from each cell to itself, which is 0, in addition to the distances between distinct cells.

In that case, for n cells, H will always include 0, and we need to maximize the number of distinct positive distances in addition to 0.

So, the task is to maximize the size of H, which includes 0 and as many different positive Manhattan distances as possible among the chosen n cells.

Given that, for n=2, H has 2 elements: 0 and 1.

For n=3, in the example, they have H = {0,1,2,3}, which has size 4.

For n=4, presumably, the example provides a certain arrangement.

I need to find a way to choose n cells such that the number of distinct distances is maximized.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for i in range(0, int(input())):

n = int(input())

print(1, 1)

print(1, 2)

for i in range(3, n + 1):

print(i, i)

So, for each test case, it reads n, and then outputs n cells:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

- ...

- (n,n)

Wait, but the loop starts from 3 to n, printing (i,i).

So, for n=2:

- It would print (1,1) and (1,2), which matches the first example.

For n=3:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

Which matches the second example.

For n=4:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

Which seems to match the third example.

And so on.

So, the pattern is:

- Always choose (1,1) and (1,2)

- Then, for the remaining cells, choose (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

I need to verify if this choice maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let me analyze this choice for n=3.

Cells chosen: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Let's compute all pairwise distances:

- (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |2-1| = 1

- (1,1) and (3,3): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,2) and (3,3): |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

So, H = {0,1,3,4}

Wait, but in the example for n=3, they have H = {0,1,2,3}.

Wait, in their example, they chose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Let's check the distances for their choice:

- (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2

- (2,1) and (3,1): |3-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- (2,3) and (3,1): |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

So, H = {0,1,2,3}

In my choice, (1,1), (1,2), (3,3):

H = {0,1,3,4}

Which also has 4 elements, matching the example's H size.

So, both choices achieve the same H size for n=3.

But in the problem statement, they chose different cells, but achieved the same H size.

So, multiple solutions are possible, as long as H is maximized.

Now, for n=4, according to the program, cells are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Let's compute H:

- (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- (1,1) and (4,4): 6

- (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- (1,2) and (4,4): 5

- (3,3) and (4,4): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Is this the maximum possible for n=4?

I need to verify if there's a better arrangement that gives more distinct distances.

Suppose I choose (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,2)-(2,1): 2

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (2,1)-(4,4): 5

H = {0,1,2,5,6}, size 5.

Which is less than the previous arrangement's size of 7.

So, the program's choice seems better.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (2,2)-(3,3): 2

- (2,2)-(4,4): 4

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

H = {0,2,4,6}, size 4.

Which is worse than the program's arrangement.

So, the program's choice seems better.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,3): 3

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,2)-(2,3): 2

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (2,3)-(4,4): 3

H = {0,1,2,3,5,6}, size 6.

Still less than the program's arrangement's 7.

So, the program's arrangement seems to maximize H for n=4.

For n=5, according to the program, cells are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 7

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

- (3,3)-(5,5): 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): 2

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, size 8.

In the example for n=5, they have a different arrangement, but the H size should be the same or less.

Looking at their arrangement: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(1,4): 3

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,3)-(1,4): 1

- (1,3)-(2,1): 3

- (1,3)-(5,5): 6

- (1,4)-(2,1): 4

- (1,4)-(5,5): 5

- (2,1)-(5,5): 7

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

Wait, that's larger than my previous arrangement's H size of 8.

So, for n=5, their arrangement achieves H size 9, while my program's arrangement achieves H size 8.

Does that mean the program is incorrect for n=5?

Wait, but in the program's arrangement for n=5, H has size 8, whereas the example achieves 9.

So, perhaps the program's arrangement isn't maximizing H for n=5.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, they have H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

But in the program's arrangement for n=5, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, size 8.

So, the program's arrangement misses distances 6 and has an extra 4 and 8.

Wait, no, in my earlier calculation for the program's arrangement for n=5, H has size 8, but the example achieves 9.

Therefore, the program's arrangement isn't optimal for n=5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the program's arrangement for n=5.

Let me recalculate:

Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Compute all pairwise distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): |0| + |1| = 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): |2| + |2| = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): |3| + |3| = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): |4| + |4| = 8

- (1,2)-(3,3): |2| + |1| = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |3| + |2| = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): |4| + |3| = 7

- (3,3)-(4,4): |1| + |1| = 2

- (3,3)-(5,5): |2| + |2| = 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): |1| + |1| = 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

Wait a minute, I must have missed (3,3)-(5,5): |2| + |2| = 4, which is already included.

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

Same as the example.

So, in this case, the program's arrangement also achieves H size 9.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, for n=5, the program's arrangement is also optimal.

Similarly, for n=6, the program would choose (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Compute pairwise distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 10

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 9

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

- (3,3)-(5,5): 4

- (3,3)-(6,6): 6

- (4,4)-(5,5): 2

- (4,4)-(6,6): 4

- (5,5)-(6,6): 2

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11.

In the example for n=6, they have a different arrangement, but the H size should be the same or less.

Looking at their arrangement: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

Let's compute distances:

- (1,4)-(1,5): 1

- (1,4)-(1,6): 2

- (1,4)-(5,2): 5

- (1,4)-(5,5): 5

- (1,4)-(6,1): 6

- (1,5)-(1,6): 1

- (1,5)-(5,2): 4

- (1,5)-(5,5): 4

- (1,5)-(6,1): 5

- (1,6)-(5,2): 3

- (1,6)-(5,5): 3

- (1,6)-(6,1): 4

- (5,2)-(5,5): 3

- (5,2)-(6,1): 2

- (5,5)-(6,1): 5

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Which is less than the program's arrangement's H size of 11.

So, the program's arrangement is better for n=6.

Therefore, for n=2 to n=6, the program's arrangement seems to maximize H.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n.

The program's strategy is:

- Choose (1,1) and (1,2)

- Then, for i from 3 to n, choose (i,i)

So, cells are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), ..., (n,n)

I need to see if this strategy maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for any n.

Let me think about the distances in this arrangement.

First, distances between (1,1) and other cells:

- To (1,2): 1

- To (i,i) for i >=3: |i-1| + |i-1| = 2(i-1)

So, for i=3: 4, i=4:6, ..., i=n:2(n-1)

So, distances from (1,1) are 1 and then 4,6,...,2(n-1)

Next, distances between (1,2) and other cells:

- To (1,1): 1 (already counted)

- To (i,i): |i-1| + |i-2| = (i-1) + |i-2|

Wait, for i >=3, i-1 >=2, i-2 >=1

So, |i-1| + |i-2| = (i-1) + (i-2) = 2i - 3

So, distances are 2i - 3 for i from 3 to n: 3,5,7,... up to 2n-3

Then, distances between (i,i) and (j,j) for i != j:

|j - i| + |j - i| = 2|j - i|

So, distances are 2,4,6,...,2(n-1)

Now, let's compile all possible distances:

- From (1,1) to others: 1, 4,6,...,2(n-1)

- From (1,2) to others: 3,5,7,...,2n-3

- Between (i,i) and (j,j): 2,4,6,...,2(n-1)

Also, don't forget the zero distances from each cell to itself.

So, overall H contains:

- 0

- 1

- 2,4,6,...,2(n-1)

- 3,5,7,...,2n-3

Now, let's see what numbers are included in H.

First, all even numbers from 0 up to 2(n-1), stepping by 2.

Second, all odd numbers from 1 up to 2n-3, stepping by 2.

Wait, but 2n-3 is odd only if n is integer greater than or equal to 2.

Let me see for n=2:

H = {0,1}

For n=3:

H = {0,1,2,3,4}

Wait, but earlier calculation for n=3 with the program's arrangement gave H = {0,1,3,4}

Wait, where is 2 coming from?

Wait, in n=3:

- From (1,1) to (3,3): 4

- From (1,2) to (3,3): 2*3 - 3 = 3

- Between (3,3) and (1,1): 4 (already counted)

- Between (1,1) and (1,2):1

- Between (1,2) and (3,3):3 (already counted)

So, H = {0,1,3,4}

Wait, but earlier I thought it should include 2, but where does 2 come from?

Wait, perhaps I missed some distances.

Wait, for n=3, cells are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,2)-(3,3): |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 +1 = 3

So, H = {0,1,3,4}

So, in this arrangement, H does not include 2.

But earlier, for n=4, H included 2.

Wait, for n=4, cells are (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,2)-(3,3): |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 +1 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |4-1| + |4-2| = 3 +2 = 5

- (3,3)-(4,4): |4-3| + |4-3| =1 +1=2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

So, for n=4, H includes 2.

Similarly, for n=5:

- (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,2)-(3,3): |3-1| + |3-2| =2 +1=3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |4-1| + |4-2| =3 +2=5

- (1,2)-(5,5): |5-1| + |5-2| =4 +3=7

- (3,3)-(4,4): |4-3| + |4-3| =1 +1=2

- (3,3)-(5,5): |5-3| + |5-3| =2 +2=4

- (4,4)-(5,5): |5-4| + |5-4| =1 +1=2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but now it's 8.

Wait, perhaps I need to recount.

Wait, in n=5 example, they have H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

But in this arrangement, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, missing 6.

So, the program's arrangement for n=5 misses 6.

But in the example, they choose (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Let's compute H for that:

- (1,1)-(1,3):2

- (1,1)-(1,4):3

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,3)-(1,4):1

- (1,3)-(2,1): |2-1| + |1-3| =1 +2=3

- (1,3)-(5,5): |5-1| + |5-3| =4 +2=6

- (1,4)-(2,1): |2-1| + |1-4| =1 +3=4

- (1,4)-(5,5): |5-1| + |5-4| =4 +1=5

- (2,1)-(5,5): |5-2| + |5-1| =3 +4=7

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

So, in this arrangement, H includes 6, which is missing in the program's arrangement.

Therefore, for n=5, the program's arrangement isn't optimal.

Similarly, for n=4, H size is 7, which seems optimal.

For n=3, H size is 4, which might not be optimal.

Wait, but earlier I saw that for n=4, H size can be 7, and for n=5, it can be 9.

Is there a general formula for the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances?

I need to find a better arrangement that includes more distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the program's arrangement is suboptimal for some n.

I need to find a better strategy.

An alternative strategy could be to place cells along the diagonal and one row.

Wait, the program's arrangement is (1,1), (1,2), then (3,3), (4,4), ..., (n,n)

Perhaps choosing all cells on the diagonal and one row would be better.

Wait, but in n=5, their arrangement includes cells not on the diagonal.

Maybe a better arrangement is to choose cells (1,1), (2,2), ..., (n,n), which are all on the diagonal.

In that case, distances between (i,i) and (j,j) are 2|j - i| for i != j.

Also, distances between (i,i) and (j,j) are 2|j - i|.

So, H would be {0,2,4,6,...,2(n-1)}

Which are only even numbers.

This would not be optimal, as we can include odd numbers as well.

Therefore, including some cells not on the diagonal can introduce odd distances.

That's why the program includes (1,1) and (1,2), to get odd distances.

But as seen in n=5, it still might not be optimal.

Perhaps a better strategy is to choose cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), then (4,4), (5,5), etc.

Wait, for n=3, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,2)-(2,1):2

H = {0,1,2}

Which is smaller than the example's H size of 4.

So, maybe not.

Wait, for n=3, the example chooses (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- (2,1)-(2,3):2

- (2,1)-(3,1):1

- (2,3)-(3,1):3

H = {0,1,2,3}

Size 4.

Better than choosing all in row 1.

So, perhaps choosing cells in a way that they are spread out both row-wise and column-wise can maximize the distances.

Alternatively, perhaps placing cells in a way that minimizes overlapping distances.

Wait, but it's maximizing distinct distances.

I need to maximize the number of unique distances, not minimize overlapping.

Wait, perhaps placing cells in a way that the differences in x and y coordinates are diverse.

Wait, maybe choosing cells where x and y are as different as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing cells where x + y is diverse.

Wait, but the Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|, which is equivalent to L1 distance.

I need to maximize the number of unique sums of absolute differences in x and y.

Perhaps choosing cells where x and y are as spread out as possible.

Wait, perhaps choosing cells along the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.

Wait, anti-diagonal would be (i, n-i+1).

Let me try for n=3:

Choose (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,3): |2-1| + |3-1| =1 +2=3

- (1,1)-(3,2): |3-1| + |2-1| =2 +1=3

- (2,3)-(3,2): |3-2| + |2-3| =1 +1=2

H = {0,2,3}

Size 3.

Not better than the example's H size of 4.

So, perhaps not optimal.

Wait, maybe choosing (1,1), (2,2), (3,1)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2):2

- (1,1)-(3,1):2

- (2,2)-(3,1):3

H = {0,2,3}

Size 3.

Still not better.

Wait, perhaps choosing (1,1), (2,1), (3,2)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,1)-(3,2):3

- (2,1)-(3,2):2

H = {0,1,2,3}

Size 4.

Same as the example.

So, in this arrangement, H size is 4.

Similarly, the program's arrangement for n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

H = {0,1,3,4}

Size 4.

Same as the example.

So, for n=3, both arrangements achieve H size 4.

For n=4, the program's arrangement achieves H size 7, which seems optimal.

For n=5, the program's arrangement achieves H size 8, while the example achieves 9.

So, perhaps the program's arrangement isn't always optimal.

Is there a way to modify the program's arrangement to include more distances?

Perhaps by choosing an additional cell not on the diagonal.

Wait, for n=5, their arrangement includes (5,5), (2,1), (1,4), (1,3), (1,1)

Which achieves H size 9.

While the program's arrangement includes (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), achieving H size 8.

So, perhaps including cells in different rows and columns can introduce more distances.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing cells in a way that x and y coordinates are more diverse.

Wait, perhaps choosing cells where x coordinates are minimized and y coordinates are maximized.

Wait, I need a better strategy.

Let me think about the maximum possible H size for a given n.

The maximum possible Manhattan distance in an n x n grid is 2(n-1), achieved between corners like (1,1) and (n,n).

The possible distances range from 0 up to 2(n-1), with some missing values depending on the arrangement.

For example, for n=3, possible distances are 0,1,2,3,4.

But in the arrangement, H can be up to size 4 or 5.

Wait, for n=3, the maximum H size is 4, as seen in the example.

Wait, but in n=3, the example achieves H size 4, which includes {0,1,2,3}.

But according to the grid, the maximum possible distinct distances are 0,1,2,3,4.

But in their arrangement, they have {0,1,2,3}.

Wait, perhaps 4 cannot be achieved in their arrangement.

Wait, in n=3, the distance between (1,1) and (3,3) is 4.

But in their arrangement of (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), the maximum distance is 3.

Wait, (2,1)-(3,3): |3-2| + |3-1| =1 +2=3

So, in their arrangement, the maximum distance is 3.

But in the program's arrangement, (1,1)-(3,3):4

So, the program's arrangement includes distance 4.

But in the example, they have H = {0,1,2,3}, missing 4.

Wait, perhaps their arrangement misses 4, but includes other distances.

Wait, in their arrangement for n=3, H = {0,1,2,3}

In the program's arrangement for n=3, H = {0,1,3,4}

So, both arrangements have H size 4, but with different distances.

So, for n=3, both are optimal.

Similarly, for n=4, H size is 7, which seems optimal.

For n=5, the example achieves H size 9, while the program's arrangement achieves H size 8.

So, perhaps for n=5, the program's arrangement isn't optimal.

Is there a way to modify the program's arrangement to include more distances?

Perhaps by choosing one cell not on the diagonal.

Wait, for n=5, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8}

Missing 6.

In the example's arrangement, they have (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Which includes 6.

So, perhaps by choosing an additional cell not on the diagonal, we can include more distances.

Therefore, the program's arrangement might not be optimal for n=5 and above.

Hence, the program isn't correct for all n.

Wait, but for n=2,3,4, it seems to work.

For n=5, it's missing one distance.

Similarly, for n=6, the program's arrangement achieves H size 11, which might be optimal.

Wait, in n=6, their arrangement has H size 7, but the program's arrangement achieves H size 11.

So, perhaps for n=6, the program's arrangement is better.

Wait, but in n=5, the example achieves H size 9, while the program achieves H size 8.

So, perhaps the program's arrangement isn't always optimal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
