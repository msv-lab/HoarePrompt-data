Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This process repeats for all commands in the string.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input starts with the number of test cases, t. For each test case, there are three lines: the first line has two integers, n and m, where n is the length of the array and m is the modulus. The second line contains n integers, which is the array a. The third line is a string s of length n consisting of 'L's and 'R's, which are the commands.

The output should be n integers for each test case, where each integer is the product of the current array modulo m, printed in order for each command.

Looking at the example, it seems that the product is calculated before any removals, and then the removal happens, updating the array for the next step.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient because n can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. So, I need an approach that is linear per test case.

My initial thought is to precompute the product of the entire array, then, based on the commands, divide the product by the element to be removed and update the product accordingly.

However, there's a problem with this approach: if m is not a prime number, division modulo m is not straightforward because not all elements have multiplicative inverses modulo m unless m is prime. But in this problem, m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, not necessarily prime.

Wait, actually, m can be any integer from 1 to 10^4, so it might not be prime. That complicates things because I can't always compute the modular inverse for division.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can compute the product modulo m directly at each step, but that would be inefficient if done naively, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5.

Another idea is to use prefix and suffix products modulo m. For example, for each position i, compute the product of the first i elements and the product of the last i elements, both modulo m. Then, depending on the command, I can use these prefix or suffix products to compute the current product after removals.

Wait, but I need to consider the sequence of removals specified by the string s. Since s dictates whether to remove from the left or the right at each step, the remaining array changes accordingly.

This seems tricky because the removals are interleaved and depend on the commands.

Let me consider the example to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

First, compute the product: 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 % 6 = 0. So, the first output is 0.

Then, s[0] = 'L', so remove the leftmost element, a[0] = 3. The array becomes [1, 4, 2].

Product: 1*4*2 = 8, 8 % 6 = 2. So, the second output is 2.

Next, s[1] = 'R', so remove the rightmost element, a[2] = 2. The array becomes [1, 4].

Product: 1*4 = 4, 4 % 6 = 4. So, the third output is 4.

Then, s[2] = 'R', remove the rightmost element, a[1] = 4. The array becomes [1].

Product: 1 % 6 = 1. So, the fourth output is 1.

Finally, s[3] = 'L', remove the leftmost element, a[0] = 1. The array is empty.

So, the outputs are: 0 2 4 1

Another test case:

n = 5, m = 1

a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

s = "LLLLL"

Product initially: 1*1*1*1*1 = 1, 1 % 1 = 0

Then, remove leftmost 1, array [1,1,1,1]

Product: 1*1*1*1 = 1, 1 % 1 = 0

And so on, all outputs are 0.

So, output: 0 0 0 0 0

Third test case:

n = 6, m = 8

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

s = "RLLLRR"

Compute initial product:1*2*3*4*5*6=720, 720 % 8 = 0

s[0] = 'R', remove rightmost 6, array [1,2,3,4,5]

Product:1*2*3*4*5=120, 120 % 8 = 0

s[1] = 'L', remove leftmost 1, array [2,3,4,5]

Product:2*3*4*5=120, 120 % 8 = 0

s[2] = 'L', remove leftmost 2, array [3,4,5]

Product:3*4*5=60, 60 % 8 = 4

s[3] = 'L', remove leftmost 3, array [4,5]

Product:4*5=20, 20 % 8 = 4

s[4] = 'R', remove rightmost 5, array [4]

Product:4 % 8 = 4

s[5] = 'R', remove rightmost 4, array empty

Outputs:0 0 0 4 4 4

Last test case:

n = 1, m = 10000

a = [10000]

s = "R"

Product:10000 % 10000 = 0

Remove rightmost element, array empty

Output:0

Okay, so from these examples, it seems that the initial product is taken modulo m, and then at each step, after removing an element, the new product is taken modulo m.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a way to compute the product after each removal without recomputing the entire product each time.

Since removals are either from the left or the right, I can keep track of the current product and update it by dividing by the removed element.

But, as I thought earlier, division modulo m is tricky if m is not prime.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements and then, for each removal, divide the current product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But, again, division modulo m requires that the divisor has an inverse modulo m, which is only possible if the divisor and m are coprime.

In this problem, m can be any integer up to 10^4, and the elements of the array can be from 1 to 10^4, so some elements might not be coprime with m.

This seems problematic.

Let me think of another approach.

Maybe I can keep track of the product modulo m at each step, considering the removals.

But if I remove elements from either end, the remaining array changes, and it's not straightforward to update the product efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use prefix and suffix products modulo m.

Let me define:

- prefix[i]: product of the first i elements modulo m

- suffix[i]: product of the last i elements modulo m

Then, for each step, depending on whether I remove from the left or the right, I can determine the current product based on these prefix and suffix products.

But I need to consider the sequence of removals specified by the string s.

This seems complicated because the removals are specified in a particular order, and the remaining array changes after each removal.

Maybe I need to simulate the process step by step, keeping track of the current product and updating it after each removal.

But with n up to 2*10^5 per test case and t up to 10^4, with the total sum of n across all test cases being up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Let me consider computing the product of the entire array modulo m, and then, for each removal, divide the current product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But again, division modulo m is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements modulo m, and then, for each removal, multiply by the modular inverse of the removed element, if it exists.

But, as I said earlier, the modular inverse only exists if the element and m are coprime, which may not be the case here.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to find a way to compute (current product) / (removed element) modulo m without directly computing the modular inverse.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining elements directly, without dividing.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, based on the removals, keep track of the product of the removed elements, and then compute the current product as (total product) / (product of removed elements) modulo m.

But again, division is problematic.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can iterate through the commands and keep track of the current product by multiplying and dividing elements as needed.

But I need to ensure that I handle the modulo operation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can keep the product modulo m at each step, multiplying by new elements and dividing by removed elements, but handle the division carefully.

But, as before, division modulo m requires the existence of inverses, which may not be the case.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider another approach.

What if I precompute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, based on the removals, adjust the product accordingly.

But I still need to handle the division by the removed element.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, remove an element and compute the product of the remaining elements.

But this seems inefficient for large n.

Looking back at the problem, I notice that m can be as small as 1, and as large as 10^4, but in any case, m is small compared to n, which can be up to 2*10^5.

Wait, m is up to 10^4, which is manageable.

But n is up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t is up to 10^4, but with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, per test case, n can be up to 2*10^5, but across all test cases, the total sum of n is up to 2*10^5.

Wait, no, the problem says "the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test does not exceed 2*10^5."

So, overall, across all test cases, n is up to 2*10^5, which means per test case, n can be up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4, it's likely that most test cases have small n.

But I need to handle the worst case, where t is 10^4 and each n is up to 2*10^5, but with the sum over all n being up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me consider using prefix and suffix products modulo m.

Compute prefix[i] = (a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i-1]) % m

Compute suffix[i] = (a[n-i] * ... * a[n-1]) % m

Then, at any point, if I have removed some elements from the left and some from the right, the remaining product would be prefix[l] * suffix[r], where l is the number of left removals and r is the number of right removals.

Wait, but this might not be accurate because when I remove elements, the remaining array changes, and the prefix and suffix products need to be adjusted accordingly.

Moreover, multiplication modulo m is associative, but I need to handle the removals in the order specified by s.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider simulating the process.

I can initialize l and r pointers to the start and end of the array.

Compute the initial product as the product of all elements modulo m.

Then, for each command in s:

- Output the current product modulo m.

- If the command is 'L', remove a[l] from the product and increment l.

- If the command is 'R', remove a[r] from the product and decrement r.

The challenge is how to remove an element from the product efficiently.

If I have the current product, and I want to remove an element, I need to divide the product by that element and take modulo m.

But, again, division modulo m is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the modular inverses of all elements that are coprime with m, and use those for division.

But not all elements may be coprime with m, so this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removal, multiply by the inverse of the removed element, if it exists.

But, as before, this only works if the removed element is coprime with m.

In cases where the element is not coprime with m, this won't work.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me consider another approach.

What if I compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removal, divide the product by the removed element, and take modulo m.

But again, division modulo m requires that the divisor has an inverse modulo m, which may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the removed element and m, and adjust the product accordingly.

Let me think about this.

Suppose I have the current product p, and I want to remove an element x.

I need to compute p / x modulo m.

But if x and m are not coprime, this is not straightforward.

I need to find a way to compute (p / x) mod m without directly dividing.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute p * inv(x) mod m, where inv(x) is the modular inverse of x modulo m, but inv(x) exists only if x and m are coprime.

So, this doesn't solve the problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I factorize m into its prime factors and then handle each prime power separately, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results.

But m can be up to 10^4, which is 10000, and factorizing m for each test case might be too time-consuming, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

Moreover, combining results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem would add complexity.

This seems too slow and complicated for this problem.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m can be as small as 1, and as large as 10^4, but it's still manageable.

Perhaps I can compute the product modulo m at each step without trying to optimize it further.

But n is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, but with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, so time constraints are tight.

I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements modulo m, and then, for each removal, adjust the product by dividing by the removed element and taking modulo m.

But again, division is problematic.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removal, compute the product of the remaining elements by dividing the current product by the removed element.

But, as before, division modulo m requires the existence of inverses, which may not be possible.

This seems like a fundamental issue.

Let me look at the example again.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[3,1,4,2]

s="LRRL"

- Initial product: 3*1*4*2=24, 24 % 6=0

- Remove 'L' (3), array becomes [1,4,2]

- Product:1*4*2=8, 8 % 6=2

- Remove 'R' (2), array becomes [1,4]

- Product:1*4=4, 4 % 6=4

- Remove 'R' (4), array becomes [1]

- Product:1, 1 % 6=1

- Remove 'L' (1), array empty

So, outputs:0 2 4 1

In this case, m=6=2*3, which is not prime.

Some elements, like 3 and 6, are not coprime with m.

So, division modulo m is not straightforward.

How did they get the answers?

Let's see:

Initial product: 3*1*4*2=24, 24 % 6=0

After removing 3, product:1*4*2=8, 8 % 6=2

After removing 2, product:1*4=4, 4 % 6=4

After removing 4, product:1, 1 % 6=1

So, they are computing the product of the remaining elements modulo m at each step.

Is there a way to compute this efficiently without direct division?

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it by multiplying or dividing by elements as I add or remove them.

But again, division is tricky.

Another idea: Since m can be small (up to 10^4), perhaps I can compute the product modulo m directly, and keep track of the current product after each removal.

But I still need to handle the division step.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m.

But, as before, division modulo m requires that the removed element has an inverse modulo m, which may not be the case.

This seems like a fundamental problem.

Let me think about the properties of modulo operation.

We know that (a * b) mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m

Also, (a / b) mod m is not straightforward unless b and m are coprime.

Given that, perhaps I need to find another way to compute the product after removal.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then, for each step, based on the number of 'L's and 'R's, compute the product of the remaining elements.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the sequence of removals is given by s, so I can simulate the process step by step.

I can keep track of the current product modulo m, and adjust it based on the removals.

But I need to handle the division step carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m, but only if the removed element and m are coprime.

If they are not coprime, then I need another way to handle it.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that m is small (up to 10^4), and n is up to 2*10^5, but with t up to 10^4 and the total sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, perhaps precomputing some values related to m can help.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can compute the product of all elements modulo m, and then, for each removal, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo m, but handle the cases where the removed element and m are not coprime separately.

But this seems error-prone and time-consuming.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that, since m is small, I can compute the product of the remaining elements directly for each step, but this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

So, that's not feasible.

I need a linear time solution.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence of removals is given in s, and process it in a way that allows me to update the product efficiently.

Let me think about the sequence of removals.

Each command is either 'L' or 'R', meaning remove from left or right.

So, I can simulate a deque (double-ended queue), where I can remove elements from either end.

But, in terms of computing the product, I need a way to compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal.

This seems difficult without division.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the elements that remain, by multiplying and dividing as I remove elements.

But again, division is problematic.

I'm stuck.

Let me look at the code provided and see how it approaches the problem.

The code defines a function func(), which seems to be the main function that reads input and processes the test cases.

It sets MOD to 10^9 + 6, which is unusual because m can be up to 10^4, and we need to compute things modulo m, not modulo MOD.

Wait, maybe MOD is used for intermediate computations to prevent integer overflow.

In the code:

For each test case:

- Read n and m

- Read the array arr

- Read the string s

- Initialize res as a list of n zeros

- Compute the initial product ans of all elements in arr, but it seems to compute it modulo MOD, not modulo m.

- Set res[0] to (ans % m) % MOD

- Initialize c=1, l=0, r=n-1

- Loop from k=0 to n-2:

- If s[k] == 'L', divide ans by arr[l] and take modulo MOD, set res[c] to (ans % m) % MOD, increment l

- Else, divide ans by arr[r] and take modulo MOD, set res[c] to (ans % m) % MOD, decrement r

- Increment c

- Print the res list

Wait, this seems similar to my initial thoughts, but it uses MOD=10^9+6 for intermediate computations to prevent integer overflow, and then takes modulo m.

But, as I thought earlier, division modulo m is problematic unless the divisor and m are coprime.

Moreover, in the code, it divides ans by arr[l] or arr[r] and takes modulo MOD, but then takes modulo m.

I'm concerned that this might not always give the correct result because of the way division is handled modulo m.

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, it correctly outputs 0 2 4 1, which matches the expected output.

But I need to verify if this approach is generally correct.

Let me consider a simple test case where m is not coprime with some elements.

For example:

n=2, m=4

a=[2,2]

s="LR"

Expected output:

(2*2)%4=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [2], 2%4=2

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [], 1%4=1 (but product is 1, but empty product is 1)

Wait, empty product should be 1, and 1%4=1

So, expected output:0 2 1

But according to the code:

Initialize ans=2*2=4, res[0]=4%4%MOD=0

Then, s[0]='L', divide ans by 2, ans=4//2=2, res[1]=2%4%MOD=2

Then, s[1]='R', divide ans by 2, ans=2//2=1, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:0 2 1, which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

n=3, m=6

a=[2,3,4]

s="LRL"

Compute ans=2*3*4=24, res[0]=24%6%MOD=0

s[0]='L', ans=24//2=12 % MOD, res[1]=12%6%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=12//4=3 % MOD, res[2]=3%6%MOD=3

s[2]='L', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[3]=1%6%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 3 1

But let's compute manually:

Initial product:2*3*4=24, 24%6=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [3,4], product=12, 12%6=0

Remove 'R' (4), remaining [3], 3%6=3

Remove 'L' (3), remaining [], 1%6=1

So, expected output:0 0 3 1, which matches the code's output.

Another test case:

n=2, m=2

a=[2,2]

s="RR"

Initial product:2*2=4, 4%2=0

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [2], 2%2=0

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [], 1%2=1

Expected output:0 0 1

According to the code:

ans=4

s[0]='R', ans=4//2=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%2%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%2%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 1, which is correct.

Seems like the code is producing correct outputs for these test cases.

But I need to think about whether this approach is generally correct.

The key operation is dividing the product by the removed element and taking modulo MOD, and then taking modulo m.

This seems sketchy because division modulo m requires the existence of inverses, which may not always be possible.

However, in the code, it's using integer division (//) which is different from modular division.

Wait, in Python, '//' is floor division, which may not be suitable for modular arithmetic.

In the code, it's using ans // arr[l] % MOD, which is equivalent to (ans // arr[l]) % MOD.

But, in modular arithmetic, division by x is equivalent to multiplying by the modular inverse of x, provided that x and m are coprime.

Since m can be any positive integer, and arr[l] can be any integer from 1 to 10^4, arr[l] and m may not be coprime, so the modular inverse may not exist.

However, in the code, it's simply doing integer division and then taking modulo MOD.

This seems incorrect in general, but somehow it's producing correct results in the test cases I tried.

Let me think of a case where this approach fails.

Consider n=1, m=2, a=[2], s="L"

Initial product:2, 2%2=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], product=1, 1%2=1

Expected output:0 1

According to the code:

ans=2

s[0]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[1]=1%2%MOD=1

So, output:0 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=2, m=4, a=[2,2], s="LL"

Initial product:2*2=4, 4%4=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [2], 2%4=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:0 2 1

According to the code:

ans=4

s[0]='L', ans=4//2=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%4%MOD=2

s[1]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:0 2 1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps this approach works because when m divides the current product and the element being removed, the integer division followed by modulo MOD gives the correct result.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider n=3, m=4, a=[2,2,2], s="LRL"

Initial product:2*2*2=8, 8%4=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [2,2], product=4, 4%4=0

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [2], 2%4=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:0 0 2 1

According to the code:

ans=8

s[0]='L', ans=8//2=4 % MOD, res[1]=4%4%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=4//2=2 % MOD, res[2]=2%4%MOD=2

s[2]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[3]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 2 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=2, m=3, a=[2,3], s="LR"

Initial product:2*3=6, 6%3=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [3], 3%3=0

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [], 1%3=1

Expected output:0 0 1

According to the code:

ans=6

s[0]='L', ans=6//2=3 % MOD, res[1]=3%3%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%3%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 1, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, when removing 2, which is not coprime with m=3, the division seems to work anyway.

How is this possible?

Let me think about what's happening in the code.

When removing an element x, it does ans = ans // x % MOD.

But in modular arithmetic, ans // x is not the same as ans * inv(x) mod m, unless x and m are coprime.

However, in the above cases, even when x and m are not coprime, the code seems to produce the correct results.

Is this a coincidence, or is there something deeper going on?

Let me consider another test case.

n=3, m=6, a=[2,3,4], s="LRL"

Initial product:2*3*4=24, 24%6=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [3,4], product=12, 12%6=0

Remove 'R' (4), remaining [3], 3%6=3

Remove 'L' (3), remaining [], 1%6=1

Expected output:0 0 3 1

According to the code:

ans=24

s[0]='L', ans=24//2=12 % MOD, res[1]=12%6%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=12//4=3 % MOD, res[2]=3%6%MOD=3

s[2]='L', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[3]=1%6%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 3 1, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2, m=4, a=[2,2], s="LL"

Initial product:2*2=4, 4%4=0

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [2], 2%4=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:0 2 1

According to the code:

ans=4

s[0]='L', ans=4//2=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%4%MOD=2

s[1]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:0 2 1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps this approach works because we are dealing with the product modulo m, and m divides the current product and the element being removed.

In such cases, integer division followed by modulo MOD gives the correct result.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Let me consider a case where m does not divide the current product.

n=2, m=3, a=[1,2], s="LR"

Initial product:1*2=2, 2%3=2

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [2], 2%3=2

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [], 1%3=1

Expected output:2 2 1

According to the code:

ans=2

s[0]='L', ans=2//1=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%3%MOD=2

s[1]='R', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%3%MOD=1

So, output:2 2 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=3, m=5, a=[1,2,3], s="LRL"

Initial product:1*2*3=6, 6%5=1

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [2,3], 2*3=6, 6%5=1

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [2], 2%5=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], 1%5=1

Expected output:1 1 2 1

According to the code:

ans=6

s[0]='L', ans=6//1=6 % MOD, res[1]=6%5%MOD=1

s[1]='R', ans=6//3=2 % MOD, res[2]=2%5%MOD=2

s[2]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[3]=1%5%MOD=1

So, output:1 1 2 1, which is correct.

Seems like the code is working correctly for these cases.

But I still need to verify if this is a general solution.

Let me consider a case where the element being removed does not divide the current product.

For example:

n=2, m=4, a=[1,3], s="LR"

Initial product:1*3=3, 3%4=3

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [3], 3%4=3

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:3 3 1

According to the code:

ans=3

s[0]='L', ans=3//1=3 % MOD, res[1]=3%4%MOD=3

s[1]='R', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:3 3 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=3, m=6, a=[1,2,3], s="LRL"

Initial product:1*2*3=6, 6%6=0

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [2,3], 2*3=6, 6%6=0

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [2], 2%6=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [], 1%6=1

Expected output:0 0 2 1

According to the code:

ans=6

s[0]='L', ans=6//1=6 % MOD, res[1]=6%6%MOD=0

s[1]='R', ans=6//3=2 % MOD, res[2]=2%6%MOD=2

s[2]='L', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[3]=1%6%MOD=1

So, output:0 0 2 1, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, when removing 1, which divides 6, and then removing 3, which also divides 6, the integer division seems to work.

But what if the element does not divide the product?

Wait, in these cases, the element being removed always divides the current product because the product is a multiple of all remaining elements.

Wait, no, in the case where m divides the product, and the element being removed divides the product.

Wait, in the case where m divides the product, and the element being removed divides the product, integer division seems to work.

But what if m does not divide the product?

Let me consider:

n=2, m=3, a=[1,2], s="LR"

Initial product:1*2=2, 2%3=2

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [2], 2%3=2

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [], 1%3=1

Expected output:2 2 1

According to the code:

ans=2

s[0]='L', ans=2//1=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%3%MOD=2

s[1]='R', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%3%MOD=1

So, output:2 2 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=2, m=5, a=[2,3], s="LR"

Initial product:2*3=6, 6%5=1

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [3], 3%5=3

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [], 1%5=1

Expected output:1 3 1

According to the code:

ans=6

s[0]='L', ans=6//2=3 % MOD, res[1]=3%5%MOD=3

s[1]='R', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%5%MOD=1

So, output:1 3 1, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, 6//2=3, which is correct for the remaining product.

Then, 3//3=1, which is also correct.

But, in general, is ans // x equivalent to (ans * inv(x)) mod m when x and m are not coprime?

I think in these specific cases, it's working because ans is a multiple of x, and m divides ans.

Wait, when m divides ans and x divides ans, then ans // x is an integer, and taking it modulo m seems to give the correct result.

But is this always true?

Let me consider another example.

n=2, m=4, a=[2,3], s="LR"

Initial product:2*3=6, 6%4=2

Remove 'L' (2), remaining [3], 3%4=3

Remove 'R' (3), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:2 3 1

According to the code:

ans=6

s[0]='L', ans=6//2=3 % MOD, res[1]=3%4%MOD=3

s[1]='R', ans=3//3=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:2 3 1, which is correct.

Another case:

n=2, m=4, a=[1,2], s="LR"

Initial product:1*2=2, 2%4=2

Remove 'L' (1), remaining [2], 2%4=2

Remove 'R' (2), remaining [], 1%4=1

Expected output:2 2 1

According to the code:

ans=2

s[0]='L', ans=2//1=2 % MOD, res[1]=2%4%MOD=2

s[1]='R', ans=2//2=1 % MOD, res[2]=1%4%MOD=1

So, output:2 2 1, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps in all these cases, ans // x is equal to ans / x, and since ans is a multiple of x, this integer division gives the correct quotient, which is then taken modulo m.

But, in general, is this approach correct?

I think in the context of this problem, where we are dealing with product of integers and removing factors from the product, and given that m divides the product initially or at intermediate steps, this approach might work.

However, I'm still not entirely confident that this is a general solution.

Let me consider a case where m does not divide the product, and the element being removed does not divide the product.

Wait, if the element being removed divides the product, then ans // x is an integer.

But if the element does not divide the product, then ans // x is not the exact quotient.

Wait, in the earlier cases, ans is the product of all remaining elements, which is divisible by the element being removed, because that element was part of the product.

Wait, no, if we remove an element, the remaining product should be the total product divided by that element.

But, in reality, the product of the remaining elements is indeed the total product divided by the removed element, assuming the total product is divisible by the removed element.

But in the context of modulo m, this division may not be straightforward.

However, in the code, it's using integer division and then taking modulo MOD, which seems to work in the examples I've tried.

Perhaps this approach is acceptable for this problem, even if it's not strictly correct in general, because of the specific constraints and the way the operations are performed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical justification for this approach that I'm missing.

Given that all the test cases I've tried so far produce the correct output, and considering time constraints, perhaps this is an acceptable solution.

But I'm still uneasy about the correctness of this approach.

Let me try to find a case where this approach fails.

Consider n=2, m=4, a=[1,2], s="LR"

Expected:2 2 1

According to the code:2 2 1

Another case:n=2, m=3, a=[1,2], s="LR"

Expected:2 2 1

According to the code:2 2 1

Another case:n=3, m=5, a=[1,2,3], s="LRL"

Expected:1 1 2 1

According to the code:1 1 2 1

Seems correct.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, since we are dealing with product modulo m, and m is small, and n is large, but the product can be very large, so using MOD=10^9+6 helps prevent integer overflows.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but in other languages, integer overflow can be an issue.

So, using MOD=10^9+6 ensures that the intermediate products don't become too large.

Then, taking ans % m % MOD ensures that the result is within bounds.

But, again, the division step is still concerning.

Wait, perhaps I can think of division as multiplying by the modular inverse, but only when the element and m are coprime.

In other cases, where the element and m are not coprime, but
