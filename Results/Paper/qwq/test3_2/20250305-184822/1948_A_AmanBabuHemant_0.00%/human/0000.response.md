Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly n characters are "special." A special character is one that's equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in "AAABAACC," there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. If a character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, that means:

- If it's the first character, it's special only if it's equal to the second character.

- If it's the last character, it's special only if it's equal to the second-to-last character.

- For any character in the middle, it's special if it's equal to either the previous or the next character, but not both.

So, for the string "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), so special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so special.

- Position 3: 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), so special.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, 'A' at position 3 is 'A' != 'A' (previous) and 'A' != 'B' (next), so it shouldn't be special. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the positions or misunderstood the example.

Looking back at the problem, it says positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special. Let's re-examine:

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), so special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so special.

- Position 3: 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), wait no, 'A' != 'B', so not special.

Wait, but the problem says position 3 is special. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let's number the positions starting from 1:

1. A

2. A

3. A

4. B

5. A

6. A

7. C

8. C

So, positions:

1. 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

2. 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), special.

3. 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), not special.

4. 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' != 'A' (next), not special.

5. 'A' != 'B' (previous), 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

6. 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'C' (next), special.

7. 'C' != 'A' (previous), 'C' == 'C' (next), special.

8. 'C' == 'C' (previous), 'C' has no next, special.

Wait, now I'm counting position 3 as not special, but positions 1,2,5,6,7,8 as special, which matches the problem's statement of 6 special characters.

So, perhaps there was a miscount in the initial problem statement, or maybe I'm misunderstanding "exactly one of its neighbors." Let's clarify:

- For position 1: only has a next neighbor.

- For position n: only has a previous neighbor.

- For positions 2 to n-1: has both previous and next neighbors.

A character is special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors, not both.

So, for position 3 in "AAABAACC":

- 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so not equal to any neighbor, hence not special.

For position 5:

- 'A' != 'B' (previous), 'A' == 'A' (next), so equal to exactly one neighbor, special.

Similarly, position 7:

- 'C' != 'A' (previous), 'C' == 'C' (next), so equal to exactly one neighbor, special.

Position 8:

- 'C' == 'C' (previous), no next neighbor, so equal to its only neighbor, special.

Got it. So, to build a string with exactly n special characters, I need to arrange the letters such that exactly n characters satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one of their neighbors.

Now, I need to find such a string for a given n, or determine that it's impossible.

First, let's think about the maximum possible number of special characters in a string.

Consider a string of length l. The maximum number of special characters is l, if every character is special.

To maximize the number of special characters, I need as many characters as possible to be equal to exactly one of their neighbors.

One way to maximize this is to create a string where every character has exactly one neighbor equal to it.

For example, consider a string like "ABABABAB...". In this string, every 'A' is equal to its next neighbor 'B', and every 'B' is equal to its previous neighbor 'A'. So, in this case, no character is equal to exactly one neighbor because each 'A' is unequal to its previous neighbor and equal to its next neighbor, but since the previous neighbor is 'B', it's unequal, and the next is 'B', which is equal only if the next character is 'A', which it's not in this pattern.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let's consider "ABABABAB...". For each 'A':

- Previous neighbor: 'B' (if it's not the first character), next neighbor: 'B'.

- So, 'A' != 'B' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), so not special.

For each 'B':

- Previous neighbor: 'A', next neighbor: 'A'.

- 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' != 'A' (next), so not special.

So, in this alternating pattern, no characters are special.

That's not helpful.

Another approach: try to make as many characters as possible equal to exactly one neighbor.

One way is to have runs of two identical characters, separated by different characters.

For example, "AABBCCDD...". Let's see:

Take "AABBCCDD":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), special.

- Position 3: 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' == 'B' (next), special.

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (previous), 'B' != 'C' (next), special.

- Position 5: 'C' != 'B' (previous), 'C' == 'C' (next), special.

- Position 6: 'C' == 'C' (previous), 'C' != 'D' (next), special.

- Position 7: 'D' != 'C' (previous), 'D' == 'D' (next), special.

- Position 8: 'D' == 'D' (previous), no next neighbor, special.

So, in "AABBCCDD", all 8 positions are special.

Wait, but according to the problem, in "AAABAACC", positions 1,2,5,6,7,8 are special, which is 6 special characters.

So, in "AABBCCDD", it seems all positions are special.

Wait, but in the example given, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters, not 8.

Wait, perhaps my earlier analysis was wrong.

Wait, in "AABBCCDD":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), special.

- Position 3: 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' == 'B' (next), special.

- Position 4: 'B' == 'B' (previous), 'B' != 'C' (next), special.

- Position 5: 'C' != 'B' (previous), 'C' == 'C' (next), special.

- Position 6: 'C' == 'C' (previous), 'C' != 'D' (next), special.

- Position 7: 'D' != 'C' (previous), 'D' == 'D' (next), special.

- Position 8: 'D' == 'D' (previous), no next neighbor, special.

So, indeed, all 8 positions are special.

But in "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

- Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), special.

- Position 3: 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), wait 'A' != 'B', so not special.

Wait, 'A' != 'B', so position 3 is not special.

But the problem says position 3 is special.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"In the AAABAACC string (at positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 )."

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the equality is misapplied.

Wait, in "AAABAACC":

Positions:

1. 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

2. 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), special.

3. 'A' != 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'B' (next), not special.

4. 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' == 'A' (next), 'B' != 'A', so not special.

Wait, 'B' != 'A', so not special.

5. 'A' != 'B' (previous), 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

6. 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' != 'C' (next), special.

7. 'C' != 'A' (previous), 'C' == 'C' (next), special.

8. 'C' == 'C' (previous), no next neighbor, special.

So, positions 1,2,5,6,7,8 are special, total 6, as per the problem.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought position 3 was not special, which matches the problem's indication that positions 1,2,5,6,7,8 are special.

So, in "AABBCCDD", all positions are special, which is greater than n=6 in that example.

So, if n=6, one possible string is "AABBCCDD", but the problem shows "AAABAACC" with 6 special positions.

So, the task is to build a string with exactly n special characters.

Now, to generalize, for any n, I need to build a string where exactly n characters are special.

From the example, when n=1, it's impossible ("NO"), and when n=2, "MM" is acceptable.

Wait, for n=1:

If I have a string like "A", it has 1 character, which has no neighbors, so not special.

"A" has 0 special characters.

"AB": position 1: 'A' != 'B' (next), not special; position 2: 'B' != 'A' (previous), not special; total 0.

"AAA": position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), special; position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'A' (next), not special; position 3: 'A' == 'A' (previous), no next, special.

So, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

Wait, but n=1 is impossible, as per the example.

Wait, in "AAA", positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

To have exactly 1 special character, I need a string where only one character is equal to exactly one neighbor.

Is that possible?

Let's try "AAB":

Position 1: 'A' == 'A' (next), special.

Position 2: 'A' == 'A' (previous), 'A' == 'B' (next), not special.

Position 3: 'B' != 'A' (previous), no next, special.

So, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

Another try: "ABC":

Position 1: 'A' != 'B' (next), not special.

Position 2: 'B' != 'A' (previous), 'B' != 'C' (next), not special.

Position 3: 'C' != 'B' (previous), no next, special.

Only position 3 is special, total 1.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=1, it's "NO".

But in "ABC", only position 3 is special, which is exactly n=1.

Is there a constraint I'm missing?

Wait, the problem says "print any suitable string or report that there is no such string."

In the example, for n=1, it's "NO".

But in "ABC", only position 3 is special, which matches n=1.

Is there an issue with the alphabet or the length?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects all letters to be uppercase, but that's probably not the issue here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

In "ABC", position 3: 'C' != 'B' (previous), no next, so it's equal to exactly one neighbor? Wait, it has only one neighbor, and it's not equal to it, so is it considered special?

Wait, the definition is: "equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

If a character has only one neighbor, and it's not equal to that neighbor, then it's not equal to exactly one neighbor, because it's unequal to its only neighbor.

So, in "ABC", position 3: 'C' != 'B' (previous), no next neighbor, so it's unequal to its only neighbor, hence not special.

Therefore, in "ABC", no positions are special, which is n=0.

So, my earlier assumption was wrong.

Thus, it's impossible to have exactly n=1 special characters.

Hence, "NO" is the correct response for n=1.

Got it.

So, to generalize, for which n is it possible to build such a string?

Looking at the examples:

- n=6: "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.

- n=1: impossible, "NO".

- n=2: "MM" has 2 special characters.

Wait, "MM": positions 1: 'M' == 'M' (next), special; position 2: 'M' == 'M' (previous), no next, special. So, both positions are special, total 2.

Another example for n=2.

Is there a pattern here?

Let's consider that in a string, the number of special characters is always even.

Wait, in "AAABAACC", n=6 (even).

In "MM", n=2 (even).

In "ABC", n=0 (even).

In "AAA", n=2 (even).

In "AABBCCDD", n=8 (even).

In "AAB", n=2 (even).

So, perhaps n must be even.

And in the example, for n=1, which is odd, it's impossible.

Hence, perhaps the rule is that n must be even.

In that case, for any even n, there exists a string with exactly n special characters.

For example:

- n=2: "MM"

- n=4: "MMNN"

- n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

And for odd n, it's impossible.

Hence, the program should check if n is even, and if so, print "YES" and a corresponding string, else print "NO".

But wait, in the given program, it checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., even), and if so, prints "YES" and a string of '1's and '0's.

Wait, the given program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = '110' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

So, it checks if n is even, and if so, constructs a string by repeating '110' (n//2) times, and if the length is less than 200, prints "YES" and the string, else "NO".

First, is this correct?

Let's see.

If n is odd, print "NO", which seems correct based on our earlier reasoning.

If n is even, construct s = '110' repeated (n//2) times.

For example, for n=2: s = '110'

Positions:

1: '1' == '1' (next), special.

2: '1' == '1' (previous), '1' != '0' (next), special.

3: '0' != '1' (previous), no next, special.

Wait, but n=2 requires exactly 2 special characters, but in this string, all 3 positions are special, which is more than n.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

In '110':

Position 1: '1' == '1' (next), special.

Position 2: '1' == '1' (previous), '1' != '0' (next), special.

Position 3: '0' != '1' (previous), no next, special.

So, 3 special characters for n=2, which is more than n.

Hence, this is not correct.

Wait, maybe the idea is different.

Wait, perhaps the string should be '110' repeated (n//2) times, but then for n=2, s='110', which has 3 special characters, which is more than n=2.

So, this is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

Wait, but maybe there is a different way to construct the string.

Let's think about how to construct a string with exactly n special characters.

One way is to create pairs of identical characters, separated by different characters.

For example, for n=2: "MM"

For n=4: "MMNN"

For n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

In "MM", positions 1 and 2 are special, total n=2.

In "MMNN", positions 1,2,3,4 are special, total n=4.

In "MMNNOO", positions 1,2,5,6 are special, total n=4, wait, no.

Wait, in "MMNNOO":

Positions:

1: 'M' == 'M' (next), special.

2: 'M' == 'M' (previous), 'M' != 'N' (next), special.

3: 'N' != 'M' (previous), 'N' == 'N' (next), special.

4: 'N' == 'N' (previous), 'N' != 'O' (next), special.

5: 'O' != 'N' (previous), 'O' == 'O' (next), special.

6: 'O' == 'O' (previous), no next, special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are special, total n=6.

So, for n=6, "MMNNOO" has exactly 6 special characters.

Similarly, for n=4, "MMNN" has positions 1,2,3,4 special.

Wait, but in "MMNN":

Positions:

1: 'M' == 'M' (next), special.

2: 'M' == 'M' (previous), 'M' != 'N' (next), special.

3: 'N' != 'M' (previous), 'N' == 'N' (next), special.

4: 'N' == 'N' (previous), no next, special.

So, positions 1,2,3,4 are special, total n=4.

Hence, for n=4, "MMNN" is a valid string.

Similarly, for n=2, "MM" has positions 1 and 2 special.

For n=6, "MMNNOO" has positions 1,2,5,6 special, which is 4, not 6.

Wait, in "MMNNOO", positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are special, as per earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Let's re-examine "MMNNOO":

Positions:

1: 'M' == 'M' (next), special.

2: 'M' == 'M' (previous), 'M' != 'N' (next), special.

3: 'N' != 'M' (previous), 'N' == 'N' (next), special.

4: 'N' == 'N' (previous), 'N' != 'O' (next), special.

5: 'O' != 'N' (previous), 'O' == 'O' (next), special.

6: 'O' == 'O' (previous), no next, special.

So, all 6 positions are special.

But earlier, I thought in "MMNNOO", positions 1,2,5,6 are special, which was incorrect.

Hence, "MMNNOO" has 6 special positions, which matches n=6.

Similarly, for n=4, "MMNN" has 4 special positions.

So, the general pattern is to create a string by repeating pairs of different letters, like "MMNNOOPP...", each pair contributing 2 special positions.

Hence, for n even, we can construct a string with n special positions by having n/2 pairs of identical letters, each pair separated by different letters.

For example, for n=2: "MM"

n=4: "MMNN"

n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

Each pair "MM", "NN", "OO", etc., contributes 2 special positions.

Hence, for any even n, we can construct such a string.

For odd n, it's impossible, as n must be even.

Hence, the program should check if n is even, and if so, print "YES" and a corresponding string, else print "NO".

Now, looking back at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = '110' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

There are a few issues here.

First, it's using '1's and '0's, which are not uppercase letters as specified in the problem (uppercase Latin letters).

Second, in the string '110' repeated (n//2) times, it may have more special characters than n.

For example, for n=2, s='110', which has 3 special characters, not 2.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Instead, the program should construct a string using different uppercase letters, ensuring that each pair contributes exactly 2 special positions.

For example, for n=2: "MM"

n=4: "MMNN"

n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

Also, the length of the string should be at most 200, which is easily satisfied since n <= 50, and each n corresponds to a string of length n (or less, depending on the construction).

Wait, in the earlier examples, for n=2, string length is 2; n=4, length is 4; n=6, length is 6.

But the problem allows strings of length up to 200, and n <= 50, so it's fine.

Hence, the corrected program should be:

- If n is odd, print "NO"

- If n is even, print "YES" and a string consisting of n/2 pairs of identical uppercase letters, each pair separated by different letters.

For example:

- n=2: "MM"

- n=4: "MMNN"

- n=6: "MMNNOO"

And so on.

Hence, the given program is incorrect because it uses '1's and '0's and constructs a string with more special characters than n.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
