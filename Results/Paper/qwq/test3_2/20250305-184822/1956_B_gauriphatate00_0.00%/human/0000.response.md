Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns placing one card at a time on the table, alternating turns, starting with me. We do this for a total of 2n turns, meaning each of us takes n turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand and places it on the table. If there's already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets one point. Otherwise, they get no points.

Importantly, Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options that maximize her score, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My task is to figure out, given the cards in my hand, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and the interactions between my moves and Nene's moves.

Let's think about how the game progresses. Each turn, a card is played, and points are awarded based on whether a card with the same number is already on the table.

Since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to anticipate her moves based on the cards on the table and the possible cards she has.

But wait, I don't know exactly which cards Nene has, only which cards I have. However, since there are two cards for each number, and I know which cards I have, I can infer which cards are in Nene's hand.

For example, if I have two cards with the same number, then Nene doesn't have that number. If I have one card of a certain number, Nene has the other one.

Wait, actually, if I have one card of a certain number, Nene has the other one, because there are exactly two cards for each number.

So, for each number from 1 to n:

- If I have two cards of that number, Nene has none.

- If I have one card of that number, Nene has one.

This allows me to know exactly which cards Nene has.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene alternately placing cards on the table. I need to choose which card to play on my turn to maximize my points, considering that Nene will respond optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where Nene is trying to minimize my score while maximizing hers.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my score, given that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's think about the concept of "pairs". Since there are two cards for each number, a pair consists of two cards with the same number.

In my hand, I can have:

- Pairs: numbers where I have both cards.

- Singles: numbers where I have one card, and Nene has the other.

Similarly, Nene has:

- Singles: for the numbers where I have one card.

- Singles or pairs: but I can determine exactly which she has based on my hand.

Wait, no. Since I know exactly which cards Nene has based on my hand, I can fully know her hand.

But the complexity comes from the sequence in which we play the cards.

I need to think about how the order of playing cards affects the points scored.

Let me consider that the game is played in 2n turns, with me and Nene alternately playing cards, starting with me.

At each turn, the player plays a card, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of ties in that, to minimize my points.

I need to play optimally to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal responses.

This seems quite complex to model directly, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, so I need an efficient solution.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical way to calculate the maximum points I can get without simulating the entire game.

First, let's consider that the total number of points available is equal to the number of pairs that are played after their pair is already on the table.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many pairs I can play after their pair has already been played.

But it's tricky because the sequence matters.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have and the number of singles.

Let me define:

- Let p be the number of pairs I have (i.e., numbers where I have two cards).

- Then, the number of singles I have is n - p, since there are n unique numbers.

Similarly, Nene has:

- For the numbers where I have a pair, she has none.

- For the numbers where I have a single, she has one.

So, Nene has n - p pairs (since she has one card for each of the n - p singles I have).

Wait, no. Wait, if I have one card of a number, Nene has the other. So, Nene has n - p singles (one card each for the numbers where I have one card).

And for the numbers where I have two cards, Nene has none.

So, Nene has n - p singles.

Wait, but in terms of pairs, Nene has no pairs because all her cards are singles.

Wait, no. Wait, in the deck, each number has exactly two cards. So, if I have both cards of a number, Nene has none of that number. If I have one card of a number, Nene has the other card of that number.

Therefore, Nene has n - p singles (one card each for the numbers where I have one card).

Similarly, I have p pairs and n - p singles.

Wait, no. Wait, I have p pairs and n - p singles.

Wait, actually, I have p pairs and n - p singles.

Wait, no. Wait, if I have p numbers where I have two cards, that's p pairs.

And for the remaining n - p numbers, I have one card each, so that's n - p singles.

Similarly, Nene has n - p singles (one card each for the n - p numbers where I have one card).

Wait, but Nene doesn't have any pairs because for each number, there are only two cards, and if I have one, she has the other, and if I have both, she has none.

So, Nene has n - p singles.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene alternately playing cards, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns.

I need to choose which card to play on my turn to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal responses.

This seems too complex to model directly.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can think in terms of which cards I should play to maximize the chances of getting points, considering that Nene is trying to minimize my points.

One idea is that I should try to play cards that have their pair already on the table, to get points, but Nene will try to prevent that.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to play singles first, to minimize the chances of Nene playing a pair after me.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the concept of "available pairs".

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have and the number of pairs Nene has.

Wait, but Nene has no pairs; she only has singles.

Wait, no, Nene has n - p singles, which are the other cards of the numbers where I have one card.

Wait, but in terms of pairs, since each number has exactly two cards, and I have some pairs and some singles, Nene has the remaining cards.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of pairs that can be formed during the game.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of points I can get based on the number of pairs I have and the number of pairs that can be played after their pair is already on the table.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times I can play a card that has its pair already on the table.

But again, the sequence matters.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have, because for each pair I have, I can potentially get one point from it.

Wait, let's consider that for each pair I have, I can play one card early in the game, and then play the second card later to get a point.

Similarly, for the singles, since Nene has the other card, if I play my single first, Nene can play her single later to get a point.

But if I play my single later, perhaps I can get a point from it.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of pairs where I can play the second card after Nene has played the first.

Wait, but Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a formula that can help me calculate the maximum points I can get based on the number of pairs I have.

Let p be the number of pairs I have.

And q be the number of singles I have, which is n - p.

Similarly, Nene has q singles.

Now, I need to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, p, but limited by something.

Wait, in the first test case:

n = 4

a = [1,1,2,3]

So, p = 1 (since I have two 1's)

q = 3 (singles: 2,3)

Nene has singles: 2,3,4,4

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, Nene should have singles corresponding to my singles, but in this case, Nene has two 4's because I have no 4's.

Wait, hold on.

If I have a = [1,1,2,3], then Nene has [2,3,4,4].

Wait, but in this case, for number 4, I have zero cards, so Nene has both cards.

So, in general, for numbers where I have zero cards, Nene has a pair.

For numbers where I have one card, Nene has one card.

For numbers where I have two cards, Nene has zero cards.

So, in this test case:

- I have two 1's, so Nene has zero 1's.

- I have one 2, so Nene has one 2.

- I have one 3, so Nene has one 3.

- I have zero 4's, so Nene has two 4's.

So, Nene has [2,3,4,4].

Now, in the example, it's said that the maximum points I can get is 1.

Looking back, perhaps the formula is min(p, floor(n/2)).

In this case, p = 1, floor(4/2) = 2, so min(1,2) = 1, which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

n = 8

a = [7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

So, p = number of pairs I have: I have two 8's and two 5's, so p = 2.

q = 8 - 2 = 6 singles: 7,4,1,2

Nene has singles for the numbers where I have singles: so Nene has 3,6,9,10 (assuming n=10, but n=8, so perhaps I miscounted).

Wait, no, n=8, so numbers are from 1 to 8.

So, I have a = [7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

So, I have:

- two 8's

- two 5's

- one 7

- one 4

- one 1

- one 2

So, p = 2 (pairs of 8 and 5)

q = 8 - 2 = 6 singles: 7,4,1,2

Wait, but a has only six singles, but n=8 and p=2, so q=6.

Nene has singles for the numbers where I have singles: so Nene has one 7, one 4, one 1, one 2.

And for numbers where I have zero cards, Nene has pairs.

From 1 to 8, I have cards for 1,2,4,5,7,8.

So, missing 3 and 6.

Thus, Nene has pairs of 3 and 6.

So, Nene has [3,3,6,6,7,4,1,2]

Wait, but n=8, so Nene has eight cards.

Wait, I have [7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], which is eight cards.

Wait, but according to earlier, for numbers where I have zero cards, Nene has both cards.

So, if I have zero cards for 3 and 6, Nene has [3,3,6,6].

And for the numbers where I have one card, Nene has one card for each: so Nene has [7,4,1,2].

So, Nene has [3,3,6,6,7,4,1,2].

Now, according to the problem, in this test case, the output is 2.

According to my earlier hypothesis, min(p, floor(n/2)) = min(2, floor(8/2)) = min(2,4) = 2, which matches the second test case.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=8

a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

So, p=1 (only one pair: 4 appears twice in my hand)

q=8-1=7 singles: 7,1,5,3,2,6

Wait, but in a, 4 appears twice, so p=1 is incorrect.

Wait, no, in a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], the counts are:

- 4:2

- others:1 each

So, p=1 (pair of 4's)

q=8-1=7 singles:7,1,5,3,2,6

Nene has singles for the numbers where I have singles: so Nene has one card each for 7,1,5,3,2,6.

And for numbers where I have zero cards: none, since n=8 and I have cards for all numbers from 1 to 8.

Wait, but n=8, and I have [7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], which covers numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Wait, but n=8, numbers from 1 to 8, and I have one of each except for 4, which I have two.

So, Nene has one card for each of the numbers where I have one card, and zero cards for the numbers where I have two cards.

Wait, but in this case, I have two 4's, so Nene has zero 4's.

And for the other numbers, I have one card each, so Nene has one card each for 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Wait, but in a, I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, which are all numbers from 1 to 8.

So, Nene has one card for each of these numbers except 4, where I have both.

So, Nene has [8,5,3,2,7,1,6].

Wait, but n=8, and Nene should have n=8 cards.

Wait, I have two 4's, so Nene has zero 4's.

And for the other numbers, I have one each, so Nene has one each.

So, Nene has [1,2,3,5,6,7,8].

Wait, but that's seven cards.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, n=8, I have [7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], which are eight cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

I have:

- two 4's

- one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7

So, Nene has one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Wait, that's seven cards.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, n=8, total cards 16.

I have eight cards: [7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

So, Nene has eight cards: [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8]

Wait, but I have one 7, so Nene has one 7.

I have one 1, so Nene has one 1.

I have one 2, so Nene has one 2.

I have one 3, so Nene has one 3.

I have one 5, so Nene has one 5.

I have one 6, so Nene has one 6.

I have one 8, so Nene has one 8.

And I have two 4's, so Nene has zero 4's.

Wait, but n=8, numbers from 1 to 8, and I have one of each except two 4's.

So, Nene has one of each except zero 4's.

Wait, but that's seven cards.

Wait, perhaps in this case, Nene has eight cards because there are two 8's.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says each integer from 1 to n appears exactly on two cards.

So, for n=8, there are two cards for each number from 1 to 8.

So, if I have one 8, Nene has the other 8.

So, Nene has [1,2,3,5,6,7,8], but she should have eight cards.

Wait, perhaps there are two 8's, and I have one 8, so Nene has the other 8.

Wait, in a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], that's eight cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, I have one 8, meaning Nene has the other 8.

So, Nene has [1,2,3,5,6,7,8].

Wait, that's seven cards.

Wait, perhaps I have one 8, and Nene has one 8, but n=8, total cards 16.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of cards.

Wait, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], which are eight cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, I have one 7, one 1, two 4's, one 5, one 3, one 2, one 6.

So, Nene has one of each of these numbers except for 4, where I have both.

Wait, but for 8, I have one 8, so Nene has one 8.

Wait, but in a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], there is no 8 in my hand.

Wait, in the problem, n=8, and a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], which are eight cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, I have one of each number except two 4's.

Wait, but 8 is included in the numbers from 1 to 8, and I have no 8 in my hand, so Nene has both 8's.

So, Nene has [8,8,1,2,3,5,6,7].

Wait, that makes sense: eight cards.

So, Nene has:

- two 8's (since I have zero 8's)

- one each of 1,2,3,5,6,7 (since I have one of each)

Now, in this test case, the output is 1.

According to my earlier hypothesis, p=1 (pair of 4's), floor(n/2)=4, so min(1,4)=1, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the fourth test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

So, p=0 (no pairs)

q=3 (singles:1,2,3)

Nene has pairs for the numbers where I have singles: so Nene has two of each: [1,1,2,2,3,3], but since n=3, total cards 6.

Wait, n=3, total cards 6.

I have [1,2,3], so Nene has [1,2,3].

So, Nene has one of each.

Wait, but according to the problem, each number appears exactly twice, so if I have one of each, Nene has one of each.

Wait, but in this case, Nene has one of each, not pairs.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, for numbers where I have one card, Nene has one card.

So, Nene has one of each:1,2,3.

Wait, but n=3, total cards 6, I have [1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3].

But in this case, p=0, floor(3/2)=1, min(0,1)=0, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the fifth test case:

n=1

a=[1]

So, p=1 (since I have two 1's, but wait, a has only one 1, so p=0.

Wait, a=[1], n=1.

So, p=0 (no pairs)

q=1 (single:1)

Nene has one 1.

So, min(0, floor(1/2))=0, which matches the output.

Wait, but in this case, floor(1/2)=0, since 1 divided by 2 is 0 in integer division.

Wait, but in Python, floor division of 1//2 is 0.

So, min(0,0)=0, which matches the output.

So, it seems that the formula min(p, floor(n/2)) works for all the test cases provided.

Therefore, perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, the function func_1(n, a) calculates the number of pairs I have, p, and then returns min(p, n//2).

This seems to be the correct solution.

So, the answer is **True**.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - You and Nene have cards with integers from 1 to n, each integer appearing exactly twice.
   - You need to maximize your points by strategically choosing which card to play on your turn, considering Nene's optimal responses.

2. **Insight**:
   - Calculate the number of pairs you hold.
   - The maximum points you can get is limited by the number of pairs you have and half the total number of unique integers (n//2).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Count the frequency of each integer in your hand to determine how many pairs you have.
   - Compute the minimum of the number of pairs you have and floor division of n by 2.

## Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

## Explanation

- **func_1(n, a)**:
  - Uses `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in your hand.
  - Counts the number of pairs you have.
  - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

- **func_2()**:
  - Reads input data.
  - Processes each test case to extract `n` and the list of integers in your hand.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
  - Prints the results for each test case.

This approach ensures an efficient and optimal solution to maximize your points against Nene's optimal play.
