Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. Let's break it down.

For the first installation:

- Launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka minutes.

For the second installation:

- Launches fireworks at times: b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb minutes.

Each firework is visible from the time it's launched up to m minutes after its launch time. So, for a firework launched at time t, it's visible from t to t + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these fireworks are visible in the sky.

Let me consider the visibility periods for each firework.

For the first installation:

- Firework launched at ka is visible from ka to ka + m.

For the second installation:

- Firework launched at lb is visible from lb to lb + m.

I need to find a time x where the number of intervals (ka, ka + m) and (lb, lb + m) that contain x is maximized.

This seems like a problem of overlapping intervals. I need to find the time x where the maximum number of these intervals overlap.

But since a and b can be very large (up to 10^18), and m can also be up to 10^18, I can't iterate through all possible times x. I need a smarter way to calculate this.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Case 1: m < a and m < b

In this case, each firework from either installation is visible for less time than the interval between launches. So, no two fireworks from the same installation will be visible at the same time.

But, there might be a time when a firework from the first installation and one from the second installation are visible together.

So, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be 2.

Wait, but if m < a and m < b, and if a and b are such that their launch times don't overlap within m minutes, then indeed, only two fireworks can be visible at the same time.

But, if a and b have a common multiple within m minutes, then more fireworks could be visible together.

Wait, no. If m < a and m < b, and a and b are launch intervals, then the only way multiple fireworks could be visible together is if their launch times are within m minutes of each other.

But since m < a and m < b, the only way this can happen is if a and b have a common multiple within m minutes.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me take an example.

Suppose a = 3, b = 4, m = 2.

So, fireworks from first installation at 3,6,9,12,...

From second installation at 4,8,12,16,...

Each firework is visible for m + 1 = 3 minutes.

So, firework launched at 3 is visible from 3 to 5.

At 4: firework from second installation visible from 4 to 6.

At 6: firework from first installation visible from 6 to 8.

At 8: firework from second installation visible from 8 to 10.

At 9: firework from first installation visible from 9 to 11.

At 12: both installations launch fireworks.

Firework from first installation at 12: visible from 12 to 14.

Firework from second installation at 12: visible from 12 to 14.

So, at time 12, both fireworks are visible together, so maximum is 2.

But according to my earlier thought, since m < a and m < b, maximum is 2.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for 6 7 4, the output is 2.

Wait, but in my example with a=3, b=4, m=2, maximum is 2.

But in the note, for 7 8 56, the output is 17.

Wait, that's when m is larger.

So, perhaps when m is larger, more fireworks can be visible together.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If m < a and m < b, then maximum is 2.

- Else, calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible at the same time.

Wait, but in the note, for 7 8 56, it's 17 fireworks visible at time 112.

Let me see:

First installation launches at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112,...

Second installation launches at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112,...

Each firework is visible for m + 1 = 57 minutes.

So, firework launched at 56 is visible from 56 to 56 + 56 = 112.

Firework launched at 56 from both installations is visible from 56 to 112.

Firework launched at 63 from first installation is visible from 63 to 119.

From second installation, 64 to 120.

And so on.

So, at time 112, fireworks launched at:

From first installation: all launches from 56 to 112 - 56 = 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112.

Wait, 56 + 7*7 = 56 + 49 = 105, then 112.

So, 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112. That's 9 fireworks.

From second installation: launches from 56 to 112 - 56 = 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112.

That's 8 fireworks.

Total 9 + 8 = 17 fireworks visible at time 112.

So, in this case, m = 56, which is larger than both a and b.

So, it seems that when m is larger than both a and b, the number of fireworks visible at the same time can be more than 2.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If m < a and m < b, then maximum is 2.

- If m >= a and m < b, then maximum is number of fireworks from first installation plus number of fireworks from second installation that are visible at the same time.

- Similarly for m >= b and m < a.

- If m >= a and m >= b, then it's the sum of the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at the same time.

But I need a more precise way to calculate this.

Let me think about it mathematically.

I need to find a time x where the number of fireworks visible is maximized.

A firework launched at time t is visible at time x if t <= x <= t + m.

So, for the first installation, the fireworks are launched at ka for k = 1,2,3,...

For the second installation, at lb for l = 1,2,3,...

So, at time x, the number of fireworks visible is:

Number of ka such that ka <= x <= ka + m (i.e., ka <= x <= ka + m)

Similarly for lb.

So, for the first installation, the number of ka where ka <= x <= ka + m.

Which is equivalent to ka <= x and x <= ka + m.

But since ka <= x <= ka + m, and ka is a multiple of a, this can be rewritten as:

ka <= x <= ka + m.

Similarly for lb.

But this seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many launches from each installation have x within their visibility period.

For the first installation, the number of k where ka <= x <= ka + m.

Which is the same as floor((x - m)/a) <= k <= floor(x/a).

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

The number of ka where ka <= x <= ka + m.

This is equivalent to x - m <= ka <= x.

Because ka <= x and ka >= x - m.

Since ka is a multiple of a, ka = floor((x)/a) * a, but I need to find the range of k where ka is in [x - m, x].

So, k starts from ceil((x - m)/a) to floor(x/a).

Similarly for lb.

So, the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at x is floor(x/a) - ceil((x - m)/a) + 1.

Similarly for the second installation.

Therefore, total fireworks visible at x is:

floor(x/a) - ceil((x - m)/a) + 1 + floor(x/b) - ceil((x - m)/b) + 1.

But I need to maximize this over x.

But x can be up to m + max(a, b), but m can be up to 10^18, so I can't iterate over x.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time x is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation visible at x, minus any overlaps if they launch at the same time.

But since the installations launch at different times unless a and b have a common multiple within m.

But I need to find the maximum possible sum.

Wait, perhaps I can find the time x where the number of visible fireworks is maximized by choosing x such that it aligns with as many launches as possible.

But given the large values, I need a formula-based approach.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case: 6 7 4

Output: 2

Second test case: 3 4 10

Output:7

Third test case:7 8 56

Output:17

Looking at the first test case, m = 4, which is less than both a and b.

Hence, only two fireworks can be visible at the same time, one from each installation.

In the second test case, m = 10, which is greater than a and b.

So, more than two fireworks can be visible at the same time.

Similarly, in the third test case, m =56, which is greater than a and b.

So, the number of visible fireworks is higher.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

If m < a and m < b, then maximum visible is 2.

Else, it's floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2.

Wait, but in the third test case, m =56, a=7, b=8.

floor(56/7) = 8, floor(56/8) =7, so 8 +7 +2 =17, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second test case, m=10, a=3, b=4.

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3+2+2=7, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, m=4, a=6, b=7.

Since m < a and m < b, maximum is 2.

So, the formula seems to be:

If m < a and m < b, then 2.

Else, floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, m=4, a=6, b=7.

floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0+0+2=2, which matches.

In the second test case, m=10, a=3, b=4.

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3+2+2=7, which matches.

In the third test case, m=56, a=7, b=8.

floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8+7+2=17, which matches.

So, this seems to be the correct formula.

Let me verify with another example.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=5.

Then, floor(5/2)=2, floor(5/3)=1, so 2+1+2=5.

Is this correct?

Launch times:

First installation: 2,4,6,...

Second installation:3,6,9,...

Visibility:

m=5, so each firework is visible from t to t+5.

At time 6:

Fireworks launched at 2 are visible from 2 to7.

At 4: from4 to9.

At6: from6 to11.

From second installation:

3:3 to8.

6:6 to11.

9:9 to14.

So, at time6:

Fireworks from first installation:2,4,6.

From second installation:3,6.

Total:5 fireworks, which matches the formula.

Another example:

a=1, b=1, m=1.

Then, floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1+1+2=4.

At time1:

Fireworks from first installation:1 to2.

Second installation:1 to2.

At time1: both installations launch, and their fireworks are visible from1 to2.

So, at time1: two fireworks from each installation are visible, total4.

At time2: fireworks from first installation launched at1 and2 are visible.

From second installation: fireworks launched at1 and2 are visible.

So, again4 fireworks.

So, maximum is4, which matches the formula.

Another example:

a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000.

Then, floor(m/a)=1000000000000000000, floor(m/b)=1000000000000000000.

So, 1000000000000000000 +1000000000000000000 +2 =2000000000000000002, which matches the last sample output.

So, the formula seems consistent.

Hence, the program provided is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
