Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate, and they're sorted in ascending order. So, a1 < a2 < ... < an.

The distance between any two cities x and y is simply the absolute difference between their coordinates, |a_x - a_y|.

For each city, there's a concept of the "closest city." For a given city i, its closest city is the one where the distance to it is not greater than the distance to any other city. And importantly, for every city, this closest city is unique.

So, for example, if we have cities at positions [0, 8, 12, 15, 20], then:

- City 1 (at 0) has city 2 (at 8) as its closest city.

- City 2 (at 8) has city 3 (at 12).

- City 3 (at 12) has city 4 (at 15).

- City 4 (at 15) has city 3 (at 12).

- City 5 (at 20) has city 4 (at 15).

Makes sense because the distances are:

- From 0 to 8: 8

- From 8 to 12: 4

- From 12 to 15: 3

- From 15 to 20: 5

So, for city 1 (0), the closest is city 2 (8) since 8 is closer than 12, which would be 12 - 0 = 12.

Similarly, for city 2 (8), city 3 (12) is closer than city 1 (0) because 12 - 8 = 4 vs. 8 - 0 = 8.

For city 3 (12), city 4 (15) is closer: 15 - 12 = 3, which is less than 12 - 8 = 4.

For city 4 (15), city 3 (12) is closer: 15 - 12 = 3 vs. 20 - 15 = 5.

For city 5 (20), city 4 (15) is closer: 20 - 15 = 5 vs. 20 - 12 = 8.

Got it.

Now, the problem allows two types of moves:

1. Travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the distance |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying only 1 coin.

And we need to handle m queries, each asking for the minimum coins needed to go from city x to city y.

Constraints:

- T (number of test cases) is up to 10^4.

- N (number of cities per test case) is up to 10^5.

- M (number of queries per test case) is up to 10^5.

- The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and similarly for M.

So, it's crucial to optimize the solution because with T=10^4 and N or M=10^5, a naive approach would be too slow.

First thoughts:

In each query, we need the minimal cost to go from x to y using the two types of moves.

Option 1: Direct move from x to y, paying |a_x - a_y|.

Option 2: Move from x to its closest city, paying 1, and then proceed to y in some way.

But since we can use both types of moves, we might need to combine them strategically.

Wait, actually, we can use the second move multiple times. The problem says "you can travel to the city which is the closest to x, paying 1 coin." So, from any city, you can choose to either go directly to any other city with the distance cost or go to its closest city for 1 coin.

So, in the example given:

- From city 1, go to city 2 for 1 coin.

- From city 2, go to city 3 for 1 coin.

- From city 3, go to city 4 for 1 coin.

Total cost: 3 coins to go from 1 to 4.

Alternatively, from city 1 to city 4 directly: |0 - 15| = 15 coins, which is worse.

Another option: from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins.

Same as above.

But in the second query, from city 1 to city 5:

Option 1: Directly, |0 - 20| = 20 coins.

Option 2: Go from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), city 4 to city 5 (5 coins, since 15 to 20 is 5), total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins.

But in the example, it says the output is 8 for the second query.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says:

"You can travel from city 1 to city 4 using 3 coins, and then from city 4 to city 5 for 5 coins, totaling 8 coins."

So, that matches.

But is there a better way?

Let's see.

Another path: city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), city 3 to city 5 (|12 - 20| = 8 coins), total: 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 coins, which is worse.

Or city 1 to city 3 directly: |0 - 12| = 12 coins, worse.

So, the minimal is indeed 8 coins for going from city 1 to city 5.

Alright, now, to generalize this.

I need to find the minimal cost path from x to y, where in each step, I can either go directly to any city for the distance cost or to the closest city for 1 coin.

I need an efficient way to compute this for multiple queries per test case, given the constraints.

First, I need to understand the structure of these moves.

Let me think about the graph formed by these possible moves.

Each city x has an edge to every other city y with weight |a_x - a_y|.

Additionally, each city x has an edge to its closest city z with weight 1.

Given that, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with N up to 1e5 and M up to 1e5, and T up to 1e4, but with the sum of N and M across all test cases being 1e5, I need an approach that is fast per query.

Building a graph with N nodes and N + N edges (each node has one additional edge to its closest city) would still be too slow for shortest path calculations per query.

Even Dijkstra's algorithm per query would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Since the cities are on a number line and sorted in ascending order, perhaps I can exploit the properties of the number line.

Let me consider that the cities are arranged in order, and the closest city for each is either the previous or the next one, depending on which is closer.

Wait, actually, from the problem statement, it's given that for each city, the closest city is unique, so there's no ambiguity.

So, for each city, we can precompute its closest city.

Let me denote closest[i] as the index of the closest city to city i.

Given that, we can model the moves:

- Move from any city x to any city y: cost |a_x - a_y|.

- Move from city x to closest[x]: cost 1.

Our goal is, for each query (x, y), find the minimal cost path from x to y using these moves.

Given the constraints, a standard shortest path algorithm would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is a way to traverse the cities at a cheaper cost, but it's still 1 coin per step.

While moving directly to any city costs the distance between them.

I need to balance between these two options.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path would involve moving to the closest city repeatedly until I'm "close enough" to the target, and then make a direct move.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and edges to all other cities with cost equal to the distance.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path in this graph from x to y.

But with N up to 1e5 and M up to 1e5, and T up to 1e4, but with the sum of N and M across all test cases being 1e5, I need an approach that is faster than running Dijkstra's for each query.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the target in a cheaper way, but since the closest city is unique for each city, perhaps there's a way to model this as some kind of tree or hierarchical structure.

Wait, actually, since each city has exactly one closest city, this forms a tree where each city points to its closest city.

So, we can build a tree where each node has a parent, which is its closest city.

Then, the root of the tree would be a city that is its own closest city, but according to the problem, that can't happen because for every city, the closest city is another city.

So, there is no city where closest[i] = i.

Hence, the tree doesn't have a root in the traditional sense, but we can choose an arbitrary city as the root and proceed.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of this tree.

Given that, moving to the closest city is like moving to the parent in the tree with cost 1.

And moving to any other city is like jumping directly with cost equal to the distance.

I need to find a path from x to y using these moves with minimal cost.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in this tree, the path from x to y goes through their lowest common ancestor or something like that.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number line.

Since the cities are on a number line and sorted, maybe I can find a way to calculate the minimal cost based on their positions.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to the neighboring city that's closest, for a cost of 1.

While moving directly to any city costs the distance.

So, in a way, it's similar to moving step by step towards the target, but with the option to make a direct long jump at the cost of the distance.

I need to find the minimal cost to go from x to y using these options.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path would involve a sequence of moves to closest cities until I'm "close" to y, and then make a direct move to y.

But I need to define what "close" means.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the distance between x and y minus the sum of the costs of moving to closest cities along the path.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the example given:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

Queries:

1. 1 to 4: minimal cost 3

2. 1 to 5: minimal cost 8

3. 3 to 4: minimal cost 1

4. 3 to 2: minimal cost 4

5. 5 to 1: minimal cost 14

Let's see:

For 1 to 4:

- Move from 1 to 2 (cost 1), then 2 to 3 (cost 1), then 3 to 4 (cost 1), total 3.

Alternatively, directly from 1 to 4: |0 - 15| = 15, which is worse.

For 1 to 5:

- Move from 1 to 2 (1), 2 to 3 (1), 3 to 4 (1), 4 to 5 (5), total 8.

Directly from 1 to 5: |0 - 20| = 20, worse.

For 3 to 4:

- Move from 3 to 4 (cost 1).

Directly: |12 - 15| = 3, so paying 1 is better.

For 3 to 2:

- Move from 3 to 2 (|12 - 8| = 4).

Alternatively, 3 to 4 (1), 4 to 3 (1), but that's not helpful.

So, directly 3 to 2 is better.

Wait, but according to the problem, in this case, moving directly is better.

For 5 to 1:

- Move from 5 to 4 (5), then 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 2 (1), 2 to 1 (1), total 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

But the example says 14.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the example output, it's 14 for the last query.

Wait, perhaps the path is different.

Wait, maybe from 5 to 4 (5), then from 4 to 1 (|15 - 0| = 15), which is 5 + 15 = 20, which is worse than directly from 5 to 1 (20).

But the example says 14.

Wait, perhaps another path: 5 to 4 (5), 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 2 (1), 2 to 1 (1), total 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

But the example says 14.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, looking back at the problem, in the example output, it's:

3

8

1

4

14

But according to my calculation, it should be 8 for the last one.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let's see:

From 5 to 1:

Option 1: Directly, |20 - 0| = 20.

Option 2: 5 to 4 (5), 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 2 (1), 2 to 1 (1), total 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

Is there a way to get a cost of 14? Maybe I misread the example.

Wait, perhaps in the explanation, it's different.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"You can travel from city 1 to city 4 using 3 coins, and then from city 4 to city 5 for 5 coins, totaling 8 coins."

But in the output, it's 14 for the last query.

Wait, maybe I misread the query.

Wait, the last query is 5 to 1.

Wait, perhaps in the example, it's different.

Wait, in the example input:

1

5

0 8 12 15 20

5

1 4

1 5

3 4

3 2

5 1

Output:

3

8

1

4

14

But according to my calculation, it should be 8 for the last one, but the output is 14.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the way the closest cities are defined.

Wait, for city 5 (20), closest is city 4 (15).

For city 4 (15), closest is city 3 (12).

For city 3 (12), closest is city 4 (15).

Wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it says:

"For example, if the cities are located in points [0,8,12,15,20], then:

- the closest city to city 1 is city 2

- the closest city to city 2 is city 3

- the closest city to city 3 is city 4

- the closest city to city 4 is city 3

- the closest city to city 5 is city 4"

So, closest[1] = 2

closest[2] = 3

closest[3] = 4

closest[4] = 3

closest[5] = 4

So, from city 5 to city 4: closest city is 4, so moving to 4 costs 1.

From city 4 to city 3: closest city is 3, so moving to 3 costs 1.

From city 3 to city 2: closest city is 4, but to go to 2, which is closer, |12-8|=4, so moving directly to 2 costs 4.

Then from city 2 to city 1: closest city is 3, but to go to 1, |8-0|=8, but closest city is 3, which is farther away.

Wait, perhaps in the last query, 5 to 1, the minimal cost path is:

5 to 4 (1 coin), 4 to 3 (1 coin), 3 to 4 (1 coin), 4 to 3 (1 coin), 3 to 2 (1 coin), 2 to 1 (1 coin), totaling 6 coins.

But that's worse than the direct path of 8 coins.

Wait, but according to the example output, it's 14, which doesn't match my calculations.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps moving to the closest city is not the only option; perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x. Then you can perform one of the following actions:

- travel to any other city y, paying |a_x - a_y| coins;

- travel to the city which is the closest to x, paying 1 coin."

So, from any city x, you can either go directly to any city y for |a_x - a_y| coins, or go to the closest city for 1 coin.

So, in the path, you can mix these two types of moves.

In the last query, 5 to 1:

Option 1: Directly from 5 to 1: 20 coins.

Option 2: 5 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 1 (15 coins), total 16 coins.

Option 3: 5 to 4 (1 coin), 4 to 3 (1 coin), 3 to 2 (1 coin), 2 to 1 (1 coin), total 4 coins.

Wait, but according to the example output, it's 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps in the example, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that moving to the closest city might not always be the best option.

Wait, maybe there's a better path.

Wait, perhaps moving from 5 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 3 (1 coin), then from 3 to 2 (1 coin), then from 2 to 1 (1 coin), total 4 coins.

But according to the example output, it's 14 coins.

Wait, maybe the example is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that you can only move to the closest city once.

Wait, no, the problem allows you to choose either move type at each step.

Wait, perhaps in the example, they took a different path.

Wait, maybe moving from 5 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 0 (15 coins), total 16 coins.

But that's worse than 20 coins.

Wait, perhaps moving from 5 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 3 (1 coin), then from 3 to 1 (12 - 0 = 12 coins), total 1 + 1 + 12 = 14 coins.

Ah, that matches the example output of 14.

So, that must be the minimal cost path.

Hence, for the last query, 5 to 1, the minimal cost is 14 coins.

Got it.

So, in this path, we go from 5 to 4 (1), then 4 to 3 (1), then 3 to 1 (12), totaling 14 coins.

Better than going directly (20 coins) or going through 4, 3, 2, 1 (4 coins).

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, going through 4, 3, 2, 1 would cost 4 coins, which is better than 14.

But according to the example, it's 14.

Perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps moving from 3 to 1 is not allowed or costs more.

Wait, no, you can move directly from any city to any other city for the distance cost.

So, from 3 to 1, it's |12 - 0| = 12 coins.

Hence, 5 to 4 (1), 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 1 (12), total 14.

But why not 5 to 4 (1), 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 2 (1), 2 to 1 (1), total 4 coins?

Is that allowed?

Wait, yes, that should be allowed.

Perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing some constraint.

Wait, perhaps moving to the closest city is only allowed once.

But no, the problem allows you to choose at each step which type of move to make.

Hence, you can choose to move to the closest city multiple times.

Hence, the path 5 to 4 (1), 4 to 3 (1), 3 to 2 (1), 2 to 1 (1), total 4 coins should be possible.

But according to the example, it's 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the example.

Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"For each city i, let's define the closest city j as the city such that the distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each other city k."

"And the closest city is unique for each city."

Hence, for city 3 (12), the closest city is city 4 (15), because |12-15|=3, which is less than |12-8|=4.

Hence, closest[3]=4.

Similarly, for city 4 (15), closest[4]=3, since |15-12|=3 is less than |15-20|=5.

So, in the path 5 to 4 (1 coin), 4 to 3 (1 coin), 3 to 2 (1 coin), 2 to 1 (1 coin), total 4 coins.

But according to the example, it's 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, moving to the closest city is only allowed if it's closer to the target.

But no, the problem allows you to choose to move to the closest city regardless.

Hence, I'm confused about the example output being 14 when a path of 4 coins exists.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps moving to the closest city is only allowed once.

But no, the problem doesn't say that.

Hence, I think there might be a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

I need to consider that perhaps moving to the closest city is not always beneficial.

But in this case, moving through the closest cities seems to give a better path.

Hence, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimal cost path where you can choose to move to the closest city for 1 coin or move directly to any city for the distance cost, but you have to choose one of these options at each step.

Hence, in the path, you can't mix moving to closest cities and direct moves in a way that's not sequential.

Wait, no, the problem allows you to choose at each step which type of move to make.

Hence, you can choose to move to the closest city multiple times, or make direct moves as needed.

Hence, the path with 4 coins should be valid.

But according to the example, it's 14 coins.

Perhaps it's a typo in the example.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

I need to consider the problem constraints and find an efficient solution.

Given the time constraints, I need an approach that can handle up to 10^5 queries per test case, with a sum of M over all test cases up to 10^5.

Hence, per query, the time complexity should be O(1) or O(log N).

I need to precompute something that allows fast query answering.

Let me consider precomputing for each city, the minimal cost to reach other cities.

But with N up to 1e5, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the minimal cost from each city to all other cities, but that's too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and edges to all other cities with weight equal to the distance.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the shortest path in this graph.

But with N up to 1e5 and M up to 1e5, building such a graph and running Dijkstra's per query is too slow.

Hence, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the target in a cheaper way.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost being the distance between x and y minus the sum of the minimal distances to the closest cities along the path.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path will involve moving to the closest city repeatedly until I reach a city from which I can make a direct move to y with a cost that's better than continuing to move to closest cities.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of moves to get close to y and then make a direct jump.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider precomputing for each city, the minimal cost to reach it from any other city.

But that's too broad.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost being the minimal between the direct distance and the cost of moving to closest cities until reaching y.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using dynamic programming.

Define dp[x] as the minimal cost to reach y from x.

Then, dp[x] = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + dp[closest[x]]).

But with N up to 1e5, this is still too slow to compute for each x.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city, the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and compute the cumulative cost.

Then, for a query, I can find the minimal cost by combining these precomputed costs.

Let me think about this.

Let me define for each city x, a path generated by repeatedly moving to its closest city, recording the sequence of cities and the cumulative cost.

But given that closest cities can form cycles, this path might loop.

Hence, I need to handle cycles.

Wait, in the problem, it's guaranteed that the closest city is unique for each city, so the graph is a collection of trees where each node points to its closest city.

Wait, actually, since closest city is unique and not necessarily pointing to a parent, it can form cycles or trees.

Wait, in the example, closest[3]=4 and closest[4]=3, so there's a cycle between 3 and 4.

Hence, it's not a tree.

Hence, it's a graph with possible cycles.

Hence, I need to handle cycles.

This complicates things.

I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost from x to y considering that I can move to the closest city for 1 coin or directly to any city for the distance cost.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like paying 1 coin to make a step towards the target, but each step might not necessarily bring me closer in terms of the number line.

Given that, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal number of steps to move to the closest city plus the direct distance to y from some point.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all sequences of moves where I can choose to move directly to y at any point.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimal over all k of (cost to go from x to some city z_k using moves to closest city, plus the direct distance from z_k to y).

So, minimal cost = min over z (cost from x to z using closest city moves + |a_z - a_y|)

Hence, I need to find the minimal over all z of (cost from x to z using closest city moves + |a_z - a_y|)

Now, if I can precompute for each x, the set of all z that can be reached from x using moves to closest city and their corresponding costs, then for each query, I can find the minimal cost.

But with N up to 1e5, this is still too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city repeatedly will lead to some "core" city or a cycle.

Hence, I can precompute for each city, the minimal cost to reach its "core" city, which is the city that is part of a cycle or is its own closest city.

Wait, but according to the problem, no city is its own closest city, since for every city, the closest city is unique and different.

Hence, there are no self-loops.

Hence, the graph of closest city moves is a collection of trees with possible cycles.

Wait, more precisely, it's a directed graph where each node points to its closest city.

Hence, it can have cycles, and trees where the root points to a cycle.

In such a graph, the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all paths from x to y using these directed edges (each costing 1) and the option to make a direct jump to y at any point.

This seems complicated.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in the graph with cost 1, and moving directly to y is like paying the distance cost.

Hence, in the path from x to y, I can make a series of moves to closest cities and at some point decide to make a direct move to y.

Hence, the total cost would be the number of moves to closest cities plus the direct distance to y from the city where I decide to make the direct move.

So, to minimize this, I need to choose the city z along the path from x to y via closest city moves where the sum of the number of moves to z plus the direct distance from z to y is minimized.

Hence, minimal cost = min over z (cost from x to z using closest city moves + |a_z - a_y|)

Now, if I can precompute for each x, the sequence of cities reachable by moving to closest cities and the cost to reach them, then for each y, I can find the minimal sum.

But with N up to 1e5, this seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the concept of jumping in a number line.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like making a step of 1 coin towards a neighboring city that's closest.

Wait, but the closest city might not be neighboring in the number line sense.

Wait, given that the cities are on a number line and sorted, perhaps I can consider moving left or right to the closest city.

Wait, but the closest city could be either left or right.

Let me consider that for each city, its closest city is either the previous one or the next one, depending on which is closer.

Hence, for each city i, closest[i] is either i-1 or i+1, whichever is closer.

Wait, but in the example, city 3 (12) has city 4 (15) as its closest city, even though city 2 (8) is at distance 4 and city 4 is at distance 3.

Hence, closest[3]=4.

Similarly, closest[4]=3.

Hence, it's not necessarily the immediate neighbor that's closer.

Wait, but in sorted order, it's the neighbor that's closer.

Wait, no, in this case, city 3's closest is city 4, which is the next one, since 15-12=3 is less than 12-8=4.

Hence, it's moving to the next city.

Similarly, city 4's closest is city 3, since 15-12=3 is less than 20-15=5.

Hence, it's moving to the previous city.

Hence, the direction depends on which one is closer.

Hence, for each city, moving to its closest city is either moving left or right.

Hence, moving to closest city is like moving one step left or right, but the direction is determined by which neighbor is closer.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city (either left or right) with cost 1, and edges to all other cities with cost equal to the distance.

Then, finding the minimal cost path from x to y in this graph.

But again, with N up to 1e5 and M up to 1e5, building such a graph and running Dijkstra's per query is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly will eventually lead me to a city that is closest to y.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute for each city, the minimal number of moves to reach y, considering the option to make a direct move at any step.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost being the minimal over all k of (k + |a_z - a_y|), where z is reachable from x in k moves using the closest city moves.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, but in reality, it might not always be the case, since the closest city could be in the opposite direction.

Hence, I need to handle this carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of the minimal cost being the distance between x and y minus the maximal reduction obtained by moving to closest cities.

But I'm stuck.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can precompute the minimal cost to reach y.

But that's too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city, the minimal cost to reach the leftmost city and the rightmost city, and then for any query, I can compute the minimal cost based on that.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number line and prefix sums.

Let me define for each city, the minimal cost to reach it from the first city.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where cities are connected in a tree structure based on their closest city, and then compute some kind of LCA-based distances.

But with cycles present, it's not a tree.

Hence, it's a graph with cycles, and finding shortest paths in such a graph is still time-consuming.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path will involve moving to the closest city until I'm in a city where the direct move to y is cheaper than continuing to move to closest cities.

Hence, I can precompute for each city, the minimal cost to reach y using direct moves from that city.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all z of (cost from x to z using closest city moves + |a_z - a_y|).

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is beneficial only if it reduces the distance to y by more than 1 coin.

Wait, that is, if moving to the closest city reduces the distance by more than 1, then it's better to move to the closest city and pay 1 coin, rather than paying the full distance.

Hence, as long as moving to the closest city reduces the distance by more than 1, it's better to do so.

Once the reduction is less than or equal to 1, it's better to make a direct move.

Hence, the minimal cost path would involve moving to the closest city as long as the distance reduction is greater than 1, and then making a direct move to y.

Hence, the minimal cost is the sum of the costs of moving to closest cities until the distance reduction is <=1, plus the remaining distance.

Let me formalize this.

Let current_position = x

Initialize total_cost = 0

While distance from current_position to y > some_threshold:

move to closest city

total_cost += 1

distance_reduction = previous_distance - new_distance

if distance_reduction <=1:

break

Then, total_cost += remaining_distance

But this seems too vague and not efficient for implementation.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible k of (k + |a_z - a_y|), where z is reachable from x in k moves using the closest city moves.

Hence, I need to find the z along the path from x to y via closest city moves that minimizes k + |a_z - a_y|.

I need to find the z that is "closest" to y in terms of the sum of moves to z and the direct distance to y.

This resembles the A* search algorithm, where you minimize the sum of the path cost so far and the heuristic estimate to the goal.

But implementing A* per query is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, reducing the distance by at least 1.

Wait, but in reality, moving to the closest city might not necessarily reduce the distance to y by more than 1.

Hence, in such cases, it's better to make a direct move.

Hence, perhaps the minimal cost is the distance between x and y minus the maximal reduction obtained by moving to closest cities.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city, the minimal number of moves to reach y via closest city moves, and then the minimal cost is the minimal over all z of (number of moves from x to z + |a_z - a_y|).

But this seems too slow.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the distance between x and y minus the sum of the minimal distances saved by moving to closest cities.

But I need to make this precise.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city, the minimal distance to y using the closest city moves.

Wait, but this is still too vague.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path will involve moving to the closest city until I reach a city where moving directly to y is cheaper than continuing to move to closest cities.

Hence, I can define for each city z, the cost to reach y as min(|a_z - a_y|, 1 + cost_to_reach_y_from_closest[z])

Then, I can compute this recursively.

But with N up to 1e5, this is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all paths of the form: move to closest city k times, then make a direct move to y.

Hence, minimal cost = min over k of (k + |a_z - a_y|), where z is the city reached after k moves to closest city from x.

Hence, I need to find the z along the path from x to y via closest city moves that minimizes (number of moves from x to z + |a_z - a_y|)

This seems similar to the shortest path problem, but I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using two pointers or something similar on the number line.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a city that's closer to y in terms of distance, but not necessarily in a straight line.

Hence, it's like making a step towards y, but possibly not the most direct step.

Hence, the minimal cost path would be to move to closest cities until I'm "close enough" to y, and then make a direct move.

But I need to define "close enough."

Wait, perhaps "close enough" means that the remaining distance is less than or equal to the number of moves made so far.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal number of moves to reach a city z such that |a_z - a_y| <= some_value.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city, the minimal cost to reach y using only moves to closest city.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all z of (cost from x to z using closest city moves + |a_z - a_y|)

But again, this seems too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like paying 1 coin to reduce the distance to y by some amount.

Hence, the minimal cost is the distance divided by the reduction per move.

But this is too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming.

Define dp[x] as the minimal cost to reach y from x.

Then, dp[x] = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + dp[closest[x]])
