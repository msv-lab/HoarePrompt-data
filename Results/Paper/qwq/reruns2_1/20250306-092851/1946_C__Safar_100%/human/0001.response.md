Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

The problem is asking for the largest x such that after removing exactly k edges, all resulting connected components have at least x vertices. So, I need to ensure that no component is smaller than x after the removal.

Let's think about the constraints:

- n can be up to 10^5, and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 10^5. So, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) per test case or better.

- k is between 1 and n-1, inclusive.

I need to maximize x, which means I need to find the largest possible x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds like a binary search problem on x, where for each candidate x, I check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

So, I can perform a binary search on x, from 1 to n//k (since if I want k components, each with at least x vertices, then x cannot be larger than n/k).

Wait, actually, since n and k can be such that n/k is not an integer, I should set the upper bound of x to floor(n/(k+1)) because after removing k edges, I can have up to k+1 components. But I need to verify this.

Let me think differently. In a tree, removing k edges will always result in exactly k+1 connected components. So, I'm guaranteed to have k+1 components after removing k edges.

Therefore, I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, I need to maximize x such that all k+1 components have at least x vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges.

Given that, the total number of vertices is n, and I have k+1 components each with at least x vertices, so (k+1)*x <= n.

Therefore, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

But I need to check if it's possible to achieve this x by removing exactly k edges.

Wait, but the problem examples suggest that sometimes the answer is less than floor(n/(k+1)), so I need to find the maximum x where it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

So, binary search on x seems appropriate.

In the binary search:

- For a given x, I need to check if I can remove exactly k edges such that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

- If I can, then I try a larger x; if I can't, I try a smaller x.

I need to implement this check efficiently.

Now, thinking about how to implement the check function.

Given a tree, I need to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

One way to approach this is to perform a DFS on the tree and keep track of the subtree sizes.

During the DFS, I can compute the size of each subtree.

Then, I can consider removing edges that separate subtrees of size at least x.

But I need to ensure that after removing exactly k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Another approach is to consider that in a tree, removing an edge always increases the number of connected components by exactly one.

So, starting from one component (the whole tree), removing one edge splits it into two components, removing a second edge splits one of those two into three, and so on.

I need to remove exactly k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to make the components as balanced as possible.

But balancing in a tree is not straightforward.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, there's a binary search on x, from 1 to n//k.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, removing k edges results in k+1 components, so perhaps it should be n//(k+1).

But in the code, it's n//k.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me verify with the example.

In the first example:

n=5, k=1

So, removing 1 edge results in 2 components.

The answer is 2, which is floor(5/2)=2.

So, n//(k+1)=5//2=2, which matches.

But in the code, it's n//k=5//1=5, which is too big.

In the code, it sets r=n//k, but in the first example, n//k=5//1=5, but the correct answer is 2.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

l = 1

r = n // k

But in the first example, n=5, k=1, so r=5, but the correct answer is 2.

So, perhaps it should be n//(k+1).

Let me check for another example.

Third example:

n=6, k=1

Removing 1 edge results in 2 components.

The answer is 3, which is floor(6/2)=3.

n//(k+1)=6//2=3, which is correct.

n//k=6//1=6, which is too big.

Another example:

n=3, k=1

Answer is 1.

n//(k+1)=3//2=1, which is correct.

n//k=3//1=3, which is too big.

Another example:

n=8, k=2

Answer is 1.

n//(k+1)=8//3=2, but the answer is 1.

Wait, but 1 is less than 2, so perhaps it's not n//(k+1).

Wait, no, in this case, n//(k+1)=2, but the answer is 1, which is less.

So, perhaps n//(k+1) is just an upper bound, but it's not always achievable.

So, perhaps setting r=n//k is wrong, and it should be n//(k+1).

But in the first example, n=5, k=1, n//(k+1)=2, which is correct.

n//k=5//1=5, which is too big.

So, the code is likely wrong in setting r=n//k.

I think it should be r=n//(k+1).

Let me check the constraints again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"the size of each remaining connected component is at least x"

and we need to remove exactly k edges.

Given that removing k edges results in k+1 components.

So, we need each of the k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

Therefore, (k+1)*x <= n.

So, x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

Therefore, the upper bound for x is floor(n/(k+1)).

So, in the binary search, r should be set to floor(n/(k+1)), not n//k.

So, there might be a mistake in the reference solution.

Wait, in the code, it's r = n // k.

But in the first example, n=5, k=1, 5//1=5, but the correct answer is 2.

So, it's possible that the code is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the code handles it correctly in some other way, but just the initialization of r is incorrect.

Looking further into the code, in the check function, there's a DFS-like traversal.

Let me try to understand what the check function is doing.

In the check function:

- It performs a DFS starting from node 1.

- It keeps track of the subtree sizes in dictionary d.

- For each node, it calculates the subtree size.

- Then, it counts the number of subtrees with size at least A (the current x being tested), and increments r.

- Finally, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k).

- If this condition is true, it returns True; else, False.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me try to rephrase it.

In the check function:

- It performs a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- For each node, it calculates the subtree size including itself.

- It counts how many subtrees have size at least A.

- If the number of such subtrees is greater than k, or if the remaining tree (after removing those subtrees) has size at least A, then it returns True.

But I'm not entirely sure if this correctly checks whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges to get components of at least x vertices each.

I think there might be a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the problem differently.

In a tree, removing k edges will always result in k+1 connected components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices in all components should be n, and each component has at least x vertices.

Hence, (k+1)*x <= n.

Therefore, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

But I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges to achieve this.

However, in some cases, floor(n/(k+1)) might not be achievable, so I need to find the maximum x <= floor(n/(k+1)) that allows me to remove exactly k edges to get components of at least x vertices each.

So, I can perform a binary search on x from 1 to floor(n/(k+1)).

For each x, I need to check if I can remove exactly k edges such that all resulting k+1 components have at least x vertices.

To implement the check function efficiently, I need a way to count how many components of size at least x I can get by removing edges.

In a tree, this can be done by finding and removing subtrees of size at least x.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a DFS to find subtrees of size at least x and count how many such subtrees I can get by removing edges.

If the number of such subtrees is greater than or equal to k+1, then it's possible to remove k edges to get at least k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But I need exactly k edges to be removed, resulting in exactly k+1 components.

So, I need to ensure that by removing k edges, I get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Wait, but in a tree, removing k edges always results in exactly k+1 components.

So, if I can find k+1 components each with at least x vertices, then it's possible.

Hence, in the check function, I need to count the number of subtrees with size at least x, and see if this count is at least k+1.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because the way edges are removed affects the sizes of the components.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of components with at least x vertices by removing up to k edges, and see if I can reach exactly k+1 components.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in trees, we can perform centroid decomposition, where we repeatedly remove nodes (or edges) such that the tree is divided into components of roughly half the size.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Another idea: since we need to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, I can think of selecting k edges to remove such that no component becomes smaller than x.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the number of small components.

Wait, but minimizing small components might not directly help.

Let me consider the minimal x first, and then try to increase it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the minimal component size when removing k edges, and maximize that minimal size.

This sounds similar to balancing the components.

But I need an efficient way to compute this.

Looking back at the reference solution, it seems to perform a DFS and keep track of subtree sizes, then check if the number of subtrees with size at least x is greater than k, or if the remaining tree has size at least x.

But I'm not entirely sure if this correctly captures the condition.

Maybe I need to verify the check function with an example.

Take the first example:

n=5, k=1

Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 3-4, 3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

   ├─4

   └─5

Now, let's try x=2.

In the check function:

- Perform DFS from node 1.

- Calculate subtree sizes:

  - Subtree of 1: 5

  - Subtree of 2: 1

  - Subtree of 3: 3

  - Subtree of 4: 1

  - Subtree of 5: 1

- Count r: number of subtrees with size >=2.

  - Subtree of 1: 5 >=2 → r=1

  - Subtree of 3: 3 >=2 → r=2

  - Other subtrees have size 1, so no.

- So, r=2.

- Check if r > k or (d[1] >= x and r == k)

- Here, r=2 > k=1, so return True.

- Hence, x=2 is possible.

- Now, try x=3.

- r=1 (only subtree of 1 has size >=3)

- Check if r > k or (d[1] >=3 and r == k)

- r=1 == k=1, and d[1]=5 >=3 → return True.

- So, x=3 should be acceptable, but in the example, the answer is 2.

- Wait, but according to this, x=3 should be acceptable, but the example answer is 2.

- So, perhaps the check function is not correct.

Wait, maybe I misread the condition.

Looking back at the check function in the code:

if r > k or (d[1] >= x and r == k):

return True

else:

return False

In the case of x=3:

r=1, k=1, d[1]=5 >=3 → return True

So, according to this, x=3 should be acceptable.

But in the example, the answer is 2.

So, perhaps the check function is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices, not just that there are at least k+1 subtrees with size at least x.

Perhaps the check function is not accurately capturing the condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to remove k edges to maximize the minimal size of the components.

I can perform a binary search on x, and for each x, check if I can remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

To check this, I can find the number of subtrees with size at least x, and see if this number is at most k+1.

Wait, no.

Actually, in a tree, removing k edges results in k+1 components.

I need all of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices.

So, I need to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But in the check function, it's counting the number of subtrees with size at least x and checking if this count is greater than k.

This seems inverted.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of components that have size less than x.

If I can have at most k components with size less than x, then I can remove k edges to merge those small components into larger ones.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a standard approach to this type of problem.

I recall that in trees, we can use the centroid decomposition, where we repeatedly remove centroids to divide the tree into components of roughly half the size.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Another idea: since removing k edges results in k+1 components, I need to ensure that none of these components is smaller than x.

So, I need to maximize x such that all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

This is equivalent to ensuring that the smallest among the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the size of the smallest component.

Wait, no, to maximize x, I need to maximize the minimal component size.

I need to find the largest x where it's possible to remove k edges such that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

This seems like a classic binary search problem on x, where for each x, I check if I can remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But I need an efficient way to perform this check.

An efficient way is needed because n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 1e5, so overall time complexity should be O(n log n).

Let me think about how to implement the check function correctly.

One way is:

- For a given x, find the maximum number of components, each with at least x vertices, that can be obtained by removing edges.

- If this number is at least k+1, then it's possible to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Wait, but in a tree, removing k edges always results in exactly k+1 components.

So, perhaps I need to find if there exists a set of k edges whose removal results in k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal x such that the tree can be divided into at most k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing at most k edges.

But I need exactly k edges to be removed.

This is confusing.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I perform a DFS and calculate subtree sizes.

Then, I can consider removing edges that separate subtrees of size at least x.

But I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

I need to find a way to count the number of components that would have at least x vertices after removing k edges.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a way to maximize the minimal component size by choosing which edges to remove.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

- Then, try to find the minimal component size when removing k edges.

- To maximize this minimal component size, I need to ensure that no component is smaller than x.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal subtree size that is at least x, and see how many such subtrees I can get.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the reference solution and see how it implements the check function.

In the check function:

- It performs a DFS starting from node 1, calculating subtree sizes.

- It counts r, the number of subtrees with size at least x.

- Finally, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >= x and r == k).

- If true, return True; else, False.

In the first example with x=3:

- Subtree sizes: 1->5, 2->1, 3->3, 4->1, 5->1

- r=2 (subtrees 1 and 3 have size >=3)

- k=1

- So, r > k is 2 > 1, which is True, so return True.

But in the example, the answer is 2, not 3.

So, perhaps this check function is too lenient and accepts x=3 as possible, but in reality, it's not possible to remove exactly one edge to get two components, both with at least 3 vertices.

Looking back at the first example:

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}. Sizes 2 and 3.

So, in this case, one component has size 2, which is less than 3.

Hence, it's not possible to remove one edge to get two components, each with at least 3 vertices.

Therefore, the check function is incorrect because it accepts x=3 as possible, but in reality, it's not possible.

So, the reference solution seems flawed.

I need to find a better way to implement the check function.

Let me think about what the correct condition should be.

Given that removing k edges results in k+1 components, I need to ensure that all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices in these k+1 components should be at least (k+1)*x.

But since the total number of vertices is n, I need (k+1)*x <= n.

Moreover, I need to ensure that there exists a way to remove exactly k edges to achieve this.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimal component size among the k+1 components after removing k edges, and maximize that minimal size.

This is similar to balancing the components as much as possible.

In other words, I need to maximize x such that the k+1 components all have at least x vertices.

To implement this, I can perform a binary search on x, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

To check this, I can find the minimal number of components that have at least x vertices when removing k edges.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix x, and I want to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

I can iterate through the tree and find edges whose removal would not create a component smaller than x.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Then, if this number is less than or equal to k, it's possible.

But I need to remove exactly k edges.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in trees, the diameter can be found, and perhaps removing edges along the diameter can balance the components.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: perform a BFS from a root and try to balance the components.

But time is limited, and I need to find a working solution.

Given that the reference solution might be incorrect, I need to find an alternative approach.

Perhaps I can consider that in a tree, the components formed by removing edges are unique and can be analyzed based on their sizes.

So, for a given x, I can find the maximal number of components with at least x vertices that can be formed by removing edges.

If this number is at least k+1, then it's possible to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But I need to implement this efficiently.

To do this, I can perform a DFS and try to group subtrees of size at least x.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Implement the binary search on x from 1 to floor(n/(k+1)).

- For each x, implement a check function that returns True if it's possible to remove k edges such that all k+1 components have at least x vertices.

- To implement the check function, perform a DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- Count how many subtrees have size at least x.

- If the number of such subtrees is at least k+1, then it's possible to remove k edges to get k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

- However, this might not always be correct, as seen in the first example.

Wait, in the first example, with x=3, there are two subtrees with size at least 3 (subtrees rooted at 1 and 3), but removing one edge doesn't allow both components to have at least 3 vertices.

So, this approach is flawed.

I need a better way to implement the check function.

Let me consider that in order to have all components with at least x vertices after removing k edges, I need to ensure that no component is smaller than x.

To ensure this, I need to remove edges in such a way that the smallest component formed is as large as possible.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the minimal largest subset in a tree, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through possible x values and for each x, try to find a way to remove k edges such that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But this seems too vague and not efficient enough for the time constraints.

Given the time constraints, I need to find an efficient way to solve this problem.

Since the reference solution might be incorrect, I need to find an alternative approach.

Perhaps I can consider the following:

- Perform a DFS and keep track of the subtree sizes.

- For a given x, find the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

- If this number is less than or equal to k, then it's possible.

- To find the minimal number of edges to remove, I can count the number of subtrees with size less than x and require that many edge removals.
