Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, and it's acyclic, meaning there are no loops. That's important because it means there's exactly one path between any two vertices.

So, the problem is to remove k edges to create k+1 connected components, and each of these components should have at least x vertices. I need to maximize x.

Let's think about how to approach this. Since the tree is acyclic, removing an edge will always increase the number of connected components by exactly one. So, removing k edges will result in k+1 connected components.

My goal is to maximize x, which is the minimum size of these k+1 components. In other words, I want all components to be as large as possible, but since I'm dealing with a tree, some components might naturally be smaller.

I recall that in optimization problems where I need to maximize a minimum value, binary search is often a good approach. So, perhaps I can perform a binary search on x, the minimum size of the components.

Let me formalize that. I'll set a lower bound l and an upper bound r for x. I'll start with l = 1 and r = n // k, since x can't be larger than n/k in general, but I need to be careful with this upper bound.

Wait, actually, since I'm removing k edges to create k+1 components, the average size of the components would be n/(k+1). But to maximize the minimum size, maybe n//k is a better upper bound. Hmm.

Let me think differently. The maximum possible x is the size of the smallest component when the tree is divided into k+1 components, and I need to maximize this minimum size.

I need to find the largest x such that it's possible to remove k edges and have all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To use binary search, I'll have a function that, given a value x, checks whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

If I can implement such a function, I can perform a binary search on x to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

So, the pseudocode would look like this:

Initialize l = 1, r = some upper limit

While l <= r:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if possible(mid):

l = mid + 1

else:

r = mid - 1

print(r)

Where possible(x) is a function that returns True if it's possible to remove k edges and have all components have at least x vertices, and False otherwise.

Now, I need to implement the possible(x) function.

How can I check if it's possible to remove k edges such that each component has at least x vertices?

One way is to perform a DFS on the tree and keep track of the sizes of the subtrees. If I can find k edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices, then possible(x) returns True.

But this sounds a bit vague. Let me think more concretely.

I recall that in trees, the size of a subtree can be calculated using DFS. So, I can perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, I need to decide which edges to remove to create components with at least x vertices.

Perhaps I can think of it as partitioning the tree into k+1 subtrees, each of size at least x, by removing k edges.

Alternatively, I can think of it as selecting k edges to remove such that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But I need a more efficient way to check this.

Wait, maybe I can use the idea of heavy-light decomposition or something similar, but that might be too complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

- Then, try to remove edges in such a way that the resulting components have at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, not more, not less.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can count the number of subtrees that have at least x vertices, and see if the number of such subtrees minus one is at least k.

Wait, not sure.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix x, and I want to remove edges to create components where each has at least x vertices.

I can think of it as removing edges that connect subtrees of size at least x.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove edges that, when removed, separate components where each resulting component has at least x vertices.

This is still a bit fuzzy.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand their approach.

In the given program, there's a function called func_1 that takes n, k, and edges as input.

It seems to set up the graph as an adjacency list.

Then, it initializes l = 1 and r = n // k, and performs a binary search between l and r.

For each mid value in the binary search, it calls a function check(mid) to see if it's possible to remove k edges such that each component has at least mid vertices.

If check(mid) returns True, it sets l = mid + 1; else, r = mid - 1.

Finally, it prints r, which should be the maximum x.

So, the key is the check function.

Let's look into the check function.

It seems to perform a DFS traversal using a stack, keeping track of the sizes of the subtrees.

It maintains a stack and a visited set, and for each node, it calculates the size of its subtree.

If the size of a subtree is at least A, it increments a counter r.

Otherwise, it adds the subtree size to the parent's size.

Finally, it checks if r > k or if the size of the root component is at least A and r == k.

If either condition is true, it returns True; else, False.

Wait, this seems to be counting the number of components that have at least A vertices after removing some edges.

But I'm not entirely sure how it correlates to removing exactly k edges.

Let me try to understand this approach.

It appears that in the check function, it's performing a DFS and accumulating subtree sizes.

If a subtree has size at least A, it's considered as a separate component, and r is incremented.

If a subtree has size less than A, its size is added to the parent's size.

At the end, it checks if the number of components (r) is greater than k, or if r == k and the root component has at least A vertices.

If r > k, that means there are more than k components with at least A vertices, which should be okay because I can choose to remove k edges.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

In a tree, removing k edges results in k+1 connected components.

I need to ensure that each of these k+1 components has at least x vertices.

So, the total number of components is fixed at k+1.

Therefore, I need to choose which k edges to remove to achieve this.

In the check function, it seems to be counting how many subtrees have size at least A, and if that count is greater than k, or equal to k with the root component also having at least A vertices, it returns True.

But I'm not sure if this accurately reflects the condition of removing exactly k edges.

Maybe I need to think in terms of selecting which edges to remove to maximize the minimum component size.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of components with at least A vertices should be less than or equal to k+1.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 5, k = 1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

├─2

└─3

  ├─4

  └─5

If I remove the edge 1-3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, x = 2 is possible.

The program's binary search would go like this:

l = 1, r = 5 // 1 = 5

Wait, n//k = 5//1 = 5, so r = 5

Check(5): is it possible to remove 1 edge such that each component has at least 5 vertices?

If I remove any edge, I get components of sizes 1 and 4, or 2 and 3, none have at least 5, so check(5) should return False.

So, r = 5 - 1 = 4

Check(4): similar, removing any edge doesn't result in components with at least 4 vertices.

So, r = 4 - 1 = 3

Check(3): removing edge 1-3 gives components {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both have at least 2, but 2 < 3, so maybe check(3) returns False.

Wait, but in the example, x=2 is possible, but check(3) seems to return False.

Wait, but according to the program, it should print r after the loop.

In the first iteration, l=1, r=5

mid = 3

check(3) is False, so r = 3 - 1 = 2

Now, l=1, r=2

mid = 1

check(1) is True (since with x=1, it's always possible)

So, l = 1 + 1 = 2

Now, l=2, r=2

mid = 2

check(2) is True (as per the example), so l = 2 + 1 = 3

Now, l=3 > r=2, so loop ends, print r=2, which matches the example.

Okay, so in this case, it works.

Let's see another example.

Take n=2, k=1

Edges:

1-2

So, removing the only edge, we get two components of size 1 each.

So, x=1 is possible, but x=2 is not.

According to the program:

l=1, r=2//1=2

mid=1

check(1) is True (since both components have at least 1)

So, l=1+1=2

Now, l=2, r=2

mid=2

check(2) is ??

If I remove the only edge, components are {1} and {2}, both have size 1, which is less than 2.

So, check(2) should return False.

Therefore, r=2-1=1

Now, l=2 > r=1, so print r=1, which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

Edges:

1-2

2-3

3-4

4-5

5-6

So, a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6

Removing any one edge will result in two components, one with 1 vertex and another with 5 vertices.

So, x=1 is possible, x=2 is not.

According to the program:

l=1, r=6//1=6

mid=3

check(3): removing any edge results in one component with size <3, so check(3)=False, r=3-1=2

Now, l=1, r=2

mid=1

check(1)=True, so l=1+1=2

Now, l=2, r=2

mid=2

check(2): removing any edge results in one component with size 1 <2, so check(2)=False, r=2-1=1

Now, l=2 > r=1, print r=1, which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

Another example:

n=3, k=1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

Removing edge 1-2 gives components {1,3} and {2}, both have at least 1 vertex.

x=1 is possible.

x=2: removing edge 1-2, component {2} has size 1 <2, not acceptable.

So, x=1 is the maximum.

According to the program:

l=1, r=3//1=3

mid=2

check(2): removing any edge results in a component with size 1 <2, so check(2)=False, r=2-1=1

Now, l=1, r=1

mid=1

check(1)=True, so l=1+1=2

Now, l=2 > r=1, print r=1, correct.

Another example:

n=8, k=2

Some tree structure.

I won't go into details, but assuming the program works correctly for the given examples.

So, the approach seems valid.

Now, let's look at the implementation details.

The program reads t test cases, reads n and k for each, reads n-1 edges, and calls func_1(n, k, edges).

In func_1, it builds the adjacency list g.

Then, it performs a binary search between l=1 and r=n//k.

In each iteration, it calls check(mid), and adjusts l or r accordingly.

Finally, it prints r.

In the check function, it performs a DFS using a stack, keeping track of visited nodes and subtree sizes.

It seems to be correctly simulating a DFS traversal.

It starts from node 1, and for each node, it calculates the size of its subtree.

If a subtree has size at least A, it's considered as a separate component, and r is incremented.

Otherwise, its size is added to the parent's size.

At the end, it checks if r > k or (r == k and root's size >= A).

If r > k, that means there are more than k components with at least A vertices, which would imply that I can choose k edges to remove and still have all components >= A.

Wait, but I need exactly k edges to be removed, creating k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

I'm still a bit confused about how r relates to the number of edges removed.

Wait, perhaps r represents the number of components that have at least A vertices.

Since removing k edges creates k+1 components, but some of them might have size less than A.

So, if r, the number of components with at least A vertices, is greater than k, that means I can choose to remove k edges such that all components have at least A vertices.

Wait, maybe not directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set x = A.

I need to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least A vertices.

If the tree can be divided into k+1 components, each with at least A vertices, by removing k edges, then x = A is possible.

The check function seems to be counting how many components would have at least A vertices if I were to separate them.

If the number of such components is greater than k, or equal to k with the root component also having at least A vertices, then it's possible.

This seems logically sound.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
