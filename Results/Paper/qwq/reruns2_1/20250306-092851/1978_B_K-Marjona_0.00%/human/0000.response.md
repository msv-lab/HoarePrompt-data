Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he bakes n buns that he wants to sell. Normally, each bun costs a coins, but he's running a promotion to attract customers. The promotion works like this: he can choose some integer k, which can be between 0 and the minimum of n and b. For the first k buns sold, each bun has a modified price: the i-th bun costs (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for selling all n buns.

First, I need to understand the promotion better. So, if he chooses k=0, that means no buns are sold at the modified price, and all n buns are sold at the usual price a. So, the total profit would be n * a.

If he chooses k=1, then the first bun is sold at (b - 1 + 1) = b coins, and the remaining (n - 1) buns are sold at a coins each. So, total profit would be b + (n - 1)*a.

If he chooses k=2, the first bun is sold at b coins, the second at (b - 2 + 1) = (b - 1) coins, and the remaining (n - 2) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (b - 1) + (n - 2)*a.

I see a pattern here. For a general k, the total profit would be the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

So, the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns is:

sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1) = sum from i=1 to k of (b + 1 - i) = k*(b + 1) - sum from i=1 to k of i = k*(b + 1) - k*(k + 1)/2

Therefore, total profit for a given k is:

k*(b + 1) - k*(k + 1)/2 + (n - k)*a

I need to maximize this expression over k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems like they're calculating something different. Let's look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

k = min(n, b - a)

if b <= a:

print(a * n)

else:

print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)

So, in the code, they're choosing k = min(n, b - a), and then if b <= a, they just sell all buns at price a, which makes sense because the modified prices would be less than or equal to a, so it's better to stick with a.

But if b > a, they calculate the sum of the modified prices for k buns and add the usual price for the remaining buns.

Wait, but is choosing k = min(n, b - a) always optimal?

Let me test this with the first example:

Input: 4 4 5

So, n=4, a=4, b=5

Calculate k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4,1) =1

So, k=1

Then, total profit = (5 + (5 -1 +1))//2 *1 + (4 -1)*4 = (5 +5)//2 *1 + 3*4 = 5 + 12 = 17

Which matches the first example.

Another example: 5 5 9

k = min(5, 9 -5) = min(5,4) =4

Total profit = (9 + (9 -4 +1))//2 *4 + (5 -4)*5 = (9 +6)//2 *4 +1*5 = 15*4 +5 = 60 +5 =65

But in the example output, it's 35. Wait, that doesn't match. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, in the example, when k=5, profit is 9+8+7+6+5=35, which is higher than when k=4.

But according to the code, k=min(n, b-a)=min(5,4)=4, so it chooses k=4 and gives profit 65, but the example shows output as 35.

Wait, that's inconsistent. Maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, no, in the example, it's saying that for the first test case, choosing k=1 gives 17, which matches the code's output.

For the second test case, choosing k=5 gives 35, which is less than what the code would calculate for k=4 as 65.

But in the example, 35 is the correct output, so maybe the code is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think about when to choose k.

I need to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

So, I need to find the k that maximizes this expression.

Let me consider the difference in profit between choosing k and k-1.

The additional profit from choosing k instead of k-1 is the price of the k-th bun in the modified price sequence minus the usual price a.

That is, (b - k +1) - a.

So, as long as (b - k +1) - a > 0, it's better to increase k.

Because if (b - k +1) - a > 0, then adding another bun at the modified price increases the total profit.

So, we should choose k such that (b - k +1) > a, and (b - (k+1) +1) <= a.

Simplify: (b - k +1) > a => k < b - a +1

And (b - k) <= a => k >= b - a

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, let's set (b - k +1) > a, which implies k < b - a +1

And (b - (k+1) +1) <= a, which is (b - k) <= a => k >= b - a

So, the optimal k is between b - a and b - a +1.

Wait, but k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b).

I think there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the sum of the modified prices for k buns.

The sum is (b + (b - k +1)) * k / 2 = (2b - k +1) * k / 2

Then, the total profit is (2b - k +1) * k / 2 + a*(n -k)

I need to maximize this expression with respect to k.

Let me define the function p(k) = (2b - k +1) * k / 2 + a*(n -k)

Simplify: p(k) = (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k = (2b*k - k^2 + k + 2*a*n - 2*a*k)/2

But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, think of p(k) = sum of modified prices for k buns + sum of usual prices for (n -k) buns.

I need to find the k that maximizes p(k).

To find the maximum, I can look for the point where the derivative with respect to k changes sign, but since k is integer, I can look for the point where (p(k+1) - p(k)) changes from positive to negative.

But perhaps a simpler way is to notice that the modified prices are decreasing: b, b-1, b-2, ..., up to b - k +1.

So, as k increases, the price of the additional bun decreases.

I should choose k such that the price of the k-th bun is greater than or equal to a, and the price of the (k+1)-th bun is less than a.

So, the optimal k is the largest k where b - k +1 >= a.

Solve for k: b - k +1 >= a => k <= b - a +1

So, k_max = min(n, b - a +1)

Wait, but in the code, k = min(n, b - a)

That seems off by one.

Let me check with the example.

In the first example, n=4, a=4, b=5

b - a +1 =5 -4 +1=2

So, k_max = min(4,2)=2

But in the explanation, choosing k=1 gives 17, which is better than k=2.

Wait, let's calculate p(k) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

k=0: 0*modified +4*4=16

k=1:5 +3*4=5+12=17

k=2:5+4=9 +2*4=8, total=17

k=3:5+4+3=12 +1*4=4, total=16

k=4:5+4+3+2=14 +0=14

So, maximum is k=1 or k=2, both giving 17.

So, k_max = min(n, b - a +1) =2, and p(2)=17, which is correct.

But in the code, k = min(n, b - a)=min(4,1)=1, which also gives p(1)=17.

So, in this case, it works, but only because p(1)=p(2)=17.

But in the second example, n=5, a=5, b=9

b - a +1=9-5+1=5

So, k_max= min(5,5)=5

p(5)=9+8+7+6+5=35

Which is less than what the code would calculate: k=min(5,4)=4

p(4)=9+8+7+6=30 +1*5=35, same as p(5).

But in the example output, it's 35, which matches p(5), but the code would calculate p(4)=30 +5=35, which is the same.

Wait, but in the note, it says it's optimal to choose k=5, which gives 35.

So, in this case, the code happens to give the same output.

But according to my earlier reasoning, k should be up to b - a +1.

In this case, b - a +1=5, so k_max=5, and p(5)=35.

But the code uses k=min(n, b - a)=min(5,4)=4, and p(4)=30 +5=35, which coincides with p(5).

So, perhaps in this case, it works out.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, a=2, b=4

Then, b - a +1=4-2+1=3

So, k_max= min(3,3)=3

Calculate p(3)=4+3+2=9

p(2)=4+3=7 +1*2=9

p(1)=4 +2*2=8

p(0)=3*2=6

So, maximum is p(2)=p(3)=9

But according to the code, k=min(3,2)=2, which gives p(2)=9, which is correct.

Another example: n=2, a=3, b=4

b - a +1=4-3+1=2

k_max=min(2,2)=2

p(2)=4+3=7

p(1)=4 +1*3=7

p(0)=2*3=6

So, maximum is p(2)=p(1)=7

Code would choose k=min(2,1)=1, which gives p(1)=7, which is correct.

Another example: n=1, a=1, b=1

b - a +1=1-1+1=1

k_max=min(1,1)=1

p(1)=1 +0*1=1

p(0)=1*1=1

So, maximum is 1.

Code chooses k=min(1,0)=0, which gives p(0)=1, which is correct.

Wait, min(1,0)=0, but b - a +1=1, so k should be 1.

Wait, perhaps there's an off-by-one error in the code.

Wait, in the code, k = min(n, b - a)

But according to my reasoning, it should be k = min(n, b - a +1)

In the earlier examples, it happened to give the correct answer because p(k) was equal for k and k-1 in some cases.

But in general, it might not be correct.

Let me check with another example.

n=1, a=1, b=2

k = min(1,1)=1

p(1)=2 +0*1=2

p(0)=1*1=1

So, maximum is 2.

Code chooses k=1, which is correct.

Another example: n=3, a=4, b=4

k = min(3,0)=0

p(0)=3*4=12

p(1)=4 +2*4=12

p(2)=4+3 +1*4=11

p(3)=4+3+2=9

So, maximum is p(0)=p(1)=12

Code chooses k=0, which gives 12, which is correct.

Another example: n=2, a=5, b=4

k = min(2,-1)=0

p(0)=2*5=10

p(1)=4 +1*5=9

So, maximum is p(0)=10

Code chooses k=0, which is correct.

Seems like in all these cases, even though the code uses k=min(n, b - a), it still gives the correct maximum profit.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be k=min(n, b - a +1)

Is there a relationship between b - a and b - a +1 that makes min(n, b - a) sufficient?

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the condition.

Let me think about the point where the modified price drops below a.

We should choose the largest k where b - k +1 >= a

Which is k <= b - a +1

So, k_max = floor(b - a +1)

But in the code, it's using k = min(n, b - a)

Which is one less than k_max in my earlier reasoning.

But in the examples, it still gives the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps because when b - a is an integer, min(n, b - a) suffices.

But in the case where b - a +1 > n, then k=n, which is fine.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Let me consider the derivative of p(k) with respect to k.

p(k) = (2b - k +1)*k /2 + a*(n -k)

Take derivative: p'(k) = (2b -2k +1)/2 - a = (2b -2k +1 -2a)/2

Set p'(k)=0: 2b -2k +1 -2a =0 => k = (2b +1 -2a)/2 = b - a +0.5

So, the maximum occurs at k = b - a +0.5

Since k has to be integer, we choose k = floor(b - a +0.5)

Which is equal to b - a if b - a is integer.

But in programming problems, since b and a are integers, b - a is integer, so k = b - a.

But in my earlier reasoning, I had k = min(n, b - a +1)

But according to this, it should be k = floor(b - a +0.5)

Which for integer b - a, is b - a.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in one of my earlier examples, n=3, a=2, b=4

b - a =2, so k=min(3,2)=2

p(2)=4+3=7 +1*2=9

p(3)=4+3+2=9

Which is correct.

Another example: n=5, a=5, b=9

b - a=4, so k=min(5,4)=4

p(4)=9+8+7+6=30 +1*5=35

p(5)=9+8+7+6+5=35

Again, same.

So, perhaps choosing k=min(n, b - a) works because p(k)=p(k+1) when k=b - a.

So, in such cases, choosing k=b - a or k=b - a +1 gives the same p(k).

Hence, choosing k=min(n, b - a) works.

Therefore, the code is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize Bob's profit from selling buns under a promotional pricing scheme. We achieve this by carefully selecting the number of buns sold at modified prices versus those sold at the usual price.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - For the first \( k \) buns, the price of the \( i \)-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \) coins.
   - For the remaining \( n - k \) buns, the price is the usual \( a \) coins each.

2. **Choosing the Optimal \( k \):**
   - We need to choose \( k \) such that the total profit is maximized.
   - The optimal \( k \) is determined by the point where the modified price is still greater than or equal to the usual price.

3. **Calculation:**
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is optimal.
   - Otherwise, choose \( k = \min(n, b - a) \) to maximize the profit from the modified pricing.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns.
   - Add the sum of the usual prices for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Optimal \( k \) Selection:**
   - Calculate \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), set \( k = 0 \) since selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k \).
   - Calculate the sum of the usual prices for the remaining \( n - k \) buns: \( a \times (n - k) \).
   - Add these two sums to get the total profit.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the total profit for each test case.

This approach ensures that Bob maximizes his profit by strategically choosing how many buns to sell at the modified prices.
