Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, up to a_n. Players take turns, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile, and then removes k stones from each nonempty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

So, the key here is that stones are removed from all nonempty piles simultaneously by k stones each time. This is different from games where stones are removed from just one pile at a time.

Given that Alice goes first and both play optimally, we need to determine who wins each of the t test cases.

Looking at the input format:

- First, there's t (number of test cases).

- For each test case:

- First line: n (number of piles)

- Second line: n integers representing the number of stones in each pile.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 10^4

- n ≤ 2*10^5 per test case, but the total sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, efficiency is crucial here due to the large input sizes.

Now, to solve this, I need to find a way to determine the winner without simulating the entire game, which would be too slow given the constraints.

Let me think about game theory here. This seems like an impartial game, meaning that the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player's turn it is. So, perhaps I can model this using Nimbers or some other game theory concept.

But first, let's try to see if there's a pattern or a mathematical property that can help us determine the winner quickly.

Looking at the example:

Test case 1:

n = 5

a = [3,3,3,3,3]

Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty in one move, so she wins.

Test case 2:

n=2

a=[1,7]

Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has 1 stone), removes 1 from each pile, making piles [0,6]. Now, Bob chooses k up to 6 (the smallest nonempty pile is 6), say k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, making it [0,0]. So, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the output, it says "Bob", which matches the result.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

Let's simulate:

Alice chooses k=1 (smallest pile is 1), removes 1 from each pile: [0,1,2]

Now, Bob chooses k=1 (smallest nonempty pile is 1), removes 1 from each nonempty pile: [0,0,1]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from the last pile: [0,0,0]

So, Alice wins.

But according to the code, it's 'Alice' which matches.

Wait, but in the code, there's a function func_1 that seems to determine the winner based on some conditions.

Let's look at the provided program:

import heapq

import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())

c = 1

while t > 0:

n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split))

arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split))

r = func_1(arr)

print(r)

t -= 1

def func_1(arr):

A = False

set_ = list(set(arr))

set_.sort()

if set_[0] != 1:

return 'Alice'

not_c = True

for i in range(1, len(set_)):

if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:

not_c = False

break

A = not A

if not_c:

A = not A

return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'

So, the function func_1 takes the array of pile sizes, removes duplicates, sorts them, and then checks some conditions to determine the winner.

Let's try to understand what's happening in func_1.

First, it checks if the smallest pile is not 1. If it's not 1, it returns 'Alice', meaning Alice wins immediately.

Otherwise, it checks if the sorted unique pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it toggles A based on some logic, and then possibly toggles again if the sequence is consecutive.

Finally, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

This seems overly complicated and not very clear. I need to verify if this logic correctly determines the winner for all cases.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can model the game in terms of the mex (minimum excludant) concept from game theory, similar to the Nim game.

In standard Nim, the XOR of pile sizes determines the winner. But here, moves affect multiple piles simultaneously, so it's different.

Another thought: Since removing k stones from all nonempty piles is equivalent to reducing each pile by k, this resembles the concept of Nimbers in game theory, but adapted to this specific removal rule.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to reduce this game to a standard game with known winning strategies.

Let me consider the minimal excludant approach.

Define the mex as the smallest positive integer not present in the set of pile sizes.

Wait, but in standard game theory, mex is used in the context of the Grundy function.

Maybe I can define the Grundy number for this game.

The Grundy number for a position is the mex of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

In this game, choosing k affects all nonempty piles simultaneously, which makes it tricky.

Let's consider a simple case:

- If all piles have the same size, say m, then choosing k=m removes all stones, ending the game. So, if m > 0, Alice can win immediately by choosing k=m.

- If piles have different sizes, it's more complicated.

Wait, in the first test case, all piles have size 3, Alice chooses k=3, removes all stones, and wins.

In the second test case, piles are [1,7], Alice must choose k=1, resulting in [0,6], then Bob chooses k=6, resulting in [0,0], so Bob wins.

In the third test case, [1,2,3], Alice chooses k=1, resulting in [0,1,2], then Bob chooses k=1, resulting in [0,0,1], then Alice chooses k=1, resulting in [0,0,0], so Alice wins.

So, in this case, Alice wins.

Looking at the code, it seems to check if the smallest pile is not 1, then Alice wins immediately.

Otherwise, it checks if the unique sorted pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it toggles A based on some logic.

This seems too simplistic and might not capture the complexity of the game.

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of stones removed.

Each move consists of selecting a k up to the smallest pile and removing k stones from each nonempty pile.

This is equivalent to replacing each non-zero pile a_i with a_i - k.

This operation is similar to a parallel chip-firing game or some other combinatorial game.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves.

Wait, but the game can be quite long if piles have large sizes.

I need a way to determine the winner without simulating the entire game.

Another angle: perhaps the number of stones in each pile can be represented in a certain way to find the overall game value.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of binary representations or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula based on the pile sizes.

Looking back at the code, it seems to focus on the unique sorted pile sizes and checks if they form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

But is that sufficient to determine the winner?

Let me try some test cases.

Test case 1:

n=5

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

Unique sorted: [3]

Since 3 !=1, return 'Alice'. Which matches the expected output.

Test case 2:

n=2

a=[1,7]

Unique sorted: [1,7]

Check if it's consecutive starting from 1: 7-1=6 >1, so not consecutive.

Then, A is toggled based on some logic, but since it's not consecutive, perhaps it's 'Bob'.

But in the code, it's 'Bob'.

Test case 3:

n=7

a=[1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

Unique sorted: [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

Not consecutive, since 3-2=1, 4-3=1, 7-4=3, etc.

So, not consecutive, A is not toggled, return based on A.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

I think the logic in the code is flawed because it doesn't accurately capture the game's dynamics.

Let me look for a better approach.

Perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of times stones can be removed.

Each time a player removes k stones from each pile, it's like reducing each pile by k.

This is similar to performing a parallel move in multiple piles.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where each pile is independent, but here moves affect all piles simultaneously.

Wait, maybe it's the opposite: since moves affect all piles, it's like a combination of independent games.

But I need to find a way to compute the game's nimber.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of times stones are removed.

Let me consider the mex concept.

Define the mex as the smallest positive integer not present in the set of pile sizes.

Wait, but in standard game theory, the mex is used to calculate the nimber of a position.

In this game, the nimber might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of stones removed.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the number of moves.

Each move removes k stones from each pile, where k is at most the smallest pile.

This is similar to reducing each pile by k.

This seems like a variant of the game where each move affects multiple piles.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1:

n=5

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

Alice chooses k=3, removes all stones, wins.

Test case 2:

n=2

a=[1,7]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,6]

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, resulting in [0,0]

Bob wins.

Test case 3:

n=7

a=[1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,2,8,6,3,1,99]

Then Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each nonempty pile, resulting in [0,1,7,5,2,0,98]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each nonempty pile, resulting in [0,0,6,4,1,0,97]

And so on.

This seems too time-consuming to simulate.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal pile size.

The game ends when all piles are empty, so the last player to make a move wins.

This is a misère game, but it's not exactly like standard Nim.

Wait, actually, in standard Nim, the last player to remove the last stone wins, similar to this game.

But in this game, the moves affect all piles simultaneously, which is different.

Let me consider the number of times we can remove stones.

Each removal of k stones from all piles reduces each pile by k, until a pile is empty.

So, it's like repeatedly cutting off the smallest pile's height.

This seems similar to the concept of the minimal excludant in surreal numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of the mex of the pile sizes.

In standard Nim, the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner.

But here, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, it's different.

Perhaps I can consider the game as equivalent to a single pile of stones, where the pile size is determined by some function of the individual pile sizes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to sort the piles and find a certain value that determines the winner.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to focus on the unique sorted pile sizes and checks if they form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

But is that correct?

Let me try another test case.

Test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

According to the code:

set_ = [1,2,3]

sorted: [1,2,3]

Check if it's consecutive: yes, because 2-1=1 and 3-2=1.

Then, A is toggled based on some logic, and finally returns 'Alice'.

But in reality, as simulated earlier, Alice wins this case.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,0]

Alice wins.

According to the code:

set_ = [1]

sorted: [1]

Since set_[0] ==1, proceed to check if it's consecutive.

Yes, it's consecutive.

Then A is toggled, and finally returns 'Alice', which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, Alice wins, which matches 'Alice'.

Another test case:

n=1

a=[1]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1, resulting in [0]

Alice wins.

Code:

set_ = [1]

sorted: [1]

set_[0]==1, check consecutive, which it is.

A is toggled, returns 'Alice', which is correct.

Another test case:

n=1

a=[2]

set_ = [2]

set_[0] !=1, return 'Alice', which is correct because Alice can choose k=2 and win immediately.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,4]

set_ = [1,2,4]

sorted: [1,2,4]

Check if consecutive: 2-1=1, but 4-2=2 >1, so not consecutive.

Then A is not toggled, and returns based on A.

In this case, A is False, so 'Bob'.

But let's simulate:

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, resulting in [0,1,3]

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each nonempty pile, resulting in [0,0,2]

Alice chooses k=2, removes 2 from the last pile, resulting in [0,0,0]

Alice wins.

So, according to the code, it would return 'Bob', but actually Alice wins.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, the provided code is flawed because it doesn't correctly determine the winner in all cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
