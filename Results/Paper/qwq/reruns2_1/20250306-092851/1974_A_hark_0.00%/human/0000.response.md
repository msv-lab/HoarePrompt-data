Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1, which means they take up one cell, and others are 2x2, which take up four cells in a square.

The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and icons can't overlap.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. We have t test cases, each with values x and y, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively. For each test case, I need to output the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons.

Looking at the example provided, for the first test case with x=1 and y=1, the output is 1, meaning both icons can fit into a single screen. From the note, there's an illustration showing how this arrangement can be done.

Another test case is x=0 and y=9, which outputs 5. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, but we have to consider how many 2x2 icons can fit into a screen without overlapping.

I need to figure out the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a single screen and how the 1x1 icons can be placed around them.

Let's think about the screen grid: 5 rows and 3 columns.

A 2x2 icon occupies a 2x2 block of cells. So, in a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 blocks can we have?

Let's visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So the cells are:

1A 1B 1C

2A 2B 2C

3A 3B 3C

4A 4B 4C

5A 5B 5C

A 2x2 icon can be placed starting at positions:

1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B

But we need to make sure that no two 2x2 icons overlap.

Let's see how many 2x2 icons can fit into one screen without overlapping.

If I place one 2x2 icon starting at 1A, it occupies 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B.

Then, another at 3A, occupying 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B.

That's two 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but in the example with y=9, the output is 5. So, if each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, then for y=9, we'd need ceil(9/2) = 5 screens, since 4 screens would hold 8 icons, and the fifth screen holds the remaining one.

Wait, but 9 divided by 2 is 4.5, which would round up to 5 screens.

But in the example, when y=3 and x=0, the output is 2, which matches ceil(3/2)=2.

Similarly, when y=2 and x=8, the output is 2, but according to the initial approach, it should be ceil(2/2)+ceil((8-2*4)/15)=1+0=1, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.

Let's look at the code provided.

The code defines func_2() which handles one test case.

In func_2():

- Read x and y.

- If x > 0 and y > 0:

- Calculate bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- Then x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- Then bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15) + 1

- Print bxsfory1 + bxsfory

- If x == 0 and y > 0:

- Print ceil(y / 2)

- If x > 0 and y == 0:

- Print ceil(x / 15)

- If x == 0 and y == 0:

- Print 0

Wait, there's something off in the formula.

In the first case, when both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates bxsfory as ceil(y / 2), which makes sense if each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, it adjusts x by subtracting bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Wait, why is it subtracting bxsfory * 15? Each screen has 15 cells, but if we're placing y 2x2 icons, which take 4 cells each, then the total cells used by y icons would be y * 4.

But bxsfory is the number of screens used for y icons, which is ceil(y / 2).

Each of these screens can hold up to two 2x2 icons, using up to 8 cells per screen (since 2 icons * 4 cells each = 8 cells).

But wait, in a 5x3 grid, which has 15 cells, placing two 2x2 icons would use 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But in the code, it's doing x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4, which seems unclear.

Maybe I need to rethink this.

Let's consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and the remaining cells can hold 1x1 icons.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Two 2x2 icons take up 8 cells (2 * 4 = 8).

So, remaining cells for 1x1 icons are 15 - 8 = 7.

So, per screen:

- Up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if we don't use any 2x2 icons, then we can have up to 15 1x1 icons per screen.

Or, if we use one 2x2 icon, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, possibilities per screen:

- 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons

- 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons

- 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons

We need to minimize the number of screens used.

Given that, we should maximize the use of 2x2 icons per screen to reduce the number of screens needed.

So, the strategy should be to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, each occupying their 4 cells, and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

But we need to consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

So, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, for the 1x1 icons, we need to see how many cells are left after placing the 2x2 icons.

Wait, but actually, since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons, we need to account for both.

Maybe a better approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2).

- Then, calculate the total number of cells used by these 2x2 icons: min(y, 2 * screens) * 4.

- Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons: x - (total cells used by 2x2 icons).

- Then, calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil((x - cells_used_by_2x2) / 15).

- The total screens would be the maximum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but this might not be optimal.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and a certain number of 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, if we place two 2x2 icons, they take up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If we place one 2x2 icon, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If we place no 2x2 icons, we can have up to 15 1x1 icons.

Our aim is to minimize the number of screens, so we should maximize the use of 2x2 icons where possible.

So, we should calculate the number of screens needed to accommodate all y 2x2 icons, which is ceil(y / 2).

Then, for each of these screens, we can also place some 1x1 icons.

So, total screens needed would be the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons plus the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons after accounting for the space left on the screens with 2x2 icons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of cells required:

- Cells used by 2x2 icons: y * 4

- Cells used by 1x1 icons: x

- Total cells needed: y * 4 + x

- Each screen has 15 cells.

- So, the minimal number of screens would be ceil((y * 4 + x) / 15)

But wait, this doesn't take into account that 2x2 icons must be placed in a way that their squares don't overlap and are fully contained within the screen.

So, it's not just about the total number of cells, but also about the arrangement.

In the initial approach, it's considering that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps a better way is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2)

- Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens: screens * 7 (since each screen with two 2x2 icons can hold 7 1x1 icons)

- If x <= screens * 7, then the total screens needed are ceil(y / 2)

- Else, the additional 1x1 icons needed are x - (screens * 7), and the additional screens needed for these are ceil((x - screens * 7) / 15)

- So, total screens = ceil(y / 2) + ceil(x - screens * 7)/15)

But need to make sure that this doesn't underestimate the required screens.

Wait, in the code, it's doing something similar but seems a bit off.

In the code:

- bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- then x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- then bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15) + 1

- then print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

This seems incorrect because:

- bxsfory is ceil(y / 2), which is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

- Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This part is confusing. It's subtracting bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4 from x.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to account for the cells used by 2x2 icons and the cells left for 1x1 icons.

But it's not clear.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen used for 2x2 icons (ceil(y / 2)), it can also hold seven 1x1 icons.

So, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens is screens * 7.

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - (screens * 7), if x > screens * 7.

These remaining 1x1 icons would require additional screens: ceil((x - screens * 7) / 15)

So, total screens = screens + ceil((x - screens * 7) / 15)

Where screens = ceil(y / 2)

This seems logical.

Now, let's check with the example where x=1, y=1.

screens = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

1x1 icons that can be placed on this screen: 7

Remaining 1x1 icons: 1 - 7 = -6 <= 0, so no additional screens.

Total screens = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the example.

Another example: x=12, y=4

screens = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens: 2 * 7 = 14

Remaining 1x1 icons: 12 - 14 = -2 <= 0, so no additional screens.

Total screens = 2 + 0 = 2, which matches the example.

Another example: x=0, y=9

screens = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens: 5 * 7 = 35

Remaining 1x1 icons: 0 - 35 = -35 <= 0, so no additional screens.

Total screens = 5 + 0 = 5, which matches the example.

Another example: x=8, y=1

screens = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

1x1 icons that can be placed on this screen: 7

Remaining 1x1 icons: 8 - 7 = 1

Additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2, but in the example, it's 1.

Wait, but according to this calculation, it should be 2, but the example shows 1.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the example, for x=8, y=1, the output is 1.

But according to my calculation, it should be 2.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe the arrangement allows for more efficient use of space.

In the screen, with one 2x2 icon taking 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for x=8, y=1:

- One screen can hold one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons.

- So, total capacity: 1x 2x2 and 11x 1x1.

- We have y=1 and x=8, which is within the capacity of one screen.

Hence, only one screen is needed.

So, in this case, my previous formula was incorrect.

I see, so when placing one 2x2 icon, we can place up to eleven 1x1 icons on the same screen.

Similarly, when placing two 2x2 icons, we can place up to seven 1x1 icons on the same screen.

So, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on a screen depends on the number of 2x2 icons placed on it.

- If no 2x2 icons, 15 1x1 icons.

- If one 2x2 icon, 11 1x1 icons.

- If two 2x2 icons, 7 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, which is two per screen.

So, the approach should be:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens_y: capacity_x = screens_y * 7

- If x <= capacity_x, then total screens needed are screens_y

- Else, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - capacity_x, and additional screens needed for these are ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

- So, total screens = screens_y + ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

But in the earlier example with x=8, y=1:

- screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

- capacity_x = 1 * 7 = 7

- x - capacity_x = 8 - 7 = 1

- additional screens = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

- total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

But the example shows output as 1, which contradicts this calculation.

Wait, but according to the problem, for x=8, y=1, the output is 1.

So, perhaps my capacity_x is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps when y < 2, the capacity_x is different.

Wait, in the screen, if we place only one 2x2 icon, we can place up to eleven 1x1 icons.

So, for y=1, capacity_x = 11, not 7.

But according to the earlier calculation, capacity_x = screens_y * 7, which assumes screens_y is for two 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the capacity_x based on the actual number of 2x2 icons per screen.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe a better way is to iterate through the possible number of screens and check if the icons can fit.

But since this is a programming problem, and we need an efficient solution, we need a formula-based approach.

Let me consider the following:

- Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

- Or, one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons.

- Or, no 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons.

Our aim is to minimize the number of screens.

So, we should prioritize placing two 2x2 icons per screen as much as possible.

So, calculate the number of screens needed to place all y 2x2 icons, each screen holding up to two 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens_y: remaining_x = x - (screens_y * 7)

If remaining_x > 0, then additional screens are needed: additional_screens = ceil(remaining_x / 15)

Total screens = screens_y + additional_screens

But in the earlier example, for x=8, y=1:

- screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

- remaining_x = 8 - (1 * 7) = 1

- additional_screens = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

- total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

But the example shows 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the capacity_x should be adjusted based on the actual number of 2x2 icons per screen.

In this case, since y=1, only one 2x2 icon is placed on the screen, leaving space for eleven 1x1 icons.

So, capacity_x should be 11, not 7.

Hence, remaining_x = x - 11 = 8 - 11 = -3 <= 0, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the example.

So, the formula should be:

- If y <= screens_y * 2:

- capacity_x = screens_y * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

- Then, remaining_x = x - capacity_x

- If remaining_x > 0:

- additional_screens = ceil(remaining_x / 15)

- total_screens = screens_y + additional_screens

- Else:

- total_screens = screens_y

But this seems too convoluted.

Perhaps a better way is to iterate through possible number of screens and check if y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons can fit into that number of screens.

Given that screens_y = ceil(y / 2), and for each screen, if it has two 2x2 icons, it can hold seven 1x1 icons; if it has one 2x2 icon, it can hold eleven 1x1 icons; if it has no 2x2 icons, it can hold fifteen 1x1 icons.

So, for screens_y screens, each holding two 2x2 icons, total 2x2 icons placed = screens_y * 2

If y <= screens_y * 2, then the remaining screens_y can hold seven 1x1 icons each.

But if y < screens_y * 2, then some screens will have only one 2x2 icon, holding eleven 1x1 icons.

Wait, this is getting too complicated for a programming problem.

Maybe I should look for a formula that directly calculates the minimal number of screens.

Looking back at the code provided:

In func_2():

- If x > 0 and y > 0:

- bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15) + 1

- print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

This seems flawed because it's subtracting bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 from x, which doesn't make sense in the context of screen capacity.

Perhaps a better approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate the total capacity for 1x1 icons on these screens_y: capacity_x = screens_y * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

- If x <= capacity_x, then total screens = screens_y

- Else, additional screens needed = ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

- total screens = screens_y + additional_screens

Let's test this with x=8, y=1:

- screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

- capacity_x = 1 * (15 - 4 * 1) = 1 * 11 = 11

- x - capacity_x = 8 - 11 = -3 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the example.

Another test: x=12, y=4

- screens_y = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

- capacity_x = 2 * (15 - 4 * 2) = 2 * 7 = 14

- x - capacity_x = 12 - 14 = -2 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 2 + 0 = 2, which matches the example.

Another test: x=0, y=9

- screens_y = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

- capacity_x = 5 * (15 - 4 * 2) = 5 * 7 = 35

- x - capacity_x = 0 - 35 = -35 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 5 + 0 = 5, which matches the example.

Seems correct.

So, the formula is:

screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

capacity_x = screens_y * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

if x <= capacity_x:

total_screens = screens_y

else:

additional_screens = ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

total_screens = screens_y + additional_screens

But in the code, it's doing something different.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, it's:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems wrong because it's subtracting bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4 from x.

Wait, perhaps the author intended to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

But it's not clear.

An alternative approach is to calculate the total number of cells required:

total_cells = x + y * 4

Then, divide by the number of cells per screen (15), and take ceil of that:

total_screens = ceil((x + y * 4) / 15)

But this doesn't consider that 2x2 icons must be placed in a way that their squares don't overlap and are fully contained within the screen.

So, it might not always give the correct result.

For example, if y=1 and x=15, total_cells = 15 + 4 = 19

ceil(19 / 15) = 2 screens

But in reality, one screen can hold one 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons, totaling 4 + 11 = 15 cells, leaving x - 11 = 4 cells for the second screen.

So, total screens should be 2, which matches.

Another example: x=1, y=1

total_cells = 1 + 4 = 5

ceil(5 / 15) = 1 screen

Which matches the example.

Another example: x=0, y=9

total_cells = 0 + 36 = 36

ceil(36 / 15) = 3 screens

But in the example, it's 5 screens.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps because the 2x2 icons can't be split across screens, and each screen can hold at most two 2x2 icons.

So, for y=9, number of screens needed just for 2x2 icons is ceil(9 / 2) = 5 screens.

Then, even though total_cells = 36, which would fit into 3 screens (3*15=45), but since 2x2 icons can't be split, we need 5 screens for the y=9 case.

Hence, the total_cells approach is insufficient; we need to account for the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons separately.

So, the correct approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens_y: capacity_x = screens_y * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

- If x <= capacity_x, then total screens = screens_y

- Else, additional screens needed = ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

- total screens = screens_y + additional_screens

But in the earlier test, for x=12, y=4:

- screens_y = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

- capacity_x = 2 * (15 - 8) = 2 * 7 = 14

- x - capacity_x = 12 - 14 = -2 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 2, which matches the example.

For x=0, y=9:

- screens_y = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

- capacity_x = 5 * (15 - 8) = 5 * 7 = 35

- x - capacity_x = 0 - 35 = -35 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 5, which matches the example.

For x=8, y=1:

- screens_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

- capacity_x = 1 * (15 - 4) = 11

- x - capacity_x = 8 - 11 = -3 <= 0, so additional_screens = 0

- total screens = 1, which matches the example.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the correct formula is:

screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

capacity_x = screens_y * (15 - 4 * min(2, y))

if x <= capacity_x:

total_screens = screens_y

else:

additional_screens = ceil((x - capacity_x) / 15)

total_screens = screens_y + additional_screens
