Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a square of four cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, obviously.

The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible. So, I need to figure out how to arrange x number of 1x1 icons and y number of 2x2 icons on as few 5x3 grids as possible, without overlapping icons or having icons spill over the grid boundaries.

First, I need to understand the constraints and the grid layout. Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making 15 cells. A 2x2 icon occupies a 2-row by 2-column square, which means it covers four cells. I need to see how many such 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen without overlapping.

Let me visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, the cells are A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, and so on up to C5.

Now, a 2x2 icon could be placed starting at A1, which would cover A1, B1, A2, B2. Another one could start at B2, covering B2, C2, B3, C3, but wait, B2 is already covered by the first icon. So, that's overlapping. So, placement needs to be such that the icons don't overlap.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to arrange them without overlapping. Let's see.

Another approach: since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and the grid has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit without overlapping is floor(15/4) = 3. But, in reality, because of the grid layout, it might be less due to positioning constraints.

Wait, let's try to actually place them.

Suppose I place one 2x2 icon starting at A1:

- A1, B1, A2, B2 are occupied.

Then, I can place another starting at C2:

- C2, C3, C4, C5.

But wait, C2 to C5 is a vertical strip; does that form a 2x2 square? No, that's a 4-cell vertical column, which isn't a square. So, that's invalid because a 2x2 icon needs to be a square.

Wait, in a 5x3 grid, can I even place more than one 2x2 icon without overlapping?

Let me try again.

Starting at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2.

Then, starting at C3: C3, C4, C5.

Wait, that's not a 2x2 square; that's just a vertical column.

Alternatively, starting at A3: A3, B3, A4, B4.

Is that possible? Let's see:

- A1, B1, A2, B2 are occupied.

- A3, B3, A4, B4 are also occupied.

- Now, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are still available.

But placing a 2x2 icon starting at C3 would cover C3, C4, C5, but that's not a 2x2 square because it's only in one column.

Wait, in a 5x3 grid, can I have non-overlapping 2x2 squares?

Let's see:

- First 2x2 at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2.

- Second 2x2 at A3: A3, B3, A4, B4.

- Third 2x2 at A5: but there's no A5, since there are only 5 rows.

Wait, rows are 1 to 5, columns A to C.

So, A1, B1, A2, B2 are the first 2x2.

A3, B3, A4, B4 are the second 2x2.

Now, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are still available, but cannot form a 2x2 square because they are all in the same column.

So, in a single screen, I can only place two 2x2 icons: one at A1 and one at A3.

Wait, but A3 is row 3, which is below the first 2x2.

Let me check:

- First 2x2: A1, B1, A2, B2.

- Second 2x2: A3, B3, A4, B4.

- C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are still available, but cannot form a 2x2 square because they are all in the same column.

So, in one screen, I can place at most two 2x2 icons.

Is there a better arrangement?

Wait, maybe placing one 2x2 icon at A1 and another at C2.

Let's see:

- First 2x2 at A1: A1, B1, A2, B2.

- Second 2x2 at C2: C2, C3, C4, C5.

But C2 to C5 is a vertical column, which isn't a 2x2 square. A 2x2 square needs to be a square block, meaning it spans two rows and two columns.

So, C2, C3, C4, C5 is invalid because it's not a square block.

Therefore, in one screen, I can only place two 2x2 icons: one at A1 and one at A3.

Hence, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Now, for the 1x1 icons, they can be placed in any remaining cells.

In a screen with two 2x2 icons, the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is 8 cells (4 per icon), leaving 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if I place only one 2x2 icon, it occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If I place no 2x2 icons, then all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, the idea is to maximize the use of screens by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then filling the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

But, since each screen can only hold up to two 2x2 icons, I need to calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons and the number of 1x1 icons.

Let me formalize this.

Let x be the number of 1x1 icons, and y be the number of 2x2 icons.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and, depending on that, some 1x1 icons.

If a screen has two 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 7 1x1 icons.

If a screen has one 2x2 icon, it can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

If a screen has no 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., put two 2x2 icons per screen as much as possible, and then handle the remaining 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons.

Wait, but I need to consider the 1x1 icons as well.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have y 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But, in reality, it might be more because of the 1x1 icons.

Wait, no. Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons, as per the earlier calculations.

So, if I allocate ceil(y / 2) screens for the 2x2 icons, then I need to see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in those screens along with the 2x2 icons.

For example, if y is even, then y/2 screens are used, each with two 2x2 icons and up to 7 1x1 icons.

If y is odd, then ceil(y / 2) screens are used, with one screen having only one 2x2 icon and up to 11 1x1 icons.

So, total capacity for 1x1 icons in these screens is:

If y is even:

number of screens = y / 2

total 1x1 capacity = (y / 2) * 7

If y is odd:

number of screens = ceil(y / 2) = (y // 2) + 1

total 1x1 capacity = ((y // 2)) * 7 + 11

Because the last screen has only one 2x2 icon and can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the case where y is odd, the number of screens is (y // 2) + 1.

Out of these, (y // 2) screens have two 2x2 icons each, and one screen has one 2x2 icon.

So, total 1x1 capacity is:

((y // 2) * 7) + (1 * 11)

Because the screens with two 2x2 icons can hold up to 7 1x1 icons, and the screen with one 2x2 icon can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in reality, it's more nuanced because the screens might not be fully utilized.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of cells available for 1x1 icons given y 2x2 icons distributed across the screens.

Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so y 2x2 icons occupy 4y cells.

Each screen has 15 cells, so the number of cells available for 1x1 icons per screen is 15 - 4 * number of 2x2 icons per screen.

Since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the number of cells available per screen is:

- If the screen has two 2x2 icons: 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If the screen has one 2x2 icon: 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If the screen has no 2x2 icons: 15 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., put two 2x2 icons per screen as much as possible.

So, let's say we have y 2x2 icons.

The number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Letâ€™s denote s = ceil(y / 2).

Now, in these s screens:

- If y is even, all s screens have two 2x2 icons, so total cells available for 1x1 icons are s * 7.

- If y is odd, (s - 1) screens have two 2x2 icons, and one screen has one 2x2 icon, so total cells available for 1x1 icons are (s - 1) * 7 + 11.

Now, we have x 1x1 icons to place.

If x is less than or equal to the total cells available for 1x1 icons in these s screens, then s screens are sufficient.

Otherwise, we need additional screens to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

The remaining 1x1 icons would be x - total cells available in s screens.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons (since it would have no 2x2 icons).

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - total cells available in s screens) / 15).

Hence, the total number of screens needed is s + ceil((x - total cells available in s screens) / 15).

Wait, but we need to be careful with the calculations.

Let me formalize this.

Let s = ceil(y / 2).

If y is even:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = s * 7

If y is odd:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = (s - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, if x <= total 1x1 cells in s screens:

total screens = s

else:

additional screens = ceil((x - total 1x1 cells in s screens) / 15)

total screens = s + additional screens

This seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the first test case from the example.

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Take the first test case: x = 1, y = 1

s = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

Since y is odd:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

x = 1 <= 11, so total screens = 1

Which matches the output.

Second test case: x = 7, y = 2

s = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

y is even:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = 1 * 7 = 7

x = 7 <= 7, so total screens = 1

Which matches the output.

Third test case: x = 12, y = 4

s = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

y is even:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = 2 * 7 = 14

x = 12 <= 14, so total screens = 2

Which matches the output.

Fourth test case: x = 0, y = 3

s = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

y is odd:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = (2 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18

x = 0 <= 18, so total screens = 2

Which matches the output.

Fifth test case: x = 1, y = 0

s = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

y is even (though y=0):

total 1x1 cells in s screens = 0 * 7 = 0

x = 1 > 0, so additional screens = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which should be the output, but in the sample input, it's "1 0" which corresponds to x=1, y=0, and output=1, which matches.

Wait, in the sample input, it's "1 0" is the fifth test case, which is output=1.

Wait, but in the explanation above, it's correct.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

s = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

y is odd:

total 1x1 cells in s screens = (1 - 1) * 7 + 11 = 0 * 7 + 11 = 11

x=8 <=11, so total screens =1

Which matches the output.

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0

s=ceil(0 /2)=0

total 1x1 cells in s screens =0

x=0<=0, so total screens=0

Which matches the output.

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0

s=ceil(0 /2)=0

total 1x1 cells in s screens =0

x=2>0, so additional screens=ceil(2 /15)=1

total screens=0+1=1

Which matches the output.

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0

s=ceil(0 /2)=0

total 1x1 cells in s screens =0

x=15>0, additional screens=ceil(15 /15)=1

total screens=0+1=1

Which matches the output.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

s=ceil(2 /2)=1

y is even:

total 1x1 cells in s screens=1*7=7

x=8>7, so additional screens=ceil((8-7)/15)=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=1+1=2

Which matches the output.

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9

s=ceil(9 /2)=5

y is odd:

total 1x1 cells in s screens=(5-1)*7 +11=4*7 +11=28+11=39

x=0<=39, so total screens=5

Which matches the output.

So, this logic seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, let's see how this is implemented in the given program.

Looking at the code:

There are three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

func_1 seems unused; it just returns the minimum of two numbers.

func_3 reads the number of test cases and calls func_2 t times.

So, func_2 seems to handle each test case.

Looking at func_2:

It reads x and y from input.

Then, it has a conditional structure based on whether x and y are zero or not.

But, the logic seems different from what I derived.

Let me see.

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, it's calculating bxsfory = ceil(y / 2), which is correct.

Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems fishy.

Wait, why is it subtracting bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4 from x?

That doesn't make sense in the context of my earlier reasoning.

In my approach, after allocating screens for y 2x2 icons, I calculate the remaining x 1x1 icons that need to be placed, considering the available cells in those screens.

But here, it's doing x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Maybe it's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's trying to compute something else.

Let me try to understand.

bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

This is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, it seems to adjust x based on some calculation involving 15 and 4.

Wait, 15 is the number of cells per screen, and 4 is the number of cells per 2x2 icon.

But the formula x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 doesn't seem right.

It should probably be x = x - (available cells for 1x1 icons in bxsfory screens)

In my earlier reasoning, if y is even:

total 1x1 capacity = bxsfory * 7

if y is odd:

total 1x1 capacity = (bxsfory - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, x = x - total 1x1 capacity

Then, additional screens needed are ceil(x / 15)

And total screens = bxsfory + ceil(x / 15)

But in the code, it's doing x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which seems incorrect.

Perhaps it's a different approach.

Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct and I'm missing something.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take the first test case: x=1, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

So, x = -10 <= 0, so bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 7 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0

0 <= 0, so bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2 <=0, so bxsfory1=0

Total screens =0 +2=2

Which matches.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

bxsfory=ceil(3 /2)=2

x=0-2*15 +3*4=0-30+12=-18<=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+2=2

Which matches.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0

x=1, y=0

Enters elif x>0 and y==0:

print(math.ceil(x /15))

x=1, ceil(1/15)=1

Which matches the output.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

bxsfory=ceil(1 /2)=1

x=8 -1*15 +1*4=8-15+4=-3 <=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+1=1

Which matches.

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0

else:

print(0)

Which matches.

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0

elif x>0 and y==0:

ceil(2/15)=1

Which matches.

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0

ceil(15 /15)=1

Which matches.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

bxsfory=ceil(2 /2)=1

x=8 -1*15 +2*4=8-15+8=1 >0, so bxsfory1=ceil(1 /15)=1

Total screens=1+1=2

Which matches.

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9

bxsfory=ceil(9 /2)=5

x=0 -5*15 +9*4=0-75+36=-39<=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+5=5

Which matches.

So, even though the formula seems counterintuitive, it's producing the correct outputs for the sample inputs.

Let me try to understand why this formula works.

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, perhaps it's accounting for the total cells used by 2x2 icons and the capacity for 1x1 icons.

Wait, bxsfory is ceil(y / 2), which is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Each screen has 15 cells, so bxsfory * 15 is the total cells in those screens.

y * 4 is the total cells occupied by y 2x2 icons.

So, x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in my earlier reading; it's x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4, but maybe it's supposed to be x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

That would make sense.

Let me see:

x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

Which is x - (cells used by screens minus cells used by 2x2 icons)

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

Wait, maybe it's a different way to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed after accounting for the screens used by 2x2 icons.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the effective x after considering the screens allocated for 2x2 icons and their impact on the available cells for 1x1 icons.

Let me see.

If I rearrange the formula:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which can be written as x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

But I think it should be x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

Which is x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4, which is what the code has.

Wait, perhaps it's correct.

Let me see with the first test case:

x=1, y=1

bxsfory=1

x=1 -1*15 +1*4=1-15+4=-10

Since x <=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+1=1

Which is correct.

Second test case:

x=7, y=2

bxsfory=1

x=7-15+8=0

0<=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+1=1

Correct.

Third test case:

x=12, y=4

bxsfory=2

x=12-30+16=-2

-2<=0, bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+2=2

Correct.

Wait, but why does this formula work?

Let me try to derive it.

The total cells available for 1x1 icons when allocating bxsfory screens for y 2x2 icons is bxsfory * 15 - y * 4

Because each screen has 15 cells, and y 2x2 icons occupy y * 4 cells.

So, the available cells for 1x1 icons are bxsfory * 15 - y * 4

Then, the remaining x after placing as many as possible in these cells is x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

If x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4) <=0, it means that the available cells can hold all the x 1x1 icons, so no additional screens are needed.

Else, additional screens needed are ceil(x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)) / 15)

And total screens = bxsfory + additional screens

Which is what the code does.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15) +1

Wait, ceil(x /15) +1 seems off.

Wait, in the code, it's:

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <=0 else math.ceil(x / 15) +1

Which adds one additional screen if x >0.

But in my earlier reasoning, it should be ceil(x /15), not ceil(x /15) +1

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Let me check with the third test case:

x=12, y=4

bxsfory=2

x=12-30+16=-2 <=0, so bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+2=2

Which is correct.

Another test case:

x=8, y=2

bxsfory=1

x=8-15+8=1 >0

bxsfory1=ceil(1 /15)+1=1+1=2

Total screens=1+2=3

But in the sample input, it's 2.

Wait, but in the sample input, for x=8, y=2, output is 1.

Wait, in my earlier manual calculation, it should be 1 screen for y=2 2x2 icons and x=8 1x1 icons.

Wait, according to my earlier formula:

s=ceil(y /2)=1

y is even, so total 1x1 cells=1*7=7

x=8>7, so additional screens=ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens=1+1=2

But in the sample input, it's outputting 1, which contradicts.

Wait, but looking back at the sample input and output, for x=8, y=2, output is 1.

Wait, let's check the sample input again.

Wait, in the sample input, the tenth test case is x=8, y=2, and output is 2.

But according to the code, for x=8, y=2:

bxsfory=1

x=8-15+8=1 >0

bxsfory1=ceil(1 /15)+1=1+1=2

Total screens=1+2=3

But sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the code.

Wait, but in the earlier manual calculation, it should be 2 screens.

Wait, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if x >0 and y>0:

bxsfory = ceil(y /2)

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

bxsfory1 =0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15)+1

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

But in the sample input, for x=8, y=2, output is 1, but according to this code, it would output 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, maybe the code has a typo; perhaps it should be x = x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)

Instead of x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

Because bxsfory *15 is total cells available in screens allocated for y 2x2 icons, and y*4 is cells occupied by y 2x2 icons, so available cells for 1x1 icons is bxsfory *15 - y*4

Hence, remaining x after placing in available cells is x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)

If x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4) <=0, then no additional screens needed.

Else, additional screens needed is ceil(x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)) /15)

Total screens = bxsfory + additional screens

So, the code should be:

x = x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)

if x <=0:

print(bxsfory)

else:

additional = ceil(x /15)

print(bxsfory + additional)

But in the given code, it's:

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

bxsfory1 =0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15)+1

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

Which is equivalent to:

x = x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)

if x <=0:

print(bxsfory)

else:

additional = ceil(x /15) +1

print(bxsfory + additional)

So, it's adding one extra screen in the else case.

Which is incorrect, as per the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=8, y=2, output is 1, but according to this code, it would output 1 +1=2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, no, for x=8, y=2:

bxsfory=1

x=8-15 +8=1 >0

bxsfory1=ceil(1 /15)+1=1+1=2

total screens=1+2=3

But sample output is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the sample input has a mistake, or perhaps I misread it.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

11

1 1 -> output 1

7 2 -> output 1

12 4 -> output 2

0 3 -> output 2

1 0 -> output 1

8 1 -> output 1

0 0 -> output 0

2 0 -> output 1

15 0 -> output 1

8 2 -> output 2

0 9 -> output 5

Wait, for x=8, y=2, output is 2.

But according to the code, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, the tenth test case is x=8, y=2, output=2.

But according to the code, it's producing 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier manual calculation, for x=8, y=2:

s=ceil(2 /2)=1

y even, total 1x1 cells=1*7=7

x=8>7, additional screens=ceil(1 /15)=1

total screens=1+1=2

Which matches the sample output.

But according to the code, it's adding an extra screen, making it 3.

Hence, the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

Which is equivalent to x = x - (bxsfory *15 - y*4)

Then, bxsfory1 =0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15)+
