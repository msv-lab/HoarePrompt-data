Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. Me and Nene each get n cards initially. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each turn, the player picks a card from their hand and plays it on the table. If the number on that card is already on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options for that, she chooses the one that minimizes my score. My goal is to figure out the maximum score I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n turns in total, with me and Nene each taking n turns. The key point is that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, given that.

I have to maximize my score, considering Nene's optimal play. So, it's like a two-player game where both players are trying to optimize their own scores, with Nene having a secondary objective to minimize my score if her primary objective is satisfied.

Let me think about the structure of the game. Since it's a perfect information game (each player knows everything about the game state), I can model it as a game tree where each node represents a game state, and edges represent moves.

But considering the constraints (n up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4 test cases), a straightforward game tree approach is impossible due to time constraints. So, I need a smarter way to compute the optimal score.

Let me consider the properties of the game. Each number appears exactly twice in the deck. So, for each number from 1 to n, there are two cards: one in my hand and one in Nene's hand.

Wait, actually, I have n cards, and Nene has n cards, and together they cover all 2n cards, with each number appearing exactly twice.

Given that, for each number, I either have both cards, one card, or none.

Wait, no. Since there are exactly two cards for each number, and we each have n cards, it's possible that for some numbers, I have both cards, for some numbers, I have one card and Nene has the other, and for some numbers, Nene has both cards.

But in the problem statement, it says that for the input, the list a1 to an represents the numbers on my cards, and each number from 1 to n appears at most twice in this list. So, if a number appears once in my hand, the other card with that number is in Nene's hand. If a number appears twice in my hand, then Nene has no cards with that number. If a number doesn't appear in my hand, then both cards with that number are in Nene's hand.

So, for each number from 1 to n:

- If it appears twice in my hand: I have both cards, Nene has none.

- If it appears once in my hand: I have one card, Nene has the other.

- If it doesn't appear in my hand: Nene has both cards.

My goal is to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me think about what determines a point. A player gets a point if, when they play a card, there's already a card with that number on the table.

So, for a number to give a point, both cards must be played, and the second player to play the second card gets the point.

Wait, not necessarily the second player. Whoever plays the second card gets the point, regardless of who plays it.

But in this game, since we're alternating turns, and I'm going first, the order in which cards are played matters.

Wait, more precisely, since we're placing cards on the table, and the table state is visible to both players at all times, each player can make decisions based on what's already on the table.

Given that, Nene, being perfectly rational and playing optimally, will choose her moves to maximize her points and minimize mine, in that order of preference.

I need to model this game in a way that allows me to compute my optimal score given Nene's optimal play.

Let me consider the concept of matching pairs. For each number, there are two cards. If I have both cards, then I can play them in a way to maximize my points. If I have one card and Nene has the other, then the timing of playing the cards matters.

Wait, no. Since it's turn-based, and we alternate turns, I need to think in terms of sequences of moves.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of graph theory or some combinatorial optimization.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent game states, and edges represent moves.

But with n up to 2*10^5, that's not feasible.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can find a way to count the number of points I can get based on the distribution of the cards.

Let me consider that for each number, there are two cards. If I have both cards, I can play them in such a way that I get a point from one of them.

Wait, how?

If I play the first card, and then later play the second card, the second play will give me a point.

But Nene can interfere by playing cards in between.

Wait, no, Nene can't interfere with my playing my own cards.

But Nene can play her cards in a way that affects the table state.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of pairs that I can "control."

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs where I have both cards, and the number of pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other.

Let me define:

- Let s be the number of numbers where I have both cards.

- Let t be the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other.

- Let u be the number of numbers where Nene has both cards.

From the input, I can count s and t, since:

- s is the number of unique numbers in my hand that appear twice.

- t is the number of unique numbers in my hand that appear once.

- u is n - s - t, since there are n unique numbers in total.

Given that, I can compute s, t, and u for each test case.

Now, I need to find a way to compute my maximum possible score based on s, t, and u.

Let me think about s, t, and u:

- For s pairs (where I have both cards), I can play them in a way to get s points, because I can play the first card, and then play the second card to get a point.

- For t pairs (where I have one card and Nene has the other), the outcome depends on the order in which we play the cards.

- For u pairs (where Nene has both cards), Nene can play both cards and get a point.

But I need to consider that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of who can control the pairs.

Let me consider that for each pair:

- If I have both cards, I can get a point from that pair.

- If Nene has both cards, she can get a point from that pair.

- If we each have one card from the pair, then the point goes to whoever plays the second card.

Now, since I go first, and we alternate turns, I need to think about the sequence in which we play the cards.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs where I have both cards (s), and the number of pairs where I have one card (t).

Let me consider that I can get s points from the pairs where I have both cards.

For the t pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other, the point will go to whoever plays the second card.

Since we alternate turns, and I go first, I can try to control when these pairs are played.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a game where I have s pairs that I can control to get points, and t pairs where the point goes to the player who plays the second card.

Given that, in the t pairs, Nene will try to play the second card to get the point, but I can also play my card from these pairs at a time that minimizes her ability to get the point.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a pattern or formula that relates s, t, u to the final scores.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first test case from the example:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, s=1 (number 1 appears twice in my hand)

t=2 (numbers 2 and 3 appear once in my hand)

u=1 (number 4 doesn't appear in my hand, so Nene has both)

According to the example, the answer is 1.

So, in this case, with s=1, t=2, u=1, my score is 1.

Let me see what's happening.

I can get s=1 point from the pair where I have both cards.

For the t=2 pairs, since Nene has one card in each, and u=1 pair where Nene has both cards.

Nene can get points from u=1 pair where she has both cards.

For the t=2 pairs, depending on the play order, either I or Nene can get the point.

In this example, the answer is 1, which is s=1. So, perhaps in this case, I can get s points, and Nene can get u + (t - s) points.

Wait, but in this case, u + (t - s) = 1 + (2 - 1) = 2, which would be Nene's score.

But in the example, Nene's score is 3, not 2. So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my thinking.

Wait, in the first test case, my score is 1, and Nene's score is 3.

Let me see:

- s=1: I can get 1 point from the pair where I have both cards.

- u=1: Nene can get 1 point from the pair where she has both cards.

- t=2: For these two pairs, one point will go to the player who plays the second card.

Since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to get as many of these t pairs' points as possible.

Given that there are t=2 such pairs, and n=4, with me going first, and alternating turns, perhaps Nene can get both of these t pairs' points.

So, total points:

- Me: s=1 + 0 (since Nene gets both t pairs' points) = 1

- Nene: u=1 + t=2 = 3

Which matches the example.

So, in this case, Nene gets both points from the t pairs.

I need to find a way to maximize my score, which means trying to get as many points from the t pairs as possible.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to find a way to get as many points from the t pairs as possible, considering the turn order.

Let me think about the t pairs.

For each t pair, the point goes to the player who plays the second card.

Since I go first, and we alternate turns, I can try to control when I play my cards from the t pairs.

Let me consider that for each t pair, I have one card, and Nene has the other.

If I play my card from a t pair early, then Nene can play her card later to get the point.

Alternatively, if I play my card from a t pair late, maybe I can force Nene to play her card earlier, and then I can play my card to get the point.

Wait, but Nene is also playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and perhaps I can model it using some kind of matching or greedy approach.

Let me consider that I can choose the order in which I play my cards, and Nene will choose the order in which she plays her cards, knowing my moves.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent game states, and edges represent moves, but that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of t pairs that I can "defend" or "capture."

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of t pairs where I can play my card after Nene plays her card, thus getting the point.

But I need to consider the sequence of turns.

Let me consider that in the n turns that I have, I can choose to play s cards from the s pairs at times when it's beneficial for me.

Similarly, for the t pairs, I need to choose when to play my cards to maximize the points I get from them.

Given that, perhaps I can get floor(t/2) points from the t pairs, but I need to confirm.

Wait, perhaps I can get min(s, t) points from the t pairs.

But in the first test case, s=1, t=2, and I get 1 point, which matches min(s,t)=1.

But in the second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, s=2 (numbers 8 and 5 appear twice in my hand)

t=3 (numbers 7,4,1,2 appear once in my hand, so t=4)

Wait, hold on, numbers 7,4,1,2 appear once each in my hand, so t=4

u=8 - s - t = 8 - 2 - 4 = 2

According to the example, the answer is 2.

So, s=2, t=4, u=2

If I follow the min(s,t) logic, min(2,4)=2, which matches the example answer of 2.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

s=1 (number 4 appears twice)

t=6 (numbers 7,1,5,3,2,6 appear once)

u=8 - 1 - 6 = 1

According to the example, the answer is 1, which is s=1.

Again, min(s,t)=min(1,6)=1, which matches.

Fourth test case:

n=3

My cards:1,2,3

s=0 (no number appears twice in my hand)

t=3 (numbers 1,2,3 appear once each)

u=0 (since n=3, s=0, t=3, u=0)

According to the example, the answer is 0.

If I follow min(s,t)=min(0,3)=0, which matches.

Fifth test case:

n=1

My cards:1

s=1 (number 1 appears once? Wait, no.

Wait, n=1, my cards:a1=1

So, s=1 (number 1 appears once in my hand, but since n=1, and there are two cards with number 1, but I have only one, so t=1)

Wait, according to the problem, each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

So, for n=1, there are two cards with number 1.

If I have one card with number 1, then Nene has the other.

So, s=0, t=1, u=0

According to the example, the answer is 0.

If I follow min(s,t)=min(0,1)=0, which matches.

So, in all the examples, the answer is min(s,t), where s is the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand, and t is the number of numbers that appear once in my hand.

Wait, but in the first test case, s=1, t=2, answer=1=min(s,t)

Second test case, s=2, t=4, answer=2=min(s,t)

Third test case, s=1, t=6, answer=1=min(s,t)

Fourth test case, s=0, t=3, answer=0=min(s,t)

Fifth test case, s=0, t=1, answer=0=min(s,t)

This seems to hold.

So, perhaps the general formula is min(s,t).

But wait, why is that?

Let me try to understand why min(s,t) gives the correct answer.

I have s pairs where I have both cards, so I can play them to get s points.

For the t pairs where I have one card and Nene has the other, I can try to get some points from them.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, for each of the t pairs, the point will go to the player who plays the second card.

Since I go first, and we alternate turns, I can try to play my cards from the t pairs in such a way that I play the second card in some of these pairs.

However, Nene, being optimal, will try to play her cards from these pairs at times when I can't play the second card.

Wait, perhaps for each t pair, if I play my card from it before Nene plays her card, then Nene can play her card later to get the point.

But if I play my card from a t pair after Nene plays her card from that pair, then I get the point.

So, to maximize my points from the t pairs, I need to arrange the play order such that for as many t pairs as possible, Nene plays her card first, and then I play my card to get the point.

But Nene is trying to minimize that.

So, it's like a scheduling problem where I need to choose the order of playing my cards to maximize the number of t pairs where Nene has already played her card before I play mine.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of t pairs where I can get the point is s, because I can use my s pairs to force Nene to play her cards in a way that allows me to get points from s t pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of available moves.

Let me consider that I have n turns to play my cards.

I have s pairs where I have both cards, and t pairs where I have one card.

Nene has t pairs where she has one card, and u pairs where she has both cards.

In the n turns that I have, I can play my s pairs in a way that maximizes my points from the t pairs.

Each time I play a card from a s pair, I can choose when to play the first and second card.

Similarly, for the t pairs, I have to choose when to play my cards.

This is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching.

But time constraints suggest I need a simpler approach.

Given that in all examples, the answer is min(s,t), perhaps that's the general formula.

So, in the code provided, it seems to implement some kind of dynamic programming to compute the answer.

But according to my reasoning, it's sufficient to compute s and t and take min(s,t).

So, perhaps the code is overcomplicating things.

Let me look at the provided code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

print(func_1())

def func_1():

n = int(input())

cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

dp[n - 1][0] = 0

dp[n - 2][0] = 0

for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):

for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:

dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]

elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)

else:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])

return dp[0][0]

This code initializes a DP table and iterates through it, updating the DP based on the counts of each number in the cards list.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it's sufficient to count s and t and compute min(s,t).

So, perhaps this DP approach is not necessary.

Let me try to implement my approach and see if it matches the example outputs.

So, for each test case:

- Read n

- Read the list of n cards in my hand

- Count the frequency of each number in my hand

- s is the number of unique numbers that appear twice in my hand

- t is the number of unique numbers that appear once in my hand

- u is n - s - t

- My score is min(s,t)

Let me implement this and see if it matches the example.

Test case 1:

n=4

my cards:1,1,2,3

frequency:1:2,2:1,3:1

s=1 (number 1 appears twice)

t=2 (numbers 2 and 3 appear once)

u=1 (number 4 not in my hand)

min(s,t)=1, which matches the example.

Test case 2:

n=8

my cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

frequency:7:1,4:1,1:1,2:1,8:2,5:2

s=2 (numbers 8 and 5)

t=4 (numbers 7,4,1,2)

u=2 (numbers 3 and 6)

min(s,t)=2, which matches the example.

Test case 3:

n=8

my cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

frequency:7:1,1:1,4:2,5:1,3:1,2:1,6:1

s=1 (number 4)

t=6 (numbers 7,1,5,3,2,6)

u=1 (number 8)

min(s,t)=1, matches the example.

Test case 4:

n=3

my cards:1,2,3

frequency:1:1,2:1,3:1

s=0 (no number appears twice)

t=3 (numbers 1,2,3 appear once)

u=0 (n=3, s=0, t=3, u=0)

min(s,t)=0, matches the example.

Test case 5:

n=1

my cards:1

frequency:1:1

s=0 (no number appears twice)

t=1 (number 1 appears once)

u=0 (n=1, s=0, t=1, u=0)

min(s,t)=0, matches the example.

So, in all the examples, min(s,t) gives the correct answer.

Therefore, I can conclude that the formula min(s,t) is correct.

Hence, the provided DP code is unnecessary and overcomplicated.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
