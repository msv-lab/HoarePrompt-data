Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips based on specific rules, and I need to determine who wins or if it's a draw when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the setup:

- The board has h rows and w columns.

- Alice starts at (x_a, y_a), and Bob at (x_b, y_b).

- They take turns, with Alice starting.

- Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, but can't go beyond the board.

- Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left, also without going beyond the board.

- If a player moves to the position of the other player, they win immediately.

- If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, and can't move, it's a draw.

I need to figure out, for multiple test cases, who wins or if it's a draw, given the initial positions and board dimensions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since both players are moving optimally, I need to consider the best possible moves for each.

Let me consider the movement capabilities:

- Alice can move down by 1, and optionally left or right by 1.

- Bob can move up by 1, and optionally left or right by 1.

So, their movements are towards each other: Alice is moving down, Bob is moving up.

I need to see if they can meet on the same cell before one of them reaches the edge where they can't move.

Let me think about the rows first.

Let's define the row distance between Alice and Bob as d = |x_a - x_b|.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, they are approaching each other.

In the best case, they can meet after d moves, but I need to consider their column positions as well.

The key is to see if they can align in both row and column at the same time.

Let me consider the row aspect:

- Alice moves down by 1 each turn, but can adjust her column by -1, 0, or +1.

- Bob moves up by 1 each turn, and can adjust his column by -1, 0, or +1.

So, in terms of row progression:

- After k moves, Alice will be at row x_a + k.

- After k moves, Bob will be at row x_b - k.

They will meet in rows when x_a + k = x_b - k, which implies k = (x_b - x_a) / 2.

But this only makes sense if (x_b - x_a) is even.

If (x_b - x_a) is odd, then they can't meet exactly on the same row.

Wait, actually, since they move alternately, I need to consider whose turn it is.

Wait, actually, let's think in terms of steps.

Let’s define the number of steps Alice takes as k.

Then, Bob takes k or k-1 steps, depending on who starts.

Since Alice starts, if k is Alice's moves, Bob makes k moves if k > 0, and k-1 if k=0.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the total number of moves until they meet or until one can't move.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I should think in terms of game theory, considering the possible moves and who can force a win.

But that might be too time-consuming for the time constraints.

Let me look for a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the outcome.

Let’s consider the row difference d = x_b - x_a.

This is how many rows apart they are vertically.

Alice is at x_a, Bob at x_b.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, they are moving towards each other.

The game can end in three ways:

1. Alice captures Bob's position.

2. Bob captures Alice's position.

3. Neither can capture the other because one reaches the edge first.

I need to determine which of these happens when both play optimally.

Let’s consider the row difference d.

If d is even, then they can meet on the same row after d/2 moves.

If d is odd, they can't meet on the exact same row, but they will be on adjacent rows after floor(d/2) moves.

Wait, but since Alice moves first, and she moves down, then Bob moves up, and so on.

Let’s consider an example.

Take the first example in the input:

6 5 2 2 5 3

Here, h=6, w=5, Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

Row difference d = 5-2 = 3 (odd).

So, floor(d/2) = 1.

After Alice's first move, she can be at (3,1), (3,2), or (3,3).

Bob then moves to, say, (4,2), (4,3), or (4,4).

Then Alice can move to (4,2), (4,3), or (4,4).

Now, if Alice moves to (4,3), Bob is at (4,3), so Alice captures Bob and wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's Alice.

So, in this case, Alice can force a win.

Another example:

4 1 2 1 4 1

Here, h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Row difference d=2, which is even.

After 1 move, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (3,1), so Alice captures Bob and wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's Bob.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in this case, h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

But w=1, so only one column.

Alice moves down to (3,1), Bob moves up to (3,1), so they meet at (3,1), and Alice captures Bob and wins.

But according to the sample output, it's Bob.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading the output.

Wait, checking the sample output:

Input:

12

6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

1 4 1 3 1 1 → Draw

5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

4 4 1 1 4 4 → Draw

10 10 1 6 10 8 → Alice

10 10 2 6 10 7 → Draw

10 10 9 1 8 1 → Draw

10 10 8 1 10 2 → Bob

10 10 1 1 2 1 → Alice

10 10 1 3 4 1 → Alice

10 10 3 1 1 1 → Draw

So, for the second case, it's Bob.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me think again.

In the second case, h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Alice moves first:

- Alice moves from (2,1) to (3,1).

- Bob moves from (4,1) to (3,1), capturing Alice's position, so Bob wins.

Hence, Bob wins in this case.

I see, so Bob can capture Alice's position.

Wait, but in my previous thought process, I had Alice moving first and capturing Bob.

But according to the sample output, it's Bob who wins.

So, perhaps I need to consider who has the opportunity to capture first.

Let me try to generalize.

Let’s consider the row difference d = x_b - x_a.

If d is even:

- They can meet after d/2 moves.

- If d/2 is an integer, then Bob can move to Alice's position after d/2 moves, capturing her.

- But Alice also has the chance to move in between.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the relative speed at which they are approaching each other.

Each turn, Alice moves down by 1, Bob moves up by 1, so they are closing the gap by 2 rows per two moves (one move each).

Hence, the gap decreases by 1 per two moves.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice moves down by 1, Bob moves up by 1, so the row difference decreases by 2 per two moves.

Wait, per turn of both, the row difference decreases by 2.

Hence, the number of turns until they meet is ceil(d / 2), where d = x_b - x_a.

Wait, more precisely:

- If d is even, they meet after d/2 turns.

- If d is odd, they meet after floor(d/2) turns, but on different rows.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of moves Alice makes.

Let me define k as the number of moves Alice makes.

Then, Bob makes k moves if k > 0, since he moves after Alice.

Initially, row difference is d = x_b - x_a.

After k moves:

- Alice is at row x_a + k.

- Bob is at row x_b - k.

They meet when x_a + k = x_b - k, which implies k = (x_b - x_a)/2.

If (x_b - x_a) is even, then k is integer, and they meet after k moves.

If (x_b - x_a) is odd, then k is not integer, so they can't meet on the same row.

In this case, they will be on adjacent rows.

Now, in the case where d is even, Bob can capture Alice.

In the case where d is odd, Alice can capture Bob.

Wait, let's see.

Wait, no.

Wait, suppose d is even.

Then, after k = d/2 moves, Bob moves to Alice's position and captures her.

Hence, Bob wins.

If d is odd, after floor(d/2) moves, they are on adjacent rows.

Then, Alice moves next, and she can move up to Bob's row and capture him.

Hence, Alice wins.

But in the sample input, for d=3, it's Alice, and for d=2, it's Bob.

Wait, but in the second test case, h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

Here, d = 4 - 2 = 2, which is even.

According to my earlier logic, Bob wins, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, d=5-2=3, which is odd, and Alice wins, matching the sample.

So, it seems that when d is even, Bob wins, and when d is odd, Alice wins.

But, wait, in the third test case, h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1.

Here, d=1-1=0, which is even, but it's a Draw.

Wait, this breaks my earlier logic.

Hence, my earlier assumption is incomplete.

I need to consider more factors.

Let me consider the case when d=0, meaning they are already on the same row.

In this case, neither can capture the other immediately, but they can't move if they are in the first or last row.

Here, h=1, so Alice is in row 1, and can't move down.

Hence, it's a Draw.

So, when d=0 and Alice is in row h, or Bob is in row 1, it's a Draw.

Moreover, in other cases, when d is even, Bob wins, and when d is odd, Alice wins.

But, looking at the sample input:

Test case 4: 5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

Here, d=5-1=4, which is even, but it's a Draw.

According to my earlier logic, Bob should win, but it's a Draw.

Hence, there must be additional constraints.

Let me think about the column positions.

In addition to the row difference, the column positions matter.

They need not only to be on the same row but also on the same column to capture each other.

Hence, I need to consider the column distance as well.

Let’s denote the column difference as delta = |y_a - y_b|.

In addition to the row movement, they can adjust their column by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

Hence, Alice can influence the column position as she moves down.

Similarly, Bob can influence his column position as he moves up.

I need to see if they can align both row and column positions to capture each other.

Let me consider the case where d is even.

After k = d/2 moves, they are on the same row.

At that point, their column positions need to be the same for Bob to capture Alice.

Similarly, if d is odd, after floor(d/2) moves, Alice can move to Bob's position.

Hence, I need to consider the column positions at that point.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s define k = floor(d / 2).

- If d is even:

- After k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob, they are on the same row.

- At that point, if their column positions coincide, Bob wins.

- But Bob can adjust his column position within k moves.

- Similarly, Alice can adjust her column position within k moves.

- So, I need to see if Bob can reach Alice's column within k moves.

- If he can, Bob wins; else, it's a draw.

- If d is odd:

- After k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob, Alice is one row below Bob.

- Then, Alice can move up to Bob's row and capture him.

- But Bob can also move down to Alice's row and capture her.

- So, I need to see who can reach the other's column first.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a better way.

I recall that in such games, it's often useful to consider the relative positions and the number of moves required to intercept.

Let me consider the row difference d = x_b - x_a.

Then, the number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's row is d - k, where k is the number of moves Bob makes.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible column positions after a certain number of moves.

Let’s consider that after k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob, their positions are:

- Alice: (x_a + k, y_a + c1), where c1 is the column adjustment Alice makes, which can be -k to +k.

- Bob: (x_b - k, y_b + c2), where c2 is the column adjustment Bob makes, which can be -k to +k.

Wait, more precisely, since each move allows a column change of -1, 0, or +1, the column can change by up to k in either direction after k moves.

Hence, after k moves, Alice's possible column positions are y_a - k to y_a + k.

Similarly, Bob's possible column positions are y_b - k to y_b + k.

Now, to capture each other:

- If Alice reaches Bob's position: Alice's position matches Bob's position.

- If Bob reaches Alice's position: Bob's position matches Alice's position.

Given that, I need to see who can force their position to coincide with the other's position first.

This seems like a pursuit-evasion game.

Let me try to model it more formally.

Let’s define the number of moves k.

After k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob:

- Alice is at row x_a + k, column y_a + c1, where -k <= c1 <= k.

- Bob is at row x_b - k, column y_b + c2, where -k <= c2 <= k.

They meet when x_a + k = x_b - k and y_a + c1 = y_b + c2.

But x_a + k = x_b - k implies k = (x_b - x_a)/2, which is only possible if (x_b - x_a) is even.

If (x_b - x_a) is odd, they can't meet on the same row, but Alice can capture Bob on her next move.

Hence, for even d = x_b - x_a:

- They can meet on the same row after k = d/2 moves.

- At that point, Bob can capture Alice if he can align his column with Alice's column.

- Alice, knowing this, will try to avoid Bob.

- So, it's a matter of whether Bob can force his column to match Alice's column within k moves.

Similarly, for odd d:

- After k = floor(d/2) moves, Alice is one row below Bob.

- Then, Alice can move up to Bob's row and capture him, or Bob can move down to Alice's row and capture her.

- So, it's a matter of who can reach the other's column first.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a mathematical way to determine who can force a win.

Let me consider the column differences.

Let delta = |y_a - y_b|.

In the case where d is even:

- After k = d/2 moves, Alice's possible column range is y_a - k to y_a + k.

- Bob's possible column range is y_b - k to y_b + k.

- For Bob to capture Alice, their column positions must coincide.

- So, if y_a - k <= y_b + k and y_a + k >= y_b - k, then Bob can capture Alice.

- This simplifies to |y_a - y_b| <= 2k.

- Since k = d/2, this is |y_a - y_b| <= d.

But d = x_b - x_a.

This seems too broad, as d can be large.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the possible column overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I need to see if Bob can reach Alice's column within k moves.

Given that Alice can also move, she can adjust her position to avoid Bob.

Hence, it's more about whether Bob can cover the column distance within k moves, considering Alice is also moving to avoid him.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that in k moves, Bob can cover up to k columns away from his starting position.

Similarly, Alice can cover up to k columns away from her starting position.

Hence, the overlapping range after k moves is from max(y_a - k, y_b - k) to min(y_a + k, y_b + k).

If this range is non-empty, Bob can capture Alice.

Else, it's a draw.

Wait, but Alice is trying to avoid Bob, so she might be able to escape if the board is wide enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider if the column distance is greater than k + k = 2k, then Bob can't capture Alice.

Wait, but they can both move up to k columns in either direction.

Hence, the possible column overlap is from max(y_a - k, y_b - k) to min(y_a + k, y_b + k).

If this interval has a non-negative length, Bob can capture Alice.

Else, it's a draw.

Hence, the condition is max(y_a - k, y_b - k) <= min(y_a + k, y_b + k).

Simplifying:

- Let l = max(y_a - k, y_b - k)

- Let r = min(y_a + k, y_b + k)

- If l <= r, Bob can capture Alice.

- Else, it's a draw.

But this seems always true since l is the larger of two negatives, and r is the smaller of two positives.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's consider y_a = 3, y_b = 1, k=1.

Then, l = max(3 - 1, 1 - 1) = max(2, 0) = 2

r = min(3 + 1, 1 + 1) = min(4, 2) = 2

Hence, l <= r, so Bob can capture Alice.

If y_a = 3, y_b = 1, k=0:

l = max(3 - 0, 1 - 0) = max(3,1) = 3

r = min(3 + 0, 1 + 0) = min(3,1) = 1

Here, l > r, so Bob can't capture Alice.

Hence, in this case, it's a draw.

Wait, but in reality, k can't be zero in this context.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider k = floor(d / 2), where d = x_b - x_a.

Hence, for d even:

- k = d / 2

- If max(y_a - k, y_b - k) <= min(y_a + k, y_b + k), then Bob wins; else, draw.

For d odd:

- k = floor(d / 2)

- Alice is at row x_a + k + 1, Bob is at x_b - k - 1.

- Alice can move to (x_b - k - 1, y) and capture Bob if she can reach his column.

- Similarly, Bob can move to (x_a + k + 1, y) and capture Alice.

Hence, it's similar to the even case, but with adjusted k.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

1. 6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

2. 4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

3. 1 4 1 3 1 1 → Draw

4. 5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

5. 4 4 1 1 4 4 → Draw

6. 10 10 1 6 10 8 → Alice

7. 10 10 2 6 10 7 → Draw

8. 10 10 9 1 8 1 → Draw

9. 10 10 8 1 10 2 → Bob

10. 10 10 1 1 2 1 → Alice

11. 10 10 1 3 4 1 → Alice

12. 10 10 3 1 1 1 → Draw

Looking at these, it seems that when d is even, Bob wins, unless some condition makes it a draw.

Similarly, when d is odd, Alice wins, unless some condition makes it a draw.

Hence, perhaps I need to find conditions under which it's a draw despite d being even or odd.

Let me consider the third test case: h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1.

Here, d=0, which is even, and it's a Draw.

This suggests that when d=0, it's a Draw.

Similarly, in test case 4: h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2.

d=4, which is even, and it's a Draw.

Wait, why is it a Draw here?

According to my earlier logic, Bob should win when d is even.

But in this case, it's a Draw.

Hence, there must be an additional condition based on the column positions.

Let me try to find that condition.

Let’s consider d even:

- k = d / 2

- Bob can capture Alice if he can align his column with Alice's column within k moves.

- But Alice can also move to avoid Bob.

Hence, perhaps if the column distance is greater than k, Bob can't capture Alice.

Wait, but Bob can also move to adjust his column position.

Wait, more precisely, in k moves, Bob can move his column by up to k positions.

Similarly, Alice can move her column by up to k positions.

Hence, the overlapping column range after k moves is from max(y_a - k, y_b - k) to min(y_a + k, y_b + k).

If this range is non-empty, Bob can capture Alice; else, it's a draw.

Hence, for d even:

- k = d / 2

- If y_a and y_b are within 2k columns, Bob wins; else, draw.

Similarly, for d odd:

- k = floor
