Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in this array is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. That's a really big number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, even if two subsequences have the same values but are from different positions in the array, they are considered different.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences would include [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3]. That's a total of 8 subsequences, which is 2^3. Hmm, that makes sense because for each element, you can choose to include it or not, but only if it's increasing.

Wait, but in this case, since all elements are increasing, every subset is an increasing subsequence. So for an array of length n with all elements increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n. But the problem allows for any array, not necessarily fully increasing, so the number of increasing subsequences can be less than 2^n.

The problem also mentions that an empty subsequence is considered increasing, which is fine.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is 1000 trillion, I need to find an array with at most 200 elements that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

First, I need to find a way to construct such an array or determine that it's impossible.

Let me think about the maximum number of increasing subsequences possible with an array of length 200. If the array is strictly increasing, then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^200, which is way larger than 10^18. So, in theory, it's possible to achieve any X between 1 and 2^200, but the problem starts at X=2.

Wait, but the problem says X can be from 2 to 10^18, so I need to make sure that for any X in this range, I can find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, or say it's impossible.

I need to find a way to construct such an array efficiently.

Let me consider binary representation. Since 2^200 is much larger than 10^18, maybe I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but X can be up to 10^18, which is 60 bits in binary, because 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18.

But the array can have up to 200 elements, which is more than enough to represent 10^18 in binary.

But I need to think about how to map the binary representation to the array.

Let me consider that each position in the array corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

Wait, but I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated.

I recall that for a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated by considering all possible subsets and checking if they are increasing.

But for large n, this is computationally expensive.

I need a smarter way to construct the array.

Let me consider building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

One idea is to start with an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences by carefully choosing the elements.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence of unique elements in increasing order, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array.

But I need exactly X, which may not be a power of 2.

So, maybe I can have some elements that are equal, which would reduce the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, but the problem allows duplicates in the array, but in an increasing subsequence, elements must be strictly increasing, so duplicates cannot be in the same subsequence.

So, duplicates don't directly help in reducing the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, actually, if there are duplicates, they can be at different positions, so subsequences that include different positions of duplicates are considered different, even if the values are the same.

So, perhaps duplicates can be used in a clever way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where some elements are equal, and some are increasing.

I need to find a way to combine these to get exactly X increasing subsequences.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a way to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, since 2^n gives the number of increasing subsequences for a fully increasing array of length n.

Wait, but it's not exactly a sum, because the number of increasing subsequences can be more complex when the array has non-increasing elements.

Let me consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all k=0 to n of the number of increasing subsequences of length k.

But calculating this directly is not efficient for large n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider building the array step by step, and calculating the number of increasing subsequences incrementally.

I can start with an empty array, which has one increasing subsequence: the empty subsequence.

Then, when I add an element to the array, the number of increasing subsequences changes based on how this element relates to the previous elements.

Specifically, if I add an element that is larger than all previous elements, then it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling the number of increasing subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or not include this new element).

Wait, but since it's strictly increasing, I can only include it if the subsequence is increasing.

Wait, no. If the new element is larger than all previous elements, then it can be appended to any existing subsequence, including the empty subsequence, to form a new increasing subsequence.

So, if I have m increasing subsequences before adding the new element, after adding this new element, the number of increasing subsequences becomes m (the old ones) plus m (the old ones with the new element appended), which is 2m.

Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Actually, for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include the new element or not, but only if including it keeps the subsequence increasing.

If the new element is larger than all previous elements, then appending it to any existing subsequence (including the empty subsequence) will result in an increasing subsequence.

Therefore, the number of increasing subsequences doubles when adding a new element that is larger than all previous elements.

Wait, but that includes the empty subsequence plus the new element, which is just the new element itself.

So, if I start with an empty array, which has one subsequence (the empty subsequence), and add a new element, say 1, then the increasing subsequences are [] and [1], so total of 2.

Then, if I add another element that is larger than 1, say 2, then the increasing subsequences are [], [1], [2], and [1,2], total of 4.

If I add another element larger than 2, say 3, then the increasing subsequences are [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3], total of 8.

So, each time I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

Therefore, for a fully increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Now, if I add an element that is not larger than all previous elements, say I add a element that is equal to one of the previous elements or smaller, then it will not be able to be appended to all subsequences.

Wait, but in this problem, we can have duplicates, but in increasing subsequences, elements must be strictly increasing, so duplicates cannot be in the same subsequence.

So, if I add an element that is equal to a previous element, say add another 2 to [1,2,2], then the increasing subsequences would be [], [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2], [2,2], [1,2,2].

Wait, but [2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

Similarly, [1,2,2] is not strictly increasing because the last two elements are equal.

So, in this case, the increasing subsequences are [], [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2], and [1,2,2] is not allowed.

Wait, but [1,2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's excluded.

Therefore, the valid increasing subsequences are [], [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2].

But since subsequences are determined by their positions, [2] appears twice (from different positions), and [1,2] appears twice.

So, total of 6 increasing subsequences.

Wait, but in this case, X=6, which is not a power of 2.

So, by introducing duplicates, I can get numbers of increasing subsequences that are not powers of 2.

This is interesting.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but I need to think about how duplicates affect the count.

Let me consider adding an element that is equal to one of the previous elements.

Suppose I have an array [1,2], and I add another 2, making it [1,2,2].

Then, the increasing subsequences are:

- [],

- [1],

- [2] (from the first 2),

- [2] (from the second 2),

- [1,2] (first 2),

- [1,2] (second 2).

So, total of 6.

Similarly, if I add another 2, making it [1,2,2,2], then the increasing subsequences would be:

- [],

- [1],

- [2] (from any of the three 2's),

- [1,2] (with any of the three 2's),

So, [], [1], [2], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2], [1,2].

Wait, but [2,2], [2,2], [2,2], [1,2,2] are not strictly increasing, so they are excluded.

Therefore, total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8.

Wait, but [2] appears three times, and [1,2] appears three times.

So, total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8.

Wait, but in reality, the unique subsequences are [], [1], [2], [1,2], but since positions differ, [2] appears three times and [1,2] appears three times.

So, total of 1 + 3 + 3 = 7, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences when duplicates are present.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence with some "levels", where each level corresponds to a unique value, and within each level, there are multiple identical elements.

For example, in [1,2,2,3], there are four levels: 1, 2 (two elements), 3.

Then, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose one element from each level, in order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

Then, dp[i] = 1 (just the element itself) plus the sum of dp[j] for all j < i such that a[j] < a[i].

The total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i.

This seems manageable.

But for n=200, this is feasible.

But I need to construct the array such that the sum of dp[i] is exactly X.

This seems too vague to construct directly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider building the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number, but n is at most 200, which is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Let me consider that each position in the array corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X.

Wait, but I need to think about how to map the bits to the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can build the array by considering the binary representation of X.

Wait, perhaps I can think of X as a sum of powers of 2, and each power of 2 corresponds to adding a new element to the array.

Wait, but I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that each time I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

As I saw earlier, starting with an empty array (1 subsequence), adding a new largest element doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

So, if I have an array of length n, with elements strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

Now, if I want to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, i.e., X = 2^{a1} + 2^{a2} + ... + 2^{ak}, then perhaps I can construct the array by having segments where the number of increasing subsequences is 2^{ai}, and combine them in a way that the total is X.

But I need to think about how to combine these segments without interfering with each other.

Wait, perhaps I can have separate increasing sequences that don't interact, so their contributions multiply.

Wait, no, if they are separate increasing sequences, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

But I need the sum to be X.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of sum.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Perhaps I can build the array step by step, starting with an empty array, and at each step, decide whether to add a new element that is larger than all previous elements or not.

If I add a new element larger than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

If I add an element that is not larger than all previous elements, say it's equal to some previous element, then it may not double the number.

Wait, but in the earlier example, adding a duplicate didn't double the number.

So, perhaps I can control the number of increasing subsequences by choosing when to add a new largest element and when to add a duplicate.

Wait, but duplicates don't increase the number of increasing subsequences in a straightforward way.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote that:

- If I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

- If I add an element that is equal to a previous element, the number of increasing subsequences increases by the number of increasing subsequences that do not include any of the previous elements equal to it.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that for any array, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all k of the number of increasing subsequences of length k.

But calculating this directly is not efficient.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty subsets that are strictly increasing.

Wait, actually, it includes the empty subsequence as well, but as per the problem, the empty subsequence is allowed.

So, total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of subsets that are strictly increasing, including the empty subsequence.

So, it's the sum over k from 0 to n of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length k.

Again, this seems too broad.

I need a way to construct the array to achieve exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let me consider that for a fully increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

So, if X is a power of 2, say X = 2^n, then I can just build a fully increasing array of length n.

But X can be any integer between 2 and 10^18, so I need to handle general X, not just powers of 2.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but how?

Let me consider that if I have disjoint increasing sequences, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

Wait, is that true?

Let me think.

Suppose I have two separate increasing sequences, say [1,2,3] and [4,5], and they are disjoint, meaning no element from one sequence is between elements of the other sequence.

Then, any increasing subsequence would be entirely within one of the sequences, because mixing them would disrupt the increasing order.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences in each sequence, not the product.

Wait, no, actually, if they are completely separate and no element from one sequence is between elements of the other, then any increasing subsequence would be from one sequence or the other, but not combining both.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

Wait, but in reality, since the sequences are disjoint and ordered such that all elements of one sequence are less than all elements of the other, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

Wait, let's think carefully.

For example, take [1,2,3] and [4,5]. If I combine them to [1,2,3,4,5], which is fully increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^5 = 32.

But if I consider them as separate sequences, the number of increasing subsequences in [1,2,3] is 2^3 = 8, and in [4,5] is 2^2 = 4.

If I sum them, I get 8 + 4 = 12, which is not equal to 32.

Wait, that suggests that when sequences are combined and fully increasing, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the individual counts.

Wait, no, in the combined fully increasing sequence, it's 2^{n1 + n2}, which is 2^{n1} * 2^{n2}.

So, it's multiplication.

But in reality, when sequences are disjoint and fully increasing, combining them multiplies the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the combined sequence [1,2,3,4,5], the number of increasing subsequences is 2^5 = 32.

In separate sequences [1,2,3] and [4,5], the number of increasing subsequences are 2^3 = 8 and 2^2 = 4, respectively.

But in the combined sequence, it's 2^{3+2} = 2^5 = 32, which is 2^3 * 2^2.

So, yes, when sequences are fully increasing and disjoint, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of their individual counts.

This makes sense because any subset of the combined sequence is increasing if and only if the subsets from each sequence are increasing, and since they are disjoint and ordered, their combination is increasing if each part is increasing.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

This is useful.

So, if I can partition the array into disjoint increasing sequences, then the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each sequence.

Given that, perhaps I can represent X as a product of powers of 2, since each fully increasing sequence of length n contributes 2^n to the product.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is not necessarily a product of powers of 2.

Wait, but 10^18 is 1000000000000000000, which is 2^60 * (10^18 / 2^60), but 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18, so X can be represented as a product of powers of 2.

Wait, but X is not necessarily a power of 2, it can be any integer between 2 and 10^18.

So, perhaps I need to factor X into a product of powers of 2.

But factorizing X into powers of 2 is straightforward since X can be expressed as a product of its prime factors, but in this case, since 2 is the only prime factor if X is a power of 2.

Wait, but X can be any integer, not necessarily a power of 2.

This seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I have multiple disjoint increasing sequences, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of (number of increasing subsequences in each sequence).

But I need the product to be equal to X.

So, if X is not a product of powers of 2, then perhaps I need to introduce sequences that don't contribute powers of 2.

Wait, but in the earlier example, sequences that are fully increasing contribute powers of 2.

So, perhaps I need to introduce sequences that contribute other factors.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence with duplicates, it may not contribute a power of 2.

But earlier examples suggest that duplicates can complicate the count.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements needed to achieve X increasing subsequences.

Given that for a fully increasing sequence of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

So, to achieve X = 2^n, I can use a sequence of length n.

But X can be any integer up to 10^18, so I need to handle sums or products accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but earlier I thought about products, but maybe sums make more sense.

Let me think about it.

If I have multiple sequences that don't interact, perhaps the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of the increasing subsequences in each sequence.

Wait, earlier I thought it was the product, but maybe I was wrong.

Let me consider two separate sequences: [1,2,3] and [4,5].

In the combined sequence [1,2,3,4,5], the number of increasing subsequences is 2^5 = 32.

If I consider them separately, [1,2,3] has 8 and [4,5] has 4, and their sum is 12, which is not equal to 32.

So, clearly, when sequences are combined and fully increasing, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of their individual counts.

Wait, but in reality, in the combined sequence, it's 2^{n1 + n2} = 2^{n1} * 2^{n2}.

So, it's multiplication.

Therefore, if I partition the array into k disjoint increasing sequences, each of length n_i, then the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of (2^{n_i}).

Therefore, X is equal to the product of (2^{n_i}) for i=1 to k.

So, X is a product of powers of 2, which means X itself must be a power of 2.

But X can be any integer up to 10^18, which is not necessarily a power of 2.

This suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, but 10^18 is not a power of 2, so if X is not a power of 2, then it's impossible to construct such an array.

But that can't be right, because in the example provided, X=2,5,13,37, and 13 and 37 are not powers of 2.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider sequences that are not fully increasing.

If I have sequences with duplicates or non-increasing elements, then the number of increasing subsequences may not be a power of 2.

In the earlier example, [1,2,2] has 6 increasing subsequences, which is not a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of such counts.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that is fully increasing, it contributes 2^n.

If I add duplicates, it may subtract some counts or add in a specific way.

This is getting too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider building the array by repeatedly adding the largest possible "contribution" to X.

That is, find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to X, subtract it from X, and record the corresponding sequence.

Repeat this until X is zero.

In this way, I can build the array incrementally.

Let me try this approach.

For example, take X=13.

The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 13 is 8 (2^3).

So, I can have a fully increasing sequence of length 3, which contributes 8 to X.

Then, X=13-8=5.

Now, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is 4 (2^2).

So, add another fully increasing sequence of length 2, contributing 4.

Now, X=5-4=1.

But 1 is not a valid contribution since the smallest fully increasing sequence has length 1, which contributes 2^1=2.

Wait, but 1 is less than 2, so I can't represent it with a fully increasing sequence.

This suggests that I need to adjust my approach.

Perhaps I need to consider sequences with duplicates to fine-tune the contribution.

Wait, but earlier I saw that [1,2,2] has 6 subsequences, which is not a power of 2.

So, maybe I can use such sequences to make up the difference.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize this approach.

Define subseq_lens as the list of lengths of fully increasing sequences.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of (2^{n_i} - 1) for each i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Wait, in the earlier combined sequence, it's 2^{n1 + n2 + ... + nk}.

Wait, no, if sequences are disjoint and fully increasing, it's the product of their individual 2^{n_i}.

Wait, but in reality, 2^{n1} * 2^{n2} = 2^{n1 + n2}, which is the same as having a single sequence of length n1 + n2.

So, perhaps this approach doesn't allow me to represent X as a sum of powers of 2.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that any number X can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is essentially its binary representation.

So, X can be expressed as X = sum over i of 2^{b_i}, where b_i are the positions of 1s in the binary representation of X.

So, perhaps I can build the array by having segments that contribute 2^{b_i} to the total number of increasing subsequences.

But how do I ensure that these segments don't interfere with each other?

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the array in such a way that these segments are completely separate and their contributions don't overlap.

But in that case, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of their individual contributions, not the sum.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to use inclusion-exclusion.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I build the array step by step, starting with an empty array, and at each step, decide whether to add a new element that is larger than all previous elements or to add a duplicate of an existing element.

Each time I add a new largest element, the number of increasing subsequences doubles.

Each time I add a duplicate, it may not change the number of increasing subsequences in a straightforward way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation.

Let me consider that adding a new largest element corresponds to multiplying the current number of increasing subsequences by 2.

Adding a duplicate corresponds to adding some other amount.

So, perhaps I can represent X in binary, and for each bit that is set, add a new largest element to double the number of increasing subsequences.

But again, this only works if X is a power of 2.

Wait, perhaps I can adjust this.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Start with an empty array, which has 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

Then, for each bit in the binary representation of X, if the bit is set, add a new largest element to double the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, but this only allows me to represent X as a power of 2.

For example, if X=13 (1101 in binary), which is 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.

So, perhaps I can add sequences that contribute 8, 4, and 1.

But how do I arrange the array so that these contributions don't interfere?

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the array in segments, where each segment corresponds to a set bit in X, and the segments are arranged in such a way that they don't interact.

Wait, perhaps I can have separate increasing sequences for each set bit, and arrange them in a way that they don't interfere with each other.

But I need to ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of the contributions from each segment.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that if I have separate increasing sequences, their contributions multiply, not add.

So, to get a sum, I need to arrange them in a way that their contributions add up.

Wait, perhaps I can have multiple arrays and take their disjoint union.

But in this problem, it's a single array.

Wait, perhaps I can have non-overlapping increasing sequences within a single array.

Wait, but in a single array, if sequences are disjoint and fully increasing, their contributions multiply, not add.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think of a different way.

Suppose I fix the first element to be some value, say 0.

Then, each subsequent element can be either larger than all previous elements or equal to some previous element.

By choosing appropriately, perhaps I can control the number of increasing subsequences.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of subsets where the elements are strictly increasing.

So, perhaps I can model this as a binary tree or something similar.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of ways to choose elements in increasing order.

Wait, but that's essentially the same as the number of strictly increasing subsequences.

I need to find a way to construct the array such that this count is exactly X.

Given that n is at most 200, which is manageable, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to build the array step by step.

Define dp[i][s] as the number of ways to achieve s increasing subsequences with the first i elements.

But this seems too time-consuming, both in terms of computation and implementation.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a given array, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated efficiently using dynamic programming.

So, perhaps I can build the array in a way that allows me to control this count.

Wait, but I need to find such an array, not calculate the count.

This is still not helpful.

Let me consider that the minimal number of elements needed to achieve X increasing subsequences is log2(X), since 2^{n} is the number of increasing subsequences for a fully increasing sequence of length n.

But X can be up to 10^18, which would require n up to 60, since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18.

But the problem allows up to 200 elements, which is more than enough.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and construct corresponding sequences.

But earlier, I saw that combining sequences multiplies their contributions, not sums them.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of products of powers of 2, but this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where some elements are equal, and I can control the number of increasing subsequences by choosing how many duplicates to include.

Perhaps I can model this using inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, but I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for a sequence with duplicates, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the product of (number of choices for each group of duplicates).

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of multiset sequences.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for a sequence with m distinct values, each appearing c_i times, then the number of increasing subsequences
