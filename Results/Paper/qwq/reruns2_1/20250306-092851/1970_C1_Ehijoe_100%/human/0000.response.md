Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about a game on a tree structure with n nodes, and the tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array. There are t rounds, but in this easy version, t is always 1, so I don't have to worry about multiple rounds affecting the tree or anything like that.

Each round starts with a stone on one node, and the players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. The player who can't make a move loses. Both players play optimally, so I need to figure out who wins each round based on the starting node.

First, I need to understand the tree structure. It's a tree with exactly two leaves, which means it's a linear structure, like a line graph, where each node has at most two neighbors, except for the two leaves, which have only one neighbor each.

So, the tree is essentially a path, and the nodes can be thought of as being in a straight line. That simplifies things a lot because I don't have to deal with branches or complex structures.

Given that, I can represent the tree as a list or array where each position corresponds to a node, and the connections are sequential.

Now, the game is about moving the stone along this path, activating nodes as we go, and the player who can't make a move loses.

Since the tree is a straight path, the game is similar to a game where you have a line of cells, and you can move the stone to an adjacent unvisited cell.

I need to determine, for a given starting position, whether Ron (the first player) or Hermione (the second player) wins when both play optimally.

In such games, the key is to determine the parity of the number of moves that can be made. Since Ron moves first, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if it's even, Hermione wins.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

Each move activates a new node. The game starts with one node already active (the starting node), and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor, activating it.

The game ends when there are no more inactive neighbors to move to.

So, the total number of moves in the game is equal to the number of nodes minus one, because one node is already active at the start.

But that doesn't seem right, because depending on the starting position, the number of possible moves can vary.

Wait, actually, in a tree, the total number of moves would be equal to n - 1, because each move activates one new node, and starting from one node, you need n - 1 moves to activate all nodes.

But in this game, the player who cannot make a move loses, and players alternate turns.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, the first player (Ron) wins, because he makes the last move. If it's even, the second player (Hermione) wins.

But hold on, in standard impartial games like this, the player who makes the last move wins, which aligns with the total number of moves being odd for the first player to win.

But let's confirm this with the sample inputs.

In the first sample input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

The tree is a path of 3 nodes: 1 - 3 - 2.

Starting at node 3.

Total moves possible: n - 1 = 2 moves.

Since 2 is even, Hermione wins. But the output is "Ron". That contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Let's simulate the game:

- Start at node 3 (active).

- Ron moves to node 1 (only inactive neighbor).

- Hermione moves to node 2.

- Now, all nodes are active; Hermione cannot move. So, Hermione loses.

But according to my earlier logic, total moves = 2, which is even, so Hermione should win, but in reality, Ron wins.

Hmm, there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think differently.

In impartial games, the number of moves determines who wins if both play optimally.

If the total number of moves is odd, the first player wins; if even, the second player wins.

But in this specific game, starting from a node, the total number of moves is n - 1, as each move activates one new node.

In the first sample, n = 3, so moves = 2, which is even, so Hermione should win, but the output is "Ron".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, in the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron moves to node 1, then Hermione moves to node 2, and then there are no moves left. So, Hermione cannot move, hence Ron wins.

So, even though there are 2 moves, which is even, Ron wins.

This contradicts the standard impartial game theory where even moves would mean the second player wins.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the starting move.

Actually, the starting node is already active, and the first move is made by Ron, activating one new node, then Hermione activates another, and so on.

The player who cannot make a move loses.

So, if there are k moves possible, and Ron makes the first move, then:

- If k is odd, Ron makes the last move and wins.

- If k is even, Hermione makes the last move and wins.

But in the first sample, k = 2 (even), and Ron wins. That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider the game as a sum of smaller games, but in this case, it's a single path, so it's one game.

Alternatively, maybe the number of moves is not n - 1.

Wait, in the first sample, starting at node 3:

- Ron moves to node 1.

- Hermione moves to node 2.

- No more moves left; Hermione loses.

Total moves: 2, which is even, but Ron wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of moves from the starting position.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the distance from the starting position to the two leaves.

Wait, the problem mentions that the tree has exactly two leaves, so it's a path.

Given that, perhaps the game can be analyzed by considering the two directions from the starting position.

Let me think about it.

Suppose the tree is a path with nodes labeled from 1 to n, where 1 and n are the leaves.

If the starting position is node s, then the game can be thought of as moving either towards node 1 or towards node n.

Each player, on their turn, chooses one direction and moves towards that leaf, activating new nodes along the way.

Wait, but in the problem, the tree is more general, but since it's guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, it's a simple path.

So, I can find the two leaves and then find the path between them, which is the only path in the tree.

Then, the distance from the starting node to each leaf defines the possible moves in each direction.

In the first sample:

Nodes: 1 - 3 - 2

Leaves: 1 and 2

Starting at 3.

From 3, you can move to 1 or 2.

If Ron moves to 1, then Hermione moves to 2, and there are no more moves.

Similarly, if Ron moves to 2, then Hermione moves to 1, and there are no more moves.

In both cases, Hermione cannot move after that, so Ron wins.

In this case, the number of moves is 2, which is even, and Ron wins.

Wait, but in standard impartial game theory, with even moves, the second player wins.

So, there must be something different here.

Wait, perhaps because the game is not simply about making moves, but about choosing directions.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the tree as a path graph, and model the game accordingly.

In a path graph, starting from any node, the number of possible moves is determined by the lengths of the paths to the two leaves.

For example, in the first sample:

From node 3, distance to leaf 1 is 1, distance to leaf 2 is 1.

Total moves: 2.

Ron moves first, makes one move, then Hermione makes the second move, and then there are no moves left.

So, Hermione cannot move, hence Ron wins.

But according to standard impartial game theory, with an even number of moves, the second player should win, but here Ron wins.

So, maybe I need to adjust my understanding.

Let me consider another example.

Second sample input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

So, the tree is a path: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5

Starting at node 5.

From 5, only one move: to 4.

Then, Hermione moves to 3.

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 1.

Now, all nodes are active; Ron cannot move. So, Ron loses, Hermione wins.

Total moves: 4, which is even, Hermione wins.

Wait, in this case, with 4 moves (even), Hermione wins, which aligns with the standard impartial game theory.

But in the first sample, with 2 moves (even), Ron wins.

This inconsistency suggests that my initial approach is flawed.

Perhaps the game isn't purely determined by the total number of moves, but by the structure of the path and the starting position.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that from the starting position, there are two possible directions to move: towards one leaf or the other.

In the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron can choose to move to either node 1 or node 2.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione moves to node 2, and Ron wins.

Similarly, if he moves to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1, and Ron wins.

So, in this case, no matter which move Ron chooses, he can force a win.

In the second sample, starting at node 5, Ron can only move to node 4.

Then, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1, and Ron loses.

So, in this case, Hermione wins.

Looking for a pattern, it seems that when the starting position is such that the maximum number of moves in either direction is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

Wait, in the first sample, from node 3, the distance to both leaves is 1, which is odd, and Ron wins.

In the second sample, from node 5, the distance to the leaf is 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, distance from starting node to each leaf is:

- Sample 1: both distances are 1 (odd).

- Sample 2: distance is 4 (even).

So, if any of the distances from the starting node to the leaves is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

Wait, in sample 1, both distances are odd, and Ron wins.

In sample 2, the distance is even, and Hermione wins.

But suppose there was a case where one distance is odd and the other is even, who would win?

Let's consider a tree with 4 nodes: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.

Leaves are 1 and 4.

Starting at node 2.

Distances to leaves: to 1 is 1 (odd), to 4 is 2 (even).

If Ron moves to 1, then Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 4, Hermione cannot move. Ron wins.

If Ron moves to 3, then Hermione moves to 4, Ron moves to 2, but 2 is already active. Wait, no.

Wait, starting at 2:

- Ron moves to 1.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione cannot move. Ron wins.

Alternatively:

- Ron moves to 3.

- Hermione moves to 4.

- Ron cannot move to 2 because it's already active. So, Ron loses.

So, in this case, depending on Ron's first move, he can either win or lose.

But in the problem statement, it says both players play optimally.

So, Ron would choose the move that leads to his victory.

In this case, if Ron moves to 1, he wins; if he moves to 3, he loses.

So, he会选择移动到1，从而获胜。

Therefore, in this scenario, Ron wins.

So, even though one distance is odd and the other is even, Ron can choose the odd direction to win.

Hence, if there exists at least one direction with an odd distance, Ron can win by choosing that direction.

Otherwise, if both directions have even distances, Hermione wins.

This seems to align with the sample inputs.

In sample 1, both distances are odd; Ron wins.

In sample 2, the distance is even; Hermione wins.

In my hypothetical example with n=4, starting at node 2, one distance is odd (1), the other is even (2), so Ron can choose the odd direction and win.

Therefore, the strategy is:

- Compute the distances from the starting node to both leaves.

- If at least one of these distances is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

This seems to be a correct approach.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

1. Build the tree from the edges.

2. Identify the two leaves.

3. Compute the distances from the starting node to each leaf.

4. Check if at least one of these distances is odd.

5. If yes, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute these distances.

I can perform a BFS from the starting node and find the distances to both leaves.

Since the tree is a simple path, BFS should work efficiently.

Also, since the tree has only two leaves, I can precompute them if needed.

But in the given code, it seems to be trying to build the path explicitly.

Let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

- It reads n and t, but since t=1, it's straightforward.

- It reads the edges and builds an adjacency list.

- It finds the two leaves by finding nodes with only one neighbor.

- It then builds the path from one leaf to the other.

- It finds the index of the starting node in this path.

- It calculates the distances to the two ends: idx and n - idx - 1.

- It checks if any of these distances is odd; if yes, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

This seems to align with the strategy I just derived.

Let's verify it with the sample inputs.

First sample:

n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

Leaves: 1 and 2

Path: [1, 3, 2]

Starting at 3, idx=1

Distances: 1 (to end 1) and 1 (to end 2)

Any of them is odd, so Ron wins.

Second sample:

n=5, t=1

Edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5

Leaves: 1 and 5

Path: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Starting at 5, idx=4

Distances: 4 (to end 1) and 0 (to end 5)

No odd distances, so Hermione wins.

Another hypothetical case:

n=4, t=1

Edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4

Leaves: 1 and 4

Path: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Starting at 2, idx=1

Distances: 1 (to end 1) and 2 (to end 4)

At least one is odd, so Ron wins.

This matches the earlier reasoning.

Therefore, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the distances from the starting node to the two leaves.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Ron}} \]
