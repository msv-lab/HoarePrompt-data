Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are specific conditions about who comes to the party based on who gets invited and their best friends. It sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem clearly. Monocarp has n friends, and he wants at least 2 of them to come to his party. Each friend has a best friend, and this best friend relationship is represented by an array p, where p_i is the best friend of the i-th friend. The conditions are:

1. All p_i are distinct, and p_i ≠ i for any i. This means that no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. A friend i will come to the party only if both friend i and their best friend p_i receive an invitation.

3. Each invitation is sent to exactly one friend.

Our task is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Let's look at the example provided to understand better.

Example 1:

Input:

3

5

3 1 2 5 4

4

2 3 4 1

2

2 1

Output:

2

3

2

In the first test case, n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4]. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5, and both will come because each has their best friend also invited.

In the second test case, n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1]. He needs to send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 to get at least 2 friends to come.

In the third test case, n=2 and p=[2,1]. Inviting both friends is sufficient.

From these examples, it seems like the structure of the best friend relationships affects the number of invitations needed.

Let's think about the best friend relationships. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this forms a permutation of the friends where no one maps to themselves. In permutation terms, this is a derangement.

In such a derangement, the permutation can be decomposed into cycles. For example, in the first test case:

p = [3,1,2,5,4]

Let's see the cycles:

- Start with friend 1: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle length 3)

- Friend 4: 4 -> 5 -> 4 (cycle length 2)

So, the permutation has cycles of lengths 3 and 2.

In the second test case:

p = [2,3,4,1]

- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 (one cycle of length 4)

In the third test case:

p = [2,1]

- 1 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle of length 2)

It seems like the cycle structure is important here.

Now, let's think about how to minimize the number of invitations while ensuring that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given that a friend comes only if both they and their best friend are invited, but note that their best friend doesn't necessarily have to come, just be invited.

Wait, the problem says: "the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation".

So, for friend i to come, both friend i and friend p_i must be invited. But friend p_i might not come if they don't have their own best friend invited.

This seems a bit circular. Let's think carefully.

Suppose we invite friend A and friend B, where B is A's best friend. Then, friend A will come because both A and B are invited. But friend B will come only if both B and p_B are invited.

Wait, but friend B might have a best friend p_B, who might be someone else.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let's consider the permutation as a graph where each friend points to their best friend. Since p is a derangement and all p_i are distinct, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

In cycle notation, each cycle represents a group of friends who are connected through their best friend relationships.

For example, in the first test case, we have cycles (1-3-2) and (4-5). In the second test case, we have one cycle (1-2-3-4). In the third test case, we have (1-2).

Now, in each cycle, if we can find a way to invite a subset of friends such that for at least 2 friends, both they and their best friends are invited, then those friends will come.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe we should consider the minimal number of invitations needed to cover at least 2 friends who will come.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that to make a friend come, we need to invite both them and their best friend. So, for each friend that we want to come, we need to invite two people: themselves and their best friend.

But we need at least 2 friends to come, so naively, we might think we need to invite 4 people (2 for each friend). But of course, there might be overlaps, since friends can share best friends.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's consider that if we invite two friends who are each other's best friends, i.e., they form a cycle of length 2, then inviting both of them will make both come, because each has the other invited.

But in cycles longer than 2, it's different.

Wait, in a cycle of length 2, like friends 1 and 2 where p_1 = 2 and p_2 = 1, inviting both 1 and 2 will make both come, since each has their best friend invited.

In a cycle of length 3, like friends 1,2,3 where 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1, if we invite 1 and 2, then friend 1 has friend 2 invited, and friend 2 has friend 3 invited, so friend 1 will come but friend 2 will not come because friend 3 is invited but friend 3's best friend is 1, who is invited, but friend 2 needs friend 3 and friend 3's best friend to be invited.

Wait, no, the condition is: friend i comes if both friend i and friend p_i are invited.

So, for friend 1 to come, both friend 1 and friend p_1 = 2 need to be invited.

For friend 2 to come, both friend 2 and friend p_2 = 3 need to be invited.

For friend 3 to come, both friend 3 and friend p_3 = 1 need to be invited.

So, in this cycle of length 3, if we invite friend 1 and friend 2:

- Friend 1: invited, and friend 2 is invited → friend 1 will come.

- Friend 2: invited, and friend 3 is not invited → friend 2 will not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

If we invite friend 1 and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited, and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited, and friend 1 is invited → friend 3 comes.

Only friend 3 comes, which is not enough.

If we invite friend 1, friend 2, and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited, and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited, and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited, and friend 1 is invited → comes.

All three come, which is more than enough.

But is there a way to have only two invitations and have at least two friends come?

Wait, in the second test case, which is a cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

If we invite friends 1, 2, and 3:

- Friend 1: invited, and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited, and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited, and friend 4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

So, friends 1,2,3 come, which is fine, but the minimal number is 3.

Is it possible to have only 2 invitations and have at least 2 friends come?

Let's try inviting friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited, friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited, friend 3 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

Inviting friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited, friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited, friend 4 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting friends 1 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited, friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited, friend 1 is invited → comes.

Only friend 4 comes, which is not enough.

So, it seems that in a cycle of length 4, we need to invite at least 3 friends to get at least 2 friends to come.

Similarly, in a cycle of length 3, we need to invite all 3 to get all 3 to come, or find another way.

Wait, but maybe there are multiple cycles in the permutation.

In the first test case, there are two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

If we invite friends from different cycles, we might be able to minimize the total invitations.

For example, in the first test case, inviting friends from the cycle of length 2 (say friends 4 and 5) will make both come, since they are each other's best friends.

So, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come, satisfying the condition with only 2 invitations.

In the second test case, with one cycle of length 4, we need to invite at least 3 friends to make at least 2 come, as we saw earlier.

In the third test case, with a cycle of length 2, inviting both friends makes both come.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations depends on the cycle structure.

Let's generalize this.

Suppose we have cycles of various lengths in the permutation.

To minimize the number of invitations, we should look for cycles of length 2, because inviting both friends in a cycle of length 2 makes both come, requiring only 2 invitations for 2 friends to come.

If there are no cycles of length 2, then we have to look at longer cycles.

In a cycle of length k, to get at least 2 friends to come, we might need to invite more friends.

From the earlier observation, in a cycle of length 3, inviting all 3 is needed to get all 3 to come, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe in a cycle of length k, to get at least 2 friends to come, we need to invite k friends.

But that seems too high. Maybe we can do better.

Wait, perhaps in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is ceil(2k / (k - 1)) or something like that.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that in any cycle, to have a friend come, we need to invite both the friend and their best friend.

In a cycle of length k, if we invite a set of friends such that for at least 2 friends, both they and their best friends are invited.

Wait, perhaps in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

Because, in a cycle, each friend's best friend is someone else in the cycle, so to have any friend come, we need to invite a connected pair.

But in practice, as we saw in the first test case with a cycle of length 2, inviting both makes both come, and in a cycle of length 3, inviting all three makes all three come.

But maybe there's a way to have overlapping invitations.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length greater than 2, we need to invite all friends in the cycle to get any of them to come.

But that doesn't seem right, because in the second test case, inviting 3 friends makes 2 come, but maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps in any cycle of length k, to get at least 2 friends to come, we need to invite at least k friends.

But that seems too high. Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let's consider that to have at least 2 friends come, we can look for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, i.e., cycles of length 2.

If such pairs exist, then inviting both in the pair makes both come, requiring only 2 invitations.

If no such pairs exist, then we have to look at larger cycles and invite more friends.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2 (4 and 5), so inviting both makes both come, totaling 2 invitations.

In the second test case, there are no cycles of length 2, only a cycle of length 4, so we need to invite at least 3 friends to get at least 2 to come.

In the third test case, there is a cycle of length 2 (1 and 2), so inviting both makes both come, totaling 2 invitations.

So, perhaps the general strategy is:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- If there are no cycles of length 2, then the minimal number of invitations is ceil(2k / (k - 1)) for cycles of length k, but this seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

Because, in a cycle of length k, to have any friend come, we need to invite both the friend and their best friend, but their best friend's best friend also needs to be invited for the best friend to come, and so on, forming a chain that eventually wraps around the cycle.

So, perhaps in a cycle of length k, to have any single friend come, we need to invite the entire cycle.

But that seems extreme.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose we have a cycle of length k.

We can model this as a graph where each friend is a node, and there is an edge between a friend and their best friend.

This graph is a disjoint union of cycles since the permutation is a derangement with no fixed points.

In such a graph, to have a friend come, we need to invite both ends of each edge that the friend is part of.

Wait, more precisely, for friend i to come, we need to invite both i and p_i.

So, in terms of the graph, for node i to come, we need to invite both i and its neighbor p_i.

Now, we need to select a subset of nodes to invite such that at least 2 nodes come to the party.

This sounds similar to selecting edges in a graph such that at least 2 nodes are covered by those edges.

Wait, but it's not exactly that.

Let me think again.

Each friend coming corresponds to both ends of an edge being invited.

So, in graph terms, for a node to come, both it and its neighbor need to be invited.

Our goal is to invite a subset of nodes such that at least 2 nodes have both themselves and their neighbor invited.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe another approach: since the graph is a union of cycles, and each cycle is of some length k.

In a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come could be related to the minimal number of edges (friend pairs) that cover at least 2 nodes.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of edges needed to cover at least 2 nodes, where inviting both ends of an edge makes the node come.

In that case, in any cycle, selecting any 2 adjacent nodes (an edge) would make both come, but in longer cycles, this might not be sufficient because their best friends are also in the cycle, and their best friends' best friends, and so on.

Wait, no, according to the problem, a friend comes if both they and their best friend are invited, regardless of whether their best friend comes or not.

So, in a cycle of length k, if we invite two adjacent nodes, say nodes i and p_i, then node i will come, and node p_i will come only if both p_i and p_{p_i} are invited.

But since p_{p_i} is also invited (because p_{p_i} is the best friend of p_i), and so on, it seems like inviting the entire cycle might be necessary.

Wait, no, let's think carefully.

Suppose we have a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If we invite nodes 1 and 2:

- Node 1: invited, and p_1 = 2 is invited → comes.

- Node 2: invited, and p_2 = 3 is not invited → does not come.

- Node 3: not invited → does not come.

So, only node 1 comes, which is not enough.

If we invite nodes 1, 2, and 3:

- Node 1: invited, p_1 = 2 is invited → comes.

- Node 2: invited, p_2 = 3 is invited → comes.

- Node 3: invited, p_3 = 1 is invited → comes.

So, all three come.

Thus, to have at least 2 friends come in a cycle of length 3, we need to invite all three.

Similarly, in a cycle of length 4, as in the second test case, inviting 3 out of 4 makes 3 come, but inviting only 2 doesn't suffice.

So, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, we need to invite k friends to get k friends to come.

But in cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come.

Therefore, the minimal number of invitations is:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, then 2 invitations suffice to get 2 friends to come.

- If all cycles are of length >= 3, then we need to invite at least k friends from one cycle to get k friends to come.

But since we only need at least 2 friends to come, perhaps in cycles of length >= 3, we can select a subset that causes at least 2 friends to come with fewer invitations.

But from the earlier examples, it seems not.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

Because, to have any single friend come, we need to invite both the friend and their best friend, but their best friend will not come unless their best friend is also invited, and so on, wrapping around the cycle.

Hence, in cycles of length >= 3, inviting fewer than k friends will not result in at least 2 friends coming.

Therefore, the strategy is:

- If there is a cycle of length 2, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- Otherwise, in cycles of length >= 3, the minimal number of invitations is the length of the smallest cycle.

But wait, in the second test case, the cycle is of length 4, and the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Is 3 less than the cycle length 4? It seems so.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is ceil(2k / (k - 1)).

But for k=3, ceil(6 / 2) = 3, which matches the second test case.

For k=4, ceil(8 / 3) ≈ 3, which also matches.

For k=2, it would be ceil(4 / 1) = 4, which is more than 2, but in reality, 2 invitations suffice.

So, perhaps this formula doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

In the second test case, k=4, and minimal invitations are 3, which is less than k.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was k, but in practice, for k=4, it's 3.

Wait, maybe it's floor(k / 2) * 2.

For k=3, floor(3/2)*2 = 2*2=4, which is more than 3.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's k - 1.

For k=3, it's 2, but in reality, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, no.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that in a cycle of length k, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to select a subset of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends have both themselves and their best friend invited.

This sounds similar to selecting edges in the cycle graph such that at least 2 nodes are covered by those edges.

In graph theory, selecting edges to cover nodes is related to matching.

But in this case, it's more specific.

Wait, perhaps it's about selecting a subset of nodes such that their closed neighborhood (the node and its neighbors) covers at least 2 nodes.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about selecting pairs of friends who are best friends of each other.

In cycles of length 2, this is straightforward.

In cycles of length k >= 3, perhaps we need to select a chain of invitations that covers at least 2 friends.

This is getting too vague.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let's consider that in any cycle, inviting all but one friend will make all the invited friends come, because each invited friend has their best friend also invited, except for the one friend not invited.

Wait, no.

In a cycle of length k, if we invite k-1 friends, missing one, then the missing friend's best friend is invited, but the missing friend is not invited, so their best friend doesn't come.

Wait, no, more carefully:

Suppose in a cycle of length 3: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If we invite 1 and 2, but not 3:

- Friend 1: invited, p_1=2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited, p_2=3 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: not invited → does not come.

Only friend 1 comes.

If we invite 1 and 3, not 2:

- Friend 1: invited, p_1=2 is not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 3: invited, p_3=1 is invited → comes.

Only friend 3 comes.

If we invite 2 and 3, not 1:

- Friend 1: not invited → does not come.

- Friend 2: invited, p_2=3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited, p_3=1 is not invited → does not come.

Only friend 2 comes.

So, in a cycle of length 3, inviting any two doesn't suffice to have at least two friends come; we need to invite all three.

Similarly, in a cycle of length 4, inviting any three makes all three come, as in the second test case.

So, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

Because inviting any k-1 friends doesn't ensure that at least 2 friends come, as only one friend might come.

Wait, but in the second test case, inviting 3 friends makes 3 friends come, but inviting only 2 doesn't make at least 2 come.

Hence, in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations is k.

But in cycles of length 2, it's 2.

Therefore, the overall minimal number of invitations is the minimum over all cycles of the minimal invitations needed for that cycle.

Wait, but if there are multiple cycles, we can choose to invite from any cycle.

So, to minimize the total invitations, we should choose the cycle that allows us to achieve the goal with the fewest invitations.

Therefore, if there is a cycle of length 2, we can invite both friends from that cycle, totaling 2 invitations, which is the minimal possible.

If there are no cycles of length 2, then we have to consider cycles of length >= 3, and in those, to get at least 2 friends to come, we need to invite all friends in that cycle.

But, since we only need at least 2 friends to come, and inviting all friends in a cycle of length k >= 3 makes all k friends come, but perhaps there is a way to invite fewer than k friends to get exactly 2 friends to come.

But from earlier observations, in cycles of length >= 3, inviting fewer than k friends doesn't suffice to have at least 2 friends come.

Hence, in cycles of length >= 3, the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is equal to the length of the cycle.

Therefore, the minimal total invitations needed is the minimal among:

- 2, if there is a cycle of length 2.

- The length of the smallest cycle, if all cycles are of length >= 3.

In other words, find the smallest cycle length m in the permutation.

If m = 2, then the minimal invitations are 2.

If m >= 3, then the minimal invitations are m.

Wait, but in the second test case, m=4, and the minimal invitations are 3, not 4.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with this conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is ceil(2k / (k - 1)).

For k=3, ceil(6 / 2) = 3, which matches the earlier observation.

For k=4, ceil(8 / 3) ≈ 3, which also matches the second test case.

For k=2, ceil(4 / 1) = 4, but in reality, 2 invitations suffice.

So, perhaps this formula overestimates for k=2.

Alternatively, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations is floor(k / 2) + 1.

For k=3, floor(3/2)+1 = 1+1=2, but earlier we saw that in a cycle of length 3, inviting 2 doesn't suffice, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, doesn't match.

For k=4, floor(4/2)+1=2+1=3, which matches the second test case.

For k=3, floor(3/2)+1=1+1=2, but in reality, we need to invite 3.

So, doesn't hold for k=3.

Wait, perhaps it's k - floor(k / 3).

Wait, for k=3, 3 - 1=2, which is less than actual 3.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's k - 1 for k >=3.

For k=3, it's 2, but again, in reality, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, no.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to accept that in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is k.

And in cycles of length 2, it's 2.

Therefore, to minimize the total invitations, if there exists a cycle of length 2, then the minimal invitations are 2; otherwise, it's the length of the smallest cycle.

Given that, let's see.

In the first test case, cycles are of lengths 2 and 3, so minimal invitations are 2.

In the second test case, cycle of length 4, so minimal invitations are 4.

But in the example, the output is 3 for the second test case.

So, my current logic is inconsistent with the example.

Hence, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to get at least 2 friends to come is k - 1.

In the second test case, k=4, so k -1 =3, which matches the example output.

In the first test case, k=3, so k -1 =2, but in that test case, there is also a cycle of length 2, so minimal invitations are 2, which is less than k -1=2, but in this case, it's equal.

Wait, but in a cycle of length 3, inviting k -1=2 friends doesn't suffice, as we saw earlier.

But according to this, it would be 2, but in reality, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, perhaps this formula doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps in cycles of length k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations is ceil(2k / (k +1)) * floor(k /2), or something like that.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let's consider that in any cycle, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite a set of friends such that at least 2 friends have both themselves and their best friend invited.

In other words, for at least 2 friends, both they and their best friend are invited.

Given that, perhaps we can model this as finding a subset S of friends to invite such that the number of friends i in S where p_i is also in S is at least 2.

Our goal is to minimize the size of S.

This sounds similar to some kind of set cover problem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of edges in a graph, where each edge represents a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.

Wait, but in cycles of length greater than 2, no such pairs exist.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting pairs where both ends are invited.

In a cycle of length k, the number of such pairs is k, since each friend is connected to their best friend.

So, to have at least 2 friends come, we need at least 2 such pairs to be fully invited.

But in cycles of length >=3, selecting 2 adjacent pairs might cover more than 2 friends, due to overlap.

For example, in a cycle of length 3: 1-2-3-1.

If we select to invite 1 and 2, that covers pair (1,2), but friend 2 also requires pair (2,3), which isn't fully invited unless 3 is invited.

Hence, to have friend 1 and friend 2 come, we need to invite 1,2, and 3.

Wait, but in reality, inviting 1,2, and 3 makes all three come, which is more than enough.

But to have at least 2 friends come, perhaps inviting all friends in the smallest cycle suffices.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is the size of the smallest cycle in the permutation.

In the first test case, the smallest cycle has length 2, so invitations=2.

In the second test case, the smallest cycle has length 4, so invitations=4.

But in the example, the output is 3 for the second test case, not 4.

Hence, this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's the size of the smallest cycle minus one.

For k=4, it would be 3, which matches the example.

For k=3, it would be 2, but in reality, in a cycle of length 3, inviting 2 doesn't suffice, as we've seen.

Hence, this doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number of invitations is the smallest integer m such that m >=2 and m >= ceil(2k / (k -1)) for all cycles of length k.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that in cycles of length k >=3, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite at least floor((k +1)/2) friends.

For k=3, floor(4/2)=2, but in reality, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k /2).

For k=3, ceil(1.5)=2, which again doesn't suffice.

Wait, perhaps it's k - ceil(k /3).

For k=3, 3 -1=2, which is insufficient.

No.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let's consider that in any cycle, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite a set of friends such that there are at least 2 friends who have both themselves and their best friend invited.

In graph terms, in the cycle graph, we need at least 2 nodes that have both themselves and their neighbor invited.

This seems similar to selecting a dominating set in the graph, but with a specific condition.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the concept of a vertex cover, where we select a subset of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one selected vertex.

But in this problem, it's different because we need friends to have both themselves and their best friend invited.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of selecting friends such that their best friend is also invited, and their best friend's best friend is invited, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should consider that in any cycle, to have a friend come, we need to invite both the friend and their best friend.

Hence, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite at least 2 friends and their best friends.

But in cycles of length >=3, this can lead to needing to invite more friends due to dependencies.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is k.

Because, to have any friend come, we need to invite the entire cycle.

But in the second test case, inviting 3 friends makes 3 friends come, which is sufficient, but according to this, we would need to invite all 4.

But the example shows that 3 invitations suffice, so inviting all 4 is not necessary.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is floor(2k / (k -1)).

For k=3, floor(6 / 2)=3, which matches.

For k=4, floor(8 / 3)=2, which is less than the example's 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k / (k -1)) * 2.

For k=3, ceil(3 /2)=2 *2=4, which is more than needed.

No.

This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I should accept that in cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come, requiring 2 invitations.

In cycles of length >=3, inviting all friends in the cycle makes all come, requiring k invitations.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is the smallest cycle's length if it's 2, else, it's the length of the smallest cycle.

But in the second test case, with a cycle of length 4, the minimal invitations are 3, not 4.

Hence, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is k -1.

For k=3, it's 2, but in reality, we need to invite all 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((k +1)/2).

For k=3, floor(4/2)=2, which is insufficient.

No.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is ceil(2k / (k +1)).

For k=3, ceil(6 /4)=2, which is insufficient.

No.

This is not working.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that in any cycle, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite a set of friends such that there are at least 2 friends who have both themselves and their best friend invited.

Hence, for each friend to come, both they and their best friend must be invited.

So, for at least 2 friends to come, we need at least 2 such pairs.

In a cycle of length k, the number of such pairs is k, since each friend is connected to their best friend.

But inviting k friends in a cycle of length k ensures that all friends come, but inviting fewer may not suffice.

In cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come.

In cycles of length >=3, inviting k -1 friends doesn't ensure that at least 2 friends come, as only one friend might come.

Hence, in cycles of length >=3, the minimal number of invitations is k.

Therefore, the overall minimal number of invitations is the minimum over all cycles of the minimal invitations needed for that cycle.

Hence, if there exists a cycle of length 2, the minimal invitations are 2; otherwise, it's the length of the smallest cycle.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2, so invitations=2.

In the second test case, the smallest cycle is of length 4, so invitations=4.

But according to the example, the output is 3 for the second test case, not 4.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is floor((k +1)/2).

For k=3, floor(4/2)=2, which is insufficient.

For k=4, floor(5/2)=2, which is also insufficient.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's k - floor(k /3).

For k=3, 3 -1=2, insufficient.

For k=4, 4 -1=3, which matches the second test case.

But in reality, for k=3, inviting 2 doesn't suffice, so it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length k >=3, the minimal number of invitations is k -1 if k is even, and k if k is odd.

For k=3, it's 3, which matches.

For k=4, it's 3, which matches.

Hence, perhaps the formula is:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

- Else, for cycles of length k >=3, minimal invitations are k -1.

This seems consistent with the second test case.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2, so invitations=2.

In the second test case, cycle length=4, so invitations=3.

In the third test case, cycle length=2, so invitations=2.

This matches the example output.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, then 2.

- Else, for cycles of length k >=3, it's k -1 for the smallest such cycle.

Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to:

1. Find all cycles in the permutation.

2. Identify the smallest cycle's length.

3. If the smallest cycle has length 2, output 2.

Else, output k -1 for that cycle.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, so k -1=3, which matches the output.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2, so output 2.

In the third test case, cycle length=2, so output 2.

Hence, this seems correct.

Therefore, the approach is:

- Find all cycles in the permutation.

- Find the smallest cycle's length.

- If the smallest cycle has length 2, output 2.

Else, output k -1, where k is the smallest cycle's length.

Hence, to implement this, we need to find all cycles in the permutation.

Given that n can be up to 50, and t up to 5000, we need an efficient way to find the cycle lengths.

We can do this by performing a graph traversal, such as DFS or BFS, marking visited nodes, and recording the cycle lengths.

Once we have all cycle lengths, we find the smallest one.

Then, based on whether the smallest cycle is of length 2, output 2; else, output k -1.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, and output is 3, which is k -1=3.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2, so output 2.

In the third test case, cycle length=2, output 2.

Hence, this seems consistent.

Therefore, the plan is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the permutation p.

- Find all cycles in p.

- Find the smallest cycle's length.

- If the smallest cycle's length is 2, print 2.

Else, print (smallest cycle's length) -1.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n <=50 and t <=5000, we need an efficient way to find the cycle lengths.

We can implement a function that finds all cycles in the permutation.

Here's how we can do it:

- Initialize a visited array of size n.

- For each unvisited node, perform a DFS to find the cycle.

- In DFS, keep track of the path from the starting node to the current node.

- When we reach a node that is already in the path, we have found a cycle.

- Record the length of this cycle.

- Continue until all nodes are visited.

- Find the smallest cycle length.

- Based on whether the smallest cycle is of length 2, output 2; else, output k -1.

Wait, but in practice, implementing DFS for cycle detection can be a bit involved, especially in Python, considering time constraints.

Given that n is small (<=50), and t is up to 5000, we need an efficient implementation.

Alternatively, since p is a permutation, we can iterate through each node and follow the permutation until we return to the starting node, counting the cycle length.

Here's how we can do it:

- Initialize a visited array of size n.

- For each unvisited node i from 0 to n-1:

- If visited[i], continue.

- Else, start a new cycle.

- Initialize a set to store the nodes in this cycle.

- Set current = i.

- While current is not in the set:

- Add current to the set.

- current = p[current] -1 (since p is 1-based index).

- The cycle length is the size of the set.

- Record this cycle length.

- Mark all nodes in this cycle as visited.

- Find the smallest cycle length.

- If the smallest cycle length is 2, print 2.

Else, print smallest cycle length -1.

This should work efficiently since for each test case, n is small.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. n=2, p=[1,2]: cycle lengths [2].

- Output 2.

2. n=2, p=[2,1]: cycle lengths [2].

- Output 2.

3. n=3, p=[2,3,1]: cycle lengths [3].

- Output 2 (since k=3, k-1=2).

4. n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]: cycle lengths [4].

- Output 3.

5. n=5, p=[2,3,4,5,1]: cycle lengths [5].

- Output 4.

6. n=5, p=[2,1
