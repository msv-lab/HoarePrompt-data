Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and all p_i are distinct, this means that the best friendships are pairwise unique. In other words, if friend A's best friend is B, then friend B's best friend is A, and so on.

Wait, actually, the problem says that all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, it's like a permutation where no element is in its own position, and each p_i maps uniquely to another friend.

But in the example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which means:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

So, in this case, it's not necessarily that if A's best friend is B, then B's best friend is A. For example, friend 1's best friend is 3, but friend 3's best friend is 2, not 1. So, it's not necessarily mutual.

Wait, but the problem says all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. It doesn't specify that the best friendships are mutual. So, it's possible to have asymmetric best friendships.

Given that, I need to model this as a graph where friends are nodes, and there's a directed edge from A to B if A's best friend is B.

So, in the first example:

- 1 → 3

- 2 → 1

- 3 → 2

- 4 → 5

- 5 → 4

So, this forms two cycles: 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 and 4 → 5 → 4.

Now, the condition for a friend to come to the party is that both they and their best friend receive an invitation. So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited.

Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come, and he wants to send the minimum number of invitations.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a set of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party, and the number of invitations is minimized.

Given the directed graph representation, where each edge represents a best friend relationship, I need to select a set of friends to invite such that for at least 2 friends, both they and their best friend are invited.

I need to minimize the number of invitations sent.

Let me consider the cycles in the graph. In the first example, there are two cycles: a triangle (1,3,2) and a cycle of length 2 (4,5).

In the first cycle (1,3,2), if I invite 1 and 3, then friend 1 will come because 1 and p1=3 are invited, and friend 3 will come because 3 and p3=2 are invited. So, two friends come, and I've sent invitations to two friends.

But wait, in this case, friend 2 will also come because 2 and p2=1 are invited. So, inviting 1 and 3 makes friends 1, 2, and 3 come. But I only need at least two friends to come, so this satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, since 4 and p4=5 are invited, and 5 and p5=4 are invited.

So, in this case, inviting two friends is sufficient.

In the second test case:

n=4

p=[2,3,4,1]

So, the graph is:

1 → 2

2 → 3

3 → 4

4 → 1

This is a cycle of length 4.

If I invite 1 and 2, then friend 1 will come because 1 and 2 are invited, and friend 2 will come because 2 and 3 are invited. So, friends 1 and 2 will come.

But according to the problem's sample output, it seems that inviting 3 friends is necessary.

Wait, in the sample input, for the second test case, the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]

So, the graph is a cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1

If I invite 1 and 2, then:

- Friend 1 will come because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 will come because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 will not come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited.

- Friend 4 will not come because 4 and 1 are invited, but 1 is invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 will come.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"The i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must receive invitations.

In the second test case, if Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3:

- Friend 1 will come because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 will come because 2 and 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 will come because 3 and 4 are invited, but 4 is not invited.

- Friend 4 will not come because 4 and 1 are invited, but 1 is invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 will come, but friend 3 will not come because 4 is not invited.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to invite 1, 2, and 4.

- Friend 1 will come because 1 and 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 will come because 2 and 3 are invited, but 3 is not invited.

- Friend 3 will not come because 3 and 4 are invited, and 4 is invited.

- Friend 4 will come because 4 and 1 are invited.

So, friends 1 and 4 will come.

Still, only two friends are coming.

Wait, maybe inviting 1, 3, and 4.

- Friend 1 will come because 1 and 2 are invited, but 2 is not invited.

- Friend 2 will not come because 2 and 3 are invited, but 3 is invited.

- Friend 3 will come because 3 and 4 are invited.

- Friend 4 will come because 4 and 1 are invited.

So, friends 3 and 4 will come.

Is this what the sample is expecting?

But why is the sample output 3? Maybe because in some cases, inviting two friends is not sufficient to make two friends come, so you need to invite more.

Wait, perhaps in some configurations, inviting two friends isn't enough to make two friends come.

Wait, let's consider n=2, p=[2,1]

So, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends.

If Monocarp invites both 1 and 2, then both will come because each has their best friend invited.

If he invites only one, say 1, then friend 1 will not come because 2 is not invited, and friend 2 will not come because 1 is invited but 2 didn't receive an invitation.

So, in this case, inviting two friends is necessary to make both come.

But according to the sample input, for n=2, p=[2,1], the output is 2, which matches this.

In the first test case, inviting two friends is sufficient to make at least two friends come.

In the second test case, inviting two friends sometimes only makes one friend come, so you need to invite three to make at least two come.

Wait, perhaps in the second test case, with n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1], inviting any two friends will only make one friend come, so you need to invite three.

Let me check:

Option 1: invite 1 and 2

- Friend 1 comes (1 and 2 invited)

- Friend 2 comes (2 and 3 invited, but 3 not invited) → no, friend 2 does not come

Wait, according to the condition, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

Wait, no, the condition is that friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

So, for friend 2: i=2, p_i=3. So, friend 2 comes only if both 2 and 3 are invited.

In this case, if Monocarp invites 1 and 2, then:

- Friend 1 comes if 1 and 2 are invited → yes

- Friend 2 comes if 2 and 3 are invited → no, since 3 is not invited

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 4 are invited → no, since 4 is not invited

- Friend 4 comes if 4 and 1 are invited → no, since 1 is invited but 4 is not

So, only friend 1 comes.

Hence, inviting two friends is not sufficient to make at least two friends come.

If Monocarp invites three friends, for example, 1, 2, and 3:

- Friend 1 comes (1 and 2 invited)

- Friend 2 comes (2 and 3 invited)

- Friend 3 comes (3 and 4 invited, but 4 not invited) → no

- Friend 4 comes (4 and 1 invited, but 4 not invited) → no

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Alternatively, invite 1, 2, and 4:

- Friend 1 comes (1 and 2 invited)

- Friend 2 comes (2 and 3 invited, but 3 not invited) → no

- Friend 3 comes (3 and 4 invited, and 4 invited) → yes

- Friend 4 comes (4 and 1 invited)

So, friends 1, 3, and 4 come.

Hence, at least two friends come.

So, in this case, inviting three friends is necessary to make at least two come.

Hence, the output is 3.

From this, I can see that the structure of the best friend relationships affects the minimum number of invitations needed.

I need to find a general way to determine the minimum number of invitations for any given n and p.

Let me think about the graph representation again.

Each friend is a node, and there is a directed edge from i to p_i.

Since all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this graph consists of disjoint cycles and/or disjoint cycles with trees attached.

Wait, no, since it's a permutation without fixed points, it's a collection of disjoint cycles.

In the first test case, there are two cycles: a triangle (1,3,2) and a 2-cycle (4,5).

In the second test case, there is one 4-cycle (1,2,3,4).

In the third test case, there is one 2-cycle (1,2).

So, in general, the graph is a collection of disjoint cycles.

Given that, I can think in terms of cycles.

Now, within a cycle of length k, how many invitations do I need to send to make at least two friends from that cycle come?

Let's consider a cycle of length k.

In a cycle of length k, if I invite m friends, how many friends will come?

A friend in the cycle comes if both they and their best friend are invited.

In a cycle, each friend's best friend is the next in the cycle.

Wait, in the first test case, the cycle is 1 → 3 → 2 → 1.

If I invite 1 and 3, then friend 1 comes (1 and 3 invited), friend 3 comes (3 and 2 invited), and friend 2 comes (2 and 1 invited). So, all three come.

If I invite two adjacent friends in the cycle, then both will come, and possibly more.

Wait, in a cycle of length k, what is the minimal number of invitations to make at least two friends come?

Let me consider different cycle lengths.

First, cycle of length 2: 1 → 2 → 1.

If I invite both 1 and 2, then both come.

If I invite only one, say 1, then friend 1 does not come because 2 is not invited, and friend 2 does not come because 1 is invited but 2 is not.

Hence, to make at least two friends come, I need to invite both, totaling 2 invitations.

Second, cycle of length 3: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1.

If I invite two friends:

- Case 1: invite two adjacent friends, say 1 and 2.

Then, friend 1 comes (1 and 2 invited), friend 2 comes (2 and 3 invited), friend 3 comes (3 and 1 invited).

So, all three come.

- Case 2: invite two non-adjacent friends, say 1 and 3.

Then, friend 1 comes (1 and 2 invited, but 2 is not necessarily invited), wait no, the condition is that both i and p_i are invited.

Wait, in this case, for friend 1 to come, both 1 and p1=3 must be invited.

Wait, p1=3, so friend 1 comes if 1 and 3 are invited.

Similarly, friend 3 comes if 3 and p3=2 are invited.

Friend 2 comes if 2 and p2=1 are invited.

So, if I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: 1 and 3 invited → comes

- Friend 3: 3 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

Hence, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, this is different from my earlier assumption.

Wait, in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, p1=3, p2=1, p3=2, p4=5, p5=4

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 2's best friend is 1, friend 3's best friend is 2, friend 4's best friend is 5, friend 5's best friend is 4.

So, in this case, if I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: 1 and 3 invited → comes

- Friend 3: 3 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → 1 is invited but 2 is not → does not come

- Friend 4: 4 and 5 invited → but 5 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 5: 5 and 4 invited → but 5 is not invited → does not come

So, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come.

Wait, p4=5, p5=4.

So, if I invite 4 and 5:

- Friend 4: 4 and 5 invited → comes

- Friend 5: 5 and 4 invited → comes

- Friend 1: 1 and 3 invited → but 3 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → but 1 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 3: 3 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

So, friends 4 and 5 come.

Hence, inviting two friends is sufficient.

But according to my earlier calculation, inviting two friends in the triangle doesn't make two friends come.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recast the condition.

Friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

In the triangle:

- p1=3, p2=1, p3=2

So, in the triangle:

- Friend 1 comes if 1 and 3 are invited

- Friend 2 comes if 2 and 1 are invited

- Friend 3 comes if 3 and 2 are invited

If I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: 1 and 3 invited → comes

- Friend 3: 3 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

Hence, only friend 1 comes.

Wait, but in the first test case, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come, since p4=5 and p5=4.

So, in cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come.

In cycles of length 3, inviting two adjacent friends makes only one come, as shown above.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2.

To make at least two friends come, I can invite both from the cycle of length 2, which makes two friends come.

Alternatively, inviting two from the cycle of length 3 only makes one come, but inviting one from each cycle might make more come.

Wait, but in this case, inviting 4 and 5 makes two come, which is sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2.

In the second test case, there is a single cycle of length 4: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1.

In this cycle, if I invite two friends:

- Case 1: invite two adjacent friends, say 1 and 2.

Then:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → comes

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 invited → but 3 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 3: 3 and 4 invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 4: 4 and 1 invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come

So, only friend 1 comes.

- Case 2: invite two friends who are not adjacent, say 1 and 3.

Then:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 3: 3 and 4 invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 invited → but 3 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 4: 4 and 1 invited → but 1 is not invited → does not come

So, no one comes.

- Case 3: invite three friends, say 1, 2, and 3.

Then:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → comes

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 invited → comes

- Friend 3: 3 and 4 invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 4: 4 and 1 invited → but 4 is not invited → does not come

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

- Case 4: invite 1, 3, and 4.

Then:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 3: 3 and 4 invited → comes

- Friend 4: 4 and 1 invited → comes

- Friend 2: 2 and 3 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

So, friends 3 and 4 come.

Hence, in both cases, inviting three friends makes two friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

In the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1]

If I invite both 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → comes

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → comes

Hence, both come.

If I invite only one, say 1:

- Friend 1: 1 and 2 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

- Friend 2: 2 and 1 invited → but 2 is not invited → does not come

Hence, no one comes.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2.

From these observations, I can see a pattern.

In cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come.

In cycles of length 3, inviting two makes only one come, so to make two come, I need to invite three.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2.

Inviting two from the cycle of length 2 makes two come, which is sufficient.

In the second test case, a cycle of length 4, inviting two makes only one come, so need to invite three.

In the third test case, cycle of length 2, inviting two makes two come.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is the smallest number such that the number of friends who come is at least 2.

Given that, I need to find, for each cycle, how many invitations to send to make a certain number of friends come.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of selecting subsets of friends to invite, and then calculating who comes based on that.

But that seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have disjoint cycles.

In each cycle, the friends come in pairs if both are invited.

Wait, no, in a cycle, it's not exactly pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset of friends to invite, and then determining who comes based on whether both they and their best friend are invited.

This sounds similar to selecting a dominating set in a graph, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of matching.

Wait, maybe I need to look for a way to cover the friends with their best friends.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the graph's cycles.

In a cycle of length k, what is the minimal number of invitations to make at least m friends come?

This seems complex.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length k, the number of friends who come is equal to the number of pairs where both friends are invited.

Wait, no.

Actually, for each friend, if they and their best friend are invited, they come.

So, in a cycle, it's like selecting nodes such that their best friends are also invited.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the condition for friend i to come is that both i and p_i are invited.

So, to make friend i come, I need to invite both i and p_i.

But p_i is unique for each i, and p_i ≠ i.

Hence, for each friend that comes, two invitations are required: one for the friend and one for their best friend.

But, since best friends can overlap, there might be some overlaps in invitations.

Wait, but in the first test case, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come, and they are each other's best friends.

Similarly, in the third test case, inviting 1 and 2 makes both come, as they are each other's best friends.

In the second test case, inviting 1, 3, and 4 makes friends 3 and 4 come, because 3 and 4 are invited, and their best friends 4 and 1 are also invited.

Wait, but in this case, friend 3 comes because 3 and 4 are invited, and friend 4 comes because 4 and 1 are invited.

So, in total, two friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Is there a general formula for this?

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a graph where each edge represents a best friend relationship.

Each cycle in this graph represents a group of friends who are chained together in their best friend preferences.

To make a friend come, both the friend and their best friend must be invited.

So, in a cycle of length k, to make m friends come, I need to invite at least m pairs of friends.

But since each invitation covers one friend, and each coming friend requires two invitations (themselves and their best friend), there is some overlap.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as selecting a subset S of friends to invite, and then the friends who come are those for whom both they and their best friend are in S.

So, the number of friends who come is the number of friends i where i and p_i are both in S.

Our goal is to have at least 2 such friends, while minimizing the size of S.

This sounds like a set cover problem, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach it given the structure of the problem.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to make m friends come can be determined based on the cycle length.

In a cycle of length 2:

- Inviting both makes both come (2 invitations, 2 friends come)

- Inviting one doesn't make any come

Hence, to make at least 2 friends come, need to invite both.

In a cycle of length 3:

- Inviting 2 adjacent friends makes 1 friend come

- Inviting 2 non-adjacent friends makes 1 friend come

- Inviting all 3 makes all 3 come

Hence, to make at least 2 friends come, need to invite all 3.

In a cycle of length 4:

- Inviting 2 adjacent friends makes 1 friend come

- Inviting 2 non-adjacent friends makes 0 friends come

- Inviting 3 friends can make 2 friends come, as shown in the second test case

Hence, for cycle lengths greater than 2, the minimal number of invitations to make at least 2 friends come is 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2.

Inviting 2 friends from the cycle of length 2 makes 2 friends come, which is sufficient.

Hence, in that case, inviting 2 is sufficient.

In the second test case, a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come.

Hence, the minimal number is 3.

In the third test case, cycle of length 2, inviting 2 makes 2 friends come.

Hence, in general, for cycles of length 2, inviting 2 is sufficient to make 2 friends come.

For cycles of length greater than 2, inviting 3 is necessary to make at least 2 friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- If there is at least one cycle of length 2, then 2

- Otherwise, 3

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 3, and the minimal number is 2.

In the second test case, only a cycle of length 4, minimal number is 3.

In the third test case, only a cycle of length 2, minimal number is 2.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there is at least one cycle of length 2, otherwise 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 3, and the minimal number is 2.

Because inviting 2 from the cycle of length 2 makes 2 friends come.

In the second test case, only a cycle of length 4, minimal number is 3.

In the third test case, only a cycle of length 2, minimal number is 2.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2, else 3.

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me consider a cycle of length 4.

As in the second test case, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come.

Is it possible to have a cycle where inviting 2 makes at least 2 friends come?

In a cycle of length 4, as shown earlier, inviting 2 makes only one friend come.

Hence, in cycles longer than 2, inviting 3 is necessary to make at least 2 friends come.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists a cycle of length 2, else 3.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to check if there is any cycle of length 2 in the graph.

If there is, then the minimal number of invitations is 2; else, it's 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 3, and the minimal is 2.

Because I can focus on the cycle of length 2 to achieve the minimal invitations.

Hence, the presence of any cycle of length 2 reduces the minimal invitations to 2, otherwise it's 3.

Is this always the case?

Let me consider a graph with multiple cycles.

For example, cycles of length 2 and 3.

In that case, the minimal is 2.

Another example: cycles of length 3 and 3.

Then, minimal is 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, it's cycles of length 3 and 2, minimal is 2.

In the second test case, cycle of length 4, minimal is 3.

In the third test case, cycle of length 2, minimal is 2.

Hence, the general rule is: if there exists at least one cycle of length 2, then the minimal number of invitations is 2; otherwise, it's 3.

Hence, I just need to check if there is any cycle of length 2 in the graph.

Given that p_i is a permutation without fixed points and all p_i are distinct, a cycle of length 2 would be i and p_i forming a mutual pair, i.e., p_{p_i} = i.

Wait, but in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, p1=3, p3=2, p2=1, p4=5, p5=4

Hence, p_{p1} = p3 = 2 ≠1, so it's not a mutual pair.

Wait, in the cycle of length 2, say 4 and 5, p4=5 and p5=4, so p_{p4}=4.

Hence, in this case, p_{p_i}=i for friends in a cycle of length 2.

Hence, to detect a cycle of length 2, I can check if p_{p_i}=i for any i.

If there exists an i such that p_{p_i}=i, then there is a cycle of length 2.

Else, all cycles are of length greater than 2, and the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is:

- 2, if there exists at least one i such that p_{p_i}=i

- 3, otherwise

Wait, but in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

Let's check p_{p_i} for each i:

- i=1, p1=3, p3=2 ≠1

- i=2, p2=1, p1=3 ≠2

- i=3, p3=2, p2=1 ≠3

- i=4, p4=5, p5=4=4

- i=5, p5=4, p4=5 ≠5

Hence, for i=4, p_{p4}=p5=4=i.

Hence, there is a cycle of length 2 involving 4 and 5.

Hence, minimal invitations are 2.

In the second test case, p=[2,3,4,1]

Check p_{p_i}:

- i=1, p1=2, p2=3 ≠1

- i=2, p2=3, p3=4 ≠2

- i=3, p3=4, p4=1 ≠3

- i=4, p4=1, p1=2 ≠4

Hence, no cycle of length 2, so minimal invitations are 3.

In the third test case, p=[2,1]

- i=1, p1=2, p2=1=1

- i=2, p2=1, p1=2=2

Hence, p_{p_i}=i for both i=1 and i=2, indicating a cycle of length 2.

Hence, minimal invitations are 2.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists at least one i such that p_{p_i}=i, else 3.

Hence, the program should check for each i if p_{p_i}=i, and if yes, print 2; else, print 3.

Wait, but in the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

For i=4, p4=5, p5=4=4, so p_{p4}=4=i.

Hence, there is a cycle of length 2.

Hence, minimal invitations are 2.

Similarly, in the third test case, p=[2,1], p_{p1}=p2=1=i for i=1, and p_{p2}=p1=2=i for i=2.

Hence, cycle of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

In the second test case, no such i exists, hence minimal invitations are 3.

Hence, the program should check if there exists any i such that p_{p_i}=i.

If yes, print 2; else, print 3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, in the first test case, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], output is 2.

In the second test case, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], output is 3.

In the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1], output is 2.

Hence, this seems correct.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists at least one i such that p_{p_i}=i, else 3.

Hence, in the program, for each test case, iterate through all i, check if p_{p_i}=i, and if any such i exists, print 2; else, print 3.

Wait, but in the program provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let me look at the given program.

Given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

x = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3 (number of test cases), and for each test case, the first line is x (number of friends), then the list p.

But in the function, it's taking n as the number of test cases, then for each test case, reading x and l.

But in the first line of the input, it's t (number of test cases), then for each test case, first line is n (number of friends), second line is p.

Hence, the function seems to be misinterpreting the input.

It's taking n as the number of test cases, then for each test case, reading x (number of friends), then the list p.

But according to the problem, the first line is t (number of test cases), then for each test case, first line is n, second line is p.

Hence, the function should be reading t first, then for each test case, read n and p.

But in the given function, it's reading n as t, then for each test case, reading x as n, and l as p.

Hence, it's correctly reading the input.

Now, in the loop, it's iterating through each friend i from 0 to x-1, and checking if l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1.

Wait, l is the list p, 1-indexed.

So, l[i]-1 is p_i -1.

Then, l[l[i]-1] is p_{p_i}.

So, l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1 means p_{p_i} == p_i -1.

Wait, but p_i is 1-indexed, so p_{p_i} should be compared to i.

But i is 0-indexed in the loop.

Wait, l[i] is p_i, which is 1-indexed.

So, l[l[i]-1] is p_{p_i}.

And l[i]-1 is p_i -1.

So, p_{p_i} == p_i -1.

Wait, that's not checking if p_{p_i} == i.

Because i is 0-indexed, and p_i is 1-indexed.

Hence, to check if p_{p_i} == i, it should be l[l[i]-1] == i+1.

Wait, l[l[i]-1] is p_{p_i}, which is 1-indexed.

i is 0-indexed, so i+1 is the 1-indexed friend.

Hence, to check if p_{p_i} == i, it should be l[l[i]-1] == i+1.

But in the given code, it's checking l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1, which is p_{p_i} == p_i -1, which is not the same.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

It should be checking if p_{p_i} == i, which is l[l[i]-1] == i+1.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

Wait, but in the first test case, it outputs 2, which is correct.

In the second test case, it would check for each i:

i=0: l[l[0]-1] = l[2-1]=l[1]=1, and l[0]-1=2-1=1 → 1==1 → print 2

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=3, and l[1]-1=1-1=0 → 3==0? No

i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1, and l[2]-1=2-1=1 → 1==1 → print 2

i=3: l[l[3]-1]=l[5-1]=l[4]=4, and l[3]-1=5-1=4 → 4==4 → print 2

i=4: l[l[4]-1]=l[4-1]=l[3]=5, and l[4]-1=4-1=3 → 5==3? No

Hence, for i=0,1,3, it finds l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1, which is true for i=0 and i=2.

Wait, but l[i]-1 is p_i -1, which is not equal to i.

Wait, in the first test case, for i=0, l[l[0]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1, and l[0]-1=2-1=1 → 1==1, which is true.

Similarly, for i=2, l[l[2]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1, and l[2]-1=2-1=1 → 1==1.

Hence, it prints 2, which is correct.

In the second test case, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]

So, l=[2,3,4,1]

Check for each i:

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2, and l[0]-1=2-1=1 → 2==1? No

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[3-1]=l[2]=4, and l[1]-1=3-1=2 → 4==2? No

i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[4-1]=l[3]=1, and l[2]-1=4-1=3 → 1==3? No

i=3: l[l[3]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2, and l[3]-1=1-1=0 → 2==0? No

Hence, no i satisfies l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1, so it prints 3, which is correct.

In the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1]

l=[2,1]

Check for each i:

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2, and l[0]-1=2-1=1 → 2==1? No

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2, and l[1]-1=1-1=0 → 2==0? No

Hence, it would print 3, but the sample output is 2.

Hence, incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for the third test case, it's n=2, p=[2,1], and output is 2.

But according to the code, it would print 3, which is incorrect.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

Wait, but in the first and second test cases, it gives the correct output, but in the third test case, it gives an incorrect output.

Hence, it's not always correct.

Hence, Correctness: False

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there exists an i such that p_{p_i}=i, else 3.

But in the third test case, p=[2,1], p_{p1}=p2=1=1, so p_{p1}=1, which is i=1.

Similarly, p_{p2}=p1=2=2.

Hence, p_{p_i}=i for both i=1 and i=2.

Hence, minimal invitations are 2.

But according to the code, it checks l[l[i]-1] == l[i]-1, which is p_{p_i} == p_i -1, which is not the same as p_{p_i} == i.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

To fix the code, it should check if p_{p_i} == i, i.e., l[l[i]-1] == i+1.

Hence, the corrected code should be:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

flag = False

for i in range(n):

if l[l[i]-1] == i+1:

flag = True

break

if flag:

print(2)

else:

print(3)

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
