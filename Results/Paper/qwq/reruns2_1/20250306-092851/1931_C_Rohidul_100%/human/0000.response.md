Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers: i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal with at most one operation. Since I can only perform the operation once, I need to choose a segment of the array and set it to a specific value x, such that after this operation, all elements in the array are equal.

Let me think about this. If I choose to set a certain segment to a value x, then all elements outside this segment should already be equal to x, and all elements inside the segment should be set to x.

Wait, actually, I can choose any value x, not necessarily existing in the array. So, I need to choose a value x and a segment [i, j] such that setting a[i] to a[j] to x, and making sure that all elements outside this segment are already equal to x.

But that might not always be possible, especially if the elements outside the segment are not all equal to each other. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since I can choose any x, I can choose x to be any value I want, and then decide which segment to set to x to minimize the cost.

But that seems a bit vague. Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Looking at the first example in the problem:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

If I choose to set indices 2 to 4 to 8, the array becomes [1,8,8,8,5,1]. Now, all elements are not equal. So, I need to choose a different segment and x.

Alternatively, if I set indices 1 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal. The cost would be 5 burles.

But is there a way to do it with less cost? If I set indices 2 to 6 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], cost is also 5.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, so 5 is not the minimal cost. Maybe I need to choose a different x.

Wait, perhaps choosing x to be a different value can lead to lower cost. But in this case, setting to 1 seems straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can set a smaller segment to a value that matches other parts.

Let's think differently. Suppose I choose to set indices 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Now, I still have a 5 in position 5. So, I need to set that to 1 as well, but I can only perform one operation. So, this approach doesn't work.

Wait, no. I can only perform one operation, so I need to choose a segment such that after setting it to x, all elements become equal.

In the first example, the minimal cost is 4. How can I achieve that?

If I set indices 2 to 5 to 1, that's cost 4, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. But then I still have a 5, which is not equal to 1. So, I need to set index 5 to 1 as well, but I can't perform another operation. So, this doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different segment.

If I set indices 3 to 5 to 1, cost is 3, array becomes [1,2,1,1,1,1]. Now, indices 2 is 2, which doesn't match 1. So, I need to set index 2 to 1 as well, but I can't.

Alternatively, set indices 2 to 4 to 1, cost is 3, array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Again, index 5 is 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, seems like I need to set a larger segment to cover more elements.

Wait, maybe set indices 2 to 6 to 1, cost is 5, array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1]. That works, cost 5.

But sample output is 4, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe set indices 1 to 4 to 1, cost 4, array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Still, index 5 is 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe set indices 2 to 5 to 1, cost 4, array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Still, index 5 is 5.

Wait, perhaps choosing x to be 5?

If I set indices 1 to 5 to 5, cost 5, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,1]. Now, index 6 is 1, which doesn't match. So, not useful.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

8

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

1

2

1 2

3

1 2 3

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Sample Output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

So, for the first test case, n=6, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1], output is 4.

I need to find a way to make all elements equal with cost at most 4.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to set a segment that overlaps with the ends, so that I can cover more elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the frequency of elements.

Wait, no, because in the first test case, elements are all unique except the first and last are both 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of elements that are already equal, and set the rest to that value.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, find the value that appears most frequently in the array, and set all other elements to that value.

But, I can only perform one operation, which sets a contiguous segment to a value.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 appears twice, which is the maximum frequency.

If I set the segment from index 2 to 5 to 1, that's cost 4, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which matches the sample output of 4.

Wait, but in this case, setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 makes the array all 1's, which is correct.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the length of the array minus the maximum frequency of any element.

Wait, in this case, n=6, maximum frequency is 2 (for 1), so 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], output is 0.

Here, all elements are already equal, so no operation is needed, which matches 0.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], output is 2.

Maximum frequency is 7 (eight appears seven times). So, 8 - 7 = 1, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the third test case, if I set indices 4 to 5 to 8, cost is 2, and the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which matches the sample output of 2.

But the maximum frequency of 8 is 7, so 8 - 7 = 1, but the output is 2.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element, considering that I can only set one contiguous segment to that value.

So, in the third test case, to make all elements 8, I need to set indices 4 and 5 to 8, which costs 2.

Alternatively, if I set a larger segment, like indices 3 to 5 to 8, cost is 3, which is higher.

So, the minimal cost is indeed 2.

But according to my earlier formula, n - max frequency is 8 - 7 = 1, which doesn't match the sample output of 2.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal cost to make all elements equal to a chosen value x, with at most one operation.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose a value x, and I look for the minimal cost to set a segment to x such that, after setting, all elements are x.

This means that all elements not in the segment must already be x.

So, for a chosen x, the cost is the length of the segment that needs to be set to x.

To minimize this cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already x, and are outside the segment.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me consider that for a chosen x, I need to set a segment [i, j] to x, and all elements outside this segment must already be x.

So, the cost is (j - i + 1), and I need to choose i and j such that a[1 to i-1] are all x, and a[j+1 to n] are all x.

So, the minimal cost would be the minimal length of the segment [i, j] such that setting a[i to j] to x makes the entire array equal to x.

To find this, for a chosen x, I need to find the minimal length of the segment [i, j] such that:

- a[1 to i-1] are all x

- a[j+1 to n] are all x

- a[i to j] can be set to x.

So, the cost is (j - i + 1).

To minimize this, I need to maximize the prefix and suffix that are already x.

So, for a chosen x, let's define:

- st: the length of the prefix that is already x

- end: the length of the suffix that is already x

Then, the minimal segment to set is from (st + 1) to (n - end), and the cost is (n - st - end).

So, the minimal cost for this x is max(0, n - st - end).

Then, since I can choose any x, I need to choose x such that n - st - end is minimized.

Wait, but in the third test case, x=8, st=3 (first three 8's), end=4 (last four 8's), so n - st - end = 8 - 3 - 4 = 1.

But the sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting st and end.

Wait, in the third test case, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

If x=8, st=3 (first three 8's), end=4 (last four 8's), so n - st - end = 8 - 3 - 4 = 1.

But according to the sample, the output is 2.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to make sure that there is no overlap in the prefix and suffix.

Wait, in this case, the first three are 8's, and the last four are 8's, but there is an overlap in the third and fourth elements.

Wait, no, the fourth element is 1, which is not 8.

Wait, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

So, prefix st=3 (indices 1,2,3 are 8)

Suffix end=4 (indices 5,6,7,8 are 8's)

But index 4 is 1, which is not 8, so there is no overlap.

So, n - st - end = 8 - 3 - 4 = 1, but sample output is 2.

So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the prefix and suffix should not overlap.

Wait, in this case, they don't overlap because st + end = 7, which is less than n=8.

Wait, but according to the sample, the minimal cost is 2, not 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be a value that doesn't have the maximum frequency.

But in this case, x=8 has the highest frequency.

Wait, maybe there are multiple x to choose from, and I need to choose the one that minimizes the cost.

But in this case, x=8 seems to give the minimal cost of 1, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating st and end for x=8.

Let me recount:

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

For x=8:

- st: number of prefix 8's = 3

- end: number of suffix 8's = 4

- so n - st - end = 8 - 3 - 4 = 1

But sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to choose x to be a different value.

For x=1:

- st: number of prefix 1's = 0 (since first element is 8)

- end: number of suffix 1's = 0 (since last element is 8)

- so n - st - end = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8

But the sample output is 2, which is less than 8, so choosing x=8 seems better.

Wait, but according to my calculation, for x=8, cost is 1, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the segment [i,j] covers all elements that are not equal to x.

In the third test case, x=8, and the elements that are not 8 are at positions 4 and 5 (1 and 2).

So, setting indices 4 and 5 to 8 would make the entire array 8's, with cost 2, which matches the sample output.

But according to my earlier formula, n - st - end = 8 - 3 - 4 = 1, but in reality, the minimal segment to set is 2.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to take the maximum of (0, n - st - end).

In this case, n - st - end = 1, but the minimal segment to set is 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that st and end should be the maximum lengths such that the prefix and suffix consist of x, and they do not overlap.

In the third test case, st=3 and end=4, but the total array length is 8.

So, the segment that needs to be set is from index 4 to 5, which is length 2.

Wait, so perhaps the minimal cost is the length of the segment that needs to be set, which is the number of elements not equal to x minus the number of elements that are not equal to x in the overlapping part.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Let me think of a different approach.

Suppose I choose a value x, and I identify all the positions where a[i] != x.

I need to cover these positions with one segment [i,j], and set that segment to x.

So, the minimal cost would be the minimal length of a segment that covers all the positions where a[i] != x.

This is equivalent to finding the minimal j - i + 1 such that all positions with a[i] != x are within [i,j].

So, for each x, find the minimal j - i + 1 such that all a[k] != x for k not in [i,j].

Wait, that seems correct.

In the third test case, x=8, positions where a[i] != 8 are i=4 and i=5.

So, to cover positions 4 and 5, the minimal segment is [4,5], which has length 2, which matches the sample output.

So, my earlier formula of n - st - end = 1 is incorrect in this case.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me consider that for a chosen x, the positions where a[i] != x need to be covered by the segment [i,j].

So, the minimal length of such a segment is the maximal position where a[i] != x minus the minimal position where a[i] != x plus one.

In other words, find the leftmost position where a[i] != x and the rightmost position where a[i] != x, and set the segment from left to right.

The cost would be (right - left + 1).

Then, the minimal cost for x is the minimal of such segments.

In the third test case, x=8, positions where a[i] !=8 are 4 and 5.

So, leftmost is 4, rightmost is 5, cost is 2.

In the first test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are 2,3,4,5.

Leftmost is 2, rightmost is 5, cost is 4.

Which matches the sample output of 4.

In the second test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are none, so cost is 0.

In the fourth test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are none, so cost is 0.

In the fifth test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 is position 2, so cost is 1.

In the sixth test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are 2 and 3, cost is 2.

In the seventh test case, x=1, positions where a[i] !=1 are 1,2,3,4,6,7, cost is 6.

In the eighth test case, x=5, positions where a[i] !=5 are 1,2,4,6,7,8,9, cost is 7.

So, this seems to match all the sample outputs.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- For each possible x, find all positions where a[i] != x.

- Find the minimal segment [i,j] that covers all these positions.

- The cost is (j - i + 1), or 0 if there are no such positions.

- Choose the x that minimizes this cost.

Now, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, we need an efficient solution.

Brute-forcing over all possible x (from 1 to n) for each test case would be too slow because n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, leading to up to 2e5 * n operations, which is not feasible.

So, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over the array once for each test case and compute the minimal cost without iterating over all possible x.

Let me think about that.

If I choose x to be the most frequent element in the array, then the positions where a[i] != x are minimized.

And the minimal segment to cover them would be the minimal range that includes all these positions.

So, perhaps I can find the most frequent element, find all positions where a[i] != x, and then find the minimal window that includes all these positions.

But finding the minimal window that includes all positions where a[i] != x can be done by finding the minimal j - i + 1 such that all positions where a[k] != x are within [i,j].

This is equivalent to finding the minimal window that covers all the "non-x" positions.

To find this efficiently, I can sort the "non-x" positions and find the minimal window that covers all of them.

But sorting would take O(m log m), where m is the number of "non-x" positions.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total n over all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be manageable.

Wait, but for each test case, I need to consider all possible x, but that would be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can choose x to be the most frequent element in the array.

Then, the number of "non-x" positions is minimized, and I can find the minimal window that covers all "non-x" positions.

But in some cases, choosing x to be the most frequent element might not lead to the minimal cost.

Wait, in the first test case, x=1 is the most frequent element (appears twice), and the minimal cost is 4, which matches n - frequency = 6 - 2 = 4.

In the third test case, x=8 is the most frequent element (appears seven times), and the minimal cost is 2, which is the length of the segment covering the two "non-8" positions.

So, perhaps choosing x to be the most frequent element is sufficient.

But I need to confirm if this always gives the minimal cost.

Suppose I choose x to be the most frequent element, then the number of "non-x" positions is minimized.

Then, the minimal window that covers all "non-x" positions would be the minimal segment I need to set to x to make the entire array equal to x.

So, the cost is the length of this window.

In the first test case, x=1 appears twice, "non-1" positions are 2,3,4,5, so the minimal window is [2,5], length 4.

In the third test case, x=8 appears seven times, "non-8" positions are 4,5, minimal window is [4,5], length 2.

In the second test case, x=1 appears seven times, "non-1" positions are none, so cost is 0.

In the fourth test case, x=1 appears once, "non-1" positions are none, so cost is 0.

In the fifth test case, x=1 appears once, "non-1" positions are position 2, minimal window is [2,2], length 1.

In the sixth test case, x=1 appears once, "non-1" positions are 2 and 3, minimal window is [2,3], length 2.

In the seventh test case, x=1 appears once, "non-1" positions are 1,2,3,4,6,7, minimal window is [1,7], length 7, but the sample output is 6, which is [1,6], but a[7] is 3, which is not 1, but wait, x should be chosen appropriately.

Wait, in the seventh test case, x=1 appears once, but choosing x=1 leads to a high cost.

But according to the sample output, it's 6, which might correspond to choosing a different x.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=1 is not the best choice in this case.

Wait, in the seventh test case, a=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

The frequency of each element is:

1: twice

3: twice

2: once

4: once

7: once

So, the most frequent elements are 1 and 3, both appearing twice.

If I choose x=1, "non-1" positions are 1,2,3,4,7, which are positions 1,2,3,4,7.

The minimal window that covers these positions is from 1 to 7, length 7.

But the sample output is 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=3?

Then, "non-3" positions are 1,2,4,5,6, which are positions 1,2,4,5,6.

The minimal window that covers these positions is from 1 to 6, length 6, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, choosing x=3 gives a better cost than choosing x=1.

Therefore, choosing x to be the most frequent element doesn't always give the minimal cost.

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to choose x such that the minimal window covering "non-x" positions is minimized.

In this case, choosing x=3 gives a better cost than choosing x=1.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the number of "non-x" positions is minimized.

In this case, x=3 has "non-3" positions: 1,2,4,5,6, which is 5 positions.

x=1 has "non-1" positions: 1,2,3,4,7, which is 5 positions as well.

Wait, but the minimal window for x=3 is 6, and for x=1 is 7.

So, among x=1 and x=3, choosing x=3 gives a better cost.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the minimal window covering "non-x" positions is minimized, not necessarily the one with the fewest "non-x" positions.

In this case, x=3 has "non-3" positions from 1 to 6, which is length 6.

x=1 has "non-1" positions from 1 to 7, which is length 7.

So, choosing x=3 is better.

Therefore, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the minimal window covering all "non-x" positions is minimized.

To do this efficiently, I need to iterate over all possible x and find, for each x, the minimal window that covers all "non-x" positions, then choose the x that gives the smallest such window.

But iterating over all possible x for each test case would be too slow because x can be up to n=2e5 and t=1e4, leading to up to 2e5 * n operations.

Given the constraints, I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over the array once and find the minimal window that covers all positions that are not equal to the most frequent element.

But in light of the seventh test case, that's not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal, over all x
