Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The question is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time. Since both installations start at the same time, their launch times will be multiples of 'a' and 'b' respectively.

For the first installation, the launch times are a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

For the second installation, the launch times are b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework launched at time x is visible from x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these fireworks overlap in their visibility periods.

Let me consider the visibility periods for each firework.

For the first installation:

- Firework launched at a: visible from a to a + m

- Firework launched at 2a: visible from 2a to 2a + m

- And so on...

Similarly for the second installation:

- Firework launched at b: visible from b to b + m

- Firework launched at 2b: visible from 2b to 2b + m

- And so on...

Now, to find the time when the most fireworks are visible, I need to find a time t where the number of fireworks whose visibility intervals include t is maximized.

This seems like a classic problem of finding maximum overlaps of intervals.

One way to approach this is to consider all possible launch times and see how their visibility periods overlap.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, it's impractical to iterate through all possible times. I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the possible number of fireworks visible at any time t.

For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of launch times k*a such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's the number of launch times l*b such that l*b <= t <= l*b + m.

So, for a given t, the total number of visible fireworks is the sum of these two counts.

I need to maximize this sum.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks could change. These points are at the launch times and at the end of the visibility periods.

Specifically, at times that are multiples of a or b, or multiples of a plus m, or multiples of b plus m.

So, potential critical times are k*a, k*a + m, l*b, l*b + m for all integers k and l >=1.

The maximum number of fireworks visible should occur at one of these times.

Given that, I can consider checking the number of visible fireworks at these critical times and find the maximum among them.

But again, with a, b, m up to 10^18, iterating through all possible k and l is not feasible.

I need to find a mathematical way to compute this without iterating through all possibilities.

Let me consider the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at a particular time t.

For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible at t is the number of k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m, which is equivalent to t - m <= k*a <= t.

So, k should satisfy ceil((t - m)/a) <= k <= floor(t/a).

Similarly, for the second installation, ceil((t - m)/b) <= l <= floor(t/b).

Therefore, at time t, the number of visible fireworks is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 for the first installation, and floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1 for the second installation.

Wait, actually, the number of k is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a), which is equivalent to floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 + floor(t/b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1

I need to maximize this sum over t.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the possible overlaps.

Case 1: a and b are multiples of each other.

If a is a multiple of b or vice versa, then the installations are synchronized in a way that might simplify the calculation.

Case 2: a and b are co-prime or have some gcd.

In general, I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b to find when their launch times coincide.

Wait, but the visibility periods are m minutes long.

I need to find a time t where the number of active fireworks from both installations is maximized.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of fireworks visible.

Each installation can have multiple fireworks visible at the same time, depending on m and their launch interval.

For the first installation, the number of visible fireworks at any time t is floor(m/a) + 1, because m/a gives the number of complete intervals within m, and +1 for the initial firework.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(m/b) + 1.

But, if the installations launch at times that are aligned, these counts could overlap.

Wait, no. Each firework has its own visibility period, so the total visible fireworks at any time is the sum of the visible fireworks from each installation at that time, minus any overlaps if they launch at the same time.

But since a and b are generally different, their launch times won't coincide unless a and b have a common multiple within the visibility period.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

First sample input:

6 7 4

Output: 2

So, a=6, b=7, m=4

From the explanation, at t=7, one firework from each installation is visible.

From first installation:

- Firework at t=6, visible from 6 to 10

- Firework at t=12, visible from 12 to 16

At t=7, only the first firework from the first installation is visible.

From second installation:

- Firework at t=7, visible from 7 to 11

So at t=7, fireworks from both installations are visible: one from each, totaling 2.

Hence, the maximum is 2.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, floor(m/a)+1 + floor(m/b)+1 = floor(4/6)+1 + floor(4/7)+1 = 0+1 + 0+1 = 2, which matches.

Second sample input:

3 4 10

Output:7

Let's check:

floor(10/3)+1 + floor(10/4)+1 = 3+1 + 2+1 = 4 + 3 = 7, which matches.

Third sample input:

7 8 56

Output:17

floor(56/7)+1 + floor(56/8)+1 = 8+1 + 7+1 = 9 + 8 = 17, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m/a)+1 + floor(m/b)+1 gives the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Wait, but in the first sample, it's 2, which is floor(4/6)+1 + floor(4/7)+1 = 0+1 + 0+1 = 2.

Yes, it matches.

Similarly, in the second sample, floor(10/3)+1 + floor(10/4)+1 = 3+1 + 2+1 = 7.

In the third sample, floor(56/7)+1 + floor(56/8)+1 = 8+1 + 7+1 = 17.

This seems consistent.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a=1, b=1, m=1

Then, floor(1/1)+1 + floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1 + 1+1 = 4.

But, if a=1 and b=1, meaning both installations launch every minute.

At t=1, fireworks from both installations are launched:

- Firework from first installation at t=1, visible from 1 to 2

- Firework from second installation at t=1, visible from 1 to 2

- Firework from first installation at t=2, visible from 2 to 3

- Firework from second installation at t=2, visible from 2 to 3

At t=1, fireworks from t=1 and t=2 are visible:

- From first installation: t=1 (visible at t=1)

- From second installation: t=1 (visible at t=1)

So, total visible at t=1: 2 from first installation (t=1 and t=2) + 2 from second installation (t=1 and t=2), but actually, at t=1, only the t=1 fireworks are visible, since t=2 fireworks start at t=2.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if a=1, b=1, m=1

At t=1:

- Firework launched at t=1 from both installations, visible from t=1 to t=2

- Firework launched at t=2 from both installations, visible from t=2 to t=3

At t=1:

- From first installation: firework launched at t=1 (visible at t=1)

- From second installation: firework launched at t=1 (visible at t=1)

So total visible at t=1: 2 fireworks.

But according to the formula, floor(1/1)+1 + floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1 + 1+1 = 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2, considering the initial fireworks.

Wait, in the first sample, floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0+0+2=2, which matches.

In the second sample, floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3+2+2=7, which matches.

In the third sample, floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8+7+2=17, which matches.

In the a=1, b=1, m=1 case, floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1+1+2=4, which matches the earlier thought.

Wait, but in reality, at t=1, only 2 fireworks are visible, not 4.

So perhaps the formula is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe the formula overcounts when a and b are equal and m is such that multiple fireworks overlap.

Wait, in the a=1, b=1, m=1 case, at t=1, only the fireworks launched at t=1 are visible, since m=1 means they are visible until t=2, but not including t=2.

Wait, the problem says "visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on, it will be visible every minute from x to x + m, inclusive."

So, for m=1, visible from t to t + 1 inclusive.

So, at t=1, fireworks launched at t=1 are visible from t=1 to t=2.

Fireworks launched at t=2 are visible from t=2 to t=3.

At t=1, only the t=1 fireworks are visible.

But according to the formula, it's floor(1/1)+1 + floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1 +1+1=4, which doesn't match.

So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula should be floor((m)/a) + floor((m)/b) + 2, but adjusted for overlaps.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at their optimal time.

Wait, in the a=1, b=1, m=1 case, the maximum visible should be 4, as per the formula, but in reality, only 2 are visible at t=1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the visibility periods.

Wait, "each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a firework was launched after x minutes after launch, it will be visible every minute from x to x + m, inclusive."

Wait, let's clarify: launched after x minutes, visible from x to x + m inclusive.

So, for a=1, b=1, m=1:

At t=0, installations start.

At t=1:

- Firework launched at t=1 from both installations, visible from t=1 to t=1 + 1 = t=2.

At t=2:

- Firework launched at t=2 from both installations, visible from t=2 to t=3.

So, at t=1:

- Fireworks launched at t=1 from both installations are visible (since t=1 is in [1,2])

- Fireworks launched at t=2 from both installations are also visible at t=1, since t=1 is in [2,3]? No, wait.

Wait, the firework launched at t=2 is visible from t=2 to t=3, which does not include t=1.

So, at t=1, only the fireworks launched at t=1 from both installations are visible.

Hence, total visible at t=1: 2.

At t=2:

- Fireworks launched at t=1 from both installations are still visible (since t=2 is in [1,2] for first installation's t=1 firework and [1,2] for second installation's t=1 firework)

- Fireworks launched at t=2 from both installations are visible (t=2 to t=3)

So, at t=2, fireworks from t=1 and t=2 from both installations are visible: total 4.

Hence, the maximum is 4, which matches the formula.

I must have misread the problem earlier.

So, in this case, the formula works.

Another test case: a=1, b=1, m=1, output should be 4, as per the formula.

Wait, but in the note, for a=1, b=1, m=1, output is 4.

Wait, in the example input, the last two cases are:

5 6 78123459896

1 1 1

1 1 1000000000000000000

Corresponding outputs:

28645268630

4

2000000000000000002

Wait, for a=1, b=1, m=1, output is 4.

For a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000, output is 2000000000000000002.

Let's check the formula:

floor(m/a)+1 + floor(m/b)+1 = floor(m/1)+1 + floor(m/1)+1 = m+1 + m+1 = 2m + 2.

For m=1, 2*1 + 2 = 4, which matches.

For m=1000000000000000000, 2*1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, the formula seems correct in these cases.

Wait, but earlier in the first sample, floor(m/a)+1 + floor(m/b)+1 = floor(4/6)+1 + floor(4/7)+1 = 0+1 +0+1=2, which matches.

Similarly, for a=3, b=4, m=10:

floor(10/3)+1 + floor(10/4)+1 = 3+1 + 2+1 =7, which matches.

Similarly for a=7, b=8, m=56:

floor(56/7)+1 + floor(56/8)+1 =8+1 +7+1=17, which matches.

So, it seems the formula floor(m/a)+1 + floor(m/b)+1 gives the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Hence, the program implements this formula:

ans = m // a + m // b + 2

print(ans)

This seems correct based on the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.
