Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that satisfies two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but every other integer between 1 and n (inclusive, except k) can be formed as the sum of some subsequence.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

First, I recall that with a sequence of powers of 2, I can generate any sum up to the sum of the sequence. For example, [1, 2, 4, 8, ...] can generate any sum by including or excluding each element, because binary representations cover all possible sums.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while still being able to generate all other sums up to n.

One approach could be to include numbers that allow me to generate all sums except k. Maybe I can include some numbers that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing which numbers to include or exclude.

Looking at the example in the problem:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

In the first test case, n=2 and k=2. The output is a sequence [1], which can sum to 1 but not to 2, which satisfies the conditions since v=1 is allowed and v=2 is excluded.

In the second test case, n=6 and k=1. The output is [2,3,4,5,6], which can generate sums from 2 to 6, but not 1.

In the third test case, n=8 and k=8. The output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can generate sums from 1 to 7 but not 8.

In the fourth test case, n=9 and k=3. The output is [7,1,4,1], which can generate sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

In the fifth test case, n=10 and k=7. The output is [1,2,8,3], which can generate sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these examples, it seems like the sequence can be constructed in different ways depending on the values of n and k.

I need to find a general way to construct such a sequence for any given n and k, with the sequence having at most 25 elements.

Let me think about the properties such a sequence should have.

First, the sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that all sums except k are possible is to include small numbers that allow building up sums incrementally, while excluding the possibility of reaching k.

But I also need to make sure that no subsequence sums to k.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can start with a base sequence that can generate all sums up to n and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

One idea is to start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n and then remove or adjust some elements so that k cannot be formed as a sum.

But removal might not be straightforward because removing an element affects multiple sums.

Another approach is to include elements in such a way that all sums except k are covered.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I have a sequence of powers of 2, like [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], I can generate any sum up to the total sum of the sequence.

But I need to exclude the sum k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the specific combination that sums to k.

But since k can be any value between 1 and n, and n can be up to 10^6, I need a more general method.

Wait, the problem allows sequences of at most 25 elements, and the elements can be up to 10^9.

So, I have some flexibility in choosing the elements.

Let me think about the maximum n is 10^6, and I need to generate all sums from 1 to n except one specific sum k.

Given that t can be up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7, so for individual test cases, n can be up to 10^6.

I need an efficient way to construct such sequences.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to be attempting to construct such a sequence.

Let me try to understand the given code.

The function func() is defined to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

Then, it initializes nums as a list of powers of 2, from 1 to 1<<23 (which is 8388608).

So, nums starts as [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 8388608].

Then, it calculates idx such that k >= 1<<idx, and idx is the highest such index.

For example, if k is 5, then 1<<2 is 4, which is less than or equal to 5, so idx=2.

Then idx is decremented by 1, so idx=1.

Then, it appends k - nums[idx] to nums.

In this case, k=5, nums[idx]=2, so k - nums[idx]=3.

Then, it appends k + 1, which is 6.

Then, it appends k + nums[idx] + 1, which is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.

Then, it removes 1<<idx, which is 2.

So, the sequence becomes [1, 4, 8, 16, ..., 8388608, 3, 6, 8], with 2 removed.

Wait, but 2 is in nums as the second element, so removing it would leave [1, 4, 8, 16, ..., 8388608, 3, 6, 8].

Then, it prints the length of nums and the elements of nums.

But I need to verify if this sequence satisfies the conditions.

First, let's see if the sequence can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

In this example, n=5, k=5.

So, sums from 1 to 5, except 5.

Sequence: [1, 4, 8, 16, ..., 8388608, 3, 6, 8] minus 2.

Wait, but n=5, so sums up to 5.

But the sequence includes large numbers like 8, 16, etc., which are greater than 5, so they won't be used in sums up to 5.

So, effectively, the sequence for sums up to 5 is [1, 3, 6, 8], since 2 is removed.

Wait, but 6 and 8 are greater than 5, so they won't be used in sums up to 5.

So, only 1 and 3 are considered for sums up to 5.

With [1, 3], possible sums are 1, 3, and 4 (1+3).

So, sums 1, 3, and 4 are possible.

But according to the problem, for v from 1 to n (n=5), except k=5, we need to have sums 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but in this case, sum 2 is missing.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, n=5, k=5, so we need sums 1,2,3,4.

But with [1,3], we can get 1,3,4.

How to get 2?

Maybe I need to adjust the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Looking back at the code:

nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]

This creates nums = [1,2,4,8,...,8388608]

Then, idx is calculated such that k >= 1 << idx.

For k=5, 1<<2=4 <=5, 1<<3=8 >5, so idx=2.

Then idx -=1, so idx=1.

Then, nums.append(k - nums[idx]) = 5 - 2 =3.

nums.append(k +1)=6.

nums.append(k + nums[idx] +1)=5 +2 +1=8.

Then, nums.remove(1<<idx)=remove(2).

So, nums = [1,4,8,16,...,8388608,3,6,8].

But for sums up to 5, only 1,3,4,6,8,... are considered.

Possible sums are 1,3,4, (1+3=4, but duplicates), (1+4=5).

Wait, so with [1,3,4], sums are 1,3,4,5.

But we need sums 1,2,3,4, excluding k=5.

But 2 is missing.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the approach.

Let me look at another example.

Take n=10 and k=7.

Sequence: [1,2,4,8,16,...,8388608, with some modifications.

Calculate idx: 1<<3=8 >7, so idx=2, k>=1<<2=4.

idx=2, then idx-=1 => idx=1.

Append k - nums[idx]=7-2=5.

Append k+1=8.

Append k + nums[idx]+1=7+2+1=10.

Remove 1<<idx=2.

So, nums = [1,4,8,16,...,8388608,5,8,10], remove 2.

For sums up to 10, excluding 7.

Possible sums from [1,4,5,8,10,...]:

From [1,4,5,8,10], possible sums:

1,4,5,8,10,1+4=5 (duplicate),1+5=6,1+8=9,1+10=11,4+5=9 (duplicate),4+8=12,4+10=14,5+8=13,5+10=15,8+10=18, and so on.

Wait, but sums 2,3 are missing.

But according to the problem, for n=10 and k=7, we need sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

But in this sequence, sums like 2,3 are not achievable.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output for n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which can generate:

1,2,3,8,

1+2=3 (duplicate),

1+3=4,

1+8=9,

2+3=5,

2+8=10,

3+8=11,

1+2+3=6,

1+2+8=11 (duplicate),

1+3+8=12,

2+3+8=13,

1+2+3+8=14.

So, sums are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14.

But missing sums are 7,8, and above.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=10 and k=7, we need sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

So, sums 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10 should be achievable, which is satisfied by [1,2,8,3].

But the code seems to be generating a different sequence.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence should be able to generate all sums except k.

One way to ensure that is to have a sequence that can generate all sums up to n, and then adjust it so that k cannot be generated.

But it's tricky because sums can be combined in many ways.

Another approach is to include numbers that cover all possible sums except k.

But it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with a set of numbers, the number of possible subsequences is 2^m, where m is the number of elements.

But m is at most 25, so 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way more than n can be up to 10^6.

But I need to ensure that the sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to include numbers that allow me to generate the required sums.

But I need a better plan.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n can be up to 10^6, t is up to 1000, sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^7.

So, time efficiency is important.

I need an efficient way to construct the sequence.

Looking back at the code, it seems to always include powers of 2 up to 1<<23, then append some specific numbers based on k and idx, and remove one power of 2.

But as seen in the earlier examples, this approach seems flawed because it doesn't guarantee that all required sums are achievable except k.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that with a sequence of 25 numbers, I need to cover all sums from 1 to n except one specific sum k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, I need to choose the numbers wisely.

One idea is to include small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Another idea is to use the minimal number of elements to cover all sums up to n except k.

But minimizing the number of elements isn't the goal; I just need to keep it within 25.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 25 elements, so I can use that to my advantage.

Perhaps I can start with a sequence that can generate all sums up to n and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, start with a sequence that can generate all sums up to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

But how?

One way is to remove an element that is necessary to form k.

But that might also affect other sums.

Alternatively, I can include elements in such a way that all sums except k are possible.

But this seems vague.

Let me consider the binary representation approach again.

If I have powers of 2 up to some value, I can generate any sum up to the sum of those powers.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the specific combination that sums to k.

But it's complicated because k could be any value.

Wait, maybe I can include elements that allow generating all sums except those that are congruent to k modulo some value.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I want to modify it so that k cannot be generated.

One way is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k.

But that might also prevent forming other sums that include that element.

Alternatively, I can replace an element with another one that doesn't allow forming k.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that with a set of numbers, the number of possible subsets is 2^m.

But in this problem, we're dealing with subsequences, which are ordered subsets.

But since addition is commutative, the order doesn't matter for the sum.

So, perhaps I can treat them as sets.

Wait, but the problem specifies subsequences, not subsets, but since the sum is concerned, and addition is commutative, the order doesn't matter.

So, I can think in terms of subsets.

Given that, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, while all other subsets sum to any v from 1 to n except k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums cover all integers from 1 to n except k.

Given that, I need to find a set whose subset sums cover [1,n] except k.

Given that, perhaps I can find a set where the total sum is at least n, and the subset sums cover everything except k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider building the set step by step.

Start with an empty set.

Add the smallest number needed to cover the smallest missing sum.

But this might be time-consuming and not efficient enough for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the problem states that a solution always exists, and that m can be at most 25.

Given that, perhaps there is a general way to construct such a set with at most 25 elements.

Given that m is small (25), and n can be up to 10^6, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range of sums.

This sounds like a variant of the subset sum problem, where I need to cover all sums except one specific value.

I need to find a set of at most 25 elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can use a combination of small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover the higher sums.

For example, include 1, which allows sum 1.

Include 2, which allows sums 2 and 3 (1+2).

Include 4, which allows sums 4, 5 (1+4), 6 (2+4), 7 (1+2+4).

And so on, doubling the range with each power of 2.

But again, I need to exclude k.

Wait, maybe I can include all powers of 2 up to some point, and then adjust for k.

But earlier examples suggest that simply removing one power of 2 might not suffice.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and I want to exclude k.

If I can find a set where k cannot be formed, but all other sums up to s can be formed, that would work.

But how?

One idea is to have a set where the subset sums form a continuous range except for k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: k=1.

In this case, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are possible.

So, I cannot include 1 in the set, but include other numbers that can sum up to 2 to n.

For example, include 2,3, which can sum to 2,3,5.

But to cover all sums up to n, I might need more elements.

Alternatively, include multiple 1's, but the problem allows non-negative integers, including 0, but in the example, they used positive integers.

Wait, the problem says non-negative integers, so 0 is allowed.

But in the examples, they used positive integers.

Including 0 would allow sums that include 0 to be the same as excluding it, so it might not help.

So, perhaps sticking to positive integers is better.

In the case where k=1, I need to exclude any subsequence that sums to 1, but be able to sum to all other values from 2 to n.

One way is to start with elements all greater than or equal to 2, and ensure that their subsets can sum to all values from 2 to n except k.

For k=1, n=6, the output is [2,3,4,5,6], which can sum to 2,3,4,5,6, and combinations like 2+3=5 (already present), 2+4=6, etc.

But in this case, it's straightforward because k=1, and all elements are >=2.

But for general k, it's more complicated.

Another case: n=8, k=8.

Need to exclude sum=8, but include sums from 1 to 7.

One way is to include seven 1's, so sums from 1 to 7 can be formed by selecting 1 to 7 ones, but no sum of 8.

But in this case, selecting all seven 1's sums to 7, and selecting any subset sums to any value from 1 to 7.

So, this works for k=8 and n=8.

But this approach isn't efficient for larger n.

So, for k=8 and n=8, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] is a solution.

But m can be up to 25, so for larger n, I need to include larger numbers.

Another example: n=9, k=3.

Output: [7,1,4,1]

Possible sums:

1,4,7,1,

1+4=5,

1+7=8,

1+1=2,

4+7=11,

4+1=5 (duplicate),

7+1=8 (duplicate),

1+4+7=12,

1+4+1=6,

1+7+1=8 (duplicate),

4+7+1=12 (duplicate),

1+4+7+1=13.

So, sums are 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13.

Missing sums are 3,9,10, etc.

But according to the problem, for n=9 and k=3, we need sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, sums 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 should be achievable.

In the output, 9 is missing.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example.

Wait, in the example output, it's [7,1,4,1], which sums as above, but 9 is missing.

But according to the problem, it should be possible to sum to 9.

Wait, maybe I missed a combination.

1+4+1+3=... wait, no, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which sums to at most 7+1+4+1=13.

But I need to find a combination that sums to 9.

7+1+1=9.

So, 7+1+1=9 is possible.

So, sums are 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

Missing sums are 3,10, etc.

So, for n=9 and k=3, this sequence works.

Back to the code, it seems that the approach is not matching the example outputs.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me think of another approach.

Given that m is at most 25, and n can be up to 10^6, I need to choose elements that can cover a wide range of sums.

One efficient way to cover a wide range of sums is to use powers of 2, as they can generate any sum up to the sum of the sequence.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the element that is equal to k, if k is a power of 2.

But if k is not a power of 2, it's more complicated.

Wait, for example, if k=5 and n=10, and I have [1,2,4,8], the sum of subsets can generate all sums from 1 to 15, except perhaps k=5.

But in this case, 1+4=5, so I need to exclude that combination.

But how?

Perhaps I need to remove one element that is involved in forming k.

But removing 4 would prevent forming sums that include 4.

Alternatively, I can replace an element with another value that allows forming other sums but not k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and another set B that can generate all sums from 1 to t, and their sums are disjoint except for overlaps.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have two subsets, one that can generate sums up to a certain value and another that can generate sums above a certain value, and adjust them to exclude k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the problem allows sequences of at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6.

So, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range of sums.

One way to do this is to include elements that are powers of small bases, allowing for combinations that cover a wide range.

But again, excluding one specific sum is challenging.

Let me consider that with m=25 elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, which is way more than n=10^6.

But the issue is not the number of subsets, but ensuring that their sums cover [1,n] except k.

This seems complex.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can output a sequence that includes all numbers from 1 to n except k.

But m can be at most 25, and n can be up to 10^6, so including all numbers from 1 to n is not feasible due to m being too small.

Alternatively, including a minimal set that can generate all sums except k.

But I need a smarter way to construct such a set.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a set that generates all sums from 1 to s, and another set that generates sums from t to u, and combine them to cover [1,n] except k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can choose elements that are carefully selected to cover the required sums.

But without a clear method, it's hard to proceed.

Given that, perhaps the initial code's approach is correct, and I just didn't understand it properly.

Let me look back at the code.

The code starts with nums = [1,2,4,8,...,1<<23].

Then, it calculates idx such that k >= 1<<idx, and idx is the highest such index.

Then, idx -=1.

Then, it appends k - nums[idx], k +1, and k + nums[idx] +1 to nums.

Then, removes 1<<idx from nums.

So, for k=5, idx=1, so appends 5-2=3, 5+1=6, 5+2+1=8, and removes 2.

So, nums = [1,4,8,16,...,8388608,3,6,8].

But earlier, I thought this doesn't cover all sums up to n except k.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Maybe with the inclusion of larger numbers, it can cover higher sums, and the removal of 2 and addition of 3,6,8 allows covering the necessary sums except k.

But in the example where n=5 and k=5, the sequence is [1,4,8,16,...,8388608,3,6,8] without 2.

But for sums up to 5, only 1,3,4,6,8,... are considered.

Possible sums are 1,3,4, and 1+3=4 (duplicate), 1+4=5.

So, sums are 1,3,4,5.

But we need sums 1,2,3,4 except k=5.

But 2 is missing.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the code is trying to ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum, and all other sums are possible.

But in the example above, sum 2 is missing, which is not k=5.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to accept that the code might be incorrect and think of a different approach.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should conclude that the given code does not correctly solve the problem, based on the example where n=5 and k=5, and sums 1,3,4,5 are possible, but 2 is missing.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
