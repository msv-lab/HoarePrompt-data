Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two players, Bodya and Sasha, who are playing a game involving a permutation and an array. They start at certain positions in the permutation and make moves over k turns. Each turn, they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation. Their score increases by the value in the array at their current position each turn. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores after k turns, assuming both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get n (the length of the permutation and the array), k (the number of turns in the game), and the starting positions for Bodya (P_B) and Sasha (P_S). Then, there's the permutation p, which is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, and the array a, which contains n integers.

The players make moves simultaneously each turn. On each turn, both players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation p. Their score increases by the value of a at their current position, regardless of whether they choose to stay or move.

The task is to determine who wins the game, meaning who has the higher score after k turns, assuming both players play optimally. If their scores are equal, it's a draw.

I need to analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves this problem.

Looking at the program, it seems to handle multiple test cases in a loop. For each test case, it reads n, k, P_B, and P_S, then reads the permutation p and the array a.

The program then finds the maximum value in the array a, denoted as maxa. It checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in a. If they do, it prints 'Draw'. If only Bodya starts at the position with maxa, it prints 'Bodya', and if only Sasha does, it prints 'Sasha'. This seems like a special case handling.

If neither or both start at maxa, it proceeds to simulate the game for k turns, keeping track of the scores for both players. It seems to handle cases where players reach the position with maxa and start accumulating maxa each turn thereafter.

I need to verify if this logic correctly determines the winner.

First, I need to consider what optimal play means in this game. Since both players make moves simultaneously and independently, each player should choose the action (stay or move) that maximizes their own score each turn.

Given that they make moves simultaneously, one player's move doesn't directly affect the other's position or score directly, except insofar as they might reach certain positions at the same time, but since their scores are independent, it shouldn't matter.

Each player can choose to stay or move each turn. Staying means they get a[x] where x is their current position, and moving means they go to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn if they choose to stay.

But since they can choose to stay or move each turn, independently, the optimal strategy would be for each player to choose the action that leads to the maximum possible score each turn, considering the remaining turns.

However, because their choices are independent, I can consider each player's strategy separately.

The key is that each player wants to maximize their own score over k turns, and they can choose to stay or move each turn.

Given that, the optimal strategy for each player is to choose, at each turn, whether to stay or move, based on which action leads to the maximum possible score for the remaining turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position and remaining turns, we calculate the maximum possible score.

But implementing that for each test case might be too slow, given the constraints (n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, with t up to 1e4 test cases).

So, there must be a smarter way to handle this.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to simulate the game for k turns, keeping track of the players' positions and scores, and then determining the winner based on the maximum possible scores.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, I need to consider the nature of the permutation p. Since p is a permutation, it forms one or more cycles. The behavior of the game depends on the cycle structure of p.

For example, if a player is in a cycle of length m, repeating the cycle every m turns, their positions will repeat every m turns.

Given that k can be up to 1e9, simulating each turn individually is not feasible. Instead, we need to find a way to compute the maximum possible score efficiently, considering the cycle structure.

The provided program seems to handle this by iterating up to k turns, but with some optimizations based on reaching the maximum value in a.

I need to understand the logic behind the program.

Let's look at the code step by step.

First, it reads the inputs: n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a.

Then, it finds the maximum value in a, maxa.

It checks if both players start at positions with a value equal to maxa. If so, it's a draw because both will accumulate the same maximum value each turn.

If only one player starts at maxa, that player will win because they can always stay and accumulate maxa each turn, while the other player cannot.

If neither starts at maxa, it proceeds to simulate the game.

In the simulation, it maintains lists b and s, which seem to represent the scores that Bodya and Sasha can accumulate each turn.

It also has flags foundb and founds to check if the players have reached the position with maxa.

In the loop over k turns:

- If a player has already found the position with maxa (foundb or founds is True), they stay there and accumulate maxa each turn.

- If not, they move to the next position in the permutation p.

After simulating k turns, it calculates prefix sums of the scores accumulated each turn for both players.

Then, it calculates all possible scores by choosing to stop accumulating after any number of turns (from 0 to k-1), assuming that after that, they stay at their current position and accumulate that value each turn.

Finally, it finds the maximum possible score for both players and compares them to determine the winner.

This seems overly complicated and may not be efficient for large k and n.

I think there's a better way to approach this problem.

Given that p is a permutation, it decomposes into disjoint cycles. Each player's movement over time will follow the cycle that their starting position is in.

For example, if a player starts at position x, and p[x] = y, p[y] = z, etc., forming a cycle, the player will visit x, y, z, ... repeatedly every cycle length turns.

Given that, for each player, we can determine their cycle and the sequence of positions they visit over time.

The goal is to maximize the score over k turns.

Since the players can choose to stay or move each turn, independently, we need to find, for each player, the sequence of positions they visit and the corresponding a values, and then choose the best sequence of stay or move decisions to maximize their total score.

But this seems too time-consuming for large n and k.

An optimization is needed.

I recall that in such problems, it's often useful to consider that the optimal strategy might involve reaching a position with the maximum a value and staying there for the remaining turns.

But the provided program seems to handle this by checking if the current position has a value equal to maxa, and if so, staying there.

However, the problem allows players to choose to stay or move each turn, independently of each other.

So, for each player, the optimal strategy would be to reach the position with the maximum a value as quickly as possible and then stay there for the remaining turns.

If a player starts at the position with maxa, they can stay there every turn and accumulate maxa each turn.

If not, they can choose to move to p[x] or stay at x each turn.

Their goal is to maximize their total score over k turns.

So, for each player, the problem reduces to finding the earliest time to reach the position with maxa and then staying there for the remaining turns.

But wait, is this always the optimal strategy?

Suppose there are multiple positions with the same maximum a value, or positions with high a values.

However, since there is a single maximum a value, and other positions have lower a values, it's best to reach the position with maxa as soon as possible and stay there.

But what if a player's current position has a higher a value than the position they would move to?

In that case, they might choose to stay at their current position to accumulate the higher a value, even if it's not the maximum.

But if the maximum a value is higher, they might still want to move to that position to maximize their total score.

This seems complicated.

Let's consider that for each player, the optimal strategy is to choose, at each turn, between staying at the current position and accumulating a[x], or moving to p[x] and accumulating a[p[x]] in the next turn, and so on.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position and remaining turns, we calculate the maximum possible score.

However, with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this approach is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

I recall that in permutation cycle problems, we can analyze the cycle structure to determine the long-term behavior.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the cycle they are in, and then determine the maximum possible a value in that cycle.

Then, the optimal strategy would be to reach that maximum a value in the cycle as quickly as possible and stay there.

But wait, the permutation p is a permutation of n elements, and it may have multiple cycles.

Each player starts at a certain position and follows their respective cycle.

However, the players can choose to stay or move each turn, so it's not strictly following the cycle.

Wait, no. Each turn, they can choose to stay or move to p[x].

So, it's like they have a choice each turn: stay at x and get a[x], or move to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn, and so on.

This seems similar to choosing between immediate reward or potential higher reward in the next step.

Given that, the optimal strategy would involve some form of dynamic programming where, for each position and remaining turns, we choose the action that maximizes the total score.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not practical.

I need a better approach.

Let's consider that for each player, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a value in their accessible positions as quickly as possible and then stay there.

To do this, I need to find, for each player, the maximum a value in the positions they can reach from their starting position, following the permutation p.

Given that p is a permutation, it decomposes into disjoint cycles.

Each player is confined to their own cycle, as moving according to p cycles through the positions in their cycle.

Therefore, for each player, the positions they can reach are the positions in their cycle.

Given that, for each player, I can find their cycle and determine the maximum a value in their cycle.

Then, the optimal strategy is to reach that position with the maximum a value in their cycle as quickly as possible and then stay there for the remaining turns.

Hence, for each player, I can find the minimum number of moves to reach the position with the maximum a in their cycle, and then accumulate the maximum a for the remaining turns.

This seems efficient, as I can find the cycle for each player and compute the necessary quantities.

But wait, since the players can choose to stay or move each turn, independently, they don't necessarily have to follow the cycle strictly.

For example, a player can choose to stay at their current position for any number of turns before moving to p[x].

This complicates things, because it allows for more flexibility in choosing when to move and when to stay.

Therefore, the problem is more nuanced than just finding the cycle and the maximum a in the cycle.

I need to consider that players can choose to stay or move each turn, and they can interleave staying and moving in any way they like, as long as they follow the rules.

Given that, perhaps the key is to consider that, for each player, the optimal strategy is to choose, at each turn, to stay if a[x] >= a[p[x]], otherwise move to p[x].

But I'm not sure if this is always optimal.

Wait, perhaps not.

Consider that if a[x] < a[p[x]], it's better to move to p[x] and get a higher a value in the next turn.

But if a[x] >= a[p[x]], it's better to stay and accumulate a[x].

However, this is a greedy approach and may not always be optimal, especially when k is large.

I need to think differently.

Another approach is to model this as a graph, where each position is a node, and there is an edge from x to p[x].

Since p is a permutation, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Each player starts at a certain node and can choose to stay or move along the edge each turn.

Given that, for each player, their possible positions over time are constrained by their cycle.

But considering that they can choose to stay or move each turn, it's equivalent to choosing any path in the cycle, where staying is like staying at the current node.

This seems too vague.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that, for each player, their position at each turn is determined by their previous choice to stay or move.

So, for turn 1, they can choose to stay at P_B or move to p[P_B].

Similarly, for turn 2, depending on their choice in turn 1, they can stay or move again.

This leads to a tree of possibilities, but with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that, for each player, the sequence of positions they can be in over k turns can be represented as a sequence of choices: stay or move.

Given that, the total number of possible sequences is 2^k, which is too large.

Hence, I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible score without enumerating all possibilities.

I recall that, in such problems, the optimal strategy often involves reaching a desirable state as quickly as possible and then staying there.

In this case, the desirable state is being at the position with the maximum a value in the player's cycle.

Therefore, for each player, I can compute:

- The maximum a value in their cycle.

- The minimum number of moves required to reach that position from their starting position.

Then, for k turns, the optimal score would be:

- If k is less than the number of moves required to reach the maximum a position, accumulate a[x] for each turn until reaching it.

- Once at the maximum a position, stay there for the remaining turns and accumulate the maximum a value each turn.

However, this assumes that the player can reach the maximum a position and then stay there.

But in reality, the player can choose to stay or move each turn, so they might choose to stay at a position with a high a value even if it's not the maximum.

But to maximize the score, it's generally best to reach the maximum a position as soon as possible and stay there.

Hence, the above approach might be correct.

Let me formalize it.

For each player:

1. Find the cycle that contains their starting position.

2. Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a value.

3. Compute the minimum number of moves required to reach that position from their starting position.

4. If k is less than the number of moves required, accumulate a[x] for each turn until k turns are over.

5. If k is greater than or equal to the number of moves required, accumulate a[x] for the moves to reach the maximum a position, and then accumulate the maximum a value for the remaining turns.

Wait, but the player can choose to stay at any position each turn, so they might choose to stay at a position with a high a value instead of moving towards the maximum a position.

Hence, the optimal strategy might be more complex.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=3, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2, 3, 1]

a = [1, 2, 3]

Cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

Maximum a value is 3.

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: Stay at 1 and get 1, or move to 2 and get 2 in turn 2.

- Turn 2: If stayed at 1 in turn 1, can stay again and get 1, or move to 2 and get 2.

- If moved to 2 in turn 1, can stay at 2 and get 2, or move to 3 and get 3.

Optimal strategy:

- Option 1: Stay at 1 both turns: 1 + 1 = 2

- Option 2: Stay at 1 in turn 1, move to 2 in turn 2: 1 + 2 = 3

- Option 3: Move to 2 in turn 1, stay at 2 in turn 2: 2 + 2 = 4

- Option 4: Move to 2 in turn 1, move to 3 in turn 2: 2 + 3 = 5

So, the maximum score is 5.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: Stay at 2 and get 2, or move to 3 and get 3 in turn 2.

- Turn 2: If stayed at 2 in turn 1, can stay again and get 2, or move to 3 and get 3.

- If moved to 3 in turn 1, can stay at 3 and get 3, or move to 1 and get 1.

Optimal strategy:

- Option 1: Stay at 2 both turns: 2 + 2 = 4

- Option 2: Stay at 2 in turn 1, move to 3 in turn 2: 2 + 3 = 5

- Option 3: Move to 3 in turn 1, stay at 3 in turn 2: 3 + 3 = 6

- Option 4: Move to 3 in turn 1, move to 1 in turn 2: 3 + 1 = 4

So, the maximum score is 6.

Hence, in this case, Sasha wins with a score of 6 versus Bodya's 5.

But according to the provided program, it seems to handle the simulation differently.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to simulate k turns, keeping track of the scores for both players, and then determining the winner based on the maximum possible scores.

However, in the above example, the program might not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both players.

Hence, I suspect that the provided program might not be correct.

Another way to think about this is to model the problem as a dynamic programming problem where, for each position and remaining turns, we calculate the maximum possible score.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

An alternative approach is to observe that, for each player, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a value in their cycle as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Given that, for each player, we can find their cycle, find the maximum a in their cycle, find the minimum number of moves to reach that position, and then compute the maximum score accordingly.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the optimal strategy.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=4, k=3, P_B=1, P_S=2

p = [2, 3, 4, 1]

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1

Maximum a value is 4.

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: Stay at 1 (a=1), or move to 2 (a=2 in turn 2)

- Turn 2: If stayed at 1 in turn 1, can stay at 1 (a=1), or move to 2 (a=2)

- Turn 3: Depending on previous choices, accumulate a[x]

Optimal strategy would be to move to 2, then to 3, then to 4, accumulating 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

Alternatively, move to 2, stay at 2, stay at 2: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6

Or stay at 1, move to 2, move to 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Hence, the maximum score is 9.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: Stay at 2 (a=2), or move to 3 (a=3 in turn 2)

- Turn 2: Depending on turn 1 choice, stay or move

- Turn 3: Similarly

Optimal strategy: Move to 3, move to 4, stay at 4: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11

Hence, Sasha wins with 11 vs Bodya's 9.

This seems to confirm that the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a value as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Hence, for each player, I need to:

1. Find their cycle.

2. Find the maximum a value in their cycle.

3. Find the minimum number of moves to reach that position from their starting position.

4. Compute the maximum score based on k and the number of moves to reach the maximum a position.

Given that, I can implement this logic efficiently.

But the provided program seems to handle it differently, with simulations up to k turns, which is inefficient for large k.

Hence, I suspect that the provided program is incorrect, at least for larger inputs.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
