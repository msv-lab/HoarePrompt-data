Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Bodya and Sasha are playing with a permutation and an array. The game lasts for k turns, and in each turn, both players can choose to stay in their current position or move to a new position based on the permutation. Their scores increase by the value in the array at their current positions. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. The players have starting positions P_B and P_S, and the game lasts for k turns. In each turn, both players simultaneously decide to stay or move to p[x], where x is their current position. The player with the higher score after k turns wins.

I need to figure out, given the constraints, how to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

Looking at the input format, there are multiple test cases, each with n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 10^4

- n ≤ 2*10^5

- k ≤ 10^9

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2*10^5

This tells me that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case or better.

First, I need to think about how the players can maximize their scores.

Each player has two choices each turn: stay or move to p[x]. The choice affects their current position and thus the value added to their score in the next turns.

Since both players make decisions simultaneously, their choices don't affect each other directly, but they affect their own positions and scores independently.

So, essentially, the problem reduces to each player trying to maximize their own score independently, and then comparing the maximum scores achievable by both.

But, since they make decisions simultaneously, and their choices don't interfere with each other, I can treat their strategies separately.

Wait, but their choices are made simultaneously, meaning that in each turn, both choose independently whether to stay or move.

But since they're trying to win, they'll choose the option that maximizes their own score.

So, for each player, I need to find the sequence of choices (stay or move) that maximizes their total score over k turns.

Given that k can be up to 10^9, it's impossible to simulate each turn individually. I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider what happens when a player chooses to stay or move.

If a player stays at position x, their score increases by a[x], and they remain at x in the next turn.

If they move to p[x], their score increases by a[p[x]], and their new position becomes p[x].

Wait, no. According to the problem:

- First, the player's score increases by a[x], where x is the current position.

- Then, the player chooses to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in each turn:

1. Score increases by a[x].

2. Choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

This is important because the choice to stay or move happens after the score is increased by a[x].

So, in each turn, the player gets a[x], and then decides where to be in the next turn.

If they stay, next position is x; if they move, next position is p[x].

I need to model this decision process for both players over k turns.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum possible score for each player.

I recall that in problems involving permutations, cycles play an important role.

Let me consider the permutation p and its cycle structure.

In a permutation, cycles are groups of elements that map to each other in a circular manner.

For example, if p = [2, 1, 4, 3], there are two cycles: 1 -> 2 -> 1 and 3 -> 4 -> 3.

In such cycles, if a player moves according to p, they cycle through the positions in the cycle.

Given that, if a player is in a cycle, and they keep moving, they will cycle through the positions in that cycle.

If they choose to stay at some point, they can decide to remain in the current position for the remaining turns.

Given that, perhaps I can analyze the cycles separately and determine the optimal strategy within each cycle.

Let me think about a cycle.

Suppose we have a cycle of length m: x1 -> x2 -> ... -> xm -> x1.

If a player is in this cycle and keeps moving, they will cycle through these positions in a loop.

Their score will be the sum of a[xi] for the positions they visit.

But since k can be up to 10^9, and m can be up to n, which is 2*10^5, I need a way to compute the sum efficiently.

Wait, but in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, independently of previous choices.

So, it's not just about cycling through the positions; it's about choosing at each turn whether to stay or move.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position, I can compute the maximum score achievable from that position for the remaining turns.

However, with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider that in each position, the player can choose to stay and collect a[x] repeatedly, or to move to p[x] and then follow a different path.

But since they make this choice each turn, independently, I need to model this carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node has two outgoing edges: one for staying and one for moving.

But with n up to 2*10^5, and k up to 10^9, this seems infeasible.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and try to find the maximum possible score they can achieve starting from their initial position in k turns.

At each turn, for a given position, the player has two options:

1. Stay: score increases by a[x], and remain at x for the next turn.

2. Move: score increases by a[p[x]], and move to p[x] for the next turn.

Wait, no. According to the problem statement:

- First, score increases by a[x].

- Then, choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in each turn:

- Score increases by a[x].

- Then, choose to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

So, in the next turn, if the player stays, they remain at x; if they move, they go to p[x].

Hence, the position for the next turn is x if they stay, or p[x] if they move.

But the score increase is always a[x], regardless of the choice made afterward.

Wait, no.

Wait, re-reading the problem statement:

"on each turn, two things happen:

- If the current position is x, score increases by a_x.

- Then, the player either stays at x or moves to p_x."

So, in each turn:

1. Score increases by a[x].

2. Then, choose to stay at x or move to p[x] for the next turn.

Hence, in the next turn, the position is x if staying, or p[x] if moving.

So, in terms of decision-making, at each turn, the player chooses their position for the next turn: either x or p[x].

Then, in the next turn, they repeat the process.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as each player having a choice at each turn about where to be in the next turn.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute the maximum possible score efficiently.

I recall that in such problems, the optimal choice often converges to staying at a particular position or cycling through a set of positions.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the position that gives the maximum a[x], and determine if they can achieve staying at that position for the remaining turns.

Wait, but they might not be able to stay at any position they want; it depends on the permutation and their choices.

Wait, actually, for any position, if a player is at x, they can choose to stay at x forever, or choose to move to p[x], and so on.

Hence, their score can be seen as the sum of a[x] over the positions they choose to stay at.

But since they must choose at each turn, perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum possible score based on the choices they make.

Let me consider that for each player, their score is the sum of a[x] over k turns, where x is the position they choose to be at in each turn, with the constraint that in each turn, x either stays the same or moves to p[x].

Wait, more precisely, in each turn:

- They get a[x].

- Then, they choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

Hence, in the next turn, their position is either x or p[x], and they get a[x] again if they stay, or a[p[x]] if they move.

Wait, no, they get a[x] first, then choose to stay or move.

So, in the next turn, if they stay, they get a[x] again; if they move, they go to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Hence, their total score is the sum of a[x_i] for each turn i, where x_i is their position in turn i, and x_{i+1} is either x_i (if they stay) or p[x_i] (if they move).

Given that, I need to maximize the sum of a[x_i] for i from 1 to k, with the constraint that x_{i+1} is either x_i or p[x_i].

This looks like a dynamic programming problem, where dp[i][x] is the maximum score achievable in i turns starting from position x.

However, with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, this is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each position x, the player can choose to stay at x for any number of turns, or to move to p[x] and repeat the process.

Hence, the player can choose to stay at x for some turns, then move to p[x], stay there for some turns, and so on.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for as many turns as possible.

But how do I determine that?

Wait, suppose for a player, their current position is x.

They can choose to stay at x for t turns, getting t * a[x], and then move to p[x] and repeat.

Alternatively, they can move to p[x] after s turns, and then stay at p[x] for some turns, and so on.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Let me consider that for each player, their position over time forms a sequence where x_{i+1} is either x_i or p[x_i].

Given that, the position at turn i depends on the choices made in previous turns.

This seems too involved to model directly for large k.

I need to find a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the long run, the player will eventually end up in a cycle, where they keep moving through a set of positions repeatedly.

In that cycle, they can choose to stay at one of the positions repeatedly to maximize their score.

Hence, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle and assume that they stay at that position for the remaining turns.

But this might not be accurate, as they might gain more by moving through certain positions before settling at the one with the maximum a[x].

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then compute the score accordingly.

But I need to consider the path they take to reach that position.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position x.

I can model their possible positions over time as a tree where each node has two children: one for staying and one for moving.

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

Wait, but since p is a permutation, its structure is made up of disjoint cycles.

Hence, the graph formed by p is a forest of trees with cycles at the roots.

But more accurately, it's a collection of trees where each tree has a cycle as its base, and trees growing out of the cycle.

But actually, in a permutation, it's a collection of disjoint cycles.

Wait, no, in a permutation, it's a collection of disjoint cycles and fixed points (which are cycles of length 1).

Wait, no, fixed points are cycles of length 1.

Hence, the permutation decomposes into disjoint cycles.

Given that, perhaps I can analyze each cycle separately.

But I need to consider the paths that the players can take, considering that they can choose to stay or move at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each player, the set of positions they can reach and the maximum a[x] in that set.

Then, their optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for the remaining turns.

But I need to confirm if this is correct.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose n=2, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=2, p=[2,1], a=[3,4].

So, the permutation is a cycle of length 2: 1 -> 2 -> 1.

The array a is [3,4].

Let's see what happens.

For Bodya starting at 1:

- Turn 1: at 1, score +=3, choose to stay at 1 or move to 2.

- If stays: turn 2, at 1, score +=3, total=6.

- If moves: turn 2, at 2, score +=4, total=7.

Hence, maximum is 7.

For Sasha starting at 2:

- Turn 1: at 2, score +=4, choose to stay at 2 or move to 1.

- If stays: turn 2, at 2, score +=4, total=8.

- If moves: turn 2, at 1, score +=3, total=7.

Hence, maximum is 8.

So, Sasha wins with score 8 vs Bodya's 7.

Now, according to the approach I thought earlier, finding the maximum a[x] in the cycle and staying there, it would suggest that Bodya stays at 2 (a=4) and Sasha stays at 2 (a=4).

But in reality, Sasha can stay at 2 and get 4+4=8, while Bodya can go to 2 and get 3+4=7.

Hence, it seems that the approach of staying at the maximum a[x] in the cycle gives the correct result.

But let's check another example.

n=3, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=2, p=[2,3,1], a=[1,2,3].

So, the permutation is a cycle: 1->2->3->1.

Array a=[1,2,3].

Bodya starts at 1.

- Turn 1: at 1, score +=1, choose to stay at 1 or move to 2.

- If stays: turn 2, at 1, score +=1, total=2.

- If moves: turn 2, at 2, score +=2, total=3.

Hence, maximum is 3.

Sasha starts at 2.

- Turn 1: at 2, score +=2, choose to stay at 2 or move to 3.

- If stays: turn 2, at 2, score +=2, total=4.

- If moves: turn 2, at 3, score +=3, total=5.

Hence, maximum is 5.

So, Sasha wins with 5 vs Bodya's 3.

According to the earlier approach, the maximum a[x] in the cycle is 3, so both should aim to stay at position 3.

For Bodya, starting at 1, he can move to 2, then to 3, and stay there.

But in k=2 turns, he can only reach position 3 by moving twice, but since k=2, he can only move once, reaching position 2, and then to 3, but in turn 2, he would be at position 3, scoring a_3=3.

Wait, but in the first turn, he is at 1, scores 1, and chooses to move to 2.

In the second turn, he is at 2, scores 2, and chooses to move to 3.

But according to the problem, in each turn, he gets a[x], then chooses to stay or move.

Hence, in turn 1: at 1, score +=1, choose to move to 2.

Turn 2: at 2, score +=2, choose to move to 3.

Total score: 1+2=3.

But in the earlier calculation, I thought he could reach position 3 and score a_3=3 in the second turn, but actually, he only scores a_2=2 in the second turn.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

In turn 1:

- Bodya is at 1, scores a_1=1.

- Chooses to move to p[1]=2.

In turn 2:

- Bodya is at 2, scores a_2=2.

- Chooses to move to p[2]=3.

Hence, total score: 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternatively, in turn 2, he could choose to stay at 2, scoring a_2=2 again, total 1 + 2 = 3.

But in reality, he can choose to stay at 2 and score 2 in the second turn, or move to 3 and score 3 in the second turn.

Wait, no. Wait, in turn 2, if he moves to 3, he scores a_3=3 in turn 2.

Wait, but according to the problem, the score is a[x], where x is the current position at the beginning of the turn.

Wait, no. Wait, re-reading the problem:

"on each turn, two things happen:

- If the current position is x, score increases by a_x.

- Then, the player either stays at x or moves to p_x."

Hence, in each turn:

1. Score increases by a_x.

2. Then, choose to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

Hence, in turn 1:

- Bodya is at 1, scores a_1=1.

- Chooses to move to p[1]=2 for the next turn.

In turn 2:

- Bodya is at 2, scores a_2=2.

- Chooses to move to p[2]=3 for the next turn.

But k=2, so the game ends after turn 2.

Total score: 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternatively, in turn 2, he could choose to stay at 2, scoring a_2=2 again.

Total score: 1 + 2 = 3.

Or in turn 1, he could choose to stay at 1, scoring a_1=1 in turn 1, and then in turn 2, stay at 1 again, scoring a_1=1 again, total 1 + 1 = 2.

Hence, the maximum he can achieve is 3.

But in reality, the maximum is 1 (from turn 1) + 3 (from turn 2 if he moves to 3 in turn 2), totaling 4.

Wait, but in turn 2, if he moves to 3, he scores a_3=3 in turn 2.

Hence, total score: 1 (turn 1) + 3 (turn 2) = 4.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought he could only score a_2=2 in turn 2 if he moves to 2 in turn 1.

Wait, no, let's correct that.

In turn 1:

- At position 1, score += a_1=1.

- Choose to move to p[1]=2 for turn 2.

In turn 2:

- At position 2, score += a_2=2.

- Choose to move to p[2]=3 for turn 3.

But k=2, so the game ends after turn 2, with total score 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternatively, in turn 2, choose to stay at 2, scoring a_2=2 again, total 1 + 2 = 3.

Or in turn 1, choose to stay at 1, scoring a_1=1, then in turn 2, stay at 1 again, scoring a_1=1 again, total 1 + 1 = 2.

Hence, the maximum is indeed 3.

But earlier I thought he could score a_3=3 in turn 2, but that would require moving to 3 in turn 1, which would make him be at 3 in turn 2, scoring a_3=3.

Wait, no. Wait, in turn 1:

- At 1, score +=1.

- Choose to move to p[1]=2 for turn 2.

Alternatively, choose to stay at 1 for turn 2.

If he chooses to move to 2 in turn 1, then in turn 2, he is at 2, scores a_2=2.

If he chooses to stay at 1 in turn 1, then in turn 2, he is at 1, scores a_1=1.

Hence, the maximum is 1 + 2 = 3.

Wait, but how can he reach position 3 in turn 2?

He can move to 2 in turn 1, then move to 3 in turn 2.

But in turn 2, he would be at 3, scoring a_3=3.

Hence, total score: 1 (turn 1) + 3 (turn 2) = 4.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that in turn 2, if he moves to 3, he scores a_2=2.

But actually, no.

Wait, let's clarify the sequence:

- Turn 1:

- At position 1, score += a_1=1.

- Choose to move to p[1]=2 for turn 2.

- Turn 2:

- At position 2, score += a_2=2.

- Choose to move to p[2]=3 for turn 3.

But since k=2, the game ends after turn 2, with total score 1 + 2 = 3.

Alternatively, in turn 2, choose to stay at 2, scoring a_2=2 again, total 1 + 2 = 3.

Or in turn 1, choose to stay at 1, scoring a_1=1, then in turn 2, stay at 1 again, scoring a_1=1 again, total 1 + 1 = 2.

Hence, the maximum is indeed 3.

Wait, but I thought he could reach position 3 in turn 2.

But actually, to be at position 3 in turn 2, he needs to move to 2 in turn 1, and then move to 3 in turn 2.

But in turn 2, he scores a_2=2, not a_3=3.

Wait, no. Wait, in turn 2, he is at position 2, scores a_2=2, then chooses to move to p[2]=3 for turn 3.

But since k=2, the game ends after turn 2, with total score 1 + 2 = 3.

Hence, he never reaches position 3 in this scenario.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"on each turn, two things happen:

- If the current position is x, score increases by a_x.

- Then, the player either stays at x or moves to p_x."

Hence, in each turn:

1. Score increases by a_x, where x is the current position.

2. Then, the player chooses to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

Hence, in turn 1:

- At x=1, score += a_1=1.

- Choose to stay at 1 or move to p[1]=2 for turn 2.

In turn 2:

- If stayed at 1, score += a_1=1, total=2.

- If moved to 2, score += a_2=2, total=3.

Hence, maximum is 3.

Wait, but in the earlier example, I thought he could reach position 3 in turn 2, but that's not possible within k=2 turns.

Hence, in k=2 turns, he can only reach position 2, scoring a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Hence, the maximum is indeed 3.

Similarly, Sasha starts at 2.

- Turn 1: at 2, score += a_2=2.

- Choose to stay at 2 or move to p[2]=3 for turn 2.

In turn 2:

- If stays at 2, score += a_2=2, total=4.

- If moves to 3, score += a_3=3, total=5.

Hence, maximum is 5.

Hence, Sasha wins with 5 vs Bodya's 3.

So, in this case, the player can reach the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle and stay there to maximize their score.

Hence, perhaps the general approach is:

For each player, find the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and compute the score as a[x] * k.

But wait, in the above example, if Bodya could reach position 3, he could get a_3=3 per turn, but in reality, he can only reach position 3 in turn 2, but since k=2, he only gets one a_3=3.

Wait, no, in the earlier example, he can only get a_1=1 and a_2=2, totaling 3, not a_3=3 in turn 2.

Wait, but in the earlier musing, I thought he could reach position 3 in turn 2, but according to the problem, he can't because moving to p[x] only affects the next turn's position.

Hence, in turn 1, he moves to p[1]=2, scores a_1=1.

In turn 2, he is at 2, scores a_2=2.

Hence, total is 1 + 2 = 3.

He never reaches position 3 in k=2 turns.

Wait, but in the earlier musing, I thought he could move to 3 in turn 2, but that would be turn 3, which is beyond k=2.

Hence, in k=2 turns, he can't reach position 3.

Hence, in this case, the maximum score is indeed 3 for Bodya and 5 for Sasha.

Hence, perhaps the approach is:

For each player, find the maximum a[x] in the positions they can reach within k turns, and assume they stay at that position for the remaining turns.

But determining the positions they can reach within k turns is tricky.

An alternative approach is to find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then compute the score accordingly.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that each player is in a cycle, and they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns.

But in reality, they might need to traverse some path to reach that position.

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then compute the score as the sum of a[x] for the turns spent reaching that position plus the maximum a[x] for the remaining turns.

But I need to compute the minimal number of turns needed to reach the position with maximum a[x], and then add the maximum a[x] for the remaining turns.

Wait, but in the earlier example, Bodya can't reach position 3 in k=2 turns, so he can't benefit from a_3=3.

Hence, perhaps I need to find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in the positions they can reach within k turns, and then stay at that position for the remaining turns.

But determining the reachable positions within k turns is not straightforward.

An alternative idea is to observe that in the long run, the player will end up in a cycle, and within that cycle, they can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] for the remaining turns.

But for small k, this might not be possible.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider two phases:

1. Reach the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle.

2. Stay at that position for the remaining turns.

But I need to compute the minimal number of turns needed to reach that position.

However, in a cycle, reaching the maximum a[x] position might require traversing the cycle, which could take up to m turns, where m is the cycle length.

But k can be up to 10^9, and m up to n=2*10^5, so I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then compute the score as the sum of a[x] for the path to reach that position plus the maximum a[x] for the remaining turns.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the cycle structure.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m: x1 -> x2 -> ... -> xm -> x1.

In this cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position or move to the next position in the cycle.

To maximize the score, the player should aim to spend as much time as possible at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a[x] as quickly as possible and then stay there for the remaining turns.

Hence, the minimal number of turns needed to reach the maximum a[x] position is t, and then the player can stay there for k - t turns, accumulating (k - t) * a[x].

Hence, the total score is the sum of a[x] for the first t turns plus (k - t) * a[x].

But I need to find the minimal t to reach the maximum a[x].

But in a cycle, t can be at most m-1, where m is the cycle length.

Hence, for each cycle, I can find the position with the maximum a[x], and the minimal t to reach it from the starting position.

Then, the maximum score is sum of a[x] along the path to that position plus (k - t) * a[x].

But I need to handle the case where k < t, meaning the player can't reach the maximum a[x] position within k turns.

Hence, I need to compute the maximum possible a[x] that the player can achieve in k turns.

This seems manageable.

First, I need to find the cycle that each player is in.

Then, find the maximum a[x] in that cycle.

Then, find the minimal number of turns to reach that position.

Then, compute the score accordingly.

But I need to handle the case where the starting position is not in the cycle yet.

Wait, in a permutation, all positions are part of cycles.

Hence, from any position, the player can eventually reach the cycle they are in.

But in reality, in a permutation, the graph is made up of disjoint cycles.

Hence, from any position, following p[x], the player eventually enters a cycle.

Hence, for each player, I need to find their cycle, find the maximum a[x] in that cycle, and find the minimal number of turns to reach that position.

Then, compute the score as the sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum a[x] position plus (k - t) * a[x].

But I need to handle the case where k < t, meaning the player can't reach the maximum a[x] position within k turns.

In that case, the player can only accumulate the sum of a[x] along the path they can traverse within k turns.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Hence, the steps are:

1. For each player, find their cycle and the maximum a[x] in that cycle.

2. Find the minimal number of turns to reach the maximum a[x] position from their starting position.

3. If k >= t, compute the sum of a[x] along the path to the maximum a[x] position plus (k - t) * a[x].

4. If k < t, compute the sum of a[x] along the path for the first k turns.

But I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Hence, I need to precompute for each cycle the maximum a[x], and the minimal t to reach it from any position in the cycle.

But handling t for each starting position in the cycle can be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the cycle as a circular array and compute for each position the distance to the maximum a[x].

But this would take O(m) per cycle, which is acceptable since the sum of m over all cycles is n.

Hence, per test case, this would be O(n).

Then, for each player, I can find their cycle, compute t, and then compute the score accordingly.

This seems manageable.

But I need to make sure that this approach is correct.

Let me consider another example.

n=4, k=3, P_B=1, P_S=2, p=[2,3,4,1], a=[1,2,3,4].

So, the permutation has one cycle: 1->2->3->4->1.

Array a=[1,2,3,4].

The maximum a[x] in the cycle is 4.

The positions and their distances to position 4:

- Position 1: distance 3 (1->2->3->4)

- Position 2: distance 2 (2->3->4)

- Position 3: distance 1 (3->4)

- Position 4: distance 0

Hence, for Bodya starting at 1, t=3 to reach position 4.

But k=3, so t=3 <= k=3, so score = a[1] + a[2] + a[4] = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Wait, no.

Wait, in turn 1:

- At 1, score +=1.

- Choose to move to p[1]=2 for turn 2.

In turn 2:

- At 2, score +=2.

- Choose to move to p[2]=3 for turn 3.

In turn 3:

- At 3, score +=3.

- Choose to move to p[3]=4 for turn 4.

But k=3, so total score: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Wait, but according to the approach, it's sum of a[x] along the path to position 4, which is a[1] + a[2] + a[4].

But in reality, in turn 3, he is at 3, scores a[3]=3, and chooses to move to 4, but since k=3, he doesn't get a[4].

Hence, the approach is incorrect.

Hence, I need to adjust the approach.

Actually, in k=3 turns, the player can move to positions 1->2->3, scoring a[1]+a[2]+a[3]=1+2+3=6.

If the player chooses to stay at some position, they can get a higher score.

For example, if the player moves to 2 in turn 1, then stays at 2 in turn 2 and turn 3, scoring a[1] + a[2] + a[2] = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5, which is less than 6.

Alternatively, move to 2 in turn 1, move to 3 in turn 2, stay at 3 in turn 3, scoring a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Alternatively, move to 2 in turn 1, stay at 2 in turn 2, move to 3 in turn 3, scoring a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Hence, the maximum is 6.

But according to the earlier approach, sum of a[x] along the path to position 4 plus (k - t) * a[4] = a[1] + a[2] + a[4] = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which is higher than the actual possible score.

Hence, the approach is incorrect.

Hence, I need a better way to model this.

An alternative idea is to consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay at their current position and collect a[x] repeatedly, or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]], and so on.

Hence, for each player, their score can be seen as the sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to k, where x_i is their position in turn i, and x_{i+1} is either x_i (if they stay) or p[x_i] (if they move).

This looks like a dynamic programming problem, where dp[i][x] is the maximum score achievable in i turns starting from position x.

However, with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, this is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for each player, their score is the sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to k, where x_i is their position in turn i, and x_{i+1} is either x_i or p[x_i].

Hence, the sequence of positions is a path where each step can be staying or moving.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where edges represent staying or moving, and then find the path of length k with the maximum sum of a[x_i].

But again, with n and k being large, this seems infeasible.

An alternative idea is to observe that in the long run, the player will end up in a cycle, and their score will be the sum of a[x] along the path to the cycle plus the sum of a[x] in the cycle multiplied by the number of times they traverse the cycle.

But in this problem, k can be up to 10^9, and n up to 2*10^5, so I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each player, their positions over time can be represented as a sequence where x_{i+1} = x_i (if they stay) or p[x_i] (if they move).

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the position that gives the maximum a[x], and determine if they can reach it within k turns.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a decision to stay at a certain position for multiple turns.

For example, if a player chooses to stay at a position x for t turns, their score increases by t * a[x].

Alternatively, they can choose to move to p[x] and then decide how many turns to stay there, and so on.

Hence, the problem reduces to choosing a sequence of positions where each subsequent position is either the same as the previous one or p[x], and maximizing the sum of a[x] over k turns.

This still seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each player, their score is the sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to k, where x_i is their position in turn i, and x_{i+1} is either x_i or p[x_i].

Hence, the score can be expressed as the sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to k, where x_i is a sequence such that x_{i+1} = x_i or p[x_i].

Given that, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum possible a[x_i] for each i, given the constraints.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position x.

I can model their possible positions over time as a tree where each node has two children: one for staying and one for moving.

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

Wait, but in a permutation, following p[x], the player will eventually enter a cycle.

Hence, perhaps I can find the path from the starting position to the cycle, and then handle the cycle separately.

But I need to handle k turns, which may include traversing the path to the cycle and then traversing the cycle multiple times.

This seems similar to handling the cycle and the path to it.

In such cases, I can compute the sum along the path to the cycle and then add the sum of the cycle multiplied by the number of times it's traversed.

But in this problem, the player can choose to stay at any position, so it's more flexible.

Hence, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a[x] in their cycle, and then compute the score as the sum of a[x] along the path to that position plus (k - t) * maximum a[x], where t is the number of turns to reach that position.

But in the earlier example, this didn't hold, as the player might not be able to reach the position with maximum a[x] within k turns.

Hence, I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each player, their possible positions over time form a tree where the root is the starting position, and each node has two children: one for staying and one for moving.

But again, with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

An alternative idea is to consider that the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle for any number of turns.

Hence, perhaps I can find the maximum a[x] in their cycle and assume that they stay there for as many turns as possible.
