Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N is the length of the strings I need to form, and K is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. I need to create a string S such that all possible strings of length N from the first K alphabets are subsequences of S. And I have to make sure that S is as short as possible. If there are multiple options, any shortest one is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so for each test case, I get N and K. I need to generate a string S where every possible combination of length N from the first K letters appears as a subsequence.

Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

1 2

2 1

2 2

2 3

Output:

ab

aa

baab

abcbac

For the first test case, N=1, K=2, so the possible strings are "a" and "b". The string "ab" contains both as subsequences: "a" is the first character, and "b" is the second.

Second test case, N=2, K=1, so only "aa" is possible. The string "aa" obviously contains "aa" as a subsequence.

Third test case, N=2, K=2, possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". The string "baab" contains all of them:

- "aa": positions 2 and 4

- "ab": positions 1 and 3

- "ba": positions 1 and 2

- "bb": positions 3 and 4

Fourth test case, N=2, K=3, possible strings are all combinations of "a", "b", "c" of length 2. The string "abcbac" contains all of them as subsequences.

So, the goal is to construct such a string S for any given N and K, with S being as short as possible.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import collections

from collections import Counter

from collections import defaultdict

import math

from math import log

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

res = func_1()

print(res)

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

return s[:k] * n

So, the program defines a function func_1() that takes N and K, takes the first K letters of the alphabet, and repeats them N times.

For example, for N=2, K=2, it would return "ba" * 2 = "baba", but in the sample input, it's "baab". So, there might be an issue here.

Wait, actually, s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and s[:k] for K=2 is "ab", so "ab" * 2 is "abab", but the sample output is "baab". So, there's a discrepancy.

Similarly, for N=1, K=2, it should return "ab", which matches the sample output. For N=2, K=1, it should return "aa", which matches. For N=2, K=2, it should return "abab", but the sample output is "baab". For N=2, K=3, it should return "abcbab", but the sample output is "abcbac".

So, it seems like the program's approach doesn't align with the sample outputs.

Moreover, is repeating the first K letters N times the optimal way to ensure all combinations are subsequences? I'm not so sure.

Let me think about a better approach.

I need to include all possible combinations of length N from the first K letters as subsequences in S.

One way to think about this is to construct a string that covers all possible combinations.

For example, for N=2 and K=2, the combinations are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". The string "baab" covers all of them, as shown in the explanation.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, "abcbac" covers all 9 possible combinations.

I need a general way to construct such a string for any N and K.

This sounds similar to de Bruijn sequences, which are cyclic sequences that contain every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once. However, de Bruijn sequences are for subsequences of length N without overlaps, and here we need to handle subsequences with possible overlaps.

Wait, but in this problem, it's about subsequences, not substrings. So, it's a bit different from the standard de Bruijn sequences, which deal with substrings.

I need to ensure that every possible combination of length N from the first K letters appears as a subsequence in S.

One straightforward, but possibly suboptimal, way is to concatenate all possible combinations. For example, for N=2 and K=2, concatenate "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb" to get "aabb", but this is longer than "baab", which also contains all of them.

So, the challenge is to find the shortest string that contains all possible combinations as subsequences.

I need to find a more efficient way to construct S.

Let's consider that for N=1, any string that contains all K letters at least once will suffice. For N=2, I need to ensure that every pair appears as a subsequence.

One approach could be to take the concatenation of all combinations in a specific order where the end of one combination overlaps with the beginning of another, reducing redundancy.

This is similar to the idea behind de Bruijn sequences, but adapted for subsequences instead of substrings.

I need to think about how to minimize the length of S by maximizing overlaps between the combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to determine the minimal length based on N and K.

Wait, but the problem allows me to output any string that satisfies the condition, not necessarily the one with the minimal length, but it's preferred to have the smallest length.

Given that T can be up to 676, and N and K are small (up to 26), efficiency might not be a major concern, as long as the solution is reasonable.

Let me consider building S by ensuring that all combinations are present as subsequences.

One way to do this is to generate all possible combinations of length N from the first K letters and then find a way to chain them together with minimal overlap.

But generating all combinations and then trying to find an optimal way to chain them might be too time-consuming for large N and K, but since N and K are small, it might be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to construct S directly.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

For N=1, K=2: "ab"

For N=2, K=1: "aa"

For N=2, K=2: "baab"

For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern here.

In the first case, N=1, K=2: just concatenate all single letters.

In the second case, N=2, K=1: just repeat "a" twice.

For N=2, K=2: "baab"

- "ba" followed by "ab"

For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

- "ab", "cb", "ba", "bc", "ac", etc.

It's not immediately clear what the pattern is.

Perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of a de Bruijn sequence adapted for subsequences.

I recall that in de Bruijn sequences, for substrings of length N from an alphabet of size K, the sequence has length K^N + N -1, but that's for substrings, not subsequences.

For subsequences, the minimal length might be different.

I need to find the minimal length such that all possible combinations of length N from the first K letters appear as subsequences.

Let me think about N=2 and K=2.

Possible combinations: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

One way to have all these as subsequences is to have "a", "b", "a", "b", which is "abab", but the sample output is "baab".

Both have length 4, which is the minimal possible, because to have all pairs, you can't do better than 4 in this case.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, the sample output is "abcbac", which has length 6.

Is this the minimal length possible? Let's see.

Possible combinations for N=2, K=3:

"aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

Is "abcbac" containing all of these as subsequences?

- "aa": positions 1 and 4 ('a','a')

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 ('a','b')

- "ac": positions 1 and 5 ('a','c')

- "ba": positions 2 and 4 ('b','a')

- "bb": positions 2 and 5 ('b','b')

- "bc": positions 2 and 6 ('b','c')

- "ca": positions 4 and 5 ('a','a'; but "ca" is needed. Wait, is there a "ca"? positions 5 and 6 ('a','c'), but that's "ac", not "ca". Wait, is "ca" present?

Looking back at the note, it seems "ca" is derived from positions 3 and 5 ('c','a'). Wait, but in "abcbac", position 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'b', 5: 'a', 6: 'c'.

So, "ca" would be position 3 ('c') and position 5 ('a'). Yes, that works.

Similarly, "cb" is positions 3 ('c') and 4 ('b').

So, all combinations are covered.

Is there a way to make it shorter than 6? Probably not, as there are 9 combinations, and some overlap is necessary.

So, the minimal length seems to be 6 for N=2 and K=3.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need a method to construct such a string for any N and K.

One approach is to use a graph where each node represents a sequence of length N-1, and edges represent the addition of a new character.

Wait, that's similar to how de Bruijn sequences are constructed, but again, for substrings, not subsequences.

For subsequences, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for N=1, the minimal string is just the concatenation of all K letters, as there are no subsequences longer than 1 to consider.

For N=2, I need to ensure that for every pair of letters, there exists at least one subsequence where the first letter appears before the second.

To minimize the length, I need to maximize the overlaps between different pairs.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think recursively.

Suppose I have constructed a string for N-1 and K, and now I need to extend it to N.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that to include all subsequences of length N, I need to have all combinations present in some order.

Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion of all combinations of positions of length N in the string.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the order of the letters in the string and ensure that for every combination, there exists a way to choose N positions that match the combination in order.

This still doesn't give me a clear path to construct S.

Maybe I should look for existing research or known algorithms for this problem.

A quick search tells me that this is related to the concept of supersequences, where a supersequence contains all possible subsequences of a certain length.

In particular, it's similar to the problem of finding the minimal supersequence that contains all possible combinations as subsequences.

I recall that the minimal length for a supersequence containing all permutations of K letters is known, but here it's combinations with repetitions allowed.

Wait, no, it's combinations with specific lengths.

This seems more related to covering codes or covering arrays in combinatorics.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Given the constraints (T up to 676, N and K up to 26), maybe a brute-force approach or a backtracking algorithm could be used to construct S.

However, 676 test cases, each potentially with N=26 and K=26, might be too slow if not implemented efficiently.

But since N and K are small, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to directly construct S.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

For N=1, K=2: "ab"

For N=2, K=1: "aa"

For N=2, K=2: "baab"

For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern in how these strings are constructed.

In "baab", for N=2 and K=2:

- It starts with "ba", which covers "ba" and "bb" (from the second "b")

- Then "ab" covers "ab" and "aa" (from the first "a")

Similarly, in "abcbac" for N=2 and K=3:

- "ab" covers "ab", "a" from "a" and "b" from "b"

- "cb" covers "cb", "c" and "b"

- "ba" covers "ba", "b" and "a"

- "ac" covers "ac", "a" and "c"

But I need a more systematic way.

Perhaps I can think of it as building a string where each combination is covered by selecting positions that form the subsequence.

Wait, this is getting too abstract.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have all possible combinations of length N from K letters.

There are K^N such combinations.

I need to create a string S such that each of these combinations appears as a subsequence in S.

To minimize the length of S, I need to maximize the overlaps between different combinations.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding a minimal path that covers all required subsequences.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes represent prefixes of the combinations, and edges represent the addition of a new character.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to build such a string.

Define DP[i][mask], where i is the current position in S, and mask represents the combinations already covered.

But this seems too vague and computationally expensive.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need a heuristic approach.

One simple heuristic is to repeatedly append the letter that covers the most uncovered combinations.

Start with an empty S, and iteratively choose the letter that allows the most new combinations to be covered as subsequences.

This is a greedy approach.

Let me try this for N=2 and K=2.

Combinations: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Start with S=""

- Append 'b': now S="b"

- Covered combinations: none, since N=2

- Append 'a': S="ba"

- Covered combinations: "ba"

- Append 'a': S="baa"

- Covered combinations: "ba", "aa" (from positions 2 and 3)

- Append 'b': S="baab"

- Covered combinations: "ba", "aa", "ab" (from positions 1 and 3), "bb" (from positions 3 and 4)

All combinations are covered, and the length is 4, which matches the sample output.

So, this greedy approach seems to work for this case.

Let's try for N=2 and K=3.

Combinations: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

Start with S=""

- Append 'a': S="a"

- Covered combinations: none

- Append 'b': S="ab"

- Covered combinations: "ab"

- Append 'c': S="abc"

- Covered combinations: "ab", "ac", "bc"

- Append 'b': S="abcb"

- Covered combinations: "ab", "ac", "bc", "bb" (from positions 2 and 4), "cb" (from positions 3 and 4)

- Append 'a': S="abcbA"

- Covered combinations: "ab", "ac", "bc", "bb", "cb", "ba" (from positions 1 and 5), "ca" (from positions 5 and 6), "aa" (from positions 1 and 5)

- Append 'c': S="abcbac"

- Covered combinations: "ab", "ac", "bc", "bb", "cb", "ba", "ca", "cc" (from positions 4 and 6)

- Only "cc" is newly covered here, but actually, "cc" is from positions 4 and 6 ('b' and 'c'), which is "bc", not "cc". Wait, position 3 is 'c', position 6 is 'c', so "cc" is from positions 3 and 6.

Wait, positions 3 and 6 in "abcbac" are both 'c', so "cc" is covered.

So, all 9 combinations are covered.

This matches the sample output.

So, this greedy approach seems to work for these cases.

Therefore, perhaps the program should implement this greedy approach: iteratively append the letter that covers the most uncovered combinations.

But in the provided program, it's simply repeating the first K letters N times, which doesn't seem optimal, as seen in the discrepancy between the program's output and the sample output for N=2 and K=2.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
