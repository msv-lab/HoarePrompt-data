Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n disks in a plane, each with centers at integer coordinates and positive integer radii. No two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent to each other. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of these disks such that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

2. No two disks overlap in a positive area.

3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And the new radii can be any positive real numbers, not necessarily integers, and the centers remain fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, their boundaries touch at exactly one point. Mathematically, for two disks with centers at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and radii r1 and r2, they are tangent if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) = r1 + r2.

Given that, the problem allows us to change the radii as long as tangencies are preserved, and no new overlaps are created. Additionally, the sum of all radii must decrease.

So, the key here is to adjust radii while maintaining the tangencies and avoiding overlaps. It seems like we need to find a way to reduce the sum of radii without causing any overlaps, and ensuring that tangencies are preserved.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to identify the relationships between the disks based on their tangencies. If two disks are tangent, their radii are related by the distance between their centers.

Let's denote the distance between the centers of disk i and disk j as d_ij = sqrt((x_j - x_i)^2 + (y_j - y_i)^2).

Given that they are tangent, d_ij = r_i + r_j.

So, for tangent disks, r_j = d_ij - r_i.

If I want to change r_i to some new value r_i', then r_j should be adjusted to r_j' = d_ij - r_i'.

This maintains the tangency.

Now, if disk j is tangent to other disks, their radii also need to be adjusted accordingly to maintain their tangencies.

This suggests that the radii adjustments might be interconnected, forming a system of equations or constraints.

Perhaps, I can model this as a graph, where each disk is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if their disks are tangent.

In this graph, adjusting the radius of one disk affects the radii of its neighbors, and so on.

So, the problem reduces to finding a way to adjust the radii in this graph such that the sum of all radii decreases, while maintaining the tangencies and avoiding overlaps.

I need to ensure that after adjustment, no two disks overlap, meaning that for any two disks that are not tangent, the distance between their centers should be greater than the sum of their new radii.

Given that the radii are positive real numbers, and can be adjusted freely as long as the constraints are satisfied, I need to find if there exists a set of radii that meets all these conditions.

This sounds like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let r_i be the original radius of disk i, and r_i' be the new radius.

For tangent disks i and j:

r_i' + r_j' = d_ij

For non-tangent disks i and j:

r_i' + r_j' < d_ij

And, sum(r_i') < sum(r_i)

Also, r_i' > 0 for all i.

Given that all coordinates and radii are integers, and distances are integers or irrational, but since tangencies are given, distances are exactly equal to the sum of radii for tangent disks.

Wait, but in the input, all coordinates and radii are integers, and it's guaranteed that no two disks overlap in positive area, only tangencies are allowed.

So, I need to work with these constraints.

Let me consider the graph where nodes are disks, and edges are tangencies.

In this graph, adjusting the radius of one disk affects the radii of its neighbors in a specific way.

Suppose I fix the radius of one disk and solve for the others.

But since the sum needs to decrease, I need to find if there's a way to adjust radii such that the sum decreases, while maintaining the tangencies and no overlaps.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the degrees of freedom.

In the graph, each connected component corresponds to a set of disks where radii are interdependent through the tangencies.

In each connected component, once I fix one radius, the others are determined by the tangency constraints.

So, in each connected component, if I can find a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, while satisfying the non-overlap conditions for non-tangent disks, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but how do I ensure that non-overlap conditions are satisfied for non-tangent disks?

If two disks are not tangent, their distances should be greater than the sum of their new radii.

Given that, in a connected component, if I adjust the radii based on the tangency constraints, I need to ensure that for any two disks not connected by any path of tangencies, their new radii sum is less than the distance between them.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider that in each connected component defined by tangencies, the radii are linearly dependent, and I can express them in terms of one variable.

Then, for the entire graph, which may have multiple connected components, I can treat each component separately.

But I need to ensure that across different components, the radii adjustments don't cause overlaps where there weren't any tangencies.

Wait, but since there were no overlaps initially, and I'm only decreasing the sum of radii, it's likely that overlaps won't be created, but I need to verify that.

Wait, no. Decreasing the radii could potentially reduce overlaps, but in this case, since there were no overlaps initially, only tangencies, decreasing radii should maintain that, unless there are dependencies between components.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize it.

Suppose I have two connected components that are not connected by any tangencies.

Then, adjusting radii within one component shouldn't affect the other component, as long as their tangencies are maintained within the component.

So, for each connected component, I can treat it separately.

In each component, I can express all radii in terms of one radius, say r1'.

Then, I can find an expression for the sum of radii in terms of r1', and see if there's a value of r1' such that the sum decreases, while all radii remain positive.

But I need to make sure that for non-tangent disks across different components, their new radii sums are less than the distances between their centers.

Wait, but if two components are not connected by any tangencies, and there were no overlaps between them initially, then decreasing their radii while maintaining tangencies within each component should not cause any overlaps between the components.

Is that correct?

Let me think.

Initially, between two components, the distance between any two disks from different components is greater than the sum of their radii, since there are no overlaps and no tangencies between them.

If I decrease their radii, the sum of radii between any two disks from different components will decrease, but the distance remains the same, so the condition r_i' + r_j' < d_ij will still hold, as d_ij > r_i + r_j >= r_i' + r_j'.

Wait, no, r_i' + r_j' could be less than r_i + r_j, but it's not necessarily less than d_ij.

Wait, initially, d_ij > r_i + r_j, since they are not tangent and don't overlap.

If I decrease r_i and r_j such that r_i' + r_j' < r_i + r_j, it's possible that r_i' + r_j' < d_ij, but only if r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

Wait, no, initially, d_ij >= r_i + r_j, with equality only if they are tangent.

Since they are not tangent, d_ij > r_i + r_j.

So, if I decrease r_i and r_j such that r_i' + r_j' < r_i + r_j, then r_i' + r_j' < d_ij, since d_ij > r_i + r_j.

Therefore, no new overlaps will be created between disks from different components.

Hence, I can treat each connected component separately.

So, the problem reduces to, for each connected component defined by tangencies, can I adjust the radii within that component such that the sum decreases, while maintaining the tangencies and keeping all radii positive.

If I can do that for at least one component, then the total sum will decrease.

Therefore, I need to check for each connected component if there's a way to adjust radii to decrease the sum, while maintaining tangencies and keeping radii positive.

If at least one component allows such an adjustment, then the total sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

So, now, how do I check for a single connected component?

Let's consider a connected component with k disks.

I can represent the tangency constraints as equations:

For each pair of tangent disks, r_i' + r_j' = d_ij.

This is a system of linear equations.

Given that the graph is connected, I can express all radii in terms of one variable.

For example, set r1' = t, and express all other r_i' in terms of t.

Then, the sum of radii is a linear function of t.

I need to find t such that:

1. All r_i' > 0.

2. Sum of all r_i' < sum of original r_i.

3. The linear function sum(r_i') is strictly less than sum(r_i).

Since sum(r_i') is linear in t, and sum(r_i) is constant, I need to find t such that sum(r_i') < sum(r_i), within the constraints that all r_i' > 0.

If the sum is strictly decreasing for some t within the allowed range, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's not.

So, for each connected component, I need to check if such a t exists.

If at least one component allows for such a t, then the total sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Hence, the overall answer is YES if there exists at least one connected component where the sum of radii can be decreased without violating the constraints, and NO otherwise.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

1. Build the graph of disks connected by tangencies.

2. Identify the connected components.

3. For each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangencies to express all radii in terms of one variable.

4. Find if there exists a value of that variable such that:

a. All radii are positive.

b. The sum of radii is strictly less than the original sum.

5. If at least one component allows this, output YES; else, NO.

This seems manageable.

Let's think about how to implement this step by step.

First, build the graph:

- Nodes are disks.

- Edges are between tangent disks.

I can represent the graph using adjacency lists.

Then, find connected components using DFS or BFS.

For each connected component, solve the system of equations.

Given that the graph is connected and the equations are r_i' + r_j' = d_ij for each edge, I can fix one radius and express others in terms of it.

For example, set r1' = t, and express r2', r3', etc., in terms of t.

Then, express the sum of radii as a function of t.

Find the range of t where all r_i' > 0.

Within that range, check if there exists a t such that sum(r_i') < sum(r_i).

If yes, then it's possible for that component.

Otherwise, move to the next component.

If no component allows it, output NO.

Now, let's consider an example to see if this works.

Take the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Let's plot these disks.

Disk 1: (0,2), r=1

Disk 2: (0,0), r=1

Disk 3: (4,-3), r=4

Disk 4: (11,0), r=3

Disk 5: (11,5), r=2

Now, check which disks are tangent.

Compute distances between centers:

d12 = sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

r1 + r2 = 1 + 1 = 2, so they are tangent.

d13 = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (-3-2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41)

r1 + r3 = 1 + 4 = 5

Check if sqrt(41) == 5: sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403, which is not equal to 5, so not tangent.

d14 = sqrt((11-0)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18, r1 + r4 = 1 + 3 = 4 ≠ sqrt(125)

d15 = sqrt((11-0)^2 + (5-2)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) ≈ 11.40, r1 + r5 = 1 + 2 = 3 ≠ sqrt(130)

d23 = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

r2 + r3 = 1 + 4 = 5, so tangent.

d24 = sqrt((11-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

r2 + r4 = 1 + 3 = 4 ≠ 11

d25 = sqrt((11-0)^2 + (5-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.08 ≠ 1 + 2 = 3

d34 = sqrt((11-4)^2 + (0 - (-3))^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.62 ≠ 4 + 3 = 7

d35 = sqrt((11-4)^2 + (5 - (-3))^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) ≈ 10.63 ≠ 4 + 2 = 6

d45 = sqrt((11-11)^2 + (5-0)^2) = 5

r4 + r5 = 3 + 2 = 5, so tangent.

So, the tangent pairs are:

1-2, 2-3, 4-5

Hence, the graph has two connected components: {1,2,3} and {4,5}

Now, for each component, check if we can decrease the sum of radii.

First component: 1,2,3

Let's set r1' = t

From r1' + r2' = 2 => r2' = 2 - t

From r2' + r3' = 5 => r3' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (2 - t) = 3 + t

So, sum of radii: t + (2 - t) + (3 + t) = 5 + t

Original sum: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

We need 5 + t < 6 => t < 1

Also, all radii > 0:

t > 0

2 - t > 0 => t < 2

3 + t > 0 => t > -3

Combining: t < 1, t > 0

So, t can be in (0,1)

Hence, sum decreases for t in (0,1)

Second component: 4,5

Set r4' = s

From r4' + r5' = 5 => r5' = 5 - s

Sum: s + (5 - s) = 5

Original sum: 3 + 2 = 5

We need 5 < 5, which is not possible.

Hence, for this component, sum cannot be decreased.

Therefore, only the first component allows decreasing the sum.

Hence, overall, it's possible to decrease the sum by adjusting radii in the first component.

Hence, the answer is YES.

This matches the first sample.

Now, the second sample:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

Let's compute distances:

d12 = sqrt((7-2)^2 + (2-2)^2) = 5

r1 + r2 = 2 + 3 = 5, so tangent.

d13 = sqrt((7-2)^2 + (7-2)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 ≠ 2 + 2 = 4

d14 = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (7-2)^2) = 5

r1 + r4 = 2 + 3 = 5, so tangent.

d23 = sqrt((7-7)^2 + (7-2)^2) = 5

r2 + r3 = 3 + 2 = 5, so tangent.

d24 = sqrt((2-7)^2 + (7-2)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07 ≠ 3 + 3 = 6

d34 = sqrt((2-7)^2 + (7-7)^2) = 5

r3 + r4 = 2 + 3 = 5, so tangent.

Hence, all disks are connected through tangencies: 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4

So, it's one connected component.

Now, express all radii in terms of r1' = t

From r1' + r2' = 5 => r2' = 5 - t

From r1' + r4' = 5 => r4' = 5 - t

From r2' + r3' = 5 => r3' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (5 - t) = t

From r2' + r4' = 5 => r4' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (5 - t) = t

Wait, but earlier r4' = 5 - t from r1' + r4' = 5.

But from r2' + r4' = 5, r4' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (5 - t) = t

So, 5 - t = t => t = 2.5

Hence, r1' = 2.5, r2' = 2.5, r3' = 2.5, r4' = 2.5

Sum of radii: 2.5 * 4 = 10

Original sum: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10

So, sum remains the same, cannot be decreased.

Hence, NO.

This matches the second sample.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

x = [None] * n

y = [None] * n

r = [None] * n

visited = [False] * n

coef0 = [None] * n

coef1 = [None] * n

nodes = []

for i in range(n):

(x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

ok = False

for i in range(n):

if not visited[i]:

coef0[i] = 0

coef1[i] = 1

nodes = []

dfs(i)

c0 = 0

c1 = 0

for j in nodes:

c0 += coef0[j]

c1 += coef1[j]

ok = ok or c1 != 0

if ok:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

def dfs(i):

if not visited[i]:

visited[i] = True

nodes.append(i)

for j in range(n):

dx = x[i] - x[j]

dy = y[i] - y[j]

if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:

coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]

coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

dfs(j)

So, the code defines a function func_1() which reads n disks, their centers and radii, and then for each connected component, it performs a DFS to explore the component, keeping track of coefficients coef0 and coef1.

It seems to be trying to express the radii in terms of a variable, similar to what I described earlier.

In the DFS function, for each tangent pair (i,j), it sets coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], and coef1[j] = -coef1[i].

Then, after DFS, for each component, it sums coef0 and coef1 for all nodes in the component, and checks if c1 != 0.

If c1 != 0 for any component, it sets ok to True, and finally prints 'YES' if ok is True, else 'NO'.

Wait, why is it checking if c1 != 0?

From my earlier reasoning, for each component, I need to check if there exists a t such that sum(r_i') < sum(r_i), within the constraints.

In the code, coef0 seems to accumulate some constant terms, and coef1 seems to accumulate the coefficients of the variable t.

In the DFS, coef1[j] = -coef1[i], which suggests that it's alternating the sign for each step in the DFS tree.

This is similar to assigning coefficients in a system where each step inverts the sign.

At the end, summing c0 and c1 for the component, and checking if c1 != 0.

I think c1 represents the coefficient of t in the sum of radii.

If c1 != 0, it means that sum(r_i') is a linear function of t with a non-zero slope, so it can be adjusted by choosing appropriate t.

If c1 == 0, then sum(r_i') is constant, equal to c0, and we need to check if c0 < sum(r_i), but in the code, it only checks c1 != 0.

Wait, perhaps it's a shortcut.

If c1 != 0, then sum(r_i') can be adjusted by choosing t, and since it's linear, it can be made less than sum(r_i) if the slope allows it.

If c1 == 0, then sum(r_i') is constant at c0, and we can only accept if c0 < sum(r_i).

But in the code, it only checks if c1 != 0, and sets ok to True if any component has c1 != 0.

This might be an approximation.

Wait, in the first sample, for the first component, sum(r_i') = 5 + t, which has c1 = 1 != 0, so ok = True.

In the second sample, sum(r_i') = 10, which is constant, c1 = 0, so ok remains False, output 'NO'.

So, it seems to work for the samples.

But is this always correct?

Wait, suppose in a component, sum(r_i') = c0 + c1 * t, and sum(r_i) is the original sum.

To have sum(r_i') < sum(r_i), we need c0 + c1 * t < sum(r_i).

If c1 != 0, then depending on the sign of c1, we can choose t to make the inequality hold, provided that t stays within the bounds that keep all r_i' > 0.

So, if c1 != 0, it's possible to adjust t to make the sum decrease, assuming that there's a range of t where all r_i' > 0 and sum(r_i') < sum(r_i).

If c1 == 0, then sum(r_i') = c0, and we can only accept if c0 < sum(r_i).

But in the code, it only checks if c1 != 0 for any component, and sets ok to True if so.

This might not be sufficient.

Wait, in the second sample, c1 == 0 and c0 = 10, which is equal to sum(r_i) = 10, so cannot decrease.

Hence, ok remains False, correctly outputting 'NO'.

In the first sample, c1 != 0, so ok = True, outputting 'YES'.

Seems correct for these cases.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me consider a case where c1 != 0, but sum(r_i') cannot be made less than sum(r_i) within the allowed t range.

For example, suppose a component has sum(r_i') = c0 + c1 * t, and sum(r_i) = s.

If c1 > 0, then to have c0 + c1 * t < s, we need t < (s - c0)/c1.

But t also needs to be > t_min to keep all r_i' > 0.

If t_min > (s - c0)/c1, then it's not possible.

Similarly, if c1 < 0, then sum(r_i') decreases as t increases.

So, to have c0 + c1 * t < s, we need t > (s - c0)/c1.

Again, t needs to be within certain bounds to keep r_i' > 0.

So, the code's approach of just checking if c1 != 0 is not sufficient to guarantee that sum(r_i') can be made less than sum(r_i).

It's possible that c1 != 0, but the range of t where sum(r_i') < sum(r_i) does not overlap with the range where all r_i' > 0.

Hence, the code might incorrectly report 'YES' in some cases where it's actually not possible.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the samples, it works correctly.

Maybe it's generally correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the graph has a cycle or not.

Wait, perhaps it's checking for the existence of a non-zero c1 in any component, which corresponds to the component being acyclic.

Wait, in the DFS, coef1[j] = -coef1[i], which suggests that it's assigning alternating signs in the DFS tree.

If the component is a tree (acyclic), then there are no conflicts in the signs.

If there is a cycle, then the signs might conflict, leading to c1 = 0.

Wait, perhaps c1 != 0 indicates that the component is a tree, and in such components, it's possible to adjust radii to decrease the sum.

While in cyclic components, c1 = 0, and it's not possible.

Is that the case?

In the first sample, component {1,2,3} is a tree (1-2-3), and component {4,5} is an edge (4-5), which is also a tree.

But in the second sample, the component is fully connected, which might have cycles.

Wait, but in the second sample, sum(r_i') = 10, which is equal to the original sum, so c1 = 0.

Hence, perhaps c1 != 0 indicates that the component is a tree, and in such components, it's possible to decrease the sum.

While in cyclic components, c1 = 0, and it's not possible.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider a component that is a tree.

For example, a tree with 3 nodes: 1-2-3.

From earlier, sum(r_i') = 5 + t, which has c1 = 1 != 0.

Hence, it's possible to decrease the sum.

In a cycle, like a triangle: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1.

Let's see.

Set r1' = t

From r1' + r2' = d12 => r2' = d12 - t

From r2' + r3' = d23 => r3' = d23 - r2' = d23 - (d12 - t) = d23 - d12 + t

From r3' + r1' = d31 => d31 = r3' + r1' = (d23 - d12 + t) + t = d23 - d12 + 2t

Therefore, 2t = d31 - d23 + d12

Hence, t = (d31 - d23 + d12)/2

Then, sum(r_i') = t + (d12 - t) + (d23 - d12 + t) = d23 - t

But t = (d31 - d23 + d12)/2

So sum(r_i') = d23 - (d31 - d23 + d12)/2 = (2d23 - d31 + d23 - d12)/2 = (3d23 - d31 - d12)/2

This seems complicated.

But in this case, c1 = 0, since t is determined uniquely.

Hence, sum(r_i') is a constant, equal to c0.

If c0 < sum(r_i), then it's possible, else not.

But in the code, it only checks if c1 != 0, which in this case is c1 == 0, and doesn't check if c0 < sum(r_i).

Hence, the code might be incorrect in this scenario.

Therefore, the code is not fully correct, as it doesn't handle the case when c1 == 0 but c0 < sum(r_i).

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can adjust the radii of given disks such that the sum of their radii strictly decreases, while maintaining tangencies between disks that were originally tangent and ensuring no two disks overlap in a positive area.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - Represent disks as nodes in a graph.
    - Connect two nodes with an edge if their disks are tangent.

2. **Connected Components**:
    - Identify connected components in the graph using DFS.
    - For each connected component, determine if we can adjust radii to decrease the sum while maintaining tangencies.

3. **System of Equations**:
    - For each connected component, express radii in terms of a single variable `t`.
    - Check if there exists a value of `t` that makes the sum of radii strictly less than the original sum, while keeping all radii positive.

4. **Decision Making**:
    - If at least one component allows such an adjustment, output "YES".
    - Otherwise, output "NO".

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - We build a graph where each disk is a node, and edges connect tangent disks.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
    - For each connected component, perform DFS to collect nodes and their coefficients.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
    - Use coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to express radii in terms of a variable `t`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
    - For each component, calculate the sum of radii as `c0 + c1 * t`.
    - Check if `c1 != 0` (allowing adjustment) or if `c0 <` original sum.

5. **Decision**:
    - If any component allows sum decrease, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can adjust the radii of given disks such that the sum of their radii strictly decreases, while maintaining tangencies between disks that were originally tangent and ensuring no two disks overlap in a positive area.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - Represent disks as nodes in a graph.
    - Connect two nodes with an edge if their disks are tangent.

2. **Connected Components**:
    - Identify connected components in the graph using DFS.
    - For each connected component, determine if we can adjust radii to decrease the sum while maintaining tangencies.

3. **System of Equations**:
    - For each connected component, express radii in terms of a single variable `t`.
    - Check if there exists a value of `t` that makes the sum of radii strictly less than the original sum, while keeping all radii positive.

4. **Decision Making**:
    - If at least one component allows such an adjustment, output "YES".
    - Otherwise, output "NO".
