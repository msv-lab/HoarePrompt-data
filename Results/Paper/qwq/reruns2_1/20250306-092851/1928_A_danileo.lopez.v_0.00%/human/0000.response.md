Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle with dimensions a by b, both integers. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a single cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to rearrange these two smaller rectangles, possibly rotating them, to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one. The problem is to determine whether this is possible for given dimensions a and b.

First, I need to understand what it means for two rectangles to be considered different. The problem states that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle. So, the key is to see if Bob can create a new rectangle that isn't simply a rotation of the original one.

Let me think about the cutting process. Bob can make a cut parallel to either the horizontal or the vertical side. So, for example, if he has a rectangle of size a x b, he can cut it either along the length a or along the length b.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the shorter side to minimize the number of cases. But actually, since a and b are just dimensions, it might be better to assume without loss of generality that a is less than or equal to b. That way, I can standardize the input and simplify my reasoning.

Wait, actually, since the problem allows rotation, maybe the order of a and b doesn't matter. But I should keep in mind that a and b are just the sides of the rectangle, and I can treat them interchangeably.

Let's consider an example. Take a 2x6 rectangle. According to the problem, Bob can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, he can arrange these two 2x3 rectangles to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle because even though it's a rotation, the dimensions are different and it's considered a new rectangle.

Another example is a 2x1 rectangle. Cutting it results in two 1x1 squares, and rearranging them can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original by rotation. So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

From these examples, it seems that if at least one of the dimensions is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle in such a way that rearranging the pieces forms a new rectangle. In the 2x6 example, a is even (2), and in the 3x2 example, b is even (2), and in both cases, a new rectangle can be formed. In the 2x1 example, both dimensions are odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the example with a=3 and b=2, which is the same as b=2 and a=3, and 2 is even, so according to my hypothesis, it should be possible to form a new rectangle, which the problem seems to confirm.

Another example: a=2 and b=2. Cutting this into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged into a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

Similarly, a=2 and b=4: cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged into a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original by rotation, or a 1x8 rectangle if further cut, but I think in this case, it's considered the same.

Wait, but according to the problem's output, it's "Yes" for a=2 and b=4, so there must be a way to form a different rectangle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe it's sufficient that at least one of the dimensions is even for it to be possible to form a new rectangle.

Let me check the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

From this, for 1x1: No

2x1: No

2x6: Yes

3x2: Yes

2x2: Yes

2x4: Yes

6x3: No

Looking at this, it seems that whenever at least one of the dimensions is even, the answer is "Yes", except for 6x3, which is "No". But 6 is even, so why is it "No"?

Wait, 6x3 is the same as 3x6, which would be cut into two 3x3 squares, and rearranging them would only form a 3x6 or 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original by rotation. So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

Hmm, so my initial hypothesis is not entirely correct. Having at least one even dimension doesn't always guarantee that a new rectangle can be formed.

Let me think again. Maybe it's about the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. If GCD(a, b) is greater than 1, then it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, GCD(3,2)=1, and the answer is "Yes". So that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether both a and b are odd. If both are odd, then "No"; otherwise, "Yes". But in the sample input, 6x3 is "No", and 6 is even, so that doesn't hold either.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd), but the answer is "No". So my hypothesis that if at least one dimension is even, then "Yes", is incorrect.

Let me look for another approach. Perhaps I need to consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle and then rearrange the pieces.

Suppose I have a rectangle of size a x b. If I make a cut parallel to the a side, I get two rectangles of size (a/2) x b, assuming a is even. Then, I can rearrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if I cut parallel to the b side, and b is even, I get two rectangles of size a x (b/2).

But I need to ensure that the new rectangle formed from these two pieces is different from the original one, not just a rotation.

Let me consider the general case. Suppose a is even. Then I can cut the rectangle into two pieces of size (a/2) x b. Now, I can arrange these two pieces side by side to form a rectangle of size (a/2 + a/2) x b, which is the same as the original. But that doesn't give me a new rectangle.

Alternatively, I can arrange them one on top of the other, making a rectangle of size (a/2) x 2b. If 2b is different from a, then this is a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the 2x6 example, cutting into two 1x6 rectangles and arranging them to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original, or a 1x12 rectangle, which is different.

So, in this case, since a=2 is even, I can form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle.

Similarly, for a=3 and b=2, cutting parallel to the b side: since b=2 is even, cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 3x2 (same as original) or a 1x6 rectangle, which is different.

So, in both cases where at least one dimension is even, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

But in the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd. Cutting parallel to the a side: cut into two 3x3 squares, which can be arranged to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original, or a 6x3 rectangle, which is again the same by rotation. So, no new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the b side: b=3 is odd, can't be cut into two integer-sized rectangles.

Therefore, in this case, even though a is even, no new rectangle can be formed because the only way to cut it into two integer-sized rectangles results in squares that can only form the original rectangle or its rotation.

So, perhaps the condition is that both dimensions need to be even for it to be possible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a=2 is even, but no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, in that case, cutting parallel to the a side: cut into two 1x1 squares, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Cutting parallel to the b side: b=1 is odd, can't be cut.

So, in this case, even though one dimension is even, no new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, in the 6x3 case, a=6 is even, but no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2 even. Cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

So, in this case, since both dimensions are even, a new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, a=2 even, b=4 even. Cutting into two 1x4 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes" for a=2 and b=4.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought that in the 2x4 case, cutting into two 1x4 rectangles and arranging them to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4 rectangle.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But in the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3 odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps the condition is that the even dimension must be divisible by 2, and the other dimension must be such that it can be combined in a way to form a new rectangle that isn't just a rotation of the original.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a=2 is even, but no new rectangle can be formed.

In the 2x2 case, a=2 even, b=2 even, and a new rectangle can be formed.

In the 2x4 case, a=2 even, b=4 even, and a new rectangle can be formed.

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3 odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

In the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and a new rectangle can be formed.

In the 2x6 case, a=2 even, b=6 even, and a new rectangle can be formed.

In the 1x1 case, a=1 odd, b=1 odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

So, from these observations, it seems that if at least one dimension is even, and the other dimension is such that it can be combined to form a new rectangle that isn't just a rotation of the original, then "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

But in the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3 odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and a new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps the condition is that the greatest common divisor of a and b must be greater than 1 for it to be "No".

Wait, GCD(6,3)=3>1, which is "No"; GCD(3,2)=1, which is "Yes"; GCD(2,6)=2>1, which is "Yes"; GCD(2,2)=2>1, which is "Yes"; GCD(2,4)=2>1, which is "Yes"; GCD(1,1)=1, which is "No".

But this doesn't match, because in the 6x3 case, GCD=3>1, and the answer is "No"; in the 2x6 case, GCD=2>1, and the answer is "Yes".

So, perhaps it's the opposite: if GCD(a,b) >1, then "No"; else "Yes".

But that doesn't hold for the 2x2 case, where GCD=2>1, and the answer is "Yes".

Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe I need to consider the aspect ratio of the original rectangle and the new rectangle.

The original rectangle has dimensions a and b. The new rectangle has dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b, since the area must be the same.

Moreover, the new rectangle must not be simply a rotation of the original, meaning that c should not be equal to b and d should not be equal to a, considering that rotations don't change the rectangle's dimensions up to rotation.

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists another pair of integers (c,d) such that c*d = a*b, c <= d, and (c,d) is not equal to (a,b) or (b,a).

But this seems too broad, as there could be many such pairs. I need to consider the constraints imposed by the cutting process.

Wait, when Bob cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, he does so by making a single cut parallel to one of the sides. So, if he cuts parallel to the a side, he gets two rectangles of size (a/2) x b each. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b side, he gets two rectangles of size a x (b/2) each.

Then, he can arrange these two smaller rectangles in different ways: side by side, one on top of the other, or in some other configuration, possibly rotating them.

Given that rotations are allowed, I need to consider all possible ways these two smaller rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle.

Let me consider the case where a is even, so he can cut it into two rectangles of size (a/2) x b.

Now, he can arrange these two pieces in two ways: place them side by side to form a rectangle of size (a/2 + a/2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original, or place them one on top of the other to form a rectangle of size (a/2) x 2b.

Now, this new rectangle has dimensions (a/2) x 2b. Is this different from the original a x b rectangle?

Well, (a/2) x 2b simplifies to a x b, which is the same as the original. So, in this case, no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it was mentioned that from a 2x6 rectangle, you can form a 4x3 rectangle.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when arranging the two smaller rectangles, I can rotate them.

So, if I have two rectangles of size (a/2) x b, I can rotate one or both of them.

If I rotate one of them, its dimensions become b x (a/2).

Then, arranging them side by side would give a rectangle of size (a/2 + b) x b, but that might not be a valid rectangle because the sides may not match up properly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of tiling or arranging the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total area. The original rectangle has area a*b. After cutting into two smaller rectangles, each has area (a*b)/2.

Now, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange these two smaller rectangles such that their combined area is a*b, and the sides are integers.

Moreover, the new rectangle should not be the same as the original one up to rotation.

So, I need to check if there exists a pair of integers (c,d) such that c*d = a*b, c <= d, and (c,d) is not equal to (a,b) or (b,a).

But I need to ensure that this new rectangle can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

1 1: No

2 1: No

2 6: Yes

3 2: Yes

2 2: Yes

2 4: Yes

6 3: No

From this, it seems that "Yes" is returned when a and b are both even, or when one of them is even and the other is odd, but only in specific cases.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and the answer is "No".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 even, b=3 odd, and the answer is "No".

In the 3x2 case, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and the answer is "Yes".

In the 2x2 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 2x4 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 2x6 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 1x1 case, both odd, "No".

So, perhaps the condition is that the product a*b is even, meaning that at least one of them is even.

But in the 2x1 case, a*b=2 is even, but the answer is "No".

Similarly, in the 6x3 case, a*b=18 is even, and the answer is "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether a and b share a common factor other than 1.

But in the 6x3 case, GCD=3, which is greater than 1, and the answer is "No".

In the 2x2 case, GCD=2>1, and the answer is "Yes".

So, that doesn't seem consistent.

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

Case 1: both a and b are odd. Then, a*b is odd. From the sample input, 1x1: No.

Case 2: a is even, b is odd.

Subcase 2.1: a is divisible by 4, b is odd. Not in sample input.

Subcase 2.2: a is even but not divisible by 4, b is odd. Like 2x1: No, 2x3: Yes.

Wait, in the 2x3 case, which is 2x3, a=2 even, b=3 odd, and the answer is "Yes".

But in the 2x1 case, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and the answer is "No".

So, within this subcase, sometimes "Yes", sometimes "No".

Case 3: a is odd, b is even. Like 3x2: Yes.

Case 4: both a and b are even. Like 2x2: Yes, 2x4: Yes, 2x6: Yes, 6x4: Yes.

Wait, but 6x3: No, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd: No.

2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd: No.

2x3: a=2 even, b=3 odd: Yes.

3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even: Yes.

So, perhaps when a is even and b is odd, it's "Yes" only if a >= 2*b.

Wait, in the 2x3 case, a=2 < 2*3=6: "Yes".

In the 2x1 case, a=2 > 2*1=2: "No".

Wait, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" when a is even and b divides a.

In the 2x1 case, b=1 divides a=2: "No".

In the 2x3 case, b=3 does not divide a=2: "Yes".

Wait, that doesn't match.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the number of ways to tile the two smaller rectangles to form a new one.

Suppose I have two rectangles of size c x d. Then, I can arrange them in two ways: side by side or one on top of the other.

Arrangement 1: side by side -> (c + c) x d = (2c) x d

Arrangement 2: one on top of the other -> c x (d + d) = c x (2d)

Now, in the first arrangement, the new rectangle has dimensions 2c x d.

In the second arrangement, the new rectangle has dimensions c x 2d.

Now, I need to check if either of these arrangements results in a rectangle that is different from the original a x b up to rotation.

So, for arrangement 1: 2c x d

Compare to original a x b.

If 2c == a and d == b, then it's the same as the original.

If 2c == b and d == a, then it's the same as the original up to rotation.

Similarly, for arrangement 2: c x 2d

If c == a and 2d == b, then same as original.

If c == b and 2d == a, then same as original up to rotation.

So, to have a new rectangle, neither of these conditions should hold.

Now, in the context of the problem, c and d are the dimensions of the smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

If the cut is parallel to the a side, then c = a/2 and d = b.

Similarly, if the cut is parallel to the b side, then c = a and d = b/2.

So, in the first case, c = a/2, d = b.

Then, arrangement 1: 2*(a/2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

Arrangement 2: a/2 x 2b.

Now, is a/2 x 2b equal to a x b up to rotation?

If a/2 x 2b == a x b, then a/2 = a and 2b = b, which implies a = a/2 and b = 2b, which is not possible unless a=0 and b=0, which is invalid.

Alternatively, if a/2 x 2b == b x a, then a/2 = b and 2b = a.

From a/2 = b and 2b = a, we get a = 2b and 2b = a, which is consistent.

So, in this case, a/2 x 2b is the same as b x a, which is the original rectangle up to rotation.

Therefore, in this arrangement, no new rectangle is formed.

Similarly, if the cut is parallel to the b side, c = a and d = b/2.

Then, arrangement 1: 2*a x b/2 = 2a x (b/2) = a x b, same as original.

Arrangement 2: a x 2*(b/2) = a x b, same as original.

So, again, no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but this seems to suggest that no new rectangle can ever be formed, which contradicts the sample inputs.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Maybe Bob can rotate the smaller rectangles by 90 degrees when arranging them.

Let's consider that.

If Bob rotates one or both of the smaller rectangles by 90 degrees, then their dimensions swap.

So, if he has two rectangles of size c x d, after rotating one, they become c x d and d x c.

Now, arranging them side by side:

- Arrangement 1: c x d and d x c side by side.

- The combined width would be c + d, and the height would be the maximum of d and c.

Wait, actually, when arranging them side by side, the heights need to match.

So, if one is c x d and the other is d x c, then to arrange them side by side, we need to align the d side together.

So, the combined rectangle would have width c + c = 2c and height d, or width d + d = 2d and height c, depending on the orientation.

Wait, no. If one rectangle is c x d and the other is d x c, and I place them side by side with the d side aligned, then the combined rectangle would have width c + d and height d.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider specific examples.

Take a=2, b=6.

Cut parallel to a side: cut into two 1x6 rectangles.

Now, rotate one of them: so one is 1x6 and the other is 6x1.

Now, arrange them side by side:

- Option 1: place the 1x6 and 6x1 side by side with the 6 side aligned.

- This would give a combined rectangle of width 1 + 6 = 7 and height 6.

- But 7 doesn't divide a*b=12, so this isn't a valid arrangement.

- Option 2: place them side by side with the 1 side aligned.

- This would give a combined rectangle of width 6 + 1 = 7 and height 1.

- Again, area is 7, which doesn't match a*b=12.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the rectangles can be arranged.

Maybe Bob can arrange them in a more complex way, like placing one on top of the other with rotations.

Alternatively, perhaps he can arrange them in an L-shape or some other configuration.

But the problem says he can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, so likely, it's about arranging them to form a new rectangle with integer sides, not necessarily by just placing them side by side.

So, perhaps I need to consider that the two smaller rectangles can be arranged in such a way that their sides align to form a new rectangle.

Let me consider the 2x6 example again.

Original rectangle: 2x6.

Cut into two 1x6 rectangles.

Rotate one of them to become 6x1.

Now, arrange them: place one 1x6 rectangle horizontally and the other 6x1 rectangle vertically.

If I place the 1x6 rectangle horizontally and the 6x1 rectangle vertically adjacent to it, I can form a new rectangle of size 4x3.

Wait, how does that work?

Let me try to visualize it.

Suppose I have a 1x6 rectangle placed horizontally, and a 6x1 rectangle placed vertically adjacent to it.

If I place the 6x1 rectangle on top of the 1x6 rectangle, then the combined shape would be 1 + 6 = 7 units in height and 6 units in width, which is a 7x6 rectangle, but that's not a valid rectangle because the area is 42, while the original area is 12.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I can arrange them in a different way.

Suppose I place the 1x6 rectangle horizontally, and then place the 6x1 rectangle vertically adjacent to one end.

Then, the combined shape would be an L-shape, which isn't a rectangle.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to arrange them in a way that their sides match up to form a new rectangular boundary.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle by matching their sides appropriately.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider the mathematical approach.

Given that the area must remain the same, and the new rectangle must have integer sides and be different from the original up to rotation, perhaps I can look for divisors of a*b that are not equal to a or b.

But I need to ensure that such a divisor can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps the answer is "Yes" if at least one of the dimensions is even, except for specific cases like 6x3 and 2x1.

But I need a general rule.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a*b is even, meaning at least one of a or b is even.

But in the sample input, 2x1 is even, but the answer is "No".

Similarly, 6x3 is even, answer is "No"; 3x2 is even, answer is "Yes"; 2x2 is even, answer is "Yes"; 2x4 is even, answer is "Yes"; 2x6 is even, answer is "Yes"; 1x1 is odd, answer is "No".

So, it's not just about a*b being even.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" if a or b is even, except for cases where a is even and b is odd, and a < 2*b.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, a=2 < 2*1=2, which is "No".

In the 2x3 case, a=2 < 2*3=6, which is "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a=6 < 2*3=6, which is "No".

So, perhaps when a is even, and a <= 2*b, then "No"; else "Yes".

Wait, but in the 2x3 case, a=2 <= 2*3=6, which should be "No", but it's "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe when a is even and a < 2*b
