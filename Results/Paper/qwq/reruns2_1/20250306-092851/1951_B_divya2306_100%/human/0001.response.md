Alright, I've got this problem here about cows participating in a coding tournament. Each cow has a unique rating, and they compete in a series of matches where the higher-rated cow always wins. I'm supposed to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve, and I have the option to swap my cow's position with another cow's position exactly once.

First, I need to understand the tournament structure. There are n cows, each in positions 1 to n. The tournament consists of n-1 matches:

1. The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2.

2. Subsequently, each match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in position.

So, it's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner advances to the next match.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for my cow, which is cow k. I can choose to swap my cow's position with any other cow's position or choose not to swap at all.

Let me think about how the tournament progresses without any swaps. Starting with cow 1 and cow 2:

- If cow 1 has a higher rating than cow 2, cow 1 advances.

- Otherwise, cow 2 advances.

Then, the winner faces cow 3, and so on, until all cows have been included in the matches.

I need to count how many times my cow k wins in this scenario and also consider if swapping positions can lead to more wins.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

So, cow k is cow 1 with rating 12.

Let's simulate the tournament without any swaps:

- Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14). Cow 3 wins.

- Match 3: cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 3 wins.

- Match 4: cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 3 wins.

- Match 5: cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 3 wins.

So, in this case, cow 1 wins only once.

Now, let's see if swapping positions can lead to more wins for cow 1.

Suppose I swap cow 1 with cow 3.

New order: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

- Match 1: cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 2: cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 3: cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 4: cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 5: cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 1 wins.

So, cow 1 wins all 5 matches.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing, and cow 1 wins only once.

But in this swap, cow 1 wins all matches, which is better than doing nothing.

But according to the problem's example, doing nothing is better, which gives 1 win.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve."

"winning the tournament is not important; rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible."

"you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k, either by keeping it in its position or swapping it with another position.

In the first test case, according to the problem, it's optimal to do nothing, and cow 1 wins once.

But in my earlier simulation, if I swap cow 1 with cow 3, cow 1 wins all matches.

But according to the problem's example, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the swapping affects the sequence.

Let me look back at the problem description.

"The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2."

"Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1."

So, the matches are always between the next cow in position and the current winner.

If I swap cow k with another cow, their positions are exchanged, and then the tournament proceeds based on the new positions.

In the first test case, swapping cow 1 (12) with cow 3 (14):

New order: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

- Match 1: cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 2: winner so far (cow 1, 14) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 3: winner so far (cow 1, 14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 4: winner so far (cow 1, 14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 5: winner so far (cow 1, 14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 1 wins.

So, cow 1 wins all matches, which is 5 wins.

But according to the problem's example, the output is 1, meaning that doing nothing is better than swapping.

Wait, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Let me look at the problem's example again.

In the first test case:

n = 6, k = 1, a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

Output: 1

Explanation:

- Do nothing:

  - Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

  - Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14). Cow 3 wins.

  - Subsequent matches: cow 3 vs cow 4, cow 3 vs cow 5, cow 3 vs cow 6. Cow 3 wins all.

  - So, cow 1 wins only once.

- If we swap cow 1 and cow 3:

  - New order: [14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]

  - Match 1: cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

  - Match 2: cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 1 wins.

  - Match 3: cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 1 wins.

  - Match 4: cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 1 wins.

  - Match 5: cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 1 wins.

  - So, cow 1 wins 4 matches.

But according to the problem's example, it's better to do nothing and have cow 1 win only once.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The problem's example says:

"In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. ... In total, your cow wins 1 match."

But according to my simulation, swapping cow 1 and cow 3 leads to cow 1 winning 4 matches, which is better than 1.

There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve."

In the first test case, the output is 1, but according to my simulation, swapping leads to 4 wins.

So, perhaps the problem is that after swapping, cow k is now in a different position, and I need to track the original cow k's wins, not the new position's wins.

Wait, no. The problem says:

"you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, I'm swapping my cow k with another cow, meaning that my cow k is now in a different position.

In the first test case, cow k is cow 1. If I swap cow 1 with cow 3, cow k is now in position 3 with rating 12.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the original cow k, not its rating.

Wait, no. The problem says:

"the position of your cow"

So, by swapping positions, my cow k is now in a different position.

In the first test case, if I swap cow 1 (12) with cow 3 (14), then cow k is now in position 3 with rating 14.

Wait, but in the simulation I did earlier, I assumed that cow k is still cow 1, but now with rating 14.

But perhaps I need to track the original cow k, which is cow 1, regardless of its rating.

Wait, no. The problem is to maximize the number of wins for cow k, considering that cow k is now in a different position after the swap.

I think I'm getting confused.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"the owner of cow k"

"you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

"Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve."

So, I have cow k, and I can choose to swap its position with any other cow's position or do nothing.

Then, in the tournament, I need to count how many times my cow k wins, considering its new position if I choose to swap.

In the first test case:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

If I do nothing:

- cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

- cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14): cow 3 wins.

- cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (11): cow 3 wins.

- cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8): cow 3 wins.

- cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3): cow 3 wins.

So, cow 1 wins only once.

If I swap cow 1 with cow 3:

- new order: [14,10,12,11,8,3]

- cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

- cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12): cow 1 wins.

- cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11): cow 1 wins.

- cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8): cow 1 wins.

- cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3): cow 1 wins.

So, cow 1 wins 4 times.

But according to the problem's example, the output is 1, meaning that doing nothing is better.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm misunderstanding which cow is considered as cow k after the swap.

Wait, perhaps after swapping, cow k is now in the position of cow 3, but it's still cow k, with its new rating.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- Initially, cow k is cow 1 with rating 12.

- If I swap cow 1 and cow 3, then cow 1 is now in position 3 with rating 14, and cow 3 is in position 1 with rating 12.

Wait, no. Swapping positions means that cow 1 and cow 3 exchange positions.

So, in the new order:

- Position 1: cow 3 with rating 14

- Position 2: cow 2 with rating 10

- Position 3: cow 1 with rating 12

- Position 4: cow 4 with rating 11

- Position 5: cow 5 with rating 8

- Position 6: cow 6 with rating 3

So, now, cow k (original cow 1) is in position 3 with rating 12.

Now, let's simulate the tournament:

- Match 1: position 1 (14) vs position 2 (10): position 1 wins.

- Match 2: winner (position 1, 14) vs position 3 (12): position 1 wins.

- Match 3: winner (position 1, 14) vs position 4 (11): position 1 wins.

- Match 4: winner (position 1, 14) vs position 5 (8): position 1 wins.

- Match 5: winner (position 1, 14) vs position 6 (3): position 1 wins.

So, cow k (now in position 3 with rating 12) doesn't win any matches in this scenario.

Wait, but according to the problem's explanation in the first test case, swapping to position 3 leads to 2 wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a different position to swap.

Wait, no. The problem says, in the first test case, it's optimal to do nothing, resulting in 1 win.

In the second test case, it's optimal to swap cow k (cow 5) with cow 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider swapping cow k with a specific cow to maximize its wins.

Let me look at the second test case:

n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Output: 2

Explanation:

- Swap cow 5 (12) with cow 3 (727)

- New order: [7,2,12,10,727,13]

- Match 1: position 1 (7) vs position 2 (2): position 1 wins.

- Match 2: winner (position 1,7) vs position 3 (12): position 3 wins.

- Match 3: position 3 (12) vs position 4 (10): position 3 wins.

- Match 4: position 3 (12) vs position 5 (727): position 5 wins.

- Match 5: position 5 (727) vs position 6 (13): position 5 wins.

So, cow k (original cow 5 with rating 12, now in position 3) wins twice.

Hence, the output is 2.

So, in this case, swapping leads to 2 wins, which is better than doing nothing.

But in the first test case, swapping leads to 0 wins, which is worse than doing nothing and getting 1 win.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, in the first test case, swapping leads to 1 win, which is the same as doing nothing.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k, either by keeping it in its position or swapping it with another position.

I need to find the maximum possible number of wins cow k can achieve.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, consider not swapping: calculate how many wins cow k achieves in the original order.

Second, consider swapping cow k with each possible position and calculate the wins for cow k in each case, then take the maximum.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, this approach is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the tournament process.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner of the previous match plays against the next cow in position.

The first match is between position 1 and position 2.

Then, the winner plays against position 3, and so on.

So, the path that cow k can take to win matches depends on how it reaches the winner's position.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

Option 1: Keep cow k in its original position and see how many wins it can achieve.

Option 2: Swap cow k with another position and see how many wins it can achieve in the new position.

I need to choose the option that gives the maximum number of wins for cow k.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner advances, so the sequence of winners forms a path through the cows.

I need to find a position where, after swapping cow k there, it can win as many matches as possible before losing.

I need to find a position where cow k has the highest possible rating compared to the cows it will face.

Wait, perhaps I can find the longest sequence of cows with lower ratings than cow k, starting from some position.

But it's more complicated because of the tournament structure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position where I place cow k, and then simulate the tournament to see how many wins cow k can achieve.

I need to do this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum number of wins by finding the longest sequence where cow k's rating is higher than the previous winners.

I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me look at the given program and try to understand what it's doing.

Given program:

for each test case:

read n, k

read a as list of ratings

wins = 0

for i in range(n):

if a[i] > a[k-1]:

break

wins +=1

if wins >=k:

print(wins-1)

return

win_with_swap = wins +1

for i in range(win_with_swap, k-1):

if a[i] > a[k-1]:

break

win_with_swap +=1

print(max(wins-1, win_with_swap - wins -1 + (wins !=0)))

I need to understand what this code is trying to do.

First, it calculates "wins" which is the number of cows before cow k that have a lower rating than cow k.

Wait, no.

It iterates through all cows from position 0 to n-1, and counts how many have a lower rating than cow k.

But actually, it's iterating from the start and counting how many cows have a lower rating than cow k.

Then, if wins >= k, it prints wins -1.

Otherwise, it calculates win_with_swap as wins +1, then iterates from win_with_swap to k-2 and counts how many cows have a lower rating than cow k, adding to win_with_swap.

Finally, it prints the maximum of (wins -1, win_with_swap - wins -1 + (wins !=0))

This seems overly complicated and confusing.

I think there must be a better way to approach this problem.

Let me try to think about the tournament structure more carefully.

The tournament can be represented as a sequence of matches where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, the winner advances to the next match.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k, either by keeping it in its position or by swapping it with another position.

Let me consider the case where I don't swap cow k.

In this case, I need to see how many matches cow k can win in the original sequence.

To do this, I need to see if cow k can reach the position where it can participate in the matches.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, cow k can only win if it faces cows with lower ratings.

So, in the original sequence, cow k can win against all the cows that have lower ratings and are positioned in such a way that cow k gets to face them.

This seems tricky to calculate directly.

Let me consider the case where I swap cow k with another position.

Suppose I swap cow k with cow p.

Then, cow k is now in position p, and the tournament proceeds accordingly.

I need to calculate how many wins cow k can achieve from position p.

Again, cow k can win against all cows with lower ratings that it faces.

So, I need to find a position p such that cow k, being in position p, can face as many cows with lower ratings as possible before facing a cow with higher rating.

This seems similar to finding the longest sequence of cows with lower ratings than cow k, starting from some position.

But I need to consider the tournament structure, where the winner advances to the next match.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose I place cow k in position p.

Then, cow k will participate in the tournament starting from position p.

It will first face the winner of the previous matches.

If cow k wins against the previous winner, it advances to face the next cow in position.

This continues as long as cow k wins.

So, the number of wins cow k achieves is equal to the number of cows in positions after p (including p) that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with higher rating.

Wait, but it's not exactly that, because the previous winner might have a higher rating than cow k, even if the cows in positions after p have lower ratings.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match is the higher-rated cow.

So, the tournament can be seen as a sequence of matches where the winner is determined by the higher rating.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k, which means I need to maximize the number of matches where cow k wins.

To do that, I need to position cow k in such a way that it faces as many cows with lower ratings as possible before facing a cow with higher rating.

So, the idea is to place cow k in a position where the cows before it have lower ratings, and the first cow with higher rating is as far as possible.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, the previous winners affect who cow k faces.

This is still confusing.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider the tournament as a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

So, starting from position 1 and position 2.

The winner of position 1 vs position 2 then faces position 3, and so on.

If I swap cow k with position p, then cow k is in position p, and the tournament proceeds accordingly.

I need to calculate, for each possible position p, the number of wins cow k can achieve if placed in position p.

Then, I can choose the position p that maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, this is too slow.

I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of wins for cow
