Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell, which is (1,1), and it wants to reach the bottom-right cell, which is (2,N). The grasshopper can only move one cell right or one cell down. For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along that path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string when comparing them as if they were words in a dictionary. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means that when comparing two strings, the one that has a '0' where the other has a '1' at the first differing position is smaller.

Okay, so to find the smallest possible string, I need to choose a path where the sequence of cells picked results in the smallest possible sequence when read left to right.

Given that the grid has only two rows, the paths are relatively straightforward. From (1,1), the grasshopper can either move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1). Then, it continues moving right or down until it reaches (2,N).

I think I can model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and there are edges to the right and down neighbors. Then, I need to find the path that gives the smallest sequence.

But that might be too slow, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5, and there are up to 10^4 test cases. So, I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think about how the path progresses. At each step, the grasshopper has two choices: move right or move down, except when it's at the bottom row or the rightmost column.

Wait, actually, in this problem, since it's a 2xN grid, the grasshopper can only move right or down, and the destination is (2,N), which is at the bottom-right.

So, in terms of the path, it has to make exactly N moves to the right and 1 move down, but the down move can be at any point during the path.

Wait, no. Actually, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), it needs to make (N-1) moves to the right and 1 move down. Wait, no, it needs to make (N-1) moves to the right and 1 move down, but the down move can be at any point in the path.

Wait, actually, more carefully: to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make a total of (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any point in the path, as long as the sequence of moves takes it to (2,N).

Wait, actually, in a 2xN grid, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, and the down move can be at any point in the path, but the position where the down move happens determines the path.

Wait, perhaps a better way to think about it is to consider that the path can be represented by the sequence of cells it visits, and since it can only move right or down, the path is uniquely determined by the column where it decides to move down.

Wait, actually, no. In a 2xN grid, the grasshopper starts at (1,1). At each step, it can either move right to the next column in the same row or move down to the other row in the same column.

So, for each column from 1 to N-1, the grasshopper can choose to stay in the current row or move down to the other row.

In the last column, it must end at (2,N), so if it's not already in row 2, it has to move down to (2,N).

So, the path can be thought of as a sequence of choices: for each column from 1 to N-1, choose whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which rows are chosen for each column.

So, for column 1: start at row 1.

For column 2: choose to stay in row 1 or move down to row 2.

And so on, up to column N.

In the last column, must be in row 2.

So, the path can be represented by the sequence of rows chosen for each column, starting from row 1 in column 1 and ending in row 2 in column N.

Now, the string is constructed by concatenating the values in the cells in the order they are visited.

So, to get the lexicographically smallest string, I need to choose the path where the sequence of cell values is the smallest possible.

To achieve this, I should try to pick '0's as early as possible in the path.

Wait, but it's not just about picking '0's early; it's about the entire sequence being lexicographically smallest.

So, at each step, I should choose the path that allows the smallest possible character at that position in the string.

Wait, but the string is built by following the path, so the order matters.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think of it as building the string step by step, always choosing the smallest possible character at each step, given the choices available.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach would work here.

Let me consider that.

At each step, I have a current position, and I can choose to move right or down.

I should choose the direction that leads to the smallest possible string from that point on.

To make this more concrete, perhaps I can consider the following:

- At each step, I look at the next possible cells I can move to, and I choose the one that gives the smallest possible extension to the string.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire remaining path.

This might be too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the structure of the grid.

Since there are only two rows, I can model the problem as a sequence of columns, each containing two possible cells (one in each row), and the grasshopper can choose to stay in the same row or switch rows at each column.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a sequence of choices: for each column, choose which row to be in, starting from row 1 in column 1 and ending in row 2 in column N.

Then, the string is the sequence of values in the chosen cells in order.

I need to find the path that gives the lexicographically smallest string.

I think a greedy approach might work here.

Let me try to think of it step by step.

Start at (1,1). The first character in the string is a_{11}.

Then, I have a choice: move right to (1,2) or move down to (2,1).

I need to choose the direction that leads to the smallest possible string.

So, I should look ahead and see which choice gives the smallest sequence.

This seems tricky, but maybe I can make a local decision at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can decide at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch rows, based on which choice gives the smallest next character.

But I need to consider the entire path.

Wait, maybe I can find a point where switching rows gives a better string, and then stick with that choice.

But I need a more systematic way.

Let me consider that since there are only two rows, the path can be described by the points where the grasshopper switches rows.

Starting in row 1, if it never switches, it would stay in row 1 until column N and then have to switch to row 2 in the last step.

But it needs to end in row 2, so it has to switch to row 2 at some point.

So, the path is defined by the column where it switches to row 2 and then continues right to column N in row 2.

Wait, that might not be entirely accurate because it can switch rows multiple times.

Wait, actually, no. If it switches to row 2 at some column, it can still choose to switch back to row 1 in the next column, but it must end in row 2.

But in this problem, since the cost is only in terms of the string formed by the cells' values, and not the number of switches, maybe multiple switches are allowed.

Wait, actually, there's no restriction on the number of switches; the grasshopper can switch rows multiple times as long as it ends in row 2.

But, in practice, switching back and forth might not lead to the smallest string.

I need to find a way to minimize the string.

Perhaps, I can think of it as: try to stay in row 1 as long as possible, but switch to row 2 early if it leads to a smaller string.

Wait, but that might not always be the case.

Wait, maybe I should look for the leftmost position where row 2 has a smaller value than row 1.

Wait, perhaps more precisely: at each step, choose to stay in the current row unless switching to the other row gives a smaller value in the current column, considering the future columns as well.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I can formalize it.

Let me define that the grasshopper is in row r at column c.

It can move to row r at column c+1 or to the other row at column c+1.

I need to choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can define it recursively.

Define a function that, given the current row and column, returns the smallest possible string from that point to (2,N).

But with N up to 2*10^5, this would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the path can be represented by the sequence of rows chosen for each column, starting from row 1 at column 1 and ending in row 2 at column N.

So, for columns 1 to N-1, the grasshopper can be in row 1 or row 2, and in column N, it must be in row 2.

I need to choose for each column from 1 to N-1 whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, such that the sequence of values in the cells is lexicographically smallest.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, keeping track of the current row, and at each column, decide whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, based on which choice gives the smallest possible extension to the string.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the path starting at (1,1).

At each column, choose to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, picking the option that gives the smallest possible next character in the string.

If both options give the same next character, choose the one that allows staying in the same row, or perhaps the one that is smaller in the subsequent columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to look ahead to decide.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each column c and each row r, what is the smallest possible string from column c in row r to column N in row 2.

Then, starting from column 1 in row 1, I can choose at each step the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, precomputing for each column and row might still be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that since there are only two rows, I can keep track of which row gives the smaller value at each column, considering the possibility of switching rows.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, keeping track of the current row, and at each column, decide whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, based on which choice gives the smaller value in that column.

But I need to consider that switching rows might affect the choices in the future columns.

Wait, maybe I can find a point where switching to row 2 is beneficial, and then stay in row 2.

But this might not always be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first column where row 2 has a smaller value than row 1, and switch there.

But what if row 2 has a larger value, but in the next columns, it has smaller values?

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimum possible string by choosing to stay or switch at each step.

Let me try to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Define dp[c][r] as the smallest string from column c in row r to column N in row 2.

Then, I can compute dp[c][r] recursively:

dp[c][r] = min(a[r][c] + dp[c+1][r], a[3-r][c] + dp[c+1][3-r])

But with N up to 2*10^5, this would be O(N), which is acceptable, but perhaps there's a way to do it without DP.

Wait, maybe I can simulate the path step by step, always choosing the smallest available value at each step.

But I need to ensure that I reach row 2 at column N.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, keeping track of the current row, and at each column, choose to stay or switch based on which choice gives the smallest possible string from that point on.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching to row 2 is beneficial.

Let me consider that.

Start in row 1 at column 1.

At each column, if row 2 has a smaller value than row 1, switch to row 2.

Otherwise, stay in row 1.

Continue this until column N.

But this might not always give the smallest string because switching early might lead to larger values in subsequent columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to look ahead one step.

Wait, maybe I can compare the values in row 1 and row 2 for the current column and the next column.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of whether I'm in row 1 or row 2, and at each step, decide to stay or switch based on which choice gives the smallest possible extension to the string.

This sounds similar to the DP approach but without storing the entire DP table.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize in row 1 at column 1.

At each column c from 1 to N-1:

- Option 1: stay in current row r, choose a[r][c] and move to a[r][c+1]

- Option 2: switch to the other row (3-r), choose a[r][c] and a[3-r][c+1]

Wait, no.

Actually, when moving right, you stay in the same row.

When moving down, you switch to the other row in the same column.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify the movement options.

From cell (r,c), the grasshopper can:

- Move right to (r, c+1)

- Move down to (3-r, c)

Wait, no.

Actually, in a 2xN grid, the rows are 1 and 2.

So, moving right from (r,c) goes to (r, c+1).

Moving down from (r,c) goes to (3-r, c).

Wait, actually, moving down from row 1 goes to row 2 in the same column, and moving down from row 2 goes to row 1 in the same column.

But in this problem, it's a grid where you can move right or down, but in this grid, "down" likely means moving to the other row in the same column.

Wait, no, in standard grid terms, "down" would mean moving to the next row in the same column.

But in this problem, since it's a 2xN grid, moving down from row 1 to row 2 in the same column, or moving right to the next column in the same row.

So, from (1,c), can move to (1,c+1) or (2,c).

From (2,c), can move to (2,c+1) or (1,c).

But the destination is (2,N), so must end in row 2, column N.

I need to find the path from (1,1) to (2,N) where the sequence of cells' values is lexicographically smallest.

I need a way to decide at each step whether to move right or down.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from 1 to N, keeping track of the current row, and decide at each column whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide to switch rows only when it leads to a smaller string.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the columns where I switch rows.

Then, the path is determined by the sequence of switch columns.

I need to choose the sequence of switch columns that leads to the smallest possible string.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the path can have at most one switch, because switching back would not lead to a smaller string.

But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps multiple switches can lead to a smaller string in some cases.

Let me look at the first test case:

N=2

a = 00

b = 00

So, grid:

Row 1: 0 0

Row 2: 0 0

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string 000

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string 000

Both paths give the same string 000, which is the smallest possible.

Number of paths yielding this string: 2

Second test case:

N=4

a = 1101

b = 1100

Grid:

Row 1: 1 1 0 1

Row 2: 1 1 0 0

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): string 11010

2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string 11000

3. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string 11000

4. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string 11000

So, the smallest string is 11000, and there are three paths that yield this string.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's only one path.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample output for the second test case, it's 11000 and 1.

Wait, perhaps only one path yields the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, let's see:

Path 1: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): string 11010

Path 2: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string 11000

Path 3: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): string 11100

Wait, no, let's see:

- Path 1: (1,1)=1 -> (1,2)=1 -> (1,3)=0 -> (1,4)=1 -> (2,4)=0 -> string 11010

- Path 2: (1,1)=1 -> (1,2)=1 -> (1,3)=0 -> (2,3)=0 -> (2,4)=0 -> string 11000

- Path 3: (1,1)=1 -> (1,2)=1 -> (2,2)=1 -> (2,3)=0 -> (2,4)=0 -> string 11100

- Path 4: (1,1)=1 -> (2,1)=1 -> (2,2)=1 -> (2,3)=0 -> (2,4)=0 -> string 11100

So, only one path gives 11000: Path 2.

Hence, the number of paths is 1.

Got it.

So, in this case, only one path yields the smallest string.

Now, for the third test case:

N=8

a = 00100111

b = 11101101

Grid:

Row 1: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

Row 2: 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

Possible paths:

There are multiple paths, but according to the sample output, the smallest string is 001001101, and there are 4 paths yielding this string.

I need to find a general way to determine the smallest string and count the number of paths that yield it.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, preferably O(N) per test case.

Let me think about how to construct the smallest string.

Start at (1,1)=0.

Option 1: move right to (1,2)=0

Option 2: move down to (2,1)=1

Comparing:

- If I move right to (1,2)=0, the next character is 0.

- If I move down to (2,1)=1, the next character is 1.

Since 0 < 1, I should move right to (1,2)=0.

Now, at (1,2)=0.

Option 1: move right to (1,3)=1

Option 2: move down to (2,2)=1

Comparing:

- Move right: string so far 001

- Move down: string so far 001

Both give the same next character, so I should choose the one that leads to the smallest string.

Wait, but I need to look ahead.

Wait, perhaps I need to compare not just the immediate next character but also consider the subsequent characters.

Wait, perhaps I need to compare the values in the next column for both possible choices.

Wait, maybe I can compare a[1][c+1] and b[1][c], and choose the smaller one.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row based on which choice gives the smallest possible extension to the string.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize in row 1 at column 1.

At each column c from 1 to N-1:

- If I stay in the current row r, the next character is a[r][c+1]

- If I switch to the other row (3-r), the next character is a[3-r][c]

Choose the option with the smaller next character.

If both are equal, choose the one that allows staying in the same row or switching based on some criterion.

Wait, perhaps if both next characters are equal, choose the one that allows staying in the same row to maximize the number of paths.

But I need to focus on finding the smallest string first.

Once I have the smallest string, then I need to count the number of paths that yield it.

Perhaps I can construct the smallest string first, and then count the number of paths that produce it.

To construct the smallest string:

Start at (1,1).

At each step, choose to move right in the current row or down to the other row, picking the option that gives the smallest possible next character.

If both options give the same next character, choose the one that allows staying in the same row.

Wait, but I need to ensure that I reach row 2 at column N.

So, perhaps I need to look ahead to column N and ensure that I end up in row 2.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay or switch, always choosing the smallest possible next character, and ensuring that I switch to row 2 at the latest possible column.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current row, and decide at each column whether to stay or switch based on which choice gives the smallest possible string.

Let me try to implement this idea step by step.

Initialize:

- current_row = 1

- string = a[1][1]

For column c from 1 to N-1:

- option1: stay in current_row, next character a[current_row][c+1]

- option2: switch to 3 - current_row, next character a[3 - current_row][c]

- choose the option with the smaller next character

- if both are equal, choose to stay in the current row

- append the chosen next character to the string

- update current_row based on the choice

Finally, append a[2][N] to the string.

This seems plausible.

Let me test this idea with the second test case.

N=4

a = 1101

b = 1100

Start at (1,1)=1

current_row = 1

string = '1'

Column 1:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][2]=1

option2: switch to row2, next character b[1]=1

Both equal, so stay in row1

string += '1'

current_row = 1

Column 2:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][3]=0

option2: switch to row2, next character b[2]=1

0 < 1, so switch to row2

string += '0'

current_row = 2

Column 3:

option1: stay in row2, next character a[2][4]=0

option2: switch to row1, next character b[3]=0

Both equal, so stay in row2

string += '0'

current_row = 2

Finally, append a[2][4]=0 to the string

Total string: '11000'

Which matches the sample output.

Now, for the first test case:

N=2

a = 00

b = 00

Start at (1,1)=0

current_row = 1

string = '0'

Column 1:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][2]=0

option2: switch to row2, next character b[1]=0

Both equal, stay in row1

string += '0'

current_row = 1

Column 2:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][3]= None (out of bounds)

option2: switch to row2, next character b[2]=0

So, choose to switch to row2

string += '0'

current_row = 2

Finally, append a[2][2]=0 to the string

Total string: '000'

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, for the third test case:

N=8

a = 00100111

b = 11101101

Start at (1,1)=0

current_row = 1

string = '0'

Column 1:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][2]=0

option2: switch to row2, next character b[1]=1

0 < 1, so stay in row1

string += '0'

current_row = 1

Column 2:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][3]=1

option2: switch to row2, next character b[2]=1

Both equal, stay in row1

string += '1'

current_row = 1

Column 3:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][4]=0

option2: switch to row2, next character b[3]=1

0 < 1, so stay in row1

string += '0'

current_row = 1

Column 4:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][5]=0

option2: switch to row2, next character b[4]=0

Both equal, stay in row1

string += '0'

current_row = 1

Column 5:

option1: stay in row1, next character a[1][6]=1

option2: switch to row2, next character b[5]=1

Both equal, stay in row1

string += '1'

current_row = 1

Column 6:

option1: stay in row
