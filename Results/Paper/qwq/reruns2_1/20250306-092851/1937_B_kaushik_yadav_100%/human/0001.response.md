Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. The goal is to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N), and along the way, collect the binary digits in the cells of the path to form a string. I need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible and also count how many paths produce this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string in dictionary order. So, for example, between "010" and "001", "001" is smaller because the second character is smaller.

Now, the grasshopper can move right or down, so from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1), and so on, until it reaches (2,N). Each path will correspond to a sequence of cells, and hence a binary string.

My task is to find the smallest such string and count how many paths produce it.

Looking at the first test case:

n=2

a=00

b=00

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string = 0 + 0 + 0 = 000

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string = 0 + 0 + 0 = 000

Both paths give the same string "000", which is the smallest possible.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=1101

b=1100

Possible paths and their strings:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+1+0=11010

2. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

3. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

4. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

So, the smallest string is "11000", and there's only one path that gives this string directly, but actually, looking back, it seems multiple paths can give "11000". Wait, in the example output, it says there's only one path that yields "11000". Let me check that again.

Wait, in the example explanation for the second test case, it says there's only one path that yields "11000". So, perhaps I miscounted. Let's see:

Path 1: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+1+0=11010

Path 2: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

Path 3: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

Path 4: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

So, actually, three paths give "11000", but the example says only one path yields it. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the path that goes through (1,4) Appends an extra 0 from b[4], making it "11010", while the other paths that go directly down after (1,3) give "11000". So, perhaps the path that goes right to (1,4) and then down to (2,4) Appends b[4], which is 0, making it "11010". While the paths that go down earlier append the 0 from b[3], making "11000". So, indeed, only the paths that avoid going right to (1,4) give "11000". But according to the example, there's only one path that yields "11000". Wait, maybe I need to look at the specific movements.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when moving right from (1,3) to (1,4), it Appends a_{14}=1, and then moving down to (2,4) Appends b_{4}=0, making the string end with "10". While moving down from (1,3) to (2,3) Appends b_{3}=0, and then moving right to (2,4) Appends b_{4}=0, making the string end with "00". Hence, "00" is lexicographically smaller than "10", so the path that avoids going right to (1,4) gives the smaller string.

Wait, but in this case, all paths that don't go right to (1,4) give "11000", and the one that does go to (1,4) gives "11010", which is larger. So, "11000" is smaller, and there are multiple paths that give it. But the example says only one path yields it. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the path that goes (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4) gives "11000", and the path (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4) also gives "11000", but perhaps in this specific grid, they are considered different, but the strings are the same. Wait, no, in this case, they are the same string.

I need to carefully read the problem statement again.

"Consider the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So, for n=4, the string should have length 5.

In the second test case:

a = 1101

b = 1100

Paths:

1. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4): string = a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+b[4] = 1+1+0+1+0=11010

2. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+0+0+0=11000

3. (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = a[1]+a[2]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+0+0+0=11000

4. (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string = a[1]+b[1]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+0+0+0=11000

So, indeed, three paths give "11000", and one path gives "11010". But the example says only one path yields "11000". Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the strings are constructed. Let's look at the first test case:

n=2

a=00

b=00

Possible paths:

1. (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2): string = a[1]+a[2]+b[2]=0+0+0=000

2. (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2): string = a[1]+b[1]+b[2]=0+0+0=000

So, both paths give "000", which matches the first example.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=1101

b=1100

Paths:

1. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4): 1+1+0+1+0=11010

2. (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

3. (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

4. (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

So, three paths give "11000", and one gives "11010". But the example output says:

11000

1

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the path that goes to (1,4) and then down to (2,4) Appends b[4], but in the grid, b[4]=0, so it's "11010". But in the explanation, it seems like only one path yields "11000", but according to my counting, three paths do.

Maybe I need to look at the grid again. Wait, perhaps the path that goes (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4) gives "11000", and the path (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4) also gives "11000", and the path (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4) also gives "11000". So, three paths give "11000". But the example says only one path yields it. Maybe there's a miscount.

Wait, perhaps in the specific grid of the second test case, only one path actually gives "11000". Maybe I need to check the grid values again.

Wait, a=1101, b=1100.

So, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=0, a[4]=1

b[1]=1, b[2]=1, b[3]=0, b[4]=0

So, path (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4): 1+1+0+1+0=11010

Path (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

Path (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+1+0+0=11100 (Wait, a[2]=1, b[2]=1, b[3]=0, b[4]=0)

Wait, in this path: (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): a[1]+a[2]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+1+0+0=11100, which is larger than "11000". So, this path gives "11100", not "11000". My mistake.

Similarly, path (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): a[1]+b[1]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+1+0+0=11100

So, only one path gives "11000", which is (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): 1+1+0+0+0=11000

Hence, only one path yields "11000", which matches the example.

So, I need a way to find the smallest possible string and count how many paths produce it.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the smallest possible string. To do that, at each step, I should choose the smallest possible digit to append to the string.

Given that the grasshopper can move right or down, I need to decide at each step whether to move right or down, choosing the path that leads to the smallest possible string.

One way to think about this is to always choose the path that gives the smallest current digit, considering the future possibilities.

But it's not straightforward because choosing a smaller digit now might lead to a larger digit later, which could make the overall string larger.

Wait, perhaps I can greedily choose the smallest available digit at each step, looking ahead to ensure that I don't close off better options.

Let me consider dynamic programming approach.

Define dp[i][j] as the smallest string from (i,j) to (2,N).

But since N can be up to 2e5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Looking at the constraints, the grid has only two rows, which might allow for a simpler solution.

Perhaps I can simulate the path, always choosing the smallest possible digit at each step, considering the possible moves.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize an empty string.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, consider the possible moves: right or down.

Choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Keep track of the number of paths that lead to this smallest string.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing the smallest digit at each step, because the order matters.

Let me think differently.

Imagine that the path is determined by the sequence of moves: right (R) and down (D).

In total, there are n-1 rights and 1 down, making n moves in total.

But wait, no. To go from (1,1) to (2,n), the grasshopper needs to make exactly one down move and n-1 right moves, but the order matters.

Wait, actually, the grasshopper needs to make exactly one down move, but it can be at any step between the first and the last.

Wait, no, actually, the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (2,n), so it needs to make exactly one down move at some point, and the rest are right moves.

Wait, but in reality, the grasshopper can make multiple down moves if n > 2.

Wait, no, actually, since there are only two rows, the grasshopper can only make at most one down move.

Wait, no, it can make multiple down moves, but in this grid, there are only two rows, so effectively, it can make at most one down move.

Wait, actually, from row 1, it can only move down to row 2, and from row 2, it can only move right.

So, in this grid, the grasshopper can make at most one down move.

Wait, no, from row 1, it can move right or down, and from row 2, it can only move right.

Hence, the path consists of moving right in row 1 as much as desired, then moving down to row 2 at some column, and then moving right in row 2 to reach column n.

Hence, the path is determined by the column where the down move occurs.

So, the grasshopper can choose to move down at any column from 1 to n.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, and there are two paths: down first, then right; or right first, then down.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=4, and there are four possible down moves: at column 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Hence, the number of paths is equal to n, since the down move can be at any column from 1 to n.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, and there are two paths, which matches.

In the second test case, n=4, and there are four possible down moves, but in the example, it says there's only one path that yields the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps not all down moves lead to distinct strings.

In the second test case:

- Down at column 1: a[1]+b[1]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+1+0+0=11100

- Down at column 2: a[1]+a[2]+b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+1+0+0=11100

- Down at column 3: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+b[3]+b[4]=1+1+0+0+0=11000

- Down at column 4: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+b[4]=1+1+0+1+0=11010

Hence, only down at column 3 gives "11000", which is the smallest string, and down at column 4 gives "11010", which is larger.

Hence, only one path yields "11000".

Wait, but in my earlier miscount, I thought there were three paths giving "11000", but actually, only one down move at column 3 gives "11000", and other paths give larger strings.

Hence, the number of paths that yield the smallest string is equal to the number of down moves that lead to that smallest string.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- For each possible down move column k (from 1 to n), construct the string: a[1] to a[k] + b[k] to b[n]

- Find the smallest such string and count how many down moves lead to that string.

Wait, but in the second test case, down at column 3 gives "11000", and down at column 4 gives "11010", which is larger, and down at columns 1 and 2 give "11100", which is larger than "11000". Hence, only one down move leads to "11000".

Hence, the smallest string is "11000", and only one path yields it.

Similarly, in the first test case, down at column 1: a[1]+b[1]+b[2]=0+0+0=000

Down at column 2: a[1]+a[2]+b[2]=0+0+0=000

Hence, both down moves at columns 1 and 2 give "000", so two paths yield the smallest string.

In the third test case:

n=8

a=00100111

b=11101101

Possible down moves:

- Down at column 1: a[1]+b[1} to b[8}=0 + 11101101 = 011101101

- Down at column 2: a[1]+a[2]+b[2} to b[8}=0+0+1101101=001101101

- Down at column 3: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+b[3} to b[8}=0+0+1+101101=001101101

- Down at column 4: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+b[4} to b[8}=0+0+1+0+1101=00101101

- Down at column 5: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+a[5]+b[5} to b[8}=0+0+1+0+0+1101=001001101

- Down at column 6: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+a[5]+a[6]+b[6} to b[8}=0+0+1+0+0+1+101=001001101

- Down at column 7: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+a[5]+a[6]+a[7]+b[7} to b[8}=0+0+1+0+0+1+1+1=00100111

- Down at column 8: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+a[5]+a[6]+a[7]+a[8]+b[8}=0+0+1+0+0+1+1+1+1=001001111

Among these:

- "001001101" is the smallest string, achieved by down moves at columns 5 and 6.

Hence, the smallest string is "001001101", and there are two paths that yield it.

Wait, but the example output says there are four paths that yield it. So perhaps I missed some.

Wait, let's see:

- Down at column 5: a[1] to a[5] + b[5} to b[8}=00100 + 1101=001001101

- Down at column 6: a[1] to a[6} + b[6} to b[8}=001001 + 1101=001001101

- Down at column 7: a[1] to a[7} + b[7} to b[8}=0010011 + 1=00100111

- Down at column 8: a[1] to a[8} + b[8}=00100111 + 1=001001111

So, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

But the example output says there are four paths that yield this string.

Wait, perhaps there are more ways to achieve "001001101".

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make multiple down moves, but given that there are only two rows, it can only make one down move.

Wait, no, from row 1, it can move right or down to row 2, and from row 2, it can only move right.

Hence, only one down move is possible.

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", so two paths.

But the example output says four paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that down can be done at any column, but in this grid, down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", and down at columns 1 to 4 give larger strings.

But according to the example, the output is:

001001101

4

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at different positions, but in this grid, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

Wait, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same string due to overlapping paths.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the grid again.

a=00100111

b=11101101

Down at column 1: a[1]+b[1} to b[8}=0 + 11101101=011101101

Down at column 2: a[1]+a[2]+b[2} to b[8}=0+0+1101101=001101101

Down at column 3: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+b[3} to b[8}=0+0+1+101101=001101101

Down at column 4: a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+a[4]+b[4} to b[8}=0+0+1+0+1101=00101101

Down at column 5: a[1} to a[5]+b[5} to b[8}=00100 +1101=001001101

Down at column 6: a[1} to a[6]+b[6} to b[8}=001001+101=001001101

Down at column 7: a[1} to a[7]+b[7} to b[8}=0010011+1=00100111

Down at column 8: a[1} to a[8]+b[8}=00100111+1=001001111

Hence, down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", which is the smallest string.

But according to the example output, the number of paths is four.

So perhaps there are more down moves that lead to "001001101".

Wait, perhaps down at columns 4 and 5 also give "001001101", but from my calculation, down at column 4 gives "00101101", which is larger.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that down at column 4 gives "00101101", which is larger than "001001101".

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

But the example output says four paths yield this string.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same string due to overlapping paths.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at column 5 or 6, and some paths overlap.

But in this grid, down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", so two paths.

But according to the example, it's four paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that down can be made at any column, but in practice, only down at columns 5 and 6 give the smallest string.

Hence, perhaps there are four down moves that lead to "001001101".

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, let's see:

- Down at column 5: a[1} to a[5} + b[5} to b[8}=00100 +1101=001001101

- Down at column 6: a[1} to a[6} + b[6} to b[8}=001001 +101=001001101

- Down at column 7: a[1} to a[7} + b[7} to b[8}=0010011 +1=00100111

- Down at column 8: a[1} to a[8} + b[8}=00100111 +1=001001111

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

But according to the example, the number of paths is four.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in some grids, multiple down moves can lead to the same string.

Wait, perhaps in this specific grid, down at columns 5 and 6 both give "001001101", and there are two ways to reach down at column 6: either by staying in row 1 until column 6 and then down, or by going down at some earlier column and then moving right.

Wait, no, in this grid, from row 1, you can only move right or down to row 2, and from row 2, you can only move right.

Hence, once you go down to row 2, you must continue rightward in row 2.

Hence, the only way to down at column k is to move right to column k in row 1 and then down to row 2, and then right to column n.

Hence, for each k from 1 to n, there is exactly one path that corresponds to down at column k.

Hence, in the third test case, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", so two paths.

But the example output says four paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some down moves at different columns lead to the same string.

Wait, perhaps in this grid, down at columns 5,6,7, and 8 give "001001101", but from my calculation, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

Wait, perhaps I need to check the strings again.

Down at column 5: 00100 +1101=001001101

Down at column 6: 001001+101=001001101

Down at column 7: 0010011+1=00100111

Down at column 8: 00100111+1=001001111

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

So why does the example output say four paths?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some paths.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at different points, leading to the same string.

Wait, maybe there are overlapping paths.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at column 5 or 6, and in some cases, multiple down moves lead to the same string.

Wait, but in this grid, down at columns 5 and 6 both give "001001101", and down at columns 7 and 8 give larger strings.

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

But according to the example, the number of paths is four.

Perhaps I need to consider that within the path, there might be multiple ways to achieve the same string due to identical digits in the grid.

Wait, perhaps in the grid, a[5]=0 and b[5]=1, a[6]=1 and b[6]=1, so down at column 5 Appends 0 from a[5} and then 1 from b[5}, and down at column 6 Appends 1 from a[6} and 1 from b[6}, but since a[6}=1 and b[6}=1, it's the same digit, so perhaps multiple paths give the same string.

Wait, but in this grid, down at columns 5 and 6 both give "001001101", but I don't see why the example output says four paths.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same string due to the grid's structure.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the grasshopper can make the down move at different columns, and some of these moves lead to the same string.

But in this grid, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101", so two paths.

But according to the example, it's four paths.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at column 5, but also at columns 6, but in some cases, multiple down moves lead to the same string.

Wait, perhaps in the grid, down at columns 5,6,7, and 8 all give "001001101", but from my calculation, only down at columns 5 and 6 do that.

Wait, maybe I need to check the grid again.

a=00100111

b=11101101

Down at column 5: a[1} to a[5} + b[5} to b[8}=00100 +1101=001001101

Down at column 6: a[1} to a[6} + b[6} to b[8}=001001 +101=001001101

Down at column 7: a[1} to a[7} + b[7} to b[8}=0010011 +1=00100111

Down at column 8: a[1} to a[8} + b[8}=00100111 +1=001001111

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

But according to the example, the number of paths is four.

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at column 5 in multiple ways.

Wait, no, from row 1, column 5, down to row 2, column 5, and then right to column 8.

Similarly, down at column 6: row 1, column 6, down to row 2, column 6, then right to column 8.

Hence, two paths give "001001101".

But according to the example, it's four paths.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper can make the down move at earlier columns but still achieve the same string.

Wait, no, down at columns 1,2,3,4 give larger strings.

Hence, only down at columns 5 and 6 give "001001101".

I'm confused; perhaps I need to accept that and proceed.

So, in general, for each down move at column k (1 to n), the string is a[1} to a[k} + b[k} to b[n}.

Find the smallest such string and count how many down moves lead to it.

This seems efficient, as for each k, constructing the string is O(n), but since n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, this would be too slow.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide where to switch from row 1 to row 2 to get the smallest string.

Let me think about it differently.

Initialize an empty string.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, decide whether to move right in row 1 or down to row 2.

Choose the option that leads to the smallest possible string.

Keep track of the number of paths that lead to this smallest string.

Wait, but I need to consider the future digits as well.

Perhaps I can simulate the path, always choosing the smallest available digit, considering the possible moves.

Let me try to simulate it.

Initialize an empty string and start at (1,1).

At each step, compare the digit in the current cell with the digit in the cell below (if possible) and the cell to the right (if possible).

Choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Wait, but in row 1, the grasshopper can move right or down, while in row 2, it can only move right.

Hence, from row 1, it can choose to move right or down, and from row 2, it can only move right.

Hence, the path consists of moving right in row 1 for some columns, then moving down to row 2 at some column, and then moving right in row 2 to reach column n.

Hence, the choice is when to make the down move.

To get the smallest string, I need to choose the down move at the column that minimizes the string a[1} to a[k} + b[k} to b[n}.

Hence, I need to find k in 1 to n that minimizes a[1} to a[k} + b[k} to b[n}.

Then, the number of such k's that give this minimal string is the number of paths.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, and sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Hence, I need to find a way to find the minimal string and count the number of k's that give it in O(n) time.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different k.

For each k from 1 to n, the string is s_k = a[1} to a[k} + b[k} to b[n}.

I need to find the minimal s_k and count how many k's give this minimal s_k.

To efficiently find the minimal s_k, I can iterate through k from 1 to n and keep track of the minimal s_k seen so far.

But directly comparing s_k for each k would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

Hence, I need a smarter way to compare s_k.

Note that s_k consists of a[1} to a[k} followed by b[k} to b[n}.

Hence, s_k = a[1:k} + b[k:n}, where a[1:k} is the substring from a[1} to a[k}, and b[k:n} from b[k} to b[n}.

I need to find the minimal concatenation of a[1:k} and b[k:n}.

I need to find k that minimizes a[1:k} + b[k:n}.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate k from 1 to n and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But I need to find a way to compare a[1:k} + b[k:n} efficiently.

One idea is to iterate k from 1 to n and keep track of the current string built so far.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the grid column by column and decide whether to stay in row 1 or move down to row 2.

At each column, choose the option that gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, but I need to consider that moving down locks the path to row 2 for the remaining columns.

Hence, perhaps I can find the column k where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest string.

To find this k, I can look for the smallest a[1:k} + b[k:n}.

To optimize this, perhaps I can precompute suffixes of b and prefixes of a.

Let me define:

- prefix_a[k} = a[1} to a[k}

- suffix_b[k} = b[k} to b[n}

Hence, s_k = prefix_a[k} + suffix_b[k}

I need to find the minimal s_k.

To compare s_k for different k, I can iterate k from 1 to n and keep track of the minimal s_k.

But this would be O(n^2) in time.

I need a way to do this in O(n) time.

Perhaps I can use the fact that strings are sequences of characters and find a way to compare them efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal string by choosing the smallest possible digit at each step.

Let me try to simulate this.

Initialize an empty string and start at (1,1).

At each step, decide whether to move right in row 1 or down to row 2.

Choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

Keep track of the number of paths that lead to this minimal string.

Wait, but I need to consider that choosing a smaller digit now might lead to a larger digit later.

Hence, I need to look ahead.

Perhaps I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible string.

Let me consider that the string is built by taking a[1} to a[k} and then b[k} to b[n}.

Hence, I need to find k that minimizes a[1:k} + b[k:n}.

To find this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate k from 1 to n and keep track of the point where switching gives the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the grid column by column and keep track of the current minimal string.

Initialize current_string as empty.

Initialize min_string as a very large string.

Initialize count as 0.

Iterate k from 1 to n:

current_string += a[k}

if a[k} < b[k}:

continue moving right in row 1

elif a[k} == b[k}:

continue moving right in row 1

else:

switch to row 2 at this k

append b[k} to current_string

compare current_string with min_string

if current_string < min_string:

update min_string to current_string

reset count to 1

elif current_string == min_string:

increment count

else:

pass

Wait, this seems too simplistic and may not handle all cases correctly.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the possible strings up to the current column.

At each column, for each possible state (row), keep the minimal string that can be achieved up to that column.

Wait, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j} represents the minimal string from start to row i, column j.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can
