Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. The graph might not be connected, and there's at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and no loops. I need to find a simple cycle where the lightest edge is as minimal as possible.

First, I need to understand what a simple cycle is. A simple cycle doesn't repeat any vertices or edges except for the starting and ending vertex. So, it's like a loop where you don't visit any vertex more than once except for the starting one.

The problem asks for any simple cycle that has the minimal lightest edge. That means among all possible simple cycles in the graph, I need to find one where the smallest edge in that cycle is as small as possible.

Looking at the input format, there are multiple test cases, each with n vertices and m edges. Each edge is defined by two vertices and a weight.

I need to output, for each test case, two numbers: b and k. b is the weight of the lightest edge in the found cycle, and k is the number of vertices in the cycle. Then, on the next line, I need to list the vertices in the cycle in the order they are traversed.

Given that the graph is undirected and can have multiple components, I need to make sure that I'm handling disconnected parts correctly.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a DFS and keep track of the path from the starting vertex. If I encounter a vertex that is already in the current path, then I've found a cycle.

But the challenge here is to find a cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

I need to think about how to efficiently find such a cycle.

One idea is to sort the edges by their weights and process them in order, trying to find cycles.

Wait, but since I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible, maybe I should look for cycles in the order of increasing edge weights.

But sorting edges in increasing order might not directly help because I need to consider cycles formed by multiple edges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a union-find data structure to keep track of connected components and detect cycles.

Yes, union-find is useful for detecting cycles in a graph.

Let me recall how union-find works. It has two main operations: union, which merges two sets, and find, which determines which set a particular element is in.

If I sort the edges in decreasing order of weight and use union-find to keep track of connected components, I can add edges one by one and use the union-find to detect cycles.

Wait, why sort in decreasing order? Maybe I should sort in increasing order to find the minimal lightest edge.

Let me think again.

If I sort the edges in increasing order of weight and add them one by one, using union-find, then when I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same connected component, it would form a cycle.

Moreover, since I'm adding edges in increasing order, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the current edge I'm adding, because all previous edges are lighter.

But actually, in such a case, the lightest edge in the cycle would be the minimum weight among all edges in the cycle.

Wait, but in the union-find approach, when I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, there is a cycle, but I don't necessarily know the lightest edge in that cycle directly.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I can keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use BFS or DFS to find cycles and keep track of the minimum edge in each cycle found.

But with large graphs, that might not be efficient enough, considering the constraints (n can be up to 2*10^5).

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort all the edges in increasing order of their weights.

- Then, iterate through the sorted edges and use union-find to detect cycles.

- When a cycle is detected, record the lightest edge in that cycle.

- However, I need to find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge, so I need to find the first cycle where the lightest edge is as small as possible.

Wait, but actually, since I'm sorting in increasing order, the first cycle I find will have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Is that correct?

Let me think.

Suppose I sort the edges from smallest to largest and start adding them one by one using union-find.

When I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

In that case, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the smallest edge in the path that connects these two vertices in the current component, combined with the current edge.

But I'm not sure if that directly gives me the minimal lightest edge for any cycle.

Maybe I need to think in terms of Krusky's algorithm.

Wait, Kruskal's algorithm is used to find a minimum spanning tree by adding edges in increasing order of weight, skipping edges that form cycles.

In this problem, I need to find a cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Perhaps I can adapt Kruskal's algorithm to track cycles instead of avoiding them.

Let me try to formalize this.

If I sort the edges in increasing order of weight and start adding them one by one using union-find:

- When I add an edge that connects two vertices in different components, I merge the components.

- When I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

In that case, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimum weight among all edges in the cycle.

But since I'm adding edges in increasing order, the cycle formed would include the current edge and the path between the two vertices in the current component.

To minimize the lightest edge in the cycle, I should find the first cycle where the lightest edge is as small as possible.

Wait, maybe I should sort the edges in decreasing order of weight and look for cycles where the lightest edge is minimized.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I fix a threshold value for the lightest edge, and then check if there exists a cycle where all edges are at least that light.

If I can binary search on the lightest edge, finding the smallest possible lightest edge where a cycle exists.

But I'm not sure if that's efficient given the constraints.

Wait, maybe I can sort the edges in increasing order of weight and iterate through them, keeping track of the union-find structure.

When I find a cycle, that cycle will have the current edge as its lightest edge because all previous edges are lighter.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true because the cycle could include heavier edges added later.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the example provided to see if that gives me any insight.

Looking at the first test case:

6 6

1 2 1

2 3 1

3 1 1

4 5 1

5 6 1

6 4 1

The output is:

1 3

1 2 3

So, it's a cycle 1-2-3 with lightest edge 1.

Another test case:

6 6

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

Output:

3 3

6 4 5

So, cycle 6-4-5 with lightest edge 3.

In this cycle, edges are 6-4 (3), 4-5 (100), and 5-6 (40). The lightest is 3.

Another test case:

6 15

with many edges

Output:

1 5

4 2 1 6 3

So, cycle 4-2-1-6-3 with lightest edge 1.

Looking at these examples, it seems that the algorithm is finding a cycle where the smallest edge is as small as possible.

In the first test case, all edges have weight 1, so the lightest edge is 1.

In the second test case, the lightest edge in the cycle is 3.

In the third test case, the lightest edge is 1.

So, the algorithm needs to find cycles and select the one with the smallest lightest edge.

I need to think of an efficient way to do this, considering the constraints.

Another idea: for each edge, consider it as the lightest edge in a cycle and check if there's a cycle containing that edge where all other edges are heavier.

But that seems too time-consuming.

Wait, maybe I can sort the edges in increasing order and for each edge, check if there's a path between its two vertices using only edges heavier than it.

If such a path exists, then combining that path with the current edge forms a cycle where the lightest edge is the current edge.

In that case, I can output the current edge's weight and the cycle formed.

Since I'm iterating from the smallest edge upwards, the first such cycle I find will have the smallest possible lightest edge.

This seems promising.

To implement this, I can sort the edges in increasing order of weight.

Then, for each edge in this order, I can check if there's a path between its two vertices using only edges that come after it in the sorted list (i.e., heavier edges).

If such a path exists, then I've found a cycle where the lightest edge is this edge.

I can then output this cycle.

This seems correct because I'm iterating from the smallest edge upwards, and the first cycle I find this way will have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Now, to efficiently check if there's a path between two vertices using only heavier edges, I can use DFS or BFS, but with the constraint that only edges heavier than the current edge are considered.

Given the constraints on n and m, I need an efficient implementation.

Alternative idea: Use union-find with union by rank or path compression to keep track of connected components.

Sort the edges in increasing order of weight.

Iterate through the edges one by one, and for each edge, if the two vertices are already in the same component, then adding this edge would form a cycle.

In that case, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimum of the current edge's weight and the lightest edge in the path connecting the two vertices.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component or something similar.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the edges in increasing order of weight.

I can try to build a forest where I add edges one by one, skipping edges that would form cycles.

The first edge that would form a cycle is the one that connects two vertices already in the same component.

In that case, the cycle formed would include that edge and the path connecting the two vertices in the current forest.

The lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimum of the edge's weight and the lightest edge in the path connecting the two vertices.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the provided code to see how it approaches the problem.

Looking at the code:

It defines a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class with find and union methods.

In the func_6 function:

- It reads n and m.

- It creates a graph as an adjacency list.

- It reads all edges and stores them in a list called edges.

- It sorts the edges in reverse order (decreasing weights).

- It initializes a DSU instance with n+1 vertices.

- It initializes _min_edge to infinity and node_u and node_v to -1.

- It iterates through the sorted edges (from highest to lowest weight).

- For each edge (w, u, v), it finds the parents of u and v.

- If they are in the same set (parent_u == parent_v), it means adding this edge would form a cycle.

- So, it calls dsu.union(u, v, w) to merge them and updates _min_edge if the minimal edge in the cycle is smaller than the current _min_edge.

- If they are not in the same set, it simply unions them with weight w.

- After processing all edges, it sets colors array to track visited nodes.

- Then, it calls dfs on node_u with parent -1 and an empty path list.

- The dfs function is supposed to find the cycle path.

- Finally, it prints _min_edge and the length of the cycle, followed by the cycle vertices.

Wait, this seems different from what I was initially thinking.

They sort the edges in decreasing order of weight and use DSU to detect cycles.

When they find a cycle, they update _min_edge with the minimal edge in that cycle.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me think about sorting edges in decreasing order.

If I sort edges from highest to lowest weight, and add them one by one, using DSU to detect cycles, then when I find a cycle, the minimal edge in that cycle would be the smallest edge among all edges in that cycle.

But since I'm adding heavier edges first, the minimal edge in the cycle would be smaller than the current edge's weight.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case:

6 6

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

Sorted in decreasing order: (100,4,5), (40,5,6), (10,1,2), (8,2,3), (3,6,4), (5,3,1)

Now, starting from the heaviest edge:

Add (100,4,5): no cycle.

Add (40,5,6): no cycle.

Add (10,1,2): no cycle.

Add (8,2,3): no cycle.

Add (3,6,4): no cycle.

Add (5,3,1): this connects 3 and 1, which are already connected through other paths.

Wait, let's see:

After adding (100,4,5), (40,5,6), (10,1,2), (8,2,3), (3,6,4), then (5,3,1).

When adding (5,3,1), if 3 and 1 are already connected, then adding this edge would form a cycle.

The cycle would be 3-1 and 3-2-1 or something like that.

But I need to find the minimal edge in that cycle.

In this case, the cycle is 1-2-3 with edges 10,8,5. The minimal edge is 5.

But according to the output, it's 3 3

6 4 5

Which is a different cycle with edges 3,40,100. Minimal edge is 3.

So, the code's approach seems to be finding a different cycle.

I need to see how the code selects the cycle.

In the code, it sets _min_edge to the minimal edge in the cycle and records node_u and node_v.

Then, it performs DFS to find the path between node_u and node_v, forming a cycle.

But I need to ensure that this cycle has the minimal possible lightest edge.

Looking back, maybe sorting in decreasing order helps because the first cycle found with the minimal edge would have the smallest lightest edge.

Wait, I'm still not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the edges in decreasing order and add them one by one.

When I add an edge that forms a cycle, the minimal edge in that cycle would be the smallest edge in the path that connects the two vertices, combined with the current edge.

But since I'm adding heavier edges first, the minimal edge in the cycle would be smaller than the current edge.

But I need the cycle with the smallest lightest edge overall.

Maybe this approach doesn't directly give me that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sort in increasing order and find the first cycle where the lightest edge is minimal.

Wait, maybe I need to sort in increasing order and keep track of the minimal edge in each component.

Let me try that.

Sort edges in increasing order.

Initialize DSU.

Iterate through edges:

if u and v are in different sets, union them and add the edge to the tree.

else, there is a cycle.

In this case, the cycle would include the path from u to v in the current tree plus the current edge.

The minimal edge in this cycle would be the minimal among the current edge and the edges in the path from u to v.

To find the minimal edge in the path from u to v, I need a way to find the minimal edge in the path.

This sounds like a minimumpath query in a tree.

I can maintain a DSU where each set has a tree, and for each tree, I can keep track of the minimal edge.

Wait, maybe I can store the minimal edge weight for each set.

In the DSU, when I union two sets, I can set the minimal edge of the new set to be the minimum of the minimal edges of the two sets.

Also, when I add an edge that forms a cycle, I can set the minimal edge of that cycle to be the minimum of the edge's weight and the minimal edge in the path from u to v.

But implementing this efficiently is tricky.

Let me see what the provided code does.

It sorts the edges in decreasing order.

Then, for each edge, if u and v are in the same set, it calls dsu.union(u,v,w) and updates _min_edge if the minimal edge in that set is smaller.

Else, it just unions them with weight w.

Then, it performs DFS from node_u to node_v to find the cycle.

I need to verify if this correctly finds the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

Let me consider the first test case:

6 6

1 2 1

2 3 1

3 1 1

4 5 1

5 6 1

6 4 1

All edges have weight 1.

Sorted in decreasing order: all edges are same.

Processing any edge, since all vertices are initially in different sets, adding any edge won't form a cycle until two vertices are already in the same set.

So, suppose it processes edges in some order and finds a cycle when adding the last edge.

Then, _min_edge would be 1, and it finds a cycle with lightest edge 1.

Which matches the output.

In the second test case, sorted edges in decreasing order: (100,4,5), (40,5,6), (10,1,2), (8,2,3), (5,3,1), (3,6,4)

Processing (100,4,5): no cycle.

(40,5,6): no cycle.

(10,1,2): no cycle.

(8,2,3): no cycle.

(5,3,1): no cycle.

(3,6,4): now, 6 and 4 are not in the same set, so union them.

Wait, according to the code, it seems that when u and v are in the same set, it calls dsu.union(u,v,w) and updates _min_edge.

But in this case, when processing (3,6,4), 6 and 4 are not in the same set, so it just unions them.

Wait, but according to the code:

if parent_u == parent_v:

dsu.union(u,v,w)

if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:

_min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]

node_u = u

node_v = v

else:

dsu.union(u,v,w)

So, in this case, for (3,6,4), parent_u and parent_v are different, so it just unions them.

Then, when processing (5,3,1):

3 and 1 are in the same set, so it calls dsu.union(3,1,1) and checks if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge.

Assuming _min_edge is initially infinity, and dsu.min_edge[parent_u] is 1, it sets _min_edge=1, node_u=3, node_v=1.

Then, it performs DFS from node_u=3 to node_v=1 to find the cycle.

But according to the output, it should output 3 3

6 4 5

Which is a different cycle.

So, perhaps there's some confusion in how node_u and node_v are set.

Maybe the code has a mistake.

Wait, in the code, it sets node_u and node_v whenever it finds a cycle with a smaller _min_edge.

But in the second test case, it sets node_u and node_v to 3 and 1, but the output is 6 4 5.

So, perhaps there's some other logic in dfs that I'm missing.

Looking at the dfs function:

It performs a DFS from curr, keeping track of the path.

If it encounters a vertex that is already in the path (colors[curr]==1), it returns the path.

Else, it marks the vertex as visited (colors[curr]=1), adds it to the path, and recurses on its neighbors.

After recursion, it marks the vertex as fully explored (colors[curr]=2).

In the func_6 function, it calls dfs(node_u, -1, []) and assigns the result to res.

Then prints _min_edge and len(res), followed by the cycle vertices.

But in the second test case, it's outputting 6 4 5, which is a cycle with edges (6,4,3), (4,5,100), (5,6,40). The lightest edge is 3.

But according to the earlier logic, _min_edge was set to 1 when processing edge (5,3,1), which corresponds to a different cycle.

So, there seems to be inconsistency here.

Maybe the code has a flaw in how it selects node_u and node_v.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I'm misunderstanding it.

Let me try to trace the code for the second test case.

Edges sorted in decreasing order:

(100,4,5), (40,5,6), (10,1,2), (8,2,3), (5,3,1), (3,6,4)

Initialize DSU with n+1=7 parents.

Processing (100,4,5):

find(4)=4, find(5)=5, different, union them, set min_edge[4]=min(min_edge[4], min_edge[5], 100)

Assuming min_edge[4]=inf, min_edge[5]=inf, so min_edge[4]=100

Processing (40,5,6):

find(5)=4, find(6)=6, different, union them, set min_edge[4]=min(min_edge[4], min_edge[6], 40)=min(100,inf,40)=40

Processing (10,1,2):

find(1)=1, find(2)=2, different, union them, set min_edge[1]=min(min_edge[1], min_edge[2],10)=10

Processing (8,2,3):

find(2)=1, find(3)=3, different, union them, set min_edge[1]=min(10, min_edge[3],8)=min(10,inf,8)=8

Processing (5,3,1):

find(3)=1, find(1)=1, same set, so call dsu.union(1,1,5), set min_edge[1]=min(min_edge[1],5)=5

Check if min_edge[1]=5 < _min_edge=inf, set _min_edge=5, node_u=1, node_v=1

Processing (3,6,4):

find(6)=4, find(4)=4, same set, call dsu.union(4,4,3), set min_edge[4]=min(min_edge[4],3)=3

Check if min_edge[4]=3 < _min_edge=5, set _min_edge=3, node_u=4, node_v=4

Then, it calls dfs(node_u=4, parent=-1, path=[])

In dfs, it marks 4 as visited, adds it to path.

Neighbors of 4 are 5 and 6.

Visit 5, mark as visited, add to path.

Neighbors of 5 are 4 and 6.

5->4 is already in path, so it returns path [4,5]

Then, in func_6, it checks if node_v=4 is in set_res={4,5}, which it is, so it returns [4,5]

Then, it prints _min_edge=3 and k=2, but wait, a cycle should have at least 3 vertices.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the dfs function.

Looking back, the dfs function is:

def dfs(curr, parent, path):

if colors[curr] == 1:

return path

colors[curr] = 1

path.append(curr)

for nei in graph[curr]:

if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:

res = dfs(nei, curr, path)

set_res = set(res)

if res and node_v in set_res:

return res

colors[curr] = 2

return []

So, in the second test case, when calling dfs(4, -1, []), it marks 4 as visited, adds it to path.

Then, visits 5, marks 5 as visited, adds it to path.

Then, visits 6, marks 6 as visited, adds it to path.

Then, visits 4 again, which is already in path, so it returns path [4,5,6]

Then, it checks if node_v=4 is in set_res={4,5,6}, which it is, so it returns [4,5,6]

Then, it prints _min_edge=3 and k=3, and the cycle 4 5 6

Which matches the output.

Wait, but in the output, it's 6 4 5.

Maybe the order doesn't matter as long as it's a valid cycle.

So, in this case, the cycle is 4-5-6-4, with edges (4,5,100), (5,6,40), (6,4,3). The lightest edge is 3, which matches _min_edge.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for this test case.

Another test case:

2 3 2

1 3 10

1 4 1

3 4 7

2 4 5

1 2 2

Sorted edges in decreasing order: (10,1,3), (7,3,4), (5,2,4), (2,1,2), (2,2,3), (1,1,4)

Processing (10,1,3):

find(1)=1, find(3)=3, different, union them, min_edge[1]=min(inf, inf,10)=10

Processing (7,3,4):

find(3)=1, find(4)=4, different, union them, min_edge[1]=min(10, inf,7)=7

Processing (5,2,4):

find(2)=2, find(4)=1, different, union them, min_edge[1]=min(7, min_edge[2],5)=min(7,inf,5)=5

Processing (2,1,2):

find(1)=1, find(2)=1, same set, call dsu.union(1,2,2), set min_edge[1]=min(5,2)=2

if 2 < _min_edge=inf, set _min_edge=2, node_u=1, node_v=2

Processing (2,2,3):

find(2)=1, find(3)=1, same set, call dsu.union(1,1,2), set min_edge[1]=min(2,2)=2

if 2 < _min_edge=2, no change

Processing (1,1,4):

find(1)=1, find(4)=1, same set, call dsu.union(1,1,1), set min_edge[1]=min(2,1)=1

if 1 < _min_edge=2, set _min_edge=1, node_u=1, node_v=1

Then, call dfs(1, -1, [])

Marks 1 as visited, adds it to path.

Visits neighbors: 2,3,4

Visit 2, marks it, adds to path.

Visits neighbors:1,3,4

1 is already in path, so returns [1,2]

Then, visits 3, marks it, adds to path.

Visits neighbors:1,2,4

1 and 2 are in path, so returns [1,2,3]

Then, visits 4, marks it, adds to path.

Visits neighbors:1,2,3

All are in path, so returns [1,2,3,4]

Then, checks if node_v=1 is in set_res={1,2,3,4}, which it is, so returns [1,2,3,4]

Then, prints _min_edge=1 and k=4, and the cycle 1 2 3 4

But in the example output, it's 3 3

2 3 1

Which is a different cycle with edges (2,3,2), (3,1,10), (1,2,2). The lightest edge is 2.

But according to the code, it's finding a cycle with _min_edge=1, which is the edge (1,4,1).

But in the cycle 1-2-3-4, the edges are (1,2,2), (2,3,2), (3,4,7), (4,1,1). The lightest is 1.

But the example output is a different cycle with _min_edge=3.

Wait, perhaps there is confusion in the example output.

Looking back at the example output:

In the last test case, the output is 3 3

2 3 1

Which corresponds to cycle 2-3-1 with edges (2,3,2), (3,1,10), (1,2,2). The lightest edge is 2.

But according to the code, it might be finding a different cycle with _min_edge=1.

Wait, perhaps the code is not correctly finding the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

In the last test case, there is a cycle 1-4-3-2 with edges (1,4,1), (4,3,7), (3,2,8), (2,1,10). The lightest edge is 1.

Which matches the fourth test case's output: 1 4

1 4 3 2

So, perhaps the code is finding different cycles based on the node_u and node_v selected.

But in the second test case, it's outputting 3 3

6 4 5

Which has _min_edge=3, which is correct for that cycle.

But according to my earlier tracing, the code sets _min_edge=1 in the last step, but the output is 3 3

6 4 5

Which suggests that perhaps the code is not correctly setting _min_edge or selecting the right cycle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in tracing.

Looking back, in the second test case, when processing (5,3,1), _min_edge is set to 5, and node_u=3, node_v=1.

Then, when processing (3,6,4), _min_edge is set to 3, node_u=4, node_v=4.

Then, it performs dfs from node_u=4 to node_v=4, finding the cycle 4-5-6.

But according to the output, it's 6 4 5, which is the same cycle.

But in the example output, it's supposed to be 3 3

6 4 5

Which matches _min_edge=3.

But according to the earlier test case, it should be 1 3

1 2 3

Wait, I'm getting confused.

In the second test case, the minimal lightest edge in any cycle is 3, as per the output.

But according to my earlier logic, there is a cycle 1-2-3 with edges all 1.

But in the second test case, edges are:

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

In this graph, the cycle 1-2-3 has edges 10,8,5. The lightest is 5.

Another cycle is 4-5-6 with edges 100,40,3. The lightest is 3.

Another cycle is 6-4-5 with edges 3,100,40. The lightest is 3.

So, the minimal lightest edge among all cycles is 3.

Hence, the output is correct.

But according to my earlier thought process, if I sort edges in decreasing order and find the first cycle, _min_edge would be 3.

But I was expecting it to be 5, but actually, in this graph, the minimal lightest edge in any cycle is 3.

So, the code is correct in this case.

Another test case:

4 6

2 3 2

1 3 10

1 4 1

3 4 7

2 4 5

1 2 2

In this graph, cycles are:

1-2-3-4-1 with lightest edge 1

1-2-4-1 with lightest edge 1

1-4-3-2-1 with lightest edge 1

So, the minimal lightest edge is 1.

But in the example output, it's 3 3

2 3 1

Which has lightest edge 2.

So, perhaps the code is not always finding the cycle with the absolute minimal lightest edge.

Wait, in this cycle 2-3-1, edges are (2,3,2), (3,1,10), (1,2,2). The lightest is 2.

But there are other cycles with lightest edge 1.

So, perhaps the code is finding a cycle with a lightest edge that is minimal, but not necessarily the absolute minimal possible.

Hence, the code might be incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, it says "find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge is minimal."

So, it's acceptable to find any cycle where the lightest edge is minimal.

It doesn't have to be the cycle with the overall minimal lightest edge.

In other words, as long as the lightest edge in the found cycle is the minimal possible among all cycles' lightest edges.

In the last test case, the minimal lightest edge among all cycles is 1, and the code finds a cycle with lightest edge 2, which is not minimal.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
