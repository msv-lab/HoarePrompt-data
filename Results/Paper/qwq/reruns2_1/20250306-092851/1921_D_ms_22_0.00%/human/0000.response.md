Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have Petya's array a of n integers, and Vasya has m integers b, where m is at least n. Vasya wants to choose n integers from b, arrange them in some order to form array c, and maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of a and c.

So, the goal is to maximize D = sum(|a_i - c_i|) for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have to select n numbers from b, possibly in a specific order, to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Since we can arrange the selected numbers in any order, we're essentially looking for a permutation of n numbers from b that maximizes the sum of absolute differences with a.

One way to think about this is to pair each a_i with a c_i from b such that the absolute difference is maximized, considering the constraints that c is a permutation of n elements from b.

However, since we can arrange c in any order, the order doesn't matter as much as matching the right c_i to the right a_i to maximize the sum.

Wait, actually, since we can arrange c in any order, it's about selecting which c_i to pair with which a_i to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds like a matching problem where we want to maximize the sum of pairwise differences.

I recall that in assignment problems, we can have costs or gains associated with assignments, and we need to maximize or minimize the total cost.

In this case, we want to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

One standard way to solve such problems is to use the Hungarian algorithm, but that might be too slow for the constraints given (n and m up to 2*10^5).

So, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think differently.

Since we can arrange c in any order, perhaps the order of a doesn't matter either. Maybe I can sort both a and b and then pair them in a certain way to maximize the difference.

Let's try sorting both arrays.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order.

If I pair the smallest a with the largest b, and so on, that might maximize the differences.

Let me test this idea with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=6

a: 6 1 2 4

b: 3 5 1 7 2 3

Sort a: 1,2,4,6

Sort b: 1,2,3,3,5,7

If I pair smallest a with largest b:

a=1 with b=7: diff=6

a=2 with b=5: diff=3

a=4 with b=3: diff=1

a=6 with b=3: diff=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13

But in the example, it says the output is 16, so this approach is not giving the correct maximum.

Wait, maybe pairing smallest a with largest b isn't always optimal.

Let's see another way: pairing each a_i with the b that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, but considering that we have to choose n distinct b_j's.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum possible difference for each a_i and select b_j's accordingly.

But with large n and m, I need an efficient way.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The code sorts b, and for each a_i, it calculates the difference with the smallest b (b[0]) and the largest b (b[m-1]), and pushes the larger difference into a max heap.

Then, it pops elements from the heap and assigns the difference accordingly, updating pointers tp1 and tp2, which seem to track the next available b to pair with.

This seems like a greedy approach where for each a_i, we try to pair it with the b that gives the maximum difference, either the smallest or largest available in b.

Then, we adjust the pointers tp1 and tp2 to ensure that each b is used only once.

Wait, but b can have duplicates, so maybe it's okay to use a b_j multiple times, but the problem says to choose n integers from b, which are distinct positions, so duplicates are allowed if they appear multiple times in b.

But in the code, it's sorting b and then using indices tp1 and tp2 to select the next available b to pair with.

Let me try to understand the algorithm step by step.

First, sort b in ascending order.

For each a_i, calculate the difference with the smallest b (b[0]) and the largest b (b[m-1]), and push the larger difference into a max heap, along with a_i and the index of the b used (either 0 or m-1).

Then, while the heap is not empty, pop the element with the maximum difference, and check if the b index is still available (i.e., tp1 <= index <= tp2).

If it's not available, calculate the difference with the current tp1 or tp2, choose the larger one, add it to the answer, and move tp1 or tp2 accordingly.

If it's available, add the difference to the answer and move tp1 or tp2 accordingly.

This seems like a way to greedily select the maximum possible difference for each a_i, considering the availability of b's.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me try to think of a counterexample.

Consider n=2, m=3

a: 1, 10

b: 2, 9, 100

Sort b: 2,9,100

For a=1, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[2]=99, so push 99 with index 2

For a=10, diff with b[0]=8, diff with b[2]=90, so push 90 with index 2

Now, max heap has (-99,1,2) and (-90,10,2)

Pop (-99,1,2), check if index 2 is between tp1=0 and tp2=2, which it is, so add 99 to ans, and set tp2=1

Now, pop (-90,10,2), but index 2 > tp2=1, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=2), diff=8, and diff with tp2=1 (b[1]=9), diff=1, choose 8, add to ans, set tp1=1

Total D=99+8=107

But the optimal should be c=2 and 100, D=|1-2| + |10-100|=1+90=91

Or c=9 and 100, D=|1-9| + |10-100|=8+90=98

Wait, my calculation shows that 107 is larger than both, but is it possible to achieve that?

Wait, in the first step, we selected a=1 with b=100, difference=99, set tp2=1

Then, for a=10, index 2 is not available anymore, so we have to choose between b[0]=2 and b[1]=9

Difference with b[0]=8, difference with b[1]=1, so we choose 8.

Total D=99+8=107

But is this a valid assignment? a=1 with c=100, and a=10 with c=2.

Is there a better assignment?

Alternatively, a=1 with c=2, difference=1, a=10 with c=100, difference=90, total D=91

Or a=1 with c=9, difference=8, a=10 with c=100, difference=90, total D=98

So, 107 seems better, but is it possible to achieve?

Wait, in the first assignment, a=1 with c=100 and a=10 with c=2, which is allowed since both are distinct elements from b.

So, 107 is indeed achievable.

But according to the reference solution, it's correct.

But is it always correct?

Let me think of another test case.

n=2, m=4

a: 1, 10

b: 2, 3, 9, 100

Sort b: 2,3,9,100

For a=1, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[3]=99, push 99 with index 3

For a=10, diff with b[0]=8, diff with b[3]=90, push 90 with index 3

Max heap: (-99,1,3), (-90,10,3)

Pop (-99,1,3), check if index 3 (b=100) is between tp1=0 and tp2=3, yes, add 99 to ans, set tp2=2

Now, pop (-90,10,3), index 3 > tp2=2, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=2)=8, and tp2=2 (b[2]=9)=1, choose 8, add to ans, set tp1=1

Total D=99+8=107

But is there a better assignment?

a=1 with c=100, difference=99

a=10 with c=9, difference=1, total D=100

Or a=1 with c=3, difference=2, a=10 with c=100, difference=90, total D=92

So, 107 is better.

Wait, but in this case, a=1 with c=100 and a=10 with c=2 gives D=99+8=107, which is better than a=1 with c=100 and a=10 with c=9, which gives D=99+1=100.

So, the algorithm seems correct in this case.

Let me think of another example.

n=3, m=5

a: 1,2,3

b: 1,2,3,4,5

Sort b:1,2,3,4,5

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[4]=4, push 4 with index 4

For a=2, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[4]=2, push 2 with index 4

For a=3, diff with b[0]=2, diff with b[4]=2, push 2 with index 4

Max heap: (-4,1,4), (-2,2,4), (-2,3,4)

Pop (-4,1,4), check if index 4 is between tp1=0 and tp2=4, yes, add 4 to ans, set tp2=3

Pop (-2,2,4), index 4 > tp2=3, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=1, and tp2=3 (b[3]=4)=2, choose 2, add to ans, set tp2=2

Pop (-2,3,4), index 4 > tp2=2, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=2, and tp2=2 (b[2]=3)=0, choose 2, add to ans, set tp1=1

Total D=4+2+2=8

But the optimal should be c=1,4,5, D=|1-1| + |2-5| + |3-4|=0+3+1=4

Wait, that's worse than 8.

Wait, maybe c=5,4,1, D=|1-5| + |2-4| + |3-1|=4+2+2=8, which matches the algorithm's output.

So, in this case, the algorithm gives the correct maximum D=8.

Another test case:

n=1, m=6

a:3

b:2,7,10,1,1,5

Sort b:1,1,2,5,7,10

For a=3, diff with b[0]=2, diff with b[5]=7, push 7 with index 5

Max heap: (-7,3,5)

Pop (-7,3,5), check if index 5 is between tp1=0 and tp2=5, yes, add 7 to ans, set tp2=4

Total D=7

Is this optimal? c=10, D=|3-10|=7, which is the maximum possible, since the next largest in b is 7, which would give D=4, which is less.

So, correct.

Seems like the algorithm works in these cases.

Let me try to understand the general idea.

The algorithm seems to prioritize pairing each a_i with the b that gives the maximum possible difference, either the smallest or largest in b, and then adjust the available range of b's accordingly.

By using a max heap, it always picks the largest possible difference first, and then assigns it if the corresponding b is still available.

If not, it calculates the difference with the current available b's (tp1 or tp2) and chooses the larger one.

This seems like a greedy approach that works in these examples.

I need to see if this is always correct.

Let me think about another example where maybe this approach fails.

Consider n=2, m=4

a: 1,10

b:2,3,9,100

Sort b:2,3,9,100

For a=1, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[3]=99, push 99 with index 3

For a=10, diff with b[0]=8, diff with b[3]=90, push 90 with index 3

Max heap: (-99,1,3), (-90,10,3)

Pop (-99,1,3), assign c=100 to a=1, set tp2=2

Now, pop (-90,10,3), index 3 > tp2=2, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=2)=8, and tp2=2 (b[2]=9)=1, choose 8, assign c=2 to a=10

Total D=99+8=107

But is there a better assignment?

If I assign a=1 to c=100 and a=10 to c=9, D=99+1=100

Or a=1 to c=3, D=2, a=10 to c=100, D=90, total D=92

So, 107 is better.

Alternatively, if I assign a=1 to c=2, D=1, a=10 to c=100, D=90, total D=91

Still, 107 is better.

So, in this case, the algorithm gives the correct maximum.

Another test case:

n=3, m=5

a:1,2,3

b:1,2,3,4,5

Sort b:1,2,3,4,5

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[4]=4, push 4 with index 4

For a=2, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[4]=2, push 2 with index 4

For a=3, diff with b[0]=2, diff with b[4]=2, push 2 with index 4

Max heap: (-4,1,4), (-2,2,4), (-2,3,4)

Pop (-4,1,4), assign c=5 to a=1, set tp2=3

Pop (-2,2,4), index 4 > tp2=3, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=1, and tp2=3 (b[3]=4)=2, choose 2, assign c=4 to a=2, set tp2=2

Pop (-2,3,4), index 4 > tp2=2, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=2, and tp2=2 (b[2]=3)=0, choose 2, assign c=1 to a=3, set tp1=1

Total D=4+2+2=8

Is there a better assignment?

If I assign a=1 to c=5, D=4

a=2 to c=4, D=2

a=3 to c=3, D=0

Total D=6

Or a=1 to c=5, D=4

a=2 to c=1, D=1

a=3 to c=3, D=0

Total D=5

Or a=1 to c=5, D=4

a=2 to c=2, D=0

a=3 to c=4, D=1

Total D=5

So, the algorithm's assignment gives D=8, which is better than these.

Is there any other assignment that gives higher than 8?

a=1 to c=5, D=4

a=2 to c=4, D=2

a=3 to c=1, D=2

Total D=8

Same as the algorithm.

a=1 to c=5, D=4

a=2 to c=3, D=1

a=3 to c=4, D=1

Total D=6

Not better.

So, in this case, the algorithm gives the correct maximum.

Another test case:

n=1, m=1

a:1

b:1

Sort b:1

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[0]=0, push 0 with index 0

Max heap: (0,1,0)

Pop (0,1,0), assign c=1 to a=1, set tp1=1

Total D=0

Correct.

Another test case:

n=2, m=2

a:1,2

b:1,2

Sort b:1,2

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[1]=1, push 1 with index 1

For a=2, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[1]=0, push 1 with index 0

Max heap: (-1,1,1), (-1,2,0)

Pop (-1,1,1), assign c=2 to a=1, set tp2=0

Pop (-1,2,0), assign c=1 to a=2, set tp1=1

Total D=1+1=2

Which is correct.

Another test case:

n=3, m=3

a:1,2,3

b:1,2,3

Sort b:1,2,3

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[2]=2, push 2 with index 2

For a=2, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[2]=1, push 1 with index 2

For a=3, diff with b[0]=2, diff with b[2]=0, push 2 with index 0

Max heap: (-2,1,2), (-1,2,2), (-2,3,0)

Pop (-2,1,2), assign c=3 to a=1, set tp2=1

Pop (-1,2,2), index 2 > tp2=1, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=1, and tp2=1 (b[1]=2)=0, choose 1, assign c=1 to a=2, set tp1=1

Pop (-2,3,0), index 0 < tp1=1, so calculate diff with tp1=1 (b[1]=2)=1, and tp2=1 (b[1]=2)=1, choose 1, assign c=2 to a=3, set tp1=2

Total D=2+1+1=4

But the optimal should be c=1,2,3, D=0+0+0=0

Wait, but the algorithm gives D=4, which is higher.

How is that possible?

Wait, a=1 with c=3, D=2

a=2 with c=1, D=1

a=3 with c=2, D=1

Total D=4

But is this allowed?

Yes, since c is a permutation of b.

But is there a way to get higher than 4?

If a=1 with c=1, D=0

a=2 with c=2, D=0

a=3 with c=3, D=0

Total D=0

Or a=1 with c=2, D=1

a=2 with c=3, D=1

a=3 with c=1, D=2

Total D=4

Same as before.

So, the algorithm gives the correct maximum D=4.

Seems consistent.

Another test case:

n=3, m=4

a:1,2,3

b:1,2,3,4

Sort b:1,2,3,4

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[3]=3, push 3 with index 3

For a=2, diff with b[0]=1, diff with b[3]=2, push 2 with index 3

For a=3, diff with b[0]=2, diff with b[3]=1, push 2 with index 0

Max heap: (-3,1,3), (-2,2,3), (-2,3,0)

Pop (-3,1,3), assign c=4 to a=1, set tp2=2

Pop (-2,2,3), index 3 > tp2=2, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=1, and tp2=2 (b[2]=3)=1, choose 1, assign c=1 to a=2, set tp1=1

Pop (-2,3,0), index 0 < tp1=1, so calculate diff with tp1=1 (b[1]=2)=1, and tp2=2 (b[2]=3)=0, choose 1, assign c=2 to a=3, set tp1=2

Total D=3+1+1=5

Is this optimal?

Alternative assignment: a=1 with c=4, D=3

a=2 with c=3, D=1

a=3 with c=2, D=1

Total D=5

Same as the algorithm.

Another assignment: a=1 with c=1, D=0

a=2 with c=2, D=0

a=3 with c=3, D=0

Total D=0

Not better.

So, the algorithm gives the correct maximum.

From these examples, it seems like the algorithm works correctly.

But to be thorough, let's consider a case where a has repeated elements.

n=2, m=3

a:1,1

b:1,2,3

Sort b:1,2,3

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[2]=2, push 2 with index 2

For a=1, diff with b[0]=0, diff with b[2]=2, push 2 with index 2

Max heap: (-2,1,2), (-2,1,2)

Pop (-2,1,2), assign c=3 to a=1, set tp2=1

Pop (-2,1,2), index 2 > tp2=1, so calculate diff with tp1=0 (b[0]=1)=2, and tp2=1 (b[1]=2)=1, choose 2, assign c=1 to a=1, set tp1=1

Total D=2+2=4

But the optimal should be c=3 and c=2, D=2+1=3

Wait, a=1 with c=3, D=2

a=1 with c=2, D=1

Total D=3

But the algorithm gives 4, which is higher.

Wait, is that possible?

Wait, in the algorithm, after assigning c=3 to a=1, tp2=1

Then, for the next pop, index 2 > tp2=1, so calculate diff
