Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. So, I need to find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is as large as possible.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to pick y (where y < x) such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximized.

Let me think about this. Since y has to be less than x, the maximum y can be is x - 1. So, for each x, I can iterate through all possible y from 1 to x - 1, calculate y + GCD(x, y), and pick the y that gives the maximum value.

But wait, iterating through all possible y for each x might not be efficient, especially if x can be up to 1000 and there are up to 1000 test cases. I need to think of a smarter way to find y without checking every single possibility.

Let me consider the properties of GCD. If y divides x (i.e., x is a multiple of y), then GCD(x, y) is y itself because y is a divisor of x. So, in that case, y + GCD(x, y) = y + y = 2y.

On the other hand, if y does not divide x, then GCD(x, y) will be less than y.

Therefore, if y divides x, y + GCD(x, y) = 2y, which is larger than y + some number less than y (which would be the case if y does not divide x).

So, it seems beneficial to choose y that divides x to maximize y + GCD(x, y).

Wait, but y + GCD(x, y) = y + GCD(x, y). If y divides x, then GCD(x, y) = y, so y + y = 2y. If y does not divide x, then GCD(x, y) < y, so y + GCD(x, y) < y + y = 2y.

Therefore, choosing y that divides x seems to give a higher sum.

But I need to maximize y + GCD(x, y), which for divisors of x is 2y.

So, among all divisors of x that are less than x, I should choose the largest y such that y < x.

Wait, but is that always the case?

Let's take an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 less than 10 are: 1, 2, 5.

For y = 5, y + GCD(10,5) = 5 + 5 = 10.

For y = 2, y + GCD(10,2) = 2 + 2 = 4.

For y = 1, y + GCD(10,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the maximum is indeed y = 5, with sum 10.

Another example: x = 7.

Divisors less than 7: 1.

So, y = 1, y + GCD(7,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Is there any other y that is not a divisor? For y = 2, GCD(7,2) = 1, so y + GCD = 3.

For y = 3, GCD(7,3) = 1, y + GCD = 4.

For y = 4, GCD(7,4) = 1, y + GCD = 5.

For y = 5, GCD(7,5) = 1, y + GCD = 6.

For y = 6, GCD(7,6) = 1, y + GCD = 7.

So, in this case, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is larger than y = 1's sum of 2.

But y = 6 is not a divisor of 7.

Wait, so in this case, choosing y that is not a divisor gives a higher sum.

Wait, but y + GCD(x,y) = y + 1, since GCD(7,y) = 1 for y from 2 to 6.

So, y + 1 is maximized when y is maximum, which is y = x - 1.

So, for x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 6 + 1 = 7.

But, is this always the case?

Let's take x = 6.

Divisors less than 6: 1, 2, 3.

For y = 3, y + GCD(6,3) = 3 + 3 = 6.

For y = 2, y + GCD(6,2) = 2 + 2 = 4.

For y = 1, y + GCD(6,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Non-divisors: y = 4, GCD(6,4) = 2, y + GCD = 6.

y = 5, GCD(6,5) = 1, y + GCD = 6.

So, y = 3 gives 6, y = 4 gives 6, y = 5 gives 6.

So, in this case, both divisors and non-divisors can give the same maximum sum.

Wait, but y = 3 is a divisor, and y = 4 and y = 5 are not.

But they all give the same sum.

So, perhaps choosing y = x - 1 is always optimal, regardless of whether it divides x or not.

Wait, but in the first example, x = 10, y = 5 gives 10, while y = 9 would give y + GCD(10,9) = 9 + 1 = 10, which is the same as y = 5.

So, y = 9 is not a divisor of 10, but y + GCD is still 10.

So, in this case, y = 9 is also optimal.

So, perhaps choosing y = x - 1 is always optimal.

Wait, but in x = 7, y = 6 is optimal, and in x = 10, y = 9 is optimal, and in x = 6, y = 5 is optimal.

Wait, but in x = 2, y can only be 1, since y < x.

y = 1, y + GCD(2,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, y = 1 is optimal.

Similarly, in x = 21, divisors less than 21 are 1,3,7.

y = 7, y + GCD(21,7) = 7 + 7 = 14.

But y = 20, GCD(21,20) = 1, y + GCD = 21.

Which is better than y = 7's sum of 14.

Wait, but y = 20 is not a divisor of 21.

So, in this case, y = 20 gives a higher sum than y = 7.

So, y = 20 is better.

Similarly, in x = 100, y = 99, GCD(100,99) = 1, y + GCD = 100.

While the largest divisor less than 100 is 50, y = 50, y + GCD(100,50) = 50 + 50 = 100, which is the same.

So, both y = 50 and y = 99 give the same sum.

So, in this case, choosing y = x - 1 is optimal, and it happens to be that y + GCD(x, y) = x + 1 when y = x - 1 and GCD(x, x-1) = 1, since consecutive integers are co-prime.

Wait, but x and x-1 are always co-prime, meaning GCD(x, x-1) = 1.

So, y + GCD(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x.

Similarly, for y = x - 2, GCD(x, x - 2) could be 1 or more, depending on x.

Wait, but in x = 100, y = 98, GCD(100,98) = 2, so y + GCD = 98 + 2 = 100.

Which is the same as y = 99, which gives y + GCD = 99 + 1 = 100.

Similarly, y = 50 gives y + GCD = 50 + 50 = 100.

So, multiple y's give the same sum.

But in x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is better than y = 1's sum of 2.

So, in this case, y = x - 1 is better than y = 1.

Wait, but in x = 10, y = 5 gives y + GCD = 10, and y = 9 gives y + GCD = 10.

So, both are equally good.

Similarly, in x = 100, y = 50 gives 100, y = 98 gives 100, y = 99 gives 100.

So, any of these y's are acceptable since the problem says "any y that satisfies the statement."

So, I need to find any y < x such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximum.

From the above observations, it seems that choosing y = x - 1 always gives y + GCD(x, y) = x + 1 - GCD(x, x - 1).

But since GCD(x, x - 1) = 1, y + GCD(x, y) = x - 1 + 1 = x.

Wait, but in x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is x.

But in x = 10, y = 9 gives y + GCD = 10, which is x.

Similarly, in x = 100, y = 99 gives y + GCD = 100.

So, choosing y = x - 1 gives y + GCD = x.

But in x = 10, y = 5 gives y + GCD = 10, which is x.

In x = 6, y = 5 gives y + GCD = 6, which is x.

In x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is x.

So, it seems that for any x, choosing y = x - 1 gives y + GCD = x.

But in some cases, there are other y's that also give y + GCD = x.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, y + GCD(x, y) = x implies y + GCD(x, y) = x.

So, y = x - GCD(x, y).

But GCD(x, y) divides both x and y.

So, GCD(x, y) divides x and y.

Therefore, GCD(x, y) divides x - y, which is GCD(x, y) divides GCD(x, y), which is trivial.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that y + GCD(x, y) = x.

Then, y = x - GCD(x, y).

Since GCD(x, y) divides y, and y = x - GCD(x, y), then GCD(x, y) divides x.

But GCD(x, y) already divides x by definition.

So, this seems consistent.

Therefore, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

But y has to be less than x, so d >=1.

Wait, d is GCD(x, y), which is a divisor of x.

So, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Then, GCD(x, y) = GCD(x, x - d) = GCD(x, d) = d.

Therefore, y = x - d, and GCD(x, y) = d, so y + GCD(x, y) = x - d + d = x.

So, for any divisor d of x, y = x - d will give y + GCD(x, y) = x.

Therefore, any y of the form y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will give y + GCD(x, y) = x.

Now, is x the maximum possible sum?

In the examples above, we see that y + GCD(x, y) can be equal to x.

But is there a way to get a sum greater than x?

Let's see.

Suppose y is such that y + GCD(x, y) > x.

Then, y > x - GCD(x, y).

But y < x, so x - GCD(x, y) < y < x.

But y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Then, y = x - d, and y + GCD(x, y) = x.

So, it seems that y + GCD(x, y) cannot be greater than x.

Wait, but in x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is x.

y = 5 gives y + GCD = 6, which is less than x.

Wait, no, in x = 7, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is x.

y = 5 gives y + GCD = 5 + 1 = 6, which is less than x.

Wait, but 5 is not a divisor of 7, is it?

Wait, no, 5 does not divide 7.

Wait, but earlier I thought y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

In x = 7, divisors are 1 and 7.

So, possible y = x - d:

For d = 1, y = 6.

For d = 7, y = 0, which is not allowed since y >=1.

Therefore, only y = 6 is possible in this form.

So, y = 6 gives y + GCD = 7, which is x.

Any other y would give y + GCD < x.

For example, y = 3 gives y + GCD = 3 + 1 = 4 < 7.

y = 2 gives y + GCD = 2 + 1 = 3 < 7.

y = 4 gives y + GCD = 4 + 1 = 5 < 7.

y = 5 gives y + GCD = 5 + 1 = 6 < 7.

So, in this case, y = 6 is the only y that gives y + GCD = x.

Similarly, in x = 10, y = 5 gives y + GCD = 10, and y = 9 gives y + GCD = 10.

But y = 9 is not of the form x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Wait, y = 9 in x = 10 is x - 1, which is x - d, where d =1, which is a divisor of 10.

Wait, d =1 is a divisor of 10, so y = 10 -1 =9.

Similarly, d=2 is a divisor of 10, y=10-2=8.

y=8, GCD(10,8)=2, y + GCD =10.

d=5 is a divisor of 10, y=10-5=5, y + GCD=10.

d=10 is a divisor, y=10-10=0, which is invalid.

So, y=9, y=8, y=5 all give y + GCD=10.

So, in this case, multiple y's achieve the maximum sum of x.

Therefore, to maximize y + GCD(x, y), we can choose y = x - d, where d is any divisor of x less than x.

And the sum will be x.

Now, the problem allows us to output any y that achieves this maximum sum.

So, I need to find any y < x such that y + GCD(x, y) = x.

From the above, choosing y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will satisfy this.

So, I can choose the largest possible d (less than x), which would give the smallest y.

Or I can choose the smallest possible d, which would give the largest y.

But since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, I can choose any such y.

Looking at the example outputs:

For x=10, y=5.

For x=7, y=6.

For x=21, y=18.

For x=100, y=98.

For x=2, y=1.

For x=1000, y=750.

For x=6, y=3.

Wait, in x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is x - d where d=5, which is a divisor of 10.

In x=7, y=6, which is x -1, d=1, which is a divisor of 7.

In x=21, y=18, which is x -3, d=3, which is a divisor of 21.

In x=100, y=98, which is x -2, d=2, which is a divisor of 100.

In x=2, y=1, which is x -1, d=1, which is a divisor of 2.

In x=1000, y=750, which is x -250, d=250, which is a divisor of 1000.

In x=6, y=3, which is x -3, d=3, which is a divisor of 6.

So, in all these cases, y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Now, the question is, how to choose d?

Since y has to be less than x, d has to be at least 1.

The larger d is, the smaller y is.

So, to maximize y, we should choose the smallest possible d.

The smallest d is 1, which corresponds to y = x -1.

But, as we've seen, y = x -1 gives y + GCD(x, y) = x.

Similarly, y = x - d, where d is any divisor of x, gives y + GCD(x, y) = x.

So, to maximize y, we should choose the smallest d, which is d=1.

Therefore, y = x -1 is always a valid choice that achieves y + GCD(x, y) = x.

And, as we've seen, there may be other y's that also achieve this sum.

But since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, we can always choose y = x -1.

This seems efficient, as it avoids iterating through all possible y's or all divisors of x.

So, in code, for each x, we can set y = x -1 and output it.

But let's verify this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Sample Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

Now, according to our approach, y = x -1 for each x.

So, for x=10, y=9.

But in the sample output, y=5.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 matches x-1=6.

For x=21, y=18, which is x -3.

For x=100, y=98, which is x -2.

For x=2, y=1 matches x -1=1.

For x=1000, y=750, which is x -250.

For x=6, y=3, which is x -3.

So, in these cases, y = x -1 is a valid choice, but other y's are chosen as well.

But since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, choosing y = x -1 is acceptable.

However, in the sample output for x=10, y=5 is chosen instead of y=9.

But as we saw earlier, y=5 also gives y + GCD =10, which is the maximum.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 gives y + GCD =21 + GCD(21,18)=21 + 3=24, wait, no.

Wait, GCD(21,18)=3, so y + GCD =18 +3=21.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, y + GCD(x,y) = x.

But in x=21, y=18 gives y + GCD=21, but y=20 would give y + GCD=20 +1=21.

Wait, but 20 is not less than x, since x=21.

Wait, y has to be less than x.

Wait, x=21, y=20, GCD(21,20)=1, y + GCD=21.

Similarly, y=18, GCD(21,18)=3, y + GCD=21.

So, both y=18 and y=20 give y + GCD=21.

But in the sample output, y=18 is chosen.

So, choosing y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, is acceptable.

In this case, d=3 is chosen for x=21, giving y=18.

But d=1 is also possible, giving y=20.

Both are acceptable.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is x -2, d=2.

But y=99 is also possible, d=1.

So, in code, choosing y = x -1 is acceptable, but in the sample output, y=98 is chosen for x=100.

But since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, both are correct.

So, in code, choosing y = x -1 is a valid approach.

But perhaps there is a reason to choose y = x - d, where d is the largest divisor of x less than x.

In x=10, the largest divisor less than x is 5, so y=5.

In x=21, the largest divisor less than x is 7, but in sample output y=18 is chosen, which corresponds to d=3.

Wait, in x=21, divisors less than x are 1,3,7.

Largest is 7, giving y=14.

But in sample output, y=18 is chosen, which is d=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose y such that y is maximum, but y + GCD is maximum.

Wait, but y + GCD is x in all cases where y = x - d and d is a divisor.

So, to maximize y, we should choose the smallest d.

But in x=21, y=18 is chosen, which corresponds to d=3.

While y=20 corresponds to d=1.

So, y=20 is larger than y=18.

But in the sample output, y=18 is chosen.

Is there a specific reason for choosing y=18 over y=20?

Wait, perhaps the problem prefers y to be as large as possible, but it doesn't specify that.

The problem only requires y + GCD(x,y) to be maximum, and allows any y that achieves that.

So, y=18 and y=20 both achieve y + GCD =21 for x=21.

Similarly, in x=100, y=98 and y=99 both achieve y + GCD =100.

So, choosing y = x -1 is acceptable.

But in the sample output for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is not y=x-1=9.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, not y=20.

So, perhaps there is another consideration.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants y to be as small as possible.

But in x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is y=x-1.

In x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is y=x-2.

In x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which is y=x-250.

So, it seems that y is chosen such that d is a divisor of x, and y = x - d.

But in x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is x -5.

Similarly, in x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is x -3.

In x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is x -2.

In x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which is x -250.

So, perhaps there is a pattern in choosing d.

Looking at x=10, d=5 is chosen.

x=7, d=1 is chosen.

x=21, d=3 is chosen.

x=100, d=2 is chosen.

x=2, d=1 is chosen.

x=1000, d=250 is chosen.

x=6, d=3 is chosen.

So, it seems that d is chosen such that d is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to x/2.

Wait, in x=10, d=5 is x/2.

In x=7, d=1 is less than x/2.

In x=21, d=3 is less than x/2.

Wait, no, 3 is less than 21/2=10.5.

In x=100, d=2 is less than 100/2=50.

In x=2, d=1 is less than 2/2=1.

Wait, but d=1 is equal to x/2 when x=2.

Wait, perhaps d is chosen to be the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to x/2.

In x=10, d=5 is equal to x/2.

In x=21, d=7 is less than x/2=10.5, but in sample output d=3 is chosen.

Wait, earlier I thought y=18 corresponds to d=3, but actually, y=18 corresponds to d=3.

Wait, y=18 = x - d => d=3.

But in x=21, divisors less than x are 1,3,7.

So, the largest d <= x/2 is d=7 (since 7 <=10.5), but in sample output d=3 is chosen.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, y=18 corresponds to d=3, but y=14 corresponds to d=7.

But in sample output, y=18 is chosen.

So, perhaps d is chosen to be the smallest divisor greater than x/2.

Wait, in x=10, d=5 is equal to x/2.

In x=21, d=7 is greater than x/2=10.5.

Wait, no, 7 < 10.5.

Wait, perhaps d is chosen to be the largest divisor less than or equal to x/2.

In x=10, d=5.

In x=21, d=7.

But in sample output, y=18 corresponds to d=3.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps y is chosen to be the largest possible y such that y < x and y + GCD(x,y) is maximized.

But in x=21, y=18 and y=20 both give y + GCD=21.

But y=20 is larger than y=18.

So, why is y=18 chosen?

Maybe there is another consideration.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants y to be the largest y < x such that y divides x.

Wait, but in x=21, y=18 does not divide x.

Wait, y=18 does not divide x=21.

Wait, y divides x only if x is a multiple of y.

But x=21 is not a multiple of y=18.

Wait, 21 divided by 18 is not an integer.

So, y=18 does not divide x=21.

Wait, but in x=10, y=5 divides x=10.

In x=7, y=6 does not divide x=7.

In x=2, y=1 divides x=2.

In x=100, y=98 does not divide x=100.

Wait, 100 divided by 98 is not an integer.

In x=1000, y=750 divides x=1000.

Wait, 1000 divided by 750 is 1000/750 = 4/3, which is not an integer.

Wait, y=750 does not divide x=1000.

Wait, 1000 / 750 = 1.333..., not an integer.

So, y=750 does not divide x=1000.

Similarly, in x=6, y=3 divides x=6.

So, in some cases, y divides x, in some cases, it doesn't.

So, perhaps it's not a general rule to choose y that divides x.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, y + GCD(x,y) = x, regardless of whether y divides x or not.

So, perhaps the problem allows any y that achieves y + GCD(x,y) = x.

So, in code, I can choose y = x - d, where d is any divisor of x.

To make it efficient, I can choose d=1, so y = x -1.

But in the sample output, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is x -5.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is x -3.

So, perhaps the problem expects y to be as large as possible, but still achieving y + GCD(x,y) = x.

So, to maximize y, choose the smallest d.

But in x=10, d=1 would give y=9, but in sample output y=5 is chosen.

Wait, perhaps there is a different approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate y from x-1 down to 1, and pick the first y that maximizes y + GCD(x,y).

In x=10, y=9 gives y + GCD=10, which is maximum.

But in sample output, y=5 is chosen.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants y to be less than x/2.

But in x=10, y=5 is equal to x/2.

In x=21, y=18 is greater than x/2=10.5.

In x=7, y=6 is greater than x/2=3.5.

In x=100, y=98 is greater than x/2=50.

In x=2, y=1 is less than x/2=1.

Wait, but x=2, y=1 is equal to x/2.

So, perhaps y should be greater than or equal to x/2.

Wait, but in x=10, y=5 is equal to x/2.

In x=21, y=18 is greater than x/2.

In x=7, y=6 is greater than x/2.

In x=100, y=98 is greater than x/2.

In x=2, y=1 is equal to x/2.

In x=1000, y=750 is greater than x/2=500.

In x=6, y=3 is equal to x/2=3.

So, in all sample outputs, y is greater than or equal to x/2.

Is this a general rule?

Wait, in x=10, y=5 is equal to x/2.

But y=9 is greater than x/2.

But in sample output, y=5 is chosen.

So, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants y to be as small as possible.

But in x=7, y=6 is large.

So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants y to be a divisor of x.

But in x=7, y=6 is not a divisor of 7.

In x=10, y=5 is a divisor of 10.

In x=21, y=18 is not a divisor of 21.

Wait, but earlier analysis shows that y + GCD(x,y) = x regardless of whether y divides x or not, as long as y = x - d, where d divides x.

So, perhaps the problem wants y to be x - d, where d is the smallest divisor of x.

In x=10, smallest d=1, y=9.

But in sample output, y=5 is chosen, which corresponds to d=5.

Wait, perhaps d is chosen to be the largest divisor less than x.

In x=10, largest d less than x is 5, y=5.

In x=7, largest d less than x is 1, y=6.

In x=21, largest d less than x is 7, y=14.

But in sample output, y=18 is chosen, which corresponds to d=3.

So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps d is chosen to be the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to x/2.

In x=10, d=5.

In x=7, d=1.

In x=21, d=7.

But in sample output for x=21, y=18 corresponds to d=3.

So, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe d is chosen to be the smallest divisor greater than 1.

In x=10, smallest d greater than 1 is 2, y=8.

But in sample output, y=5 corresponds to d=5.

Wait, perhaps not.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps the problem allows any y that achieves y + GCD(x,y) = x.

So, in code, I can choose y = x -1, which is always acceptable.

But in the sample output, for x=10, y=5 is chosen.

But since the problem allows any such y, choosing y = x -1 is acceptable.

So, to make it efficient, I can choose y = x -1 for each x.

Now, let's look at the provided program.

The main function reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads x and computes y using func_1(x), then prints y.

So, I need to analyze func_1 to see if it correctly computes y.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(x):

"""Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Args:

x: The given integer.

Returns:

The optimal y.

"""

max_val = 1

for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):

if x % y == 0:

if 2 * y >= x:

return y

max_val = y

return max_val

So, func_1 initializes max_val to 1.

Then, it iterates y from x-1 down to 2 (since step is -1 and it stops at y=2).

For each y, it checks if x % y == 0, i.e., if y divides x.

If y divides x and 2*y >= x, it returns y immediately.

Otherwise, it sets max_val to y.

After the loop, it returns max_val.

So, in other words, it looks for the largest y < x that divides x and for which 2*y >=x.

If such a y is found, it returns it.

If no such y is found, it returns 1.

Wait, but in the sample input x=7, y=6 is chosen.

But y=6 does not divide x=7.

So, according to this function, for x=7:

y=6: x%6 !=0, so skips.

y=5: x%5 !=0, skips.

y=4: x%4 !=0, skips.

y=3: x%3 !=0, skips.

y=2: x%2 !=0, skips.

Then, max_val is set to 2.

But in the sample output, y=6 is chosen.

So, this function would return y=2 for x=7, but the sample output is y=6.

So, this function is incorrect for x=7.

Wait, but according to the function, it sets max_val to y in each iteration.

So, for x=7:

y=6: x%6 !=0, so max_val=6.

y=5: x%5 !=0, so max_val=5.

y=4: x%4 !=0, so max_val=4.

y=3: x%3 !=0, so max_val=3.

y=2: x%2 !=0, so max_val=2.

Then, it returns max_val=2.

But sample output is y=6.

So, the function is incorrect for x=7.

Similarly, for x=10:

y=9: x%9 !=0, max_val=9.

y=8: x%8 !=0, max_val=8.

y=7: x%7 !=0, max_val=7.

y=6: x%6 ==0, and 2*6=12 >=10, so return y=6.

But in sample output, y=5 is chosen.

So, the function returns y=6 for x=10, but sample output is y=5.

So, again, discrepancy.

Similarly, for x=21:

y=20: x%20 !=0, max_val=20.

y=19: x%19 !=0, max_val=19.

...

y=18: x%18 !=0, max_val=18.

...

y=3: x%3 ==0, and 2*3=6 <21, so skip.

y=2: x%2 ==0, and 2*2=4 <21, so skip.

y=1: not included.

Then, return max_val=20.

But sample output is y=18.

So, again, discrepancy.

Wait, but according to the function, for y=18, x%18 !=0, so it sets max_val=18.

Wait, x=21 % 18 is 3, which is not 0, so x%18 !=0.

So, it should set max_val=18.

Then, continue to y=17: x%17 !=0, max_val=17.

...

Until y=3: x%3 ==0, and 2*3=6 <21, so no return.

Then, return max_val=20.

But in sample output, y=18 is chosen.

So, the function seems to return y=20 for x=21, but sample output is y=18.

Wait, but in x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is x -2, and d=2 divides x=100.

So, in the function, y=98: x%98 !=0, max_val=98.

y=97: x%97 !=0, max_val=97.

...

y=50: x%50 ==0, and 2*50=100 >=100, so return y=50.

Wait, but sample output is y=98.

So, the function would return y=50 for x=100, but sample output is y=98.

So, again, discrepancy.

Similarly, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen.

Let's see what the function does for x=1000.

y=999: x%999 !=0, max_val=999.

y=998: x%998 !=0, max_val=998.

...

y=500: x%500 ==0, and 2*500=1000 >=1000, so return y=500.

But sample output is y=750.

So, discrepancy again.

For x=6:

y=5: x%5 !=0, max_val=5.

y=4: x%4 !=0, max_val=4.

y=3: x%3 ==0, and 2*3=6 >=6, so return y=3.

Which matches sample output y=3.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Similarly, for x=2:

y=1: not included in loop, so return max_val=1.

Which matches sample output y=1.

So, in summary, for x=7, function would return y=2, but sample output is y=6.

For x=10, function returns y=6, sample output is y=5.

For x=21, function returns y=20, sample output is y=18.

For x=100, function returns y=50, sample output is y=98.

For x=2, function returns y=1, sample output is y=1.

For x=1000, function returns y=500, sample output is y=750.

For x=6, function returns y=3, sample output is y=3.

So, in some cases, it matches, in others, it doesn't.

But since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, both are acceptable.

So, perhaps the function is acceptable.

But in x=7, function returns y=2, which gives y + GCD(7,2)=3, which is less than the maximum possible sum of 7.

Wait, in x=7, y=6 gives y + GCD=7, which is maximum.

But function returns y=2, which gives y + GCD=3.

Which is not maximum.

So, in this case, the function is incorrect.

Similarly, in x=10, function returns y=6, which gives y + GCD=10, which is maximum.

Sample output is y=5, which also gives y + GCD=10.

So, both are acceptable.

In x=21, function returns y=20, which gives y + GCD=21, which is maximum.

Sample output is y=18, which also gives y + GCD=21.

So, both are acceptable.

In x=100, function returns y=50, which gives y + GCD=100, which is maximum.

Sample output is y=98, which also gives y + GCD=100.

So, both are acceptable.

In x=2, function returns y=1, which gives y + GCD=2, which is maximum.

In x=1000, function returns y=500, which gives y + GCD=1000, which is maximum.

Sample output is y=750, which also gives y + GCD=1000.

In x=6, function returns y=3, which gives y + GCD=6, which is maximum.

So, in x=7, the function returns y=2, which is incorrect because it does not achieve the maximum sum.

In all other cases, the function returns y that achieves the maximum sum.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the function for x=7.

Looking back at the function:

def func_1(x):

max_val = 1

for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):

if x % y == 0:

if 2 * y >= x:

return y

max_val = y

return max_val

So, for x=7:

y=6: x%
