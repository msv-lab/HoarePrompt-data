Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. So, I need to find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is as large as possible.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to pick y (where y < x) such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximized.

Let me think about this. Since y has to be less than x, the maximum y can be is x - 1. So, for each x, I can iterate through all possible y from 1 to x - 1, calculate y + GCD(x, y), and pick the y that gives the maximum value.

But, iterating through all possible y for each x might not be efficient, especially if x can be up to 1000 and there are up to 1000 test cases. So, I need a smarter way to find the y that maximizes y + GCD(x, y).

Let me consider the properties of GCD. If y divides x, then GCD(x, y) = y, because y is a divisor of x. In that case, y + GCD(x, y) = y + y = 2y.

If y does not divide x, then GCD(x, y) is less than y. So, y + GCD(x, y) would be less than y + y = 2y.

Wait a minute, if y divides x, then GCD(x, y) = y, and y + GCD(x, y) = 2y. If y does not divide x, then GCD(x, y) < y, so y + GCD(x, y) < 2y.

Therefore, the maximum value of y + GCD(x, y) would be achieved when y divides x, because in that case, y + GCD(x, y) = 2y, which is larger than y + anything less than y.

So, to maximize y + GCD(x, y), I should choose y to be the largest possible divisor of x that is less than x.

Wait, but let's verify this with an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. But y has to be less than x, so y can be 1, 2, or 5.

Now, y + GCD(x, y):

- For y=1: 1 + GCD(10,1) = 1 + 1 = 2

- For y=2: 2 + GCD(10,2) = 2 + 2 = 4

- For y=5: 5 + GCD(10,5) = 5 + 5 = 10

So, the maximum is 10, achieved when y=5.

In the sample input, for x=10, the output is 5, which matches this.

Another example: x=7.

Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. y can be 1.

y + GCD(7,1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

But in the sample input, for x=7, the output is 6.

Wait, but 6 is not a divisor of 7. GCD(7,6) is 1.

So, 6 + 1 = 7.

But according to my earlier logic, the maximum should be achieved when y is the largest divisor less than x, which is 1 in this case. But 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 6 + 1 = 7.

So, my earlier assumption is not correct.

Hmm.

Wait, in this case, y=6 gives y + GCD(7,6) = 6 + 1 = 7, which is larger than y=1 giving 1 + 1 = 2.

So, in this case, y=6 is better than y=1, even though 6 is not a divisor of 7.

So, my initial assumption that the maximum is achieved when y is the largest divisor less than x is not always true.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that y + GCD(x, y).

I can write this as y + d, where d = GCD(x, y).

Now, d divides both x and y.

Since d divides x and y, y must be a multiple of d.

So, y = k * d for some integer k >=1.

Then, y + d = k*d + d = d*(k + 1).

But since y < x, k*d < x.

Also, since d divides x, x = m*d for some integer m.

So, k*d < m*d, which implies k < m.

So, k can be from 1 to m-1.

Therefore, y + d = d*(k + 1), where k < m.

To maximize y + d = d*(k + 1), I need to maximize d*(k + 1), given that k*d < x and d divides x.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider that for a fixed d (divisor of x), the possible y are the multiples of d that are less than x.

So, y can be d, 2d, 3d, ..., up to the largest multiple less than x.

For each d, the corresponding y + d is y + d.

But since d is fixed for a particular divisor, and y is a multiple of d, y + d is maximized when y is maximized.

So, for each d, the maximum y is the largest multiple of d less than x.

Therefore, for each divisor d of x, I can compute the largest y that is a multiple of d and less than x, which is floor(x/d) * d.

Then, y + d = floor(x/d) * d + d.

But I need to maximize this over all divisors d of x.

Wait, but y has to be less than x, so floor(x/d) * d < x.

Actually, floor(x/d) is the largest integer k such that k*d < x.

So, y = k*d, where k = floor(x/d).

Then, y + d = k*d + d = (k + 1)*d.

I need to maximize (k + 1)*d over all divisors d of x, where k = floor(x/d), and k >=1.

Wait, but k is determined by d, as k = floor(x/d).

So, for each divisor d of x, compute k = floor(x/d), then compute (k + 1)*d, and choose the d that maximizes this expression.

Then, y = k*d.

This seems like a way to proceed.

Let me try this with x=7.

Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7.

But y < x, so d cannot be 7, because floor(7/7)*7 = 1*7 = 7, which is not less than 7.

So, only d=1.

k = floor(7/1) = 7.

y = 7*1 = 7, which is not less than 7. So, invalid.

Wait, but y has to be less than x.

So, for d=1, y = floor(7/1)*1 = 7*1 =7, which is not less than x.

So, need y < x, which means k*d < x.

In this case, k = floor(x/d) -1, because k*d < x.

Wait, perhaps I need k = floor((x-1)/d).

Let me recast this.

For each divisor d of x, the largest k such that k*d < x is k = floor((x-1)/d).

Then, y = k*d.

Then, y + d = k*d + d = (k +1)*d.

So, I need to maximize (k +1)*d over all divisors d of x, where k = floor((x-1)/d).

Wait, but (k +1)*d = (floor((x-1)/d) +1)*d.

But floor((x-1)/d) +1 = ceil(x/d).

So, y + d = ceil(x/d)*d.

Wait, but ceil(x/d)*d is the smallest multiple of d that is greater than or equal to x.

But y has to be less than x, so y = floor((x-1)/d)*d.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try with x=7.

Divisors of 7: 1.

For d=1, k = floor((7-1)/1) = 6.

y = 6*1 =6.

y + d =6 +1=7.

Which matches the sample output.

Another example: x=10.

Divisors of 10:1,2,5.

For d=1, k=floor(9/1)=9, y=9*1=9, y+d=10.

For d=2, k=floor(9/2)=4, y=4*2=8, y+d=10.

For d=5, floor(9/5)=1, y=1*5=5, y+d=10.

So, all give y+d=10.

But in the sample, y=5 is chosen.

So, in cases where multiple y give the same y+d, any y is acceptable.

Another example: x=2.

Divisors:1.

d=1, k=floor(1/1)=1, y=1*1=1, y+d=2.

So, y=1 is correct.

Another example: x=21.

Divisors:1,3,7,21.

y <21, so d=1,3,7.

For d=1, k=floor(20/1)=20, y=20*1=20, y+d=21.

For d=3, k=floor(20/3)=6, y=6*3=18, y+d=21.

For d=7, k=floor(20/7)=2, y=2*7=14, y+d=15.

So, y=18 or y=20 both give y+d=21.

In the sample, y=18 is chosen.

Similarly, for x=100.

Divisors:1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.

y <100, so d=1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50.

For d=1, k=floor(99/1)=99, y=99*1=99, y+d=100.

For d=2, k=floor(99/2)=49, y=49*2=98, y+d=100.

For d=4, k=floor(99/4)=24, y=24*4=96, y+d=100.

For d=5, k=floor(99/5)=19, y=19*5=95, y+d=100.

For d=10, k=floor(99/10)=9, y=9*10=90, y+d=100.

For d=20, k=floor(99/20)=4, y=4*20=80, y+d=100.

For d=25, k=floor(99/25)=3, y=3*25=75, y+d=100.

For d=50, k=floor(99/50)=1, y=1*50=50, y+d=100.

So, all divisors give y+d=100.

In the sample, y=98 is chosen.

Again, multiple y give the same y+d.

Another example: x=1000.

Divisors:1,2,4,5,8,10,20,25,40,50,100,125,200,250,500,1000.

y <1000, so d=1,2,4,5,8,10,20,25,40,50,100,125,200,250,500.

For d=1, k=floor(999/1)=999, y=999*1=999, y+d=1000.

For d=2, k=floor(999/2)=499, y=499*2=998, y+d=1000.

...

For d=750, k=floor(999/750)=1, y=750, y+d=1500.

Wait, d=750?

Wait, 750 is not a divisor of 1000.

Wait, 1000 divided by 750 is not an integer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen.

But 750 does not divide 1000.

Wait, 1000 divided by 750 is 1.333, which is not an integer.

So, GCD(1000,750) is 250.

So, y + d =750 +250=1000.

Wait, but in my earlier calculations, for d=250, y= floor(999/250)=3, y=3*250=750, y+d=750+250=1000.

So, it matches.

But according to my earlier approach, for d=250, y=750, y+d=1000.

But d=250 is a divisor of 1000.

Wait, but in the sample, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

But earlier, for x=7, y=6 was chosen, which corresponds to d=1, y=6, y+d=7.

Wait, but in that case, d=1, y=6, y+d=7.

But there is a larger d=1, y=6, y+d=7.

But for d=1, y=6, which is not a multiple of d=1, but 1 divides everything.

Wait, no, y=6 is a multiple of d=1.

Wait, but in this case, y=6 is the largest y less than x=7.

Wait, but in x=7, divisors are 1 and 7.

But y < x, so only d=1.

Then, y = floor((7-1)/1)*1 =6*1=6.

y + d=6+1=7.

Similarly, for x=1000, d=250, y=750, y+d=1000.

But in x=1000, d=250 is a divisor, and y=750 is floor(999/250)*250=3*250=750.

So, in general, for each divisor d of x, y = floor((x-1)/d)*d.

Then, y + d = floor((x-1)/d)*d + d.

To maximize y + d, I need to maximize floor((x-1)/d)*d + d.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can observe that y + d = y + GCD(x,y).

But since d = GCD(x,y), and y is a multiple of d, y = k*d.

So, y + d = k*d + d = d*(k +1).

To maximize d*(k +1), given that y < x, i.e., k*d < x.

Given that d divides x, x = m*d for some integer m.

So, k*d < x => k < m.

So, k can be from 1 to m-1.

Thus, y + d = d*(k +1), where k < m.

So, y + d = d*(k +1), with k <= floor((x-1)/d).

Wait, but k must be <= floor((x-1)/d).

So, for each d, the maximum y + d is d*(floor((x-1)/d) +1).

But floor((x-1)/d) +1 = ceil(x/d).

So, y + d = d * ceil(x/d).

But ceil(x/d) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x/d.

So, y + d = d * ceil(x/d).

But I need to maximize d * ceil(x/d) over all divisors d of x.

Wait, but ceil(x/d) is x/d if d divides x, which it does since d is a divisor of x.

So, ceil(x/d) = x/d.

Thus, y + d = d * (x/d) = x.

Wait, but in the sample input, for x=7, y=6, y+d=7.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5, y+d=10.

So, in these cases, y + d =x.

But for x=1000, y=750, y+d=1000.

Wait, but 750 + 250 =1000.

Wait, but 250 is a divisor of 1000, and 1000/250=4.

So, ceil(1000/250)=4, so y + d =250*4=1000.

Similarly, for x=7, d=1, ceil(7/1)=7, y + d=1*7=7.

But y=6, which is floor((7-1)/1)*1=6.

Wait, but y + d=6+1=7, which matches.

Similarly, for x=10, d=5, y=5, y+d=10.

So, in general, y + d =x.

Wait, but in x=7, d=1, y=6, y+d=7.

If d=1, y=6, which is x-1.

Similarly, for x=10, d=5, y=5, y+d=10.

So, y + d =x.

So, perhaps the maximum value of y + d is x, and it can be achieved when y =x - d.

But d divides x, so d divides x - y, which is d divides y.

Wait, y =x - d.

Since d divides x and d divides d, then d divides y.

So, GCD(x,y)=d.

Therefore, y + d = (x - d) + d =x.

So, for any divisor d of x, y =x - d, and y + d =x.

Therefore, the maximum value of y + d is x, and it can be achieved for any divisor d of x by setting y =x - d.

But in the sample input for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which corresponds to d=1.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5 corresponds to d=5.

For x=1000, y=750 corresponds to d=250.

Wait, but y=750, d=250, y+d=1000.

But y =x - d, which is 1000 -250=750.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 corresponds to d=1, y=7-1=6.

For x=10, y=5 corresponds to d=5, y=10-5=5.

So, in general, for any divisor d of x, y =x - d, and y + d =x.

Therefore, the maximum value of y + d is x, and it can be achieved for any divisor d of x by setting y =x - d.

So, to maximize y + d, we can choose any divisor d of x and set y =x - d.

But in the problem, it says to choose any y that maximizes y + d.

So, we can choose y =x - d for any divisor d of x.

But among all possible y, which one to choose?

In the sample input, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which corresponds to d=5.

But y=9 would also give y + d=10, since d=1.

Wait, no, y=9 corresponds to d=1, y=9, y+d=10.

Similarly, y=8 corresponds to d=2, y=8, y+d=10.

y=5 corresponds to d=5, y=5, y+d=10.

y=0 is not allowed, since y >=1.

So, any y that is x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will give y + d =x.

So, in the sample input, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, but y=8 or y=9 would also work.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is x -1.

So, in general, choosing y =x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will maximize y + d to x.

But which d to choose?

The problem says to choose any y that maximizes y + d.

So, we can choose any d that is a divisor of x, and set y =x - d.

But in the code provided, it seems to choose y as the largest y less than x that divides x.

Wait, but in the code, it's defined as:

def func_1(x):

"""Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Args:

x: The given integer.

Returns:

The optimal y.

"""

max_val =1

for y in range(x -1,1,-1):

if x % y ==0:

if 2 * y >=x:

return y

max_val =y

return max_val

So, it's iterating y from x-1 down to 2.

For each y, if x % y ==0, i.e., y divides x.

Then, if 2*y >=x, it returns y immediately.

Otherwise, it sets max_val to y.

At the end, returns max_val, which would be the largest y that divides x, but not satisfying 2*y >=x.

Wait, but in the sample input for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which satisfies 2*5=10 >=10.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 does not divide x, but in the code, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, but x%6 !=0.

Wait, but in the code, it only considers y that divide x.

So, for x=7, y=6 does not divide x, so it would not be considered.

Wait, but in the sample input, y=6 is chosen for x=7.

But according to the code, for x=7, y=6 is not considered because 7%6 !=0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's see.

In the code, it iterates y from x-1 down to 2.

For each y, if x % y ==0, i.e., y divides x.

Then, if 2*y >=x, it returns y immediately.

Otherwise, it sets max_val to y.

At the end, returns max_val.

So, for x=10, y=5 divides 10, and 2*5=10 >=10, so it returns 5.

For x=7, y=6 does not divide 7, so it's not considered.

Then y=5 does not divide 7, y=4 does not, y=3 does not, y=2 does not.

So, it returns max_val=1.

But in the sample input, for x=7, y=6 is chosen.

So, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, y does not have to divide x.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, y + d =x, where d divides x.

But y does not necessarily divide x.

Wait, in the case of x=7, y=6, d=GCD(7,6)=1, which divides 7.

So, d divides x.

But y=6 does not divide x.

So, y does not have to divide x.

But in the code, it only considers y that divide x.

So, that seems to be a mistake.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, y =x - d, where d divides x.

So, y does not necessarily divide x, unless d=1.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, it only considers y that divide x.

But according to the earlier analysis, y does not have to divide x.

So, perhaps the code is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps the condition if 2*y >=x is incorrect.

Wait, let's think about 2*y >=x.

If y >=x/2, then y + d >= y +1 >= x/2 +1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to choose y such that y >=x/2.

But in the sample input, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=3.5.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is equal to x/2=5.

For x=2, y=1 is chosen, which is less than x/2=1.

But in the code, for x=2, y=1 is considered, since 2*1=2 >=2, so it returns 1.

For x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=500.

Wait, but 750 >=1000/2=500, so it satisfies 2*y >=x.

Wait, 2*750=1500 >=1000.

So, in this case, it would return y=750.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=10.5.

2*18=36 >=21, so it would return y=18.

For x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=50.

2*98=196 >=100, so it would return y=98.

For x=2, y=1 is chosen, which is equal to x/2=1.

2*1=2 >=2, so it returns y=1.

For x=6, y=3 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=3.

2*3=6 >=6, so it returns y=3.

Wait, but for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is greater than x/2=3.5.

But in the code, for x=7, y=6 does not divide x, so it's not considered.

Hence, the code returns y=1, which is incorrect according to the sample input.

So, perhaps the code is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be y >=x/2.

But y=1 for x=7 is less than x/2=3.5, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code should choose y = floor(x/2).

But for x=7, floor(7/2)=3, but in the sample input, y=6 is chosen.

So, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps y should be the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

For x=7, y=6 >=3.5.

For x=10, y=5 >=5.

For x=21, y=18 >=10.5.

For x=100, y=98 >=50.

For x=2, y=1 >=1.

For x=1000, y=750 >=500.

For x=6, y=3 >=3.

So, in general, y should be the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

But in the code, it's choosing y that divides x and y >=x/2.

But in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, but in the sample input, y=6 is chosen.

So, perhaps the condition is y >=x/2, regardless of whether y divides x.

Wait, but in the code, it only considers y that divide x and y >=x/2.

But in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, so it's not considered.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

Then, y + d, where d=GCD(x,y).

In x=7, y=6, d=1, y+d=7.

In x=10, y=5, d=5, y+d=10.

In x=21, y=18, d=3, y+d=21.

In x=100, y=98, d=2, y+d=100.

In x=2, y=1, d=1, y+d=2.

In x=1000, y=750, d=250, y+d=1000.

In x=6, y=3, d=3, y+d=6.

So, in all these cases, y + d =x.

Hence, to maximize y + d, set y to be the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

Then, y + d =x.

So, in the code, it should choose y to be the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

But in the provided code, it chooses y that divides x and y >=x/2.

But in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, but y=6 >=7/2=3.5, and y=6 is less than x=7.

So, perhaps the code should be choosing y to be the largest y less than x such that y >=x/2.

But in the code, it's choosing y that divides x and y >=x/2.

Which works in some cases, but not in x=7.

Wait, in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, so it's not considered, and it returns y=1, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correct approach is to choose y to be the largest integer less than x such that y >=x/2.

Then, y + d =x, where d=GCD(x,y).

Hence, y = floor(x -1), but ensuring that y >=x/2.

Wait, but for x=7, y=6 >=3.5.

For x=10, y=5 >=5.

For x=2, y=1 >=1.

For x=1000, y=750 >=500.

Wait, but y=750 is less than x=1000, and >=500.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 >=10.5.

For x=100, y=98 >=50.

For x=6, y=3 >=3.

So, in general, y = floor(x -1), but at least ceil(x/2)).

Wait, but floor(x -1) is x -1, but in x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is x -1=6 >=ceil(7/2)=4.

Wait, ceil(7/2)=4.

Wait, ceil(7/2)=4?

Wait, 7/2=3.5, ceil(3.5)=4.

But in the sample input, y=6 >=4.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5 >=5.

For x=21, y=18 >=11.

Wait, ceil(21/2)=11.

But y=18 >=11.

For x=100, y=98 >=50.

For x=2, y=1 >=1.

For x=1000, y=750 >=500.

For x=6, y=3 >=3.

So, in general, y should be the largest integer less than x such that y >= ceil(x/2).

Hence, y = min(x -1, ceil(x/2)).

Wait, but for x=7, ceil(x/2)=4, but y=6 >=4.

But y=6 is larger than ceil(x/2)=4.

So, y should be the largest y less than x such that y >= ceil(x/2).

Which is y =x -1, as long as x -1 >= ceil(x/2).

Otherwise, y = ceil(x/2).

Wait, but for x=2, ceil(x/2)=1, and x -1=1, which is acceptable.

For x=7, ceil(x/2)=4, and x -1=6 >=4, so y=6.

For x=10, ceil(x/2)=5, x -1=9 >=5, so y=9, but in the sample input, y=5 is chosen.

Wait, but in the sample input, y=5 is chosen for x=10.

But according to this logic, y=9 is acceptable.

But the problem allows any y that maximizes y + d.

Since y=9 for x=10 gives y + d=10, same as y=5.

So, both are acceptable.

Hence, choosing y=9 is also correct.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, which is acceptable.

So, in general, to maximize y + d, set y to be the largest possible less than x such that y >= ceil(x/2).

Hence, y =x -1, as long as x -1 >= ceil(x/2).

Otherwise, y = ceil(x/2).

But for x >=3, x -1 >= ceil(x/2), since x -1 >= (x +1)/2 for x >=3.

Wait, x -1 >= (x +1)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: 2x -2 >=x +1 => x >=3.

So, for x >=3, x -1 >= ceil(x/2).

For x=2, ceil(x/2)=1, and x -1=1, which is equal.

Hence, for x >=2, y =x -1 is acceptable.

But in the sample input, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is not x -1=9.

But y=9 is also acceptable.

So, perhaps the code can choose y =x -1, as long as y >= ceil(x/2).

Otherwise, y = ceil(x/2).

But in practice, for x >=3, y =x -1 is acceptable.

For x=2, y=1 is acceptable.

Hence, in the code, it can simply choose y =x -1 for x >=3, and y=1 for x=2.

But in the provided code, it chooses y that divides x and y >=x/2.

But for x=7, y=6 does not divide x, so it's not considered, and it returns y=1, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to choose y =x -1, as long as y >= ceil(x/2).

Otherwise, y = ceil(x/2).

Hence, in the code, for x >=3, set y =x -1.

For x=2, set y=1.

This would match the sample input.

For x=7, y=6.

For x=10, y=9.

For x=21, y=20.

For x=100, y=99.

For x=2, y=1.

For x=1000, y=999.

For x=6, y=5.

But in the sample input, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is also acceptable.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is also acceptable.

But y=20 for x=21 is also acceptable.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is chosen, but y=99 is also acceptable.

So, in general, choosing y =x -1 is acceptable, but the code chooses y that divides x and y >=x/2.

Hence, the code is incorrect for x=7.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to choose y =x -d, where d is the smallest divisor of x that is >=x/2.

Wait, y =x -d, where d is a divisor of x.

So, y + d =x.

To maximize y, we need to minimize d.

Hence, choose d to be the smallest divisor of x that is >=x/2.

Then, y =x -d would be maximized.

Wait, but in x=7, the smallest divisor >=x/2=3.5 is d=4, but 4 does not divide 7.

Wait, divisors of 7 are 1 and 7.

So, d=7 is the only divisor >=3.5.

Then, y =7 -7=0, which is invalid.

But y has to be >=1.

So, in this case, choose the next smallest divisor, which is d=1.

Then, y=7-1=6.

Hence, y=6.

Similarly, for x=10, divisors are 1,2,5,10.

x/2=5.

So, d=5 and d=10 are >=5.

Choose d=5, y=10-5=5.

Alternatively, d=10, y=10-10=0, invalid.

So, y=5.

For x=21, divisors are 1,3,7,21.

x/2=10.5.

So, d=21 >=10.5.

y=21-21=0, invalid.

Next, d=7 <10.5, which is less than x/2.

So, choose d=3, which is less than x/2.

But need d >=x/2.

Only d=21 >=10.5.

But y=0 is invalid.

Hence, choose d=7, which is less than x/2.

But according to the earlier analysis, y =x -d, where d is the smallest divisor >=x/2.

If d=x, then y=0, invalid.

Hence, choose d as the smallest divisor >=x/2, but y must be >=1.

So, if d=x, y=0 invalid.

Then, choose the next smallest d that is less than x, but as close to x as possible.

Wait, in x=7, d=7 is invalid, so choose d=1, y=6.

In x=10, d=5, y=5.

In x=21, d=21 is invalid, so choose d=7, y=14.

Wait, but in the sample input, y=18 is chosen for x=21.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose d to be the largest divisor <=x/2.

Wait, for x=21, x/2=10.5.

Divisors are 1,3,7,21.

So, d=7 <=10.5.

Then, y=21-7=14.

But in the sample input, y=18 is chosen.

Wait, but 18 is not x -d for any d.

Wait, x=21, d=3, y=21-3=18.

But d=3 <=10.5.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose d to be the smallest divisor >=ceil(x/2).

Wait, ceil(x/2)=11 for x=21.

So, d=21 >=11, y=0 invalid.

Next, d=7 <11, so skip.

d=3 <11, skip.

Only d=21 >=11, but y=0 invalid.

Hence, no valid d, so choose y=1.

But in the sample input, y=18 is chosen.

So, perhaps the earlier approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose y to be the largest y < x such that y >= ceil(x/2).

Hence, y = min(x -1, ceil(x/2)).

But for x=7, y=6.

For x=10, y=9.

For x=21, y=20.

But in the sample input, y=18 is chosen for x=21.

Which is also acceptable, since y=18 + d=3 =21.

Similarly, y=20 + d=1 =21.

Both are acceptable.

Hence, in the code, it can choose y to be the largest y < x such that y >= ceil(x/2).

Hence, y =x -1, as long as x -1 >= ceil(x/2).

Otherwise, y= ceil(x/2).

But for x >=3, x -1 >= ceil(x/2).

Since x -1 >= (x +1)/2.

So, for x >=3, y =x -1.

For x=2, y=1.

Hence, in code, for x >=3, y =x -1.

For x=2, y=1.

This would match the sample input.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it only considers y that divide x and y >=x/2.

But in reality, y does not have to divide x, as long as y >= ceil(x/2).

Hence, the code should be modified to set y =x -1 for x >=3, and y=1 for x=2.

But in the provided code, it's choosing y that divides x and y >=x/2.

Which works for some x, but not for x=7.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \). 

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to maximize \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \).
    - Since \( y < x \), the maximum \( y \) can be \( x - 1 \).

2. **Key Insights**:
    - If \( y \) divides \( x \), then \( \text{GCD}(x, y) = y \), making \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = 2y \).
    - If \( y \) does not divide \( x \), \( \text{GCD}(x, y) < y \), making \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) < 2y \).

3. **Optimal Choice of \( y \)**:
    - To maximize \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \), choose \( y \) as large as possible, specifically \( y = x - 1 \), ensuring \( y \geq \lceil x / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Special Cases**:
    - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) is the only option.

## Solution Code

```python
def find_y(x):
    if x == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return x - 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        x = int(data[i])
        y = find_y(x)
        print(y)
```

## Explanation

- **Function `find_y(x)`**:
    - For \( x = 2 \), directly return \( y = 1 \).
    - For \( x \geq 3 \), return \( y = x - 1 \).

- **Main Function**:
    - Read the input values.
    - For each test case, read \( x \) and compute \( y \) using `find_y
