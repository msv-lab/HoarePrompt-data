Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid with rows and columns, and each cell is either white ('W') or black ('B'). The operation allowed is that I can pick any two squares of the same color, and then turn all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners to that color.

The goal is to determine whether it's possible, after performing any number of these operations, to make the entire grid have squares of the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B'.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all the squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero.

I need to think about what this operation allows me to do in terms of changing the grid. It seems like it's a way to propagate a color across rectangular regions, provided I can find two squares of that color to define the rectangle.

One key observation is that if I have two squares of the same color, I can turn the entire rectangle between them to that color. So, if I can connect different parts of the grid through these operations, I might be able to make the entire grid uniform.

But, I need to find a way to determine whether it's possible to make all squares the same color based on the initial configuration.

Looking at the sample input and output, there are cases where it's possible and where it's not. For example, in the first test case:

2 1

W

B

Here, the grid has two rows and one column, with the first cell 'W' and the second 'B'. Since they are different and there's no way to change them using the operation (because any operation would require selecting two squares of the same color, which would only affect themselves in this case), it's impossible to make them the same. So, the output is 'NO'.

In the second test case:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

The output is 'YES', meaning it's possible to make all squares the same color after some operations.

I need to find a general approach to determine this for any given grid.

Let me think about connected components or regions of the grid that share the same color and can be connected through the operations.

Perhaps I can model the grid in terms of graphs, where each cell is a node, and edges connect cells that are in the same row or same column and have the same color.

If I can find a way to connect all cells through such paths, then I might be able to make the entire grid uniform.

Wait, but that might be too time-consuming for large grids, especially since n and m can be up to 500, and t can be up to 10^4, with the total sum of n*m being up to 3*10^5.

I need an efficient way to check this.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be checking some conditions related to the first and last rows and columns.

Let's see what the program is doing.

It reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Reads n and m, the number of rows and columns.

- Reads the grid, storing each row in a list called a.

- Constructs two strings: first_row and last_row.

- first_row is composed of the first character of each row.

- last_row is composed of the last character of each row.

Then, it checks:

- If the first row is uniform (all same color) and the last row is uniform but different from the first, it prints 'NO'.

- If the first column is uniform and the last column is uniform but different, it prints 'NO'.

- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Wait, actually, in the code:

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

Wait, a[-1] is the last row.

So, first_row is the first column, and last_row is the last column.

Wait, no, first_row is being built by taking the first character of each row, so it's the first column.

Similarly, last_row is built by taking the last character of each row, so it's the last column.

Then, it checks if the first row (which is actually the first column) is uniform and the last row (last column) is uniform, and they are different, then 'NO', else 'YES'.

This seems too simplistic. How does this cover all cases?

Looking back at the sample input and output:

In the first test case:

2 1

W

B

first column is 'W' and 'B', which is not uniform.

So, first_row would be 'W' and 'B', which is not uniform.

last_row would be the same since it's a 1-column grid.

So, it's not uniform, so it wouldn't print 'NO', but according to the sample, it should be 'NO'.

Wait, but in the code, it checks if both first_row and last_row are uniform and different, then 'NO', else 'YES'.

In this case, first_row is not uniform, so it would go to 'else' and print 'YES', but the sample output is 'NO'.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking two conditions:

1. If the first row and the last row are uniform but different, then 'NO'.

2. If the first column and the last column are uniform but different, then 'NO'.

Otherwise, 'YES'.

But in the first test case, the first row is 'W' and the last row is 'B', both uniform and different, so it should print 'NO', which matches the sample.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought first_row was the first column, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, a[0] is the first row, a[-1] is the last row.

first_row is constructed by taking a[i][0] for all rows i.

last_row is constructed by taking a[i][-1] for all rows i.

So, it's checking:

- If the first row is uniform and the last row is uniform and they are different, then 'NO'.

- Or, if the first column is uniform and the last column is uniform and they are different, then 'NO'.

Otherwise, 'YES'.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about what this is trying to capture.

If the first row and the last row are uniform but different, that means the top and bottom rows are completely 'W' and 'B' respectively, and they are different.

Similarly, if the first column and the last column are uniform and different, that captures the leftmost and rightmost columns being uniform but different.

The idea might be that if these boundaries are uniform and conflicting, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

But is this sufficient to determine the correctness for all cases?

Looking back at the sample input and output, in the second test case:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

According to the program, it should check:

- First row: 'WWWWBW' -> all 'W's? No, it has a 'B' in the 5th position.

- Last row: 'BBBWBW' -> all 'B's? No, it has 'W's in positions 4 and 6.

- First column: 'WWWBBW' -> 'W', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

- Last column: 'BWWBBW' -> 'B', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W' -> not uniform.

So, neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform and different. So, it should print 'YES', which matches the sample.

In the third test case:

1 1

W

It's a single cell, which is already uniform, so 'YES'.

Fourth test case:

2 2

BB

BB

Both rows are 'BB', so uniform, so 'YES'.

Fifth test case:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

First row: 'BWBW' -> not uniform.

Last row: 'BWBW' -> not uniform.

First column: 'B', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

Last column: 'W', 'B', 'W' -> not uniform.

So, 'YES'.

Sixth test case:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

First row: 'BB' -> uniform.

Last row: 'WW' -> uniform, and different.

So, it should print 'NO', which matches the sample.

Seventh test case:

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

First row: 'WWBW' -> not uniform.

Last row: 'BBBB' -> uniform.

First column: 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

Last column: 'W', 'B', 'B', 'B' -> not uniform.

So, 'YES'.

Eighth test case:

1 5

WBBWB

First row: 'WBBWB' -> not uniform.

First column: 'W' -> uniform.

Last column: 'B' -> uniform, but since first column is 'W' and last column is 'B', and both are uniform, but they are different, so 'NO'.

Which matches the sample.

So, in the sample cases, it seems to work.

But is this logic generally correct?

I need to think about whether this condition is sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform.

Let me consider some additional test cases to verify.

Test case 1:

2x2 grid:

WW

WW

All cells are 'W', already uniform, should be 'YES'.

According to the program:

First row: 'WW' -> uniform.

Last row: 'WW' -> uniform.

But they are the same, so no 'NO' condition triggered, hence 'YES'.

Correct.

Test case 2:

2x2 grid:

WW

BB

First row: 'WW' -> uniform.

Last row: 'BB' -> uniform, different.

So, 'NO'.

Correct, because you can't make all 'W' or all 'B' with the operations allowed.

Test case 3:

3x3 grid:

WWW

WWW

WWW

All 'W', should be 'YES'.

Program:

First row: 'WWW' -> uniform.

Last row: 'WWW' -> uniform, same as first row, so 'YES'.

Correct.

Test case 4:

3x3 grid:

WWW

WWB

WWW

First row: 'WWW' -> uniform.

Last row: 'WWW' -> uniform, same, 'YES'.

But the grid is not entirely 'W', but operations can be performed to make it entirely 'W'.

For example, select (1,3) and (3,3), both 'W', turn the entire grid to 'W'.

So, 'YES' is correct.

Test case 5:

3x3 grid:

WWB

WBW

BWW

First row: 'WWB' -> not uniform.

Last row: 'BWW' -> not uniform.

First column: 'W', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

Last column: 'B', 'W', 'W' -> not uniform.

So, 'YES'.

But can this grid be made uniform?

Let's see:

Select (1,1) and (2,1), both 'W', turn column 1 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWW

WWB

WWW

Select (2,3), 'B', and (3,3), 'W' -> they are different, can't select.

Wait, operations require selecting two squares of the same color.

So, select (1,3) and (3,3), both 'W', turn row 3 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWW

WWB

WWW

Select (2,2), 'W', and (2,3), 'B' -> can't select.

Select (2,2), 'W', and (1,2), 'W', turn row 2 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWW

WWW

WWW

So, it's possible to make all 'W'. Hence, 'YES' is correct.

Another test case:

2x2 grid:

BW

WB

First row: 'BW' -> not uniform.

Last row: 'WB' -> not uniform.

First column: 'B', 'W' -> not uniform.

Last column: 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

So, 'YES'.

But can this be made uniform?

Let's see:

Select (1,1), 'B', and (2,2), 'B', turn the subrectangle (1,1) to (2,2) to 'B'.

Now grid:

BB

BB

So, 'YES' is correct.

Another test case:

3x3 grid:

BWB

WBW

BWB

First row: 'BWB' -> not uniform.

Last row: 'BWB' -> not uniform.

First column: 'B', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

Last column: 'B', 'W', 'B' -> not uniform.

So, 'YES'.

Can this be made uniform?

Select (1,1), 'B', and (1,3), 'B', turn row 1 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BWB

Select (1,2), 'B', and (3,2), 'W' -> can't select different colors.

Select (1,1), 'B', and (2,1), 'W' -> can't.

Select (1,3), 'B', and (3,3), 'B', turn column 3 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BWB

Wait, no, operations work on rectangles defined by two cells, turning everything in between to that color.

Maybe it's not possible to make this uniform. But according to the program, it's 'YES', which might be incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, there's a similar grid:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

And the output is 'YES', but in this 3x3 grid, it might be different.

Wait, in this 3x3 grid:

BWB

WBW

BWB

It's a checkerboard pattern.

Is it possible to make it all 'B' or all 'W'?

Let's see:

Select (1,1), 'B', and (1,3), 'B', turn column 1 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BWB

Select (1,2), 'B', and (3,2), 'W' -> can't select.

Select (1,3), 'B', and (3,3), 'B', turn column 3 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BBB

Select (2,1), 'W', and (2,3), 'W', turn row 2 to 'W'.

Now grid:

BBB

WWW

BBB

Select (1,2), 'B', and (2,2), 'W' -> can't select.

Select (1,1), 'B', and (3,1), 'B', turn row 1 to 'B'.

Already 'B'.

It seems stuck.

So, perhaps it's not possible to make it uniform, but according to the program, it's 'YES'.

Hence, the program might be incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample input, there's a similar 3x4 grid that is 'YES'.

Maybe the program is correct for some cases but fails for others.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in understanding the operations.

Wait, in the 3x3 checkerboard, is there a way to make it uniform?

Let's try selecting different cells.

Select (1,1), 'B', and (2,2), 'W' -> can't select different colors.

Select (1,1), 'B', and (3,1), 'B' -> turn column 1 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BWB

Select (1,2), 'B', and (3,2), 'W' -> can't select.

Select (1,3), 'B', and (3,3), 'B' -> turn column 3 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBB

WBW

BBB

Select (2,1), 'W', and (2,3), 'W' -> turn row 2 to 'W'.

Now grid:

BBB

WWW

BBB

Select (1,2), 'B', and (2,2), 'W' -> can't select.

Select (1,1), 'B', and (2,1), 'W' -> can't select.

Seems like it's stuck.

Hence, it's impossible to make it uniform, but the program would output 'YES' for this grid, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

But wait, in the sample input, there's a similar grid:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

And the output is 'YES'.

Is this different from the 3x3 checkerboard?

In the 3x4 grid:

Row 1: BWBW

Row 2: WBWB

Row 3: BWBW

Is it possible to make this uniform?

Let's try:

Select (1,1), 'B', and (3,1), 'B' -> turn column 1 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBBW

WBWB

BBBW

Select (1,3), 'B', and (3,3), 'B' -> turn column 3 to 'B'.

Now grid:

BBBB

WBWB

BBBB

Select (2,2), 'W', and (2,4), 'B' -> can't select different colors.

Select (2,1), 'W', and (2,3), 'B' -> can't select.

Select (1,2), 'W', and (1,4), 'W' -> turn row 1 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWWW

WBWB

WWWW

Select (2,1), 'W', and (2,3), 'B' -> can't select.

Select (1,2), 'W', and (3,2), 'W' -> turn column 2 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWWW

WWBW

WWWW

Select (2,3), 'B', and (2,4), 'W' -> can't select.

Select (1,3), 'W', and (3,3), 'W' -> turn column 3 to 'W'.

Now grid:

WWWW

WWWW

WWWW

So, it's possible to make it uniform 'W'.

Hence, 'YES' is correct for this grid.

But in the 3x3 checkerboard, it's not possible, and the program would output 'YES', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
