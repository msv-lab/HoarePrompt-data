Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. I need to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. The goal is to minimize the number of cards I have in the end.

Let me think about the implications of this operation. Each time I perform it, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 (since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards). But there's a condition: the k cards must have the same number.

So, if I have multiple groups of cards with the same numbers, I can perform this operation on each group separately.

Wait, but I can choose to perform the operation on any group that has at least k cards with the same number.

My aim is to minimize the number of cards, so I want to perform this operation as many times as possible.

But there's a catch: when I perform the operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, but these new cards can have any numbers, which might allow me to create new groups to perform the operation again.

However, since I can choose the numbers on the new cards, I can strategically choose numbers that allow me to perform more operations in the future.

But perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the hand.

Suppose I have a number that appears f times in the hand, where f >= k.

Then, I can perform the operation floor(f / k) times on this number, each time reducing the count by k and adding k-1 new cards.

Wait, but the new cards can have any numbers, which could be chosen to help perform more operations.

But this seems a bit tricky to model directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to reduce the total number of cards as much as possible by performing operations on the groups with frequencies >= k.

But I need to consider that when I perform an operation, I'm not just reducing the count of that group, but also adding new cards that could be part of other groups.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a mathematical way to approach this.

Let me think about the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1 (since I replace k cards with k-1 cards).

So, if I can perform m operations, the total reduction in the number of cards would be m.

Therefore, the minimum number of cards I can have in the end is n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

So, my goal is to maximize m, the number of operations.

But how do I maximize m?

Each operation requires k cards with the same number.

So, for each unique number in the hand, if it appears f times, I can perform floor(f / k) operations on it.

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate, because after performing some operations on one group, the new cards added could be used with other groups.

But perhaps, in the best case, I can ignore the new cards and just consider each group separately.

Let me try that approach first.

Suppose I have groups with frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm.

Then, the total number of operations I can perform is sum(floor(fi / k) for all i).

And hence, the minimum number of cards in the end would be n - sum(floor(fi / k) for all i).

But I'm not sure if this is correct because the new cards added could be used to perform more operations.

Wait, maybe it's possible to perform more operations by choosing the numbers on the new cards wisely.

For example, if I have two groups with frequencies f1 and f2, both greater than or equal to k, I can perform operations on each group separately.

But if I perform an operation on one group and choose the new cards to have the same number as another group, then those new cards can be combined with the existing cards in that group to perform more operations.

So, perhaps the total number of operations is not just the sum of floor(fi / k) for all i, but potentially more.

This seems tricky.

Let me think of an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 5, k = 3

cards: 4, 1, 1, 4, 4

So, frequencies:

4: 3

1: 2

According to the approach above, sum(floor(fi / k)) = floor(3/3) + floor(2/3) = 1 + 0 = 1

So, m = 1, and minimum cards = 5 - 1 = 4

But in the example, they show a sequence that ends with 2 cards, which is better than 4.

So, my initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of creating new cards that can be used in future operations.

Hmm.

So, I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider the total number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, as mentioned before.

So, the question is, what is the maximum number of operations I can perform?

I need to find a way to chain operations in such a way that the new cards created can be used in subsequent operations.

This seems like a process where I can keep reducing the cards as long as I have groups with frequencies >= k.

But I need to optimize this process to minimize the final number of cards.

Another way to think about it is to consider the maximum number of operations I can perform, considering that each operation can be dependent on the previous ones through the new cards created.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the extreme case where all cards have the same number.

Suppose n is a multiple of k, say n = m * k.

Then, I can perform m operations, each time replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

After the first operation, I have n - 1 cards.

Then, I can perform another operation with k cards from the remaining cards, and so on.

Wait, but after the first operation, the new cards can have any numbers, so I need to choose their numbers carefully to keep performing operations.

If I choose the new cards to have the same number as the previous group, then I can continue performing operations.

Let me see.

Suppose n = k * m, all cards have the same number.

Then, I can perform m operations, each time replacing k cards with k-1 cards, all chosen to have the same number.

After m operations, I would have n - m cards.

But wait, each operation reduces the number of cards by 1, so after m operations, it's n - m.

But is m the maximum number of operations possible?

In this case, yes, because each operation requires k cards, and after each operation, I have k-1 cards left from that group.

So, I can perform floor(f / k) operations for each group, where f is the frequency of that number.

But in the earlier example, this approach didn't give the optimal result, so maybe there's a way to do better by combining groups or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the overall number of cards and the value of k.

Let me consider the recursion.

Suppose I have a group with frequency f >= k.

I can perform floor(f / k) operations on it, each time replacing k cards with k-1 new cards.

But these k-1 new cards can be used in future operations, either with the remaining cards of the same group or with other groups.

This seems complex to model directly.

Maybe I need to find a different way to approach this problem.

Let me consider the total number of cards and how operations affect it.

Each operation reduces the number of cards by 1, as mentioned before.

So, the maximum number of operations is the initial number of cards minus the minimum number of cards possible.

In other words, m = n - min_cards.

So, min_cards = n - m.

But I need to find min_cards, which is n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

So, I need to maximize m.

But how?

I need to find a way to perform as many operations as possible.

Each operation requires k cards with the same number.

So, I need to have as many groups with frequencies >= k as possible.

Wait, but I can create new cards with any numbers, which could help in creating new groups or augmenting existing groups.

This is getting too vague.

Maybe I need to look for an invariant or some property that remains the same or changes in a predictable way with each operation.

Let me consider the sum over all groups of floor(fi / k).

This gives the total number of operations I can perform if I consider each group separately, without considering the new cards.

But in reality, the new cards can be used to perform more operations, so the actual number of operations could be higher.

Hence, sum(floor(fi / k)) is a lower bound on m, the number of operations.

But in the example, sum(floor(fi / k)) = 1, but the actual number of operations is higher (since they achieved 2 cards from 5, which would mean m = 3 operations, since 5 - 3 = 2).

Wait, 5 - 3 = 2, so m = 3.

But sum(floor(fi / k)) = 1, which is less than 3.

So, clearly, sum(floor(fi / k)) is not tight in this case.

So, I need a better way to calculate m.

Let me consider the process in more detail.

Suppose I have a group with frequency f.

I can perform floor(f / k) operations on it, each time replacing k cards with k-1 new cards.

But after each operation, I have f - k + (k - 1) = f - 1 cards left.

So, each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

Hence, for each group, I can perform floor(f / k) operations, reducing the total number of cards by floor(f / k).

But wait, in reality, I can perform more operations by choosing the new cards wisely.

For example, if I have two groups, one with f1 and another with f2, both >= k.

I can perform operations on one group, creating new cards that belong to the other group, thereby increasing the frequency of the other group and allowing more operations.

This way, I can chain operations between groups.

So, perhaps the total number of operations is not just the sum of floor(fi / k) over all i, but something more.

But how to calculate that?

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to minimize the number of cards.

I need to maximize the number of operations, which reduces the number of cards by 1 each time.

So, min_cards = n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations.

But m depends on how many times I can perform the operation, which in turn depends on the frequencies of the numbers and how I choose the new cards.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider the frequencies of the numbers.

Suppose I have a group with frequency f.

If f < k, I cannot perform any operations on it.

If f >= k, I can perform operations to reduce it.

But how much can I reduce it?

Wait, perhaps I can reduce it to f - (f - 1) / (k - 1), or something like that.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal number of cards per group and then sum them up.

Let me consider a single group with frequency f.

I can perform operations as long as f >= k.

Each operation reduces f by k - (k - 1) = 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, each operation replaces k cards with k - 1 cards, so f becomes f - k + (k - 1) = f - 1.

Hence, each operation reduces f by 1.

So, for a single group, I can perform f - (the minimal number of cards left) operations.

Wait, but the minimal number of cards left per group would be k - 1.

Because if I have k cards, I can replace them with k - 1 cards, and then I can't perform any more operations on that group.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have k cards, I can replace them with k - 1 cards.

Then, with those k - 1 cards, I can't perform another operation because I need k cards for that.

Hence, the minimal number of cards left per group is k - 1.

Hence, for each group with frequency f, the minimal number of cards left is f - floor((f - (k - 1)) / (k - 1)) * 1.

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, perhaps for each group, the minimal number of cards left is f - floor((f - (k - 1)) / (k - 1)).

But I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

If I have f cards in a group, and I can perform operations that reduce f by 1 each time (since each operation replaces k cards with k - 1 cards), then the number of operations I can perform is f - (k - 1).

Wait, because I can keep performing operations until I have k - 1 cards left.

So, for each group, the number of operations is f - (k - 1), if f >= k - 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if f < k, I can't perform any operations.

If f >= k, I can perform floor((f - (k - 1)) / (k - 1)) operations.

Wait, let's see.

Each operation reduces f by 1.

I can perform operations until f < k.

So, the number of operations is floor((f - (k - 1)) / (k - 1)).

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have f cards, and I perform one operation, f becomes f - 1.

I can keep doing this until f < k.

So, the number of operations is f - (k - 1), if f >= k - 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's say f = k: operations = 1, f = k - 1: operations = 0.

f = k + 1: operations = 2, and so on.

Wait, actually, operations = floor((f - (k - 1)) / (k - 1)).

Wait, perhaps operations = f - (k - 1), if f >= k - 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, with f = k, operations = 1.

With f = k + 1, operations = 2.

So, operations = f - (k - 1), if f >= k - 1.

Wait, but if f = k - 1, operations = 0.

Hence, for each group, operations = max(0, f - (k - 1)).

Hence, total operations m = sum over all groups of max(0, f - (k - 1)).

Hence, min_cards = n - m = sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1).

Wait, because m = sum over all groups of (f - (k - 1)) where f >= k - 1.

Hence, min_cards = n - m = sum over all groups of f - (f - (k - 1)) = sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the minimal number of cards is the sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1).

Because for each group, you can reduce it to k - 1 cards, and no further.

Hence, min_cards = sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1).

Let me verify this with the first example.

n = 5, k = 3

cards: 4,1,1,4,4

So, frequencies:

4: 3

1: 2

min(f, k - 1) = min(3, 2) = 2 for group 4

min(2, 2) = 2 for group 1

Sum = 4, which doesn't match the example's output of 2.

Hmm, so my formula is giving 4, but the example shows 2.

So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the example, they ended up with 2 cards.

But according to my formula, it should be sum of min(f, k - 1) for each group.

Wait, but in this case, sum is min(3,2)=2 + min(2,2)=2 = 4, but the example shows 2.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Hence, my earlier assumption is wrong.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards is not sum of min(f, k - 1) over all groups.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that new cards can be chosen to have any number, which could allow me to adjust the frequencies in a way that minimizes the total number of cards.

In other words, by choosing the new cards' numbers wisely, I can group them in a way that allows more operations.

Hence, the minimal number of cards is the sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1), but with the possibility of adjusting the groups by choosing new cards' numbers.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of cards is the sum over all groups of ceil(f / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Wait, that seems off.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a group with frequency f.

Each operation allows me to reduce f by 1, but also add k - 1 new cards that can be assigned any number.

Hence, I can choose to add new cards to other groups or create new groups.

This flexibility allows me to optimize the reduction process.

But it's still not clear how to compute the minimal number of cards.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider the total number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

Hence, the minimal number of cards is n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations.

I need to maximize m.

To maximize m, I need to perform as many operations as possible.

Each operation requires k cards with the same number.

Hence, m is limited by the number of groups that have frequencies >= k.

But, since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can strategically assign them to groups that allow more operations.

This seems like a greedy approach.

Perhaps I should sort the frequencies in descending order and perform operations on the groups with the highest frequencies first.

But even that seems too simplistic.

Let me consider another example.

Take n = 10, k = 4

cards: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

So, frequency of 1 is 10.

According to the formula min(f, k - 1) = min(10, 3) = 3, so min_cards = 3.

But in reality, I can perform operations as follows:

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 10 - 4 + 3 = 9.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 9 - 4 + 3 = 8.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 8 - 4 + 3 = 7.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 7 - 4 + 3 = 6.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 6 - 4 + 3 = 5.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 5 - 4 + 3 = 4.

- Select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards with 1. Now, total cards: 4 - 4 + 3 = 3.

So, final number of cards is 3, which matches the formula.

But in the first example, according to the formula, it's 4, but in reality, it's 2.

Hence, the formula is not always correct.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal number of cards is the sum over all groups of ceil(f / (k - 1)) * (k - 1).

Wait, in the first example:

f = 3: ceil(3 / (3 - 1)) = ceil(3 / 2) = 2, so 2 * (2 - 1) = 2

f = 2: ceil(2 / 2) = 1, so 1 * 1 = 1

Total: 2 + 1 = 3, which is still not matching the example's output of 2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's floor((f - 1) / (k - 1)) * (k - 1) + min(f, k - 1).

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me think about it differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

I can perform operations as long as there exists a group with frequency >= k.

Hence, the minimal number of cards is the number of cards left when no group has frequency >= k.

In other words, all groups have frequency <= k - 1.

But, since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can strategically assign them to keep frequencies <= k - 1.

Wait, but I need to minimize the total number of cards, so I need to distribute the new cards in such a way that the total number of groups with frequencies <= k - 1 is minimized.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider the total number of cards that cannot be reduced further, which is the sum over all groups of min(f, k - 1).

But in the first example, that gives 4, but the actual minimal is 2.

Hence, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of cards such that no group has frequency >= k.

In other words, the minimal number of cards where the maximum frequency among all groups is <= k - 1.

This seems similar to distributing the cards into groups where no group has frequency >= k.

This sounds like a problem of distributing n items into groups where no group has more than k - 1 items.

Hence, the minimal number of groups required is ceil(n / (k - 1)).

But that's not quite right, because groups correspond to different numbers, and I can choose the numbers of the new cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of cards such that the sum of ceil(fi / (k - 1)) >= total groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some similar problems, the minimal number of cards is k - 1.

But that doesn't seem to be the case in general.

Wait, in the second example:

n = 1, k = 10

cards: 7

Frequency of 7 is 1.

According to the formula min(f, k - 1) = min(1, 9) = 1.

Hence, min_cards = 1, which matches the output.

In another example:

n = 7, k = 2

cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3

Frequencies:

2: 2

4:1,1:1,100:1,5:1,3:1

According to the formula, sum of min(f,1):

2:1, 4:1,1:1,100:1,5:1,3:1 => total 6

But the output is 1, which contradicts.

Hence, my formula is wrong.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards is k - 1.

But in the first example, k - 1 = 2, which matches the output.

In the second example, k - 1 = 9, but n =1, which is less than 9, so min_cards =1.

Wait, but in the fourth example:

n =10, k=4

all 1's.

According to the operations, min_cards =3, which is k -1 =3.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of cards is k -1.

But in the third example:

n=7, k=2

frequencies: 2:2, others:1

According to k-1=1, but the output is 1, which matches.

Wait, but according to the formula sum of min(f,1):

for f=2: min(2,1)=1

for f=1: min(1,1)=1

total:1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7, which doesn't match the output of1.

Hence, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cards is the minimal among n and k -1.

But in the first example, min(5,2)=2, which matches.

In the second example, min(1,9)=1, which
