Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to find the final score of the game based on their optimal plays. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the game:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`.

- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, and deletes it from `a`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty.

- The score is the MEX of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, I need to figure out what the final MEX will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand MEX better. MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example:

- MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3.

- MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2.

- MEX of [1, 2, 3] is 0.

Given that, Alice wants to make c such that its MEX is as large as possible, and Bob wants to disrupt that.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Each turn:

- Alice picks an element to add to c.

- Bob picks an element to remove from a.

Since Alice is trying to maximize the MEX of c, she wants to collect as many small integers as possible, in order to make the MEX as high as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX of c, so he wants to prevent Alice from collecting certain numbers.

Given that Alice goes first, and they alternate turns, I need to model their interactions.

Let's consider the frequency of each number in a.

I'll count how many times each number appears in a.

Let's denote cnt[i] as the count of number i in a.

Now, since Alice and Bob are alternately picking elements, and Alice can choose what to add to c, I need to see how many times each number can be potentially added to c.

Wait, but Bob can also remove elements, so he can prevent Alice from adding certain elements by removing them.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let's consider that the total number of operations is n, since there are n elements.

Alice gets to choose floor(n/2) elements to add to c (since she picks first).

Bob gets to choose ceil(n/2) elements to remove.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

Each turn, one element is removed from a, regardless of who picks it.

Since there are n elements, there will be n turns.

Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice starting.

So, Alice gets ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob gets floor(n/2) turns.

Wait, no. If n is even, both get n/2 turns. If n is odd, Alice gets n/2 + 0.5 turns, which means she gets one more turn.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of total turns.

Total turns = n.

Alice moves first.

So, number of Alice's moves = ceil(n / 2).

Number of Bob's moves = floor(n / 2).

Yes.

Now, in each of Alice's moves, she picks an element from a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a.

In Bob's moves, he picks an element from a and deletes it.

So, the final c will have ceil(n / 2) elements, since that's how many times Alice gets to add elements.

Wait, but Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose.

So, it's not just about the number of elements, but also which elements are available when Alice makes her choices.

This seems complex.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that Alice wants to collect as many unique small numbers as possible to maximize the MEX.

Bob wants to prevent that by removing elements that Alice would want.

So, perhaps I need to see for each number i, whether Alice can ensure that she collects it, or Bob can prevent her from collecting it.

Let's consider number 0.

If there are multiple 0s in a, Alice can try to collect them, and Bob can try to remove them.

Similarly for higher numbers.

I need to model this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Let's sort the numbers and see.

Wait, but the problem constraints are that a_i can be up to n-1, and n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 2e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need an efficient solution, O(n) per test case or better.

Let me think about the MEX.

The MEX is the smallest missing number in c.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to have as many of the smaller numbers in c as possible.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having some of the smaller numbers.

So, in a way, it's like Alice is trying to collect a prefix of numbers starting from 0, and Bob is trying to break that prefix.

So, perhaps I can find the largest j such that the sum of frequencies of numbers from 0 to j is at least the number of Alice's moves plus something.

Wait, maybe I need to model it more carefully.

Let me think in terms of available moves.

Total moves: n.

Alice moves: ceil(n / 2).

Bob moves: floor(n / 2).

Let me denote A = ceil(n / 2), B = floor(n / 2).

So, Alice can choose A elements to put into c.

Bob can remove B elements from a.

But Bob can choose which elements to remove, trying to minimize the MEX of c.

Wait, but Bob removes elements from a, which might be the same elements that Alice would have chosen.

So, if Bob removes an element that Alice wanted, it makes it harder for Alice to collect it.

But Alice can choose which element to add to c.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of available choices.

Let me consider that for each number i, the number of times it appears in a is cnt[i].

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of c, which is the smallest missing number in c.

So, to have a MEX of k, Alice needs to have all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c.

So, the highest possible MEX is k, where k is the smallest number such that she can't collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal k such that it's impossible for Alice to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c.

Because Bob is trying to prevent that.

So, for each k, I need to check if Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c, despite Bob's efforts.

If she can, then the MEX is at least k.

I need to find the minimal k where she can't, which will be the MEX.

So, I need to iterate k from 0 upwards, and find the smallest k where Alice can't collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c.

To check if Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c, I need to see if, even after Bob tries to interfere, she can still get those numbers.

So, for each number i from 0 to k-1, the number of times it appears in a is cnt[i].

Alice needs at least one of each of these numbers in c.

But Bob can try to remove some of these numbers from a, making them unavailable for Alice.

So, for each i from 0 to k-1, the number of times Alice needs it is 1.

Bob can remove up to B elements.

So, the total number of critical elements is k.

Alice needs at least k elements in c from these numbers.

But she can choose A elements.

Bob can remove B elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

For each i from 0 to k-1, let's say cnt[i] is the number of times i appears in a.

Alice needs at least one of each i from 0 to k-1 in c.

Bob can remove up to B elements from a.

So, for Alice to have at least one of each i from 0 to k-1 in c, the following must hold:

For each i in 0 to k-1, cnt[i] - removed_by_Bob >= 1.

That is, after Bob removes some elements, there should still be at least one of each i in a until Alice picks it.

Wait, but Alice picks first and they alternate.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears and how many times Bob can remove them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can get each number.

Let me consider that for each number i, cnt[i] is the number of instances of i in a.

Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from a.

Alice picks first.

Alice can choose to pick any remaining element and add it to c.

Bob picks next, and can choose any remaining element to remove.

This continues until a is empty.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of c, which means she wants to collect as many small numbers as possible.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX of c, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from collecting some small numbers.

So, for each number i from 0 to k-1, Alice needs to collect at least one instance of it in c.

Bob will try to prevent that by removing instances of these numbers.

So, for Alice to collect at least one of each i from 0 to k-1, she needs to have enough instances of them that Bob can't remove all of them.

Wait, more precisely, for each i from 0 to k-1, the number of times Alice can collect i is cnt[i] - the number of times Bob removes i.

Bob will try to remove as many of the critical numbers as possible.

So, for Alice to have at least one of each i from 0 to k-1, cnt[i] - removed_by_Bob >=1 for each i.

But Bob can remove up to B elements in total.

So, the total number of removals on critical numbers can be up to B.

But Bob can choose which elements to remove.

So, to make sure that Alice can collect all i from 0 to k-1, the sum over i from 0 to k-1 of (cnt[i] -1) <= B.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice needs at least one of each i from 0 to k-1.

So, for each i in 0 to k-1, cnt[i] - removed_by_Bob >=1.

Which means removed_by_Bob <= cnt[i] -1 for each i.

And the total removed_by_Bob for all i is <= B.

So, Bob can remove up to B elements, but he needs to remove enough from each critical number to make cnt[i] - removed_by_Bob <1 for some i.

Wait, more carefully:

For Alice to fail to collect all i from 0 to k-1, there exists some i in 0 to k-1 such that cnt[i] - removed_by_Bob <1, meaning removed_by_Bob >= cnt[i].

But Bob can't remove more than cnt[i] anyway.

So, Bob needs to remove all instances of some i in 0 to k-1.

Given that Bob can remove up to B elements, he can choose to remove all instances of some i if cnt[i] <= B.

But Alice can try to protect certain i by making sure that Bob doesn't remove all instances of them.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal k such that sum over i from 0 to k-1 of cnt[i] > A + sum over j not in 0 to k-1 of min(cnt[j], 1).

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose A elements to put into c.

Bob can choose B elements to remove from a.

But Alice gets to choose which elements to put into c from the remaining elements.

So, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can select A elements, and Bob can remove B elements, but Bob removes first, in a sense.

Wait, no. Since Alice picks first, then Bob, alternately.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the game where Alice and Bob are alternately picking elements, with Alice picking first, and Alice deciding which elements to add to c.

So, in the end, c will have A elements, chosen by Alice.

But Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose.

This seems quite involved.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Sample Output:

2

1

0

Let's analyze the first test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

Possible moves:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [0,1], c=[1]

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1], c=[1,0]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c=[1,0]

MEX of c=[1,0] is 2.

Is this the optimal outcome?

Could Bob have done better?

If Bob chooses 1 first:

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0,0], c=[1]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes [0], c=[1]

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes empty, c=[1,0]

Again, MEX is 2.

Another scenario:

- Alice chooses 0, a becomes [0,1,1], c=[0]

- Bob chooses 0, a becomes [1,1], c=[0]

- Alice chooses 1, a becomes [1], c=[0,1]

- Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c=[0,1]

MEX is 2 again.

So, in all scenarios, MEX is 2.

Is it possible to get a higher MEX?

If Alice could get c=[0,1], MEX is 2.

If she could get c=[0,1,2], MEX would be 3, but n=4, and a only has 0 and 1.

Wait, n=4, a only has 0 and 1, so MEX can't be higher than 2.

Wait, n=4, but a only has 0 and 1, so MEX is at least 2.

But in this case, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible moves:

- Alice chooses 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob chooses 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice chooses 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[], c=[0,2]

MEX of c=[0,2] is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice chooses 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[1,2], c=[0]

- Alice chooses 1, a=[2], c=[0,1]

- Bob chooses 2, a=[], c=[0,1]

MEX is 2.

Another scenario:

- Alice chooses 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob chooses 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice chooses 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[], c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

Wait, MEX of [1,2] is 0.

Because 0 is missing.

But in the first move, Alice chose 1, then Bob removed 0, then Alice chose 2, Bob removed 3.

So c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX achievable by Bob is 1.

Looking back, in the first scenario, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

In another scenario, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But the sample output is 1.

So, perhaps Bob can't force MEX to be 0.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps Bob can't choose to remove elements in a way that forces MEX to be 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to help Alice collect smaller numbers.

Wait, no, Bob wants to minimize the MEX, which means he wants to make sure that Alice doesn't collect all smaller numbers.

Wait, actually, Bob wants to minimize the MEX of c, which means he wants the smallest missing number in c to be as small as possible.

So, he wants to prevent Alice from collecting the smaller numbers.

Wait, this is a bit confusing.

Actually, Bob wants to minimize the MEX, which means he wants the MEX to be as small as possible.

To make MEX small, he wants to ensure that Alice doesn't have all the smaller numbers in c.

So, he wants to prevent Alice from having all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c, for smaller k.

So, he will try to remove elements that Alice needs to make MEX higher.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Alice wants to collect 0,1,2,3 to make MEX as high as possible.

But Bob can try to prevent her from collecting some of them.

If Bob can prevent Alice from collecting 0, then MEX would be 0.

But perhaps Alice can still collect 0.

Wait, let's see.

Possible moves:

- Alice chooses 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob chooses 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice chooses 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[], c=[0,2]

MEX is 1.

Another scenario:

- Alice chooses 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob chooses 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice chooses 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[], c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

Another scenario:

- Alice chooses 2, a=[0,1,3], c=[2]

- Bob chooses 0, a=[1,3], c=[2]

- Alice chooses 1, a=[3], c=[2,1]

- Bob chooses 3, a=[], c=[2,1]

MEX is 0.

Another scenario:

- Alice chooses 3, a=[0,1,2], c=[3]

- Bob chooses 0, a=[1,2], c=[3]

- Alice chooses 1, a=[2], c=[3,1]

- Bob chooses 2, a=[], c=[3,1]

MEX is 0.

So, in some scenarios, MEX is 0, and in others, it's 1.

But the sample output is 1.

So, perhaps, even though MEX can be 0 in some scenarios, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve, with Bob playing optimally to minimize it, is 1.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would aim for MEX=0.

But perhaps in this case, Alice can force MEX to be at least 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

In the second test case, each number appears only once.

So, cnt=[1,1,1,1].

Alice needs to collect as many small numbers as possible.

Bob can remove some numbers to prevent Alice from collecting them.

Given that each number appears only once, and Alice gets to choose ceil(n/2)=2 elements, Bob chooses floor(n/2)=2 elements.

So, Alice can choose 2 elements, and Bob can remove 2 elements.

Bob wants to remove elements that Alice would need to maximize the MEX.

If Alice wants to collect 0 and 1 to have c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But Bob can remove 0 and 1, forcing Alice to collect other elements.

But in that case, c would have, say, [2,3], MEX=0.

But the sample output is 1, so perhaps Bob can't do that.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX that Alice can be forced to have is 1.

How?

If Bob removes one element that Alice needs, say 0, then Alice can collect 1 and 2, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But sample output is 1, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX is 1 because Bob can force c to be [0,2] or [0,1], but not [0,1,2].

Wait, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], Alice chooses 2 elements, Bob removes 2.

If Bob removes 2 and 3, Alice chooses from [0,1], say chooses 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But Bob can choose to remove 0 and 1, leaving a=[2,3], Alice chooses 2 and 3, c=[2,3], MEX=0.

But sample output is 1, so perhaps Bob can't do that.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob can't remove elements in a way that forces MEX to be 0.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX that Alice can be forced to have is 1.

How?

If Bob removes 1 and 3, then a=[0,2], Alice chooses 0 and 2, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Similarly, if Bob removes 0 and 2, a=[1,3], Alice chooses 1 and 3, c=[1,3], MEX=0.

But in the sample output, it's 1, so perhaps in this case, Bob can't force MEX=0.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob can't always force MEX=0.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX that Alice can be forced to have is 1, meaning that Bob can prevent Alice from having MEX=0, but not higher.

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any A elements from a, and Bob can remove any B elements from a, but Alice gets to choose which elements to put into c from the remaining elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the game as Alice selecting A elements to put into c, and Bob removing B elements from a, but Bob removes first.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it as Bob removing B elements first, then Alice chooses A elements from the remaining elements.

If that's the case, then:

- Bob removes B elements to minimize the MEX of the A elements Alice can choose from the remaining elements.

- Alice then chooses A elements from the remaining elements to maximize the MEX.

But I'm not sure if this accurately models the alternating turns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as Bob removing B elements, and Alice choosing A elements from the remaining elements.

But in reality, they alternate turns, so it's not exactly the same.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept an approximation.

Looking back at the problem, I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can be forced to have, given optimal play from both sides.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that Bob can remove up to B elements, and Alice can choose A elements from the remaining elements.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to have as many small numbers as possible in c.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having small numbers.

So, for each small number, Bob can try to remove it.

Alice needs to ensure that she can collect enough small numbers despite Bob's removals.

So, for each k from 0 to n, I can check if Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in c.

To do that, the total number of these numbers minus the number Bob can remove should be at least the number Alice needs.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate for each k, whether the sum of cnt[0] to cnt[k-1] minus B is at least k.

If sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) - B >= k, then Alice can collect all k numbers.

Else, she can't.

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

For Alice to collect k numbers, she needs at least k elements in c from numbers 0 to k-1.

But she can choose A elements.

Bob can remove B elements.

So, the number of available elements from 0 to k-1 after Bob removes B elements should be at least k.

That is, sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) - B >= k.

If this holds, Alice can collect all k numbers.

Otherwise, she can't.

So, I can find the maximal k where sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) - B >= k.

The minimal k where sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) - B < k is the MEX.

Wait, no.

Wait, I need to find the smallest k where it's not possible for Alice to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1.

So, I need to find the smallest k where sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) - B < k.

That would be the MEX.

But I need to make sure that Alice can collect A elements in total.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest k such that sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]) < B + A - (sum(cnt[k] to cnt[n-1])).

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of elements Alice can collect from the critical set.

Let me define S_k = sum(cnt[0] to cnt[k-1]).

Then, after Bob removes B elements, the remaining elements from S_k are S_k - B.

Alice needs at least k of these to be in c.

So, if S_k - B >= k, then Alice can collect k numbers.

Else, she can't.

So, the largest k where S_k - B >= k is the maximal k she can collect.

The minimal k where S_k - B < k is the MEX.

So, I can iterate k from 0 to n, and find the smallest k where S_k - B < k.

That would be the MEX.

Wait, but I need to make sure that Alice can collect A elements in total.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can collect up to A elements, and among them, she needs to have all numbers from 0 to k-1.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that S_k - B >= k, and that the total elements Alice collects is at least k.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust B based on other elements.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the sample input again.

Sample Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Sample Output:

2

1

0

For the first test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

cnt=[2,2,0,0]

So, S_0 = 2

S_1 = 2 + 2 = 4

S_2 = 4 + 0 = 4

S_3 = 4 + 0 = 4

B = floor(n/2) = 2

Check k=0:

S_0 - B = 2 - 2 = 0 >= 0 => okay.

k=1:

S_1 - B = 4 - 2 = 2 >=1 => okay.

k=2:

S_2 - B =4 -2=2 >=2 => okay.

k=3:

S_3 - B =4 -2=2 <3 => not okay.

So, MEX is 3.

But sample output is 2.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, maybe it's S_k - B >=k, but also considering that Alice can only choose A elements.

In this case, A=ceil(n/2)=2.

So, even if S_k - B >=k, if k > A, it's not possible.

Wait, in this case, k=2 is feasible, but k=3 is not, since S_2 - B =2 >=2, but k=3 > A=2.

So, the maximal k where k <=A and S_k - B >=k is k=2.

So, MEX is 2.

That matches the sample.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

cnt=[1,1,1,1]

S_0=1

S_1=2

S_2=3

S_3=4

B=2

A=2

Check k=0:

S_0 - B =1 -2=-1 >=0? No.

So, k=0 is not possible.

Wait, but MEX can't be 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, maybe it's S_k - B >=k and k <=A.

In this case, for k=0:

S_0 - B =1 -2=-1 >=0? No.

But k=0 should be possible, since MEX starts from 0.

Wait, perhaps the condition is S_k - B >=k, and k <=A.

But in this case, for k=0, S_0 - B =1 -2=-1 <0, so not okay.

So, MEX is 0.

But sample output is 1.

So, perhaps my condition is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's S_k - B >=k, and k <=A.

But in this case, k=0 is not satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that S_k - B >=k, and k <=A.

But for k=0, S_k - B >=0, which is 1 -2=-1 <0, so not okay.

But MEX can't be 0 if c is non-empty.

Wait, c has A elements, which is 2 in this case.

So, c has at least one element, so MEX can't be 0.

Wait, in the sample, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Another scenario, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

But sample output is 1, so perhaps Bob can force MEX to be at least 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that c can't have MEX less than 1.

Wait, but in some scenarios, MEX can be 0.

So, perhaps the minimal MEX that Bob can force is 1.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob can't allow MEX to be 0.

Wait, no, Bob wants to minimize MEX, which could be 0.

But in this case, perhaps Bob can't always force MEX=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose elements in a way that MEX is at least 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the third test case.

n=2

a=[1,1]

cnt=[0,2]

S_0=0

S_1=2

B=floor(2/2)=1

A=1

Check k=0:

S_0 - B=0 -1=-1 >=0? No.

k=1:

S_1 - B=2 -1=1 >=1? Yes.

So, maximal k is 1, MEX is 1.

But sample output is 0.

Wait, but in this case, c has A=1 element.

If Alice chooses 1, c=[1], MEX=0.

So, MEX is 0.

But according to my earlier logic, k=1 is possible, but c only has one element.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition to S_k - B >=k and sum(cnt[k:]) >= A -k.

Wait, this seems too involved.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach has flaws.

Looking back at the given program, let's see what it's doing.

Given code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]

for i in a:

cntl[i] += 1

if cntl[0] == 0:

print(0)

else:

c = min(2, cntl[0])

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if cntl[j] < 2:

c -= 1

if not c or j == n:

print(j)

break

So, for each test case:

- Read n and a.

- Count frequency of each number from 0 to n in a.

- If cntl[0] == 0, print 0.

- Else, set c = min(2, cntl[0])

- Then, for j from 1 to n:

- If cntl[j] < 2:

- c -=1

- If c ==0 or j ==n, print j and break.

So, it seems to be checking how many numbers have cntl[j] <2, starting from 1, until c becomes 0.

But I'm not sure about the logic behind it.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

First test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

cntl=[2,2,0,0]

cntl[0]=2, so c = min(2,2)=2

Then, for j from 1 to 4:

j=1: cntl[1]=2 >=2, so c unchanged (still 2)

j=2: cntl[2]=0 <2, c -=1, c=1

j=3: cntl[3]=0 <2, c -=1, c=0

Now, c ==0, so print j=3.

But sample output is 2.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's j-1.

Wait, perhaps it's incorrect.

Second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

cntl=[1,1,1,1]

cntl[0]=1, so c = min(2,1)=1

Then, for j from 1 to 4:

j=1: cntl[1]=1 <2, c -=1, c=0

Then, c ==0, so print j=1.

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

cntl=[0,2]

cntl[0]=0, so print 0.

Which matches the sample output.

So, in the first test case, it prints 2, which matches the sample.

Wait, in the first test case, according to the code:

c = min(2,2)=
