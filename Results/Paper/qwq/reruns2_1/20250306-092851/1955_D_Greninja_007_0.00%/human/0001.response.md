Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Maxim has two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of a of length m and check if it's "good" based on some criteria involving array b and a number k.

So, first things first, I need to understand what makes a subsegment "good." According to the problem, a subsegment c of length m is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b. It's important to note that both a and b can have duplicate elements, and the matching is done in a way that doesn't care about the order, as long as at least k elements in c match elements in b when both are rearranged.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the order doesn't matter after rearrangement, I should focus on the frequency of elements in c and b. I need to count how many elements in c are also in b, considering their frequencies.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using sliding windows, where I slide a window of size m over array a and check the condition for each window.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read the input: number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, m, k.

b. Read array a of n integers.

c. Read array b of m integers.

d. Implement a function to count the number of good subsegments.

3. Output the result for each test case.

Now, focusing on the function to count good subsegments. I need an efficient way to slide a window of size m over a and check if the elements in the window have at least k matches with elements in b.

Since n and m can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, I need an O(n) solution per test case to make it efficient enough.

Using sliding windows seems appropriate here. I can maintain a frequency counter for the current window in a and for array b.

I need to keep track of how many elements in the current window of a are also in b, considering their frequencies.

Let me think about using counters (frequency dictionaries) for this purpose.

I can create a frequency counter for array b.

Then, for each window of size m in a, create a frequency counter for that window and count how many elements are common with b, considering their frequencies.

If the number of common elements ( considering frequencies ) is at least k, then this window is good.

To optimize, I can use a sliding window approach where I maintain a frequency counter for the current window and update it as I slide the window by one position each time.

I need to efficiently update the count of matching elements when the window slides.

Let's think about how to do that.

Suppose I have a frequency counter for the current window. I can iterate through the elements in the window and count how many of them are also in b, considering their frequencies.

But since m can be up to 2e5 and n up to 2e5, I need a faster way.

I recall that in sliding window problems, we can maintain a counter and update it incrementally as we slide the window.

So, for each slide, I remove the element that is leaving the window and add the new element entering the window, updating the frequency counters accordingly.

I also need to keep track of the number of matching elements.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define matches as the number of elements in the current window that match elements in b, considering frequencies.

Initially, for the first window, I can calculate matches by iterating through the window and for each element that is in b, add the minimum of its frequency in the window and its frequency in b.

Then, as the window slides, when I remove an element from the window, if it was matching, I need to decrement the matches count appropriately.

Similarly, when I add a new element to the window, if it matches an element in b, I need to increment the matches count.

Wait, but I need to consider frequencies because elements can repeat.

So, I need to keep track of the frequency of each element in the window and in b.

Let me think about using counters.

Let’s use Counter from collections for both b and the sliding window.

Initialize b_freq as Counter(b).

Initialize window_freq as Counter of the first window of size m in a.

Then, calculate matches as sum of min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for all x in window_freq if x is in b_freq.

Then, for each slide:

- When removing an element that was in b, decrement the frequency in window_freq and update matches.

- When adding a new element, if it's in b, increment its frequency in window_freq and update matches.

This seems manageable.

I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

I can write a function, say func_1(a, b, k, n, m), that performs this operation.

Inside func_1:

- Create b_freq = Counter(b)

- Initialize window_freq as Counter(a[:m])

- Calculate initial matches = sum( min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq )

- Initialize good_subarrays = 0

- If matches >= k, increment good_subarrays

- Then, slide the window from i=0 to i<=n-m-1:

- Remove a[i] from window_freq and update matches

- Add a[i+m] to window_freq and update matches

- If matches >= k, increment good_subarrays

- Finally, return good_subarrays

Wait, in the sliding part, I need to carefully handle the updates to matches.

Let me think about how to update matches when removing and adding elements.

When removing an element a[i]:

- If a[i] is in b_freq:

- Decrement window_freq[a[i]]

- If window_freq[a[i]] < b_freq[a[i)], then matches -= 1

- Else, matches remains the same

Wait, no.

Actually, matches is the sum of min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for all x in window_freq that are in b_freq.

So, when removing a[i]:

- If a[i] is in b_freq:

- Previous matches contribution was min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

- After removing one a[i], window_freq[a[i]] decreases by 1

- New matches contribution is min(window_freq[a[i]] - 1, b_freq[a[i]])

- So, the change in matches is new_min - old_min

- Similarly, when adding a[i+m]:

- If a[i+m] is in b_freq:

- window_freq[a[i+m]] increases by 1

- Previous matches contribution was min(window_freq[a[i+m]] - 1, b_freq[a[i+m]])

- New matches contribution is min(window_freq[a[i+m]], b_freq[a[i+m]])

- So, the change in matches is new_min - old_min

This seems a bit involved, but manageable.

Let me try to formalize it.

Define:

matches = sum( min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq )

When removing a[i]:

if a[i] in b_freq:

matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

window_freq[a[i]] -= 1

if window_freq[a[i]] > 0:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

Else:

Just decrement window_freq[a[i]]

When adding a[i+m]:

if a[i+m] in b_freq:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i+m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i+m]]) - min(window_freq[a[i+m]], b_freq[a[i+m]])

window_freq[a[i+m]] += 1

Else:

Just increment window_freq[a[i+m]]

Wait, perhaps I can generalize it.

When removing a[i]:

if a[i] in b_freq:

matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

window_freq[a[i]] -= 1

if window_freq[a[i]] > 0:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

When adding a[i+m]:

if a[i+m] in b_freq:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i+m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i+m]]) - min(window_freq[a[i+m]], b_freq[a[i+m]])

window_freq[a[i+m]] += 1

This seems correct.

Let me test it with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

So, b_freq = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

window_freq = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4

Since 4 >= 2, it's good.

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

window_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

matches = same as above, 4 >=2, good.

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

window_freq = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) = 3 >=2, good.

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

window_freq = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) = 2 >=2, good.

Total good subarrays: 4, which matches the first output.

Looks correct.

Let's check the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

b_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

window_freq = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

matches = 4 >=3, good.

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

window_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

matches =4 >=3, good.

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

window_freq = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

matches=3 >=3, good.

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

window_freq = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

matches=2 <3, not good.

Total good subarrays: 3, matches the second output.

Good.

Third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

b_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

window_freq = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

matches=4 >=4, good.

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

window_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

matches=4 >=4, good.

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

window_freq = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

matches=3 <4, not good.

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

window_freq = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

matches=2 <4, not good.

Total good subarrays: 2, matches the third output.

Seems correct.

Fourth test case:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

b_freq = {6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1}

First window: [9,9,2,2,10]

window_freq = {9:2,2:2,10:1}

matches = min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2 <3, not good.

Next window: [9,2,2,10,9]

window_freq = {9:2,2:2,10:1}

same as above, matches=2 <3, not good.

Next window: [2,2,10,9,7]

window_freq = {2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1}

matches = min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 0+0+1+1+1=3 >=3, good.

Next window: [2,10,9,7,6]

window_freq = {2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1}

matches = min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 0+1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good.

Next window: [10,9,7,6,3]

window_freq = {10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+1+1+0=4 >=3, good.

Next window: [9,7,6,3,6]

window_freq = {9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+1+0+0=3 >=3, good.

Next window: [7,6,3,6,3]

window_freq = {7:1,6:2,3:2}

matches = min(1,1) + min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+0+0+0=2 <3, not good.

Total good subarrays: 4, matches the fourth output.

Great.

Fifth test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a = [4,1,5,6]

b = [6]

b_freq = {6:1}

First window: [4]

window_freq = {4:1}

matches = min(0,1) =0 <1, not good.

Next window: [1]

matches = min(0,1) =0 <1, not good.

Next window: [5]

matches = min(0,1) =0 <1, not good.

Next window: [6]

matches = min(1,1) =1 >=1, good.

Total good subarrays:1, matches the fifth output.

Perfect.

So, my approach seems correct based on the example.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=m, k=1

In this case, there's only one window, which is the entire array a.

We need to check if at least one element in a matches an element in b.

Edge case 2: k=m

Here, all elements in the window must match elements in b, considering frequencies.

Edge case 3: All elements in a are the same, and all in b are the same.

Edge case 4: n=1, m=1, k=1

Simplest case.

Edge case 5: k=0

But according to constraints, k >=1, so not applicable.

Let me test with n=1, m=1, k=1.

Input:

1

1 1 1

6

6

Output should be 1, since the only window [6] matches b=[6].

Another test:

n=3, m=2, k=1

a=[1,2,3]

b=[2,2]

b_freq={2:2}

Windows:

[1,2]: window_freq={1:1,2:1}, matches=min(0,1)+min(1,2)=0+1=1 >=1, good.

[2,3]: window_freq={2:1,3:1}, matches=min(1,2)+min(0,1)=1+0=1 >=1, good.

Total good subarrays:2

Another test:

n=3, m=2, k=2

a=[1,2,2]

b=[2,2]

b_freq={2:2}

Windows:

[1,2]: window_freq={1:1,2:1}, matches=min(0,2)+min(1,2)=0+1=1 <2, not good.

[2,2]: window_freq={2:2}, matches=min(2,2)=2 >=2, good.

Total good subarrays:1

Looks correct.

Now, think about time complexity.

For each test case, we have n <= 2e5, m <= n.

The sliding window approach runs in O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable since the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5.

Space complexity is O(n) for storing counters, which should be fine.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))

a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

print(func_1(a, b, k, n, m))

def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):

good_subarrays = 0

b_freq = Counter(b)

window_freq = Counter(a[:m])

matches = sum((min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq))

for i in range(n - m):

if matches >= k:

good_subarrays += 1

if a[i] in b_freq:

matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])

window_freq[a[i]] -= 1

if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:

del window_freq[a[i]]

if a[i + m] in b_freq:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

else:

window_freq[a[i + m]] = 1

if matches >= k:

good_subarrays += 1

return good_subarrays

Wait, there's an issue here.

In the for loop, it says:

for i in range(n - m):

...

if a[i + m] in b_freq:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

else:

window_freq[a[i + m]] = 1

This seems incorrect.

When adding a new element a[i + m], if it's in b_freq, we should update matches accordingly.

But in the else clause, when a[i + m] not in b_freq, we set window_freq[a[i + m]] = 1, which is fine, but we shouldn't affect matches in this case.

Moreover, in the current implementation, when a[i + m] is in b_freq, it increases window_freq[a[i + m]] by 1 and adjusts matches.

But, it doesn't handle the case when a[i + m] is not in b_freq correctly.

Wait, in the else clause, when a[i + m] not in b_freq, we just add it to window_freq, which is fine, but we shouldn't affect matches because b_freq[a[i + m]] is 0.

So, perhaps it's okay.

But, in the removal part, when a[i] is in b_freq, it decreases matches correctly.

But, in the addition part, when a[i + m] is in b_freq, it increases matches by min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]]) - min(window_freq[a[i + m]], b_freq[a[i + m]] )

But in the given code, it's written as:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

Which is not exactly the same as matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]]) - min(window_freq[a[i + m]], b_freq[a[i + m]])

It's missing the subtraction part.

This might lead to incorrect matches count.

Wait, perhaps the author intended to do it this way for simplicity, but it's incorrect.

Let me see with an example.

Take n=4, m=2, k=1

a=[1,2,2,3]

b=[2,2]

b_freq={2:2}

First window: [1,2]

window_freq={1:1,2:1}

matches = min(0,2) + min(1,2) = 0 + 1 =1 >=1, good.

Next window: [2,2]

Remove a[0]=1 (not in b_freq), so matches remains 1.

Add a[2]=2 (in b_freq), matches += min(1 + 1, 2) - min(1,2) = min(2,2) - min(1,2) = 2 -1 =1

So matches becomes 1 +1 =2 >=1, good.

Next window: [2,3]

Remove a[1]=2 (in b_freq), matches -= min(1,2)=1, matches=2-1=1

Add a[3]=3 (not in b_freq), matches remains 1 >=1, good.

Total good subarrays:3

But according to the definition, windows are:

[1,2]: matches=1 >=1, good.

[2,2]: matches=2 >=1, good.

[2,3]: matches=1 >=1, good.

So, good subarrays=3, which seems correct.

But in the code, when adding a[i + m], if it's in b_freq, it does:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

Which, in the above example, when adding a[2]=2:

min(1 +1=2, 2)=2

matches +=2

But before that, when removing a[0]=1 (not in b_freq), matches remains 1.

Then matches becomes 1 +2=3, which is incorrect, because it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the initial window [1,2], matches=1.

Then, removing a[0]=1 (not in b_freq), matches remains 1.

Adding a[2]=2 (in b_freq), matches should increase by min(1 +1=2, 2) - min(1,2)=1

So, matches +=1, total matches=2.

But in the code, it does matches += min(1+1=2,2)=2, so matches becomes 1 +2=3, which is wrong.

It should be 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

It should be:

if a[i + m] in b_freq:

prev_matches = min(window_freq[a[i + m]], b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

new_matches = min(window_freq[a[i + m]], b_freq[a[i + m]])

matches += new_matches - prev_matches

else:

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

But in the given code, it's simply:

matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

Which is incorrect, as shown in the example.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, it still gave the correct answer because matches was 3 instead of 2, but since k=1, it still counts as good.

But in other cases, it might give wrong results.

Let me see another example.

n=4, m=2, k=2

a=[1,2,2,3]

b=[2,2]

b_freq={2:2}

First window: [1,2], matches=1 <2, not good.

Next window: [2,2], matches=2 >=2, good.

Next window: [2,3], matches=1 <2, not good.

Total good subarrays=1

But according to the incorrect code, in the second window, matches would be 3 >=2, good.

Third window: removing a[1]=2 (in b_freq), matches -= min(1,2)=1, matches=3-1=2

Adding a[3]=3 (not in b_freq), matches remains 2 >=2, good.

So, it would count 2 good subarrays instead of 1.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
