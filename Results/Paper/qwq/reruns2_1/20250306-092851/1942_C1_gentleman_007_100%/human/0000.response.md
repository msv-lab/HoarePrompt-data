Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a birthday cake in the shape of a regular polygon with N sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N clockwise. Bessie has already chosen X vertices, and I can choose up to Y additional vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals, forming triangular pieces of cake. The goal is to maximize the number of these triangular pieces.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what I'm allowed to do. The problem mentions that Y is always 0 in this version, which means I can't choose any additional vertices beyond the X vertices Bessie has already chosen. So, I only work with the X vertices provided.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces by drawing diagonals between these X vertices. The key here is "non-intersecting" diagonals, which means that the diagonals shouldn't cross each other inside the polygon.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the polygon is regular and the vertices are chosen, I need to find a way to connect these vertices to form as many triangles as possible without any diagonals intersecting.

One way to think about this is to consider the chosen vertices as partitioning the polygon into smaller sections, and then count the triangles in each section.

Wait, maybe I should consider the chosen vertices as forming a sub-polygon, and then triangulate that sub-polygon.

But actually, since the diagonals must be drawn using only the chosen vertices and cannot intersect, this sounds similar to triangulating a polygon with some vertices removed.

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose I have a regular polygon with N sides, and Bessie has chosen X vertices. I need to draw diagonals between these X vertices such that no two diagonals intersect, and count the maximum number of triangles formed.

I recall that in a polygon with K sides, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is K-2. But here, it's not a single polygon but possibly multiple smaller polygons formed by the chosen vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the chosen vertices as dividing the original polygon into several smaller polygons, and then sum the number of triangles in each of these smaller polygons.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to go. Let's try to look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute the maximum number of triangles.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

N = 8, X = 4, Y = 0

Chosen vertices: 1, 6, 2, 5

Output: 2

Second test case:

N = 8, X = 8, Y = 0

Chosen vertices: 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8

Output: 6

Third test case:

N = 4, X = 2, Y = 0

Chosen vertices: 1, 3

Output: 2

Hmm, in the first test case, with X=4, the output is 2. For X=8, output is 6, and for X=2, output is 2.

Wait a minute, in a polygon with X vertices, the number of triangles in a triangulation is X-2. But in the first test case, X=4, so 4-2=2, which matches the output. Similarly, for X=8, 8-2=6, and for X=2, 2-2=0, but the output is 2. Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe it's not that simple. Maybe there's something else going on.

Wait, in the third test case, with X=2, output is 2. That doesn't make sense if it's X-2, because 2-2=0. Maybe there's an additional consideration.

Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the convex hull of the chosen vertices or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices in the polygon.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of triangles that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals among the chosen vertices.

Let me try to think about it in terms of graph theory. The chosen vertices form a subgraph of the polygon's graph, and I need to triangulate that subgraph without crossing edges.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the problem differently.

Let me consider sorting the chosen vertices in clockwise order. That makes sense since the polygon is regular and vertices are numbered clockwise.

So, for the first test case, sorted chosen vertices are 1,2,5,6.

For the second test case, sorted chosen vertices are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

For the third test case, sorted chosen vertices are 1,3.

Now, I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals among these vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

In the first test case, with vertices 1,2,5,6, I can draw a diagonal between 2 and 5, forming two triangles: one between 1,2,5 and another between 2,5,6.

Hence, 2 triangles, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, with all vertices from 1 to 8, triangulating an octagon would yield 8-2=6 triangles, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, with vertices 1 and 3 in a square, I need to figure out how to get 2 triangles.

Wait, in a square with only vertices 1 and 3 chosen, there are no diagonals to draw between them since they are already connected by an edge. So, perhaps the whole polygon is considered, and I need to see how many triangles can be formed using the chosen vertices.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that when X is less than 3, I can't form any triangles, but in the sample, X=2 gives output 2, which contradicts that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again carefully.

"Bessie has already chosen X of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than Y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized."

And in this version, Y=0, meaning I can't choose any additional vertices beyond the X chosen by Bessie.

So, I only work with the X chosen vertices.

Now, the key is to draw non-intersecting diagonals among these X vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Wait, but in the third test case, with X=2, how can I form any triangles? Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me read the problem again.

"It is guaranteed that the sum of X over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5."

"Output: For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out."

Wait, perhaps the triangles don't have to be formed only by the chosen vertices; maybe they can use the non-chosen vertices as well, but the diagonals are only drawn between chosen vertices.

Let me think about that.

In the first test case, with chosen vertices 1,2,5,6 in an 8-sided polygon, if I draw a diagonal between 2 and 5, then I form two triangles: 1-2-5 and 2-5-6.

These are triangles that use the sides of the polygon as well.

So, perhaps the triangles can use the sides of the polygon, not just the diagonals.

In that case, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to X - the number of connected components or something like that.

Wait, in the third test case, with X=2 and Y=0, output is 2.

Wait, but in a square, with chosen vertices 1 and 3, if I draw the diagonal between 1 and 3, I split the square into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 1-3-4.

Hence, 2 triangles, which matches the sample output.

So, even with X=2, if the chosen vertices are not adjacent, I can draw a diagonal between them and split the polygon into two triangles.

Wait, but in this case, with X=2, I can draw one diagonal, which splits the polygon into two triangles.

Hence, the number of triangles is 2.

Similarly, in X=4, with vertices 1,2,5,6, drawing one diagonal (2-5) splits into two triangles.

In X=8, with all vertices, drawing diagonals splits into 6 triangles.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to X - 2 + number of "gaps" where the gap is a sequence of consecutive vertices not chosen.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think in terms of graph theory.

Consider the polygon as a cycle graph with N vertices.

Bessie chooses X vertices, and I can choose up to Y additional vertices.

In this version, Y=0, so I can't choose any additional vertices.

I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

So, the chosen vertices form a subgraph of the cycle graph, and I need to triangulate that subgraph.

In general, for a cycle graph with X vertices, the number of triangles in a triangulation is X - 2.

But in the third test case, X=2, and X - 2 = 0, but the output is 2.

So, maybe it's not directly X - 2.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of triangles formed by adding diagonals to divide the cycle into triangles.

But in X=2, it's not a cycle, so maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles per connected component.

Each connected component of chosen vertices can be triangulated separately.

In the third test case, with X=2 in a 4-sided polygon, the two chosen vertices are likely opposite each other, and drawing one diagonal splits the square into two triangles.

Hence, 2 triangles.

Similarly, in X=4, with vertices 1,2,5,6, drawing one diagonal (2-5) splits into two triangles.

In X=8, with all vertices, triangulating gives 6 triangles.

So, perhaps the general formula is X - 2 + number of connected components or something like that.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have a cycle with X chosen vertices.

The number of triangles formed by triangulating this cycle would be X - 2.

But in the third test case, X=2, and 2 - 2 = 0, but the output is 2.

So, maybe it's N - X + something.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the polygon's edges.

Wait, perhaps it's N - X.

In the third test case, N=4, X=2, N - X = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, N=8, X=4, N - X = 4, but the sample output is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

In the second test case, N=8, X=8, N - X = 0, but the sample output is 6.

No, that doesn't work.

Alternative idea: maybe it's the number of triangles that can be formed by adding non-intersecting diagonals among the chosen vertices.

In the third test case, with X=2, I can draw one diagonal, forming two triangles.

In the first test case, with X=4, I can draw one diagonal, forming two triangles.

In the second test case, with X=8, I can draw diagonals to form six triangles.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of diagonals drawn plus something.

Wait, in the third test case, with X=2, I draw one diagonal, forming two triangles.

In the first test case, with X=4, I draw one diagonal, forming two triangles.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, in the first test case, with X=4, if I draw one diagonal, I get two triangles.

But in the second test case, with X=8, if I draw three diagonals, I can get six triangles.

Wait, perhaps it's twice the number of diagonals drawn.

In the third test case, one diagonal, two triangles.

In the first test case, one diagonal, two triangles.

In the second test case, three diagonals, six triangles.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, maybe the number of triangles is twice the number of diagonals drawn.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles, so I need to maximize the number of diagonals drawn without them intersecting.

This sounds like a standard problem of finding a maximum matching in a graph.

Wait, but in this case, it's about drawing non-intersecting diagonals in a convex polygon.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of non-intersecting diagonals is X - 2, where X is the number of vertices.

Wait, but in the third test case, X=2, and X - 2 = 0, but the output is 2.

Hmm, maybe it's different because some vertices are chosen and others are not.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of chosen vertices and see how they divide the polygon into regions.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have a cycle with X chosen vertices.

If I draw a diagonal between two chosen vertices that are not adjacent, it divides the cycle into two smaller cycles.

Then, the number of triangles is the sum of the number of triangles in each smaller cycle minus the diagonal drawn.

Wait, more formally, if I have a cycle with K vertices, the number of triangles in a triangulation is K - 2.

So, if I have a cycle with X vertices, the number of triangles is X - 2.

But in the third test case, X=2, and 2 - 2 = 0, but the output is 2.

So, perhaps it's different when X < 3.

Wait, maybe when X < 3, it's not a cycle, so I need to consider the polygon's edges.

Wait, in the third test case, with X=2 in a 4-sided polygon, the two chosen vertices are opposite each other, and drawing the diagonal between them splits the square into two triangles.

Hence, output is 2.

So, perhaps when X < 3, I can still form triangles by using the polygon's edges.

I need to generalize this.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several parts, and each part can be triangulated separately.

In the third test case, with X=2 in a 4-sided polygon, the two chosen vertices divide the polygon into two triangles.

Hence, output is 2.

In the first test case, with X=4 in an 8-sided polygon, the chosen vertices divide the polygon into two quadrilaterals, each of which can be triangulated into one triangle each, totaling 2 triangles.

In the second test case, with X=8 in an 8-sided polygon, the chosen vertices form the entire polygon, which can be triangulated into 6 triangles.

So, perhaps the general formula is X - 2, but with some adjustments when X is less than 3.

Wait, in the third test case, X=2, and output is 2, which is N - X.

In the first test case, X=4, output is 2, which is N - X.

In the second test case, X=8, output is 6, which is X - 2.

Hmm, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of X - 2 and N - X.

But in the first test case, min(4 - 2, 8 - 4) = min(2,4) = 2, which matches the sample.

In the second test case, min(8 - 2, 8 - 8) = min(6,0) = 0, but the sample output is 6.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternative idea: perhaps it's N - X when X < N, and X - 2 when X >= 3.

But in the third test case, X=2, N=4, output is 2, which is N - X.

In the first test case, X=4, N=8, output is 2, which is N - X.

In the second test case, X=8, N=8, output is 6, which is X - 2.

So, perhaps the formula is min(N - X, X - 2).

But in the second test case, min(8 - 8, 8 - 2) = min(0,6) = 0, but output is 6.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe it's max(N - X, X - 2).

In the third test case, max(4 - 2, 2 - 2) = max(2,0) = 2.

In the first test case, max(8 - 4, 4 - 2) = max(4,2) = 4, but sample output is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's X - 2 + something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of "gaps" between chosen vertices.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the chosen vertices in sorted order: v1, v2, v3, ..., vx.

Each pair of consecutive chosen vertices (vi, vi+1) forms a chord in the polygon.

If two chords don't intersect, I can draw diagonals within the regions they form.

Wait, maybe I need to find the number of triangles per region formed by the chosen vertices.

In the third test case, with X=2 in N=4, the two chosen vertices divide the polygon into two triangles.

Hence, output is 2.

In the first test case, with X=4 in N=8, the chosen vertices divide the polygon into two quadrilaterals, each triangulated into one triangle, totaling 2 triangles.

In the second test case, with X=8 in N=8, the entire polygon is triangulated into 6 triangles.

So, perhaps I need to consider each "section" between chosen vertices and triangulate them separately.

Wait, but in the third test case, there's only two chosen vertices, dividing the polygon into two triangles.

In general, if I have X chosen vertices, they divide the polygon into X regions, each of which can be triangulated.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, in a convex polygon, choosing X vertices and considering the regions they form, the number of triangles is N - X.

Wait, in the third test case, N=4, X=2, N - X=2, which matches the sample.

In the first test case, N=8, X=4, N - X=4, but sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

In the second test case, N=8, X=8, N - X=0, but sample output is 6.

So, perhaps it's not N - X.

Wait, maybe it's X - the number of connected components.

But I need to think about how the chosen vertices divide the polygon.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of diagonals drawn plus something.

Wait, in the third test case, one diagonal is drawn, forming two triangles.

In the first test case, one diagonal is drawn, forming two triangles.

In the second test case, three diagonals are drawn, forming six triangles.

So, perhaps it's twice the number of diagonals drawn.

But I need a way to compute the maximum number of such diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's X - the number of cycles formed.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The code reads T test cases, each with N, X, Y, followed by X distinct integers representing the chosen vertices.

Given that Y=0, I don't need to choose any additional vertices.

The code sorts the chosen vertices and then iterates through them to count something.

Specifically, it initializes ans = x - 2.

Then, for each pair of consecutive vertices, if they are 2 apart (i.e., arr[i] - arr[i-1] == 2), it increments ans by 1.

Finally, it checks if the first and last vertices are 1 and n-1 or 1 and n, and increments ans accordingly.

Wait, in the third test case, with X=2, arr=[1,3], n=4.

So, arr[1]-arr[0]=2, so it increments ans by 1.

Initial ans = 2 - 2 = 0, plus 1 becomes 1.

Then, checks if arr[x-1]=n-1 and arr[0]=1, which is 3==4-1 and 1==1, so increments ans by 1, making it 2.

Hence, output is 2, which matches the sample.

In the first test case, arr=[1,2,5,6], sorted as [1,2,5,6].

arr[i]-arr[i-1]: 2-1=1, 5-2=3, 6-5=1.

Only one pair with arr[i]-arr[i-1]=2, which is none, so ans remains x-2=2.

Then, checks if arr[x-1]=n-1 and arr[0]=1, which is 6==8-1? No, 6!=7.

Also checks if arr[x-1]=n and arr[0]=1, which is 6==8 and 1==1, yes, so increments ans by 1, making it 3.

But the sample output is 2, so perhaps there's an error here.

Wait, perhaps it's ans = x - 2, then for each pair where arr[i]-arr[i-1]==2, increment ans by 1.

In this case, arr[i]-arr[i-1]==2 only between 1 and 3, but in [1,2,5,6], there's no such pair.

Hence, ans = 4 - 2 = 2.

Then, check if arr[x-1]=n-1 and arr[0]=1, which is 6==7? No.

Check if arr[x-1]=n and arr[0]=1, which is 6==8 and 1==1, yes, so ans +=1, making it 3.

But sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Looking back at the code:

ans = x - 2

for i in range(1, x):

if arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]:

ans += 1

if arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:

ans += 1

if arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2:

ans += 1

print(ans)

In the first test case, arr=[1,2,5,6], n=8.

arr[i]-arr[i-1]: 2-1=1, 5-2=3, 6-5=1.

No pair where arr[i]-arr[i-1]==2, so ans remains 2.

Then, arr[x-1]=6, n-1=7, not equal, so no increment.

arr[x-1]=6 != n=8, and arr[0]=1, but the condition is arr[x-1]==n and arr[0]==2, which is 6==8 and 1==2, both false, so no increment.

Hence, ans=2, which matches the sample.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would increment ans by 1, but actually, arr[x-1]==n is 6==8, which is false.

Hence, ans=2, matching the sample.

In the second test case, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], n=8.

arr[i]-arr[i-1]: all 1's, so no increment.

Then, arr[x-1]=8==n=8, and arr[0]=1==2? No
