Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The p_i are all distinct and none of them are themselves, so no one is their own best friend. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party, and a friend comes only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

I need to figure out the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is distinct and p_i != i, it means that the best friends are uniquely assigned and no one is their own best friend. This seems like some kind of pairing or matching among the friends.

Let me think about what happens when Monocarp invites a friend. For a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation. But the best friend doesn't necessarily have to come; they just need to have an invitation for the first friend to come.

Wait, but the friend will come only if they and their best friend are invited. So, if I invite friend A and their best friend B, then A will come. But B might also come if their best friend, which might be A or someone else, is invited.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let's look at the example provided.

In the first example:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

Monocarp sends invitations to [1, 2, 4, 5]

Then, friends [2, 4, 5] will come.

- Friend 1: invited, best friend is 3 (who is also invited), but friend 3's best friend is 2 (who is invited), so friend 3 would come, but friend 1's best friend is 3, who is invited, but friend 1 doesn't come because friend 3 is not coming (since friend 3's best friend is 2, who is invited, so friend 3 comes). Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, according to the problem, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited. So, for friend 1 to come, both friend 1 and friend 3 need to be invited. Friend 3 comes only if both friend 3 and friend 2 are invited.

In the example, friends invited: [1,2,4,5]

- Friend 1: invited, best friend 3 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2: invited, best friend 3 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3: invited, best friend 2 is invited, so friend 3 comes.

- Friend 4: invited, best friend 5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- Friend 5: invited, best friend 4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

Wait, but in the example, it says that only friends [2,4,5] come. Maybe I misread.

Wait, let's read the example again.

"In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party."

Wait, that's different. If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4: invited, best friend 5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- Friend 5: invited, best friend 4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, but friend 1 is invited, and friend 1's best friend is 3, who is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

Wait, but according to the example, friends [2,4,5] will come. But friend 2 is not invited, so how can friend 2 come?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition. Let me read the problem statement again.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

Wait, but in the example, friend 2 comes even though only friend 4 and 5 are invited. Wait, no, in the example, it says Monocarp sends invitations to friends 4 and 5, then friends 2,4,5 come.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with the rule. Let's see.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4: invited, best friend 5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- Friend 5: invited, best friend 4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, best friend is 3, who is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

But according to the example, friends [2,4,5] come. There must be something wrong in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps there's a chain effect. Let's see.

If friend 4 is invited, and friend 5 is invited, then friend 4 comes, and friend 5 comes.

Now, friend 5 coming might imply that their best friend, which is 4, is invited, which is already covered.

But why does friend 2 come in this scenario? Maybe because friend 2's best friend is 3, who is not invited, so friend 2 shouldn't come.

This confusion suggests that I might be misinterpreting the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

In the example, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3.

Friend 2's best friend is 1.

Friend 3's best friend is 2.

Friend 4's best friend is 5.

Friend 5's best friend is 4.

Now, if Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4: invited, p_i=5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- Friend 5: invited, p_i=4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, p_i=1 is invited (since friend 1 is invited), but since friend 2 is not invited, friend 2 doesn't come.

Wait, but in the example, it says friends [2,4,5] come. There must be a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example. Let me check the example again.

"In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party."

Wait, maybe I misread the output. Let me check the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

3

5

3 1 2 5 4

4

2 3 4 1

2

2 1

Sample Output:

2

3

2

In the first test case, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4]

According to the example, output is 2, meaning that Monocarp can send invitations to 2 friends, and at least 2 friends will come.

In the explanation, it says sending invitations to friends 4 and 5 results in friends 2,4,5 coming.

But according to my earlier reasoning, only friends 4 and 5 should come.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me look again.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited.

In the first test case:

p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3.

friend 2's best friend is 1.

friend 3's best friend is 2.

friend 4's best friend is 5.

friend 5's best friend is 4.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- friend 4: invited, p_i=5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- friend 5: invited, p_i=4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

- friend 2: not invited, p_i=1 is invited (since friend 1 is not invited), so friend 2 doesn't come.

Wait, but according to the explanation, friend 2 comes. There must be something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that friend 2 is coming because friend 1 is invited, and friend 1's best friend is 3, who is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come, but friend 2 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

This is confusing. Maybe the example is misstated or I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me try to rephrase the condition.

Friend i comes to the party only if both i and p_i are invited.

So, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited.

In the first test case, if Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- friend 4 comes (since 4 and 5 are invited).

- friend 5 comes (since 5 and 4 are invited).

- friend 1 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- friend 2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- friend 3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

So, only friends 4 and 5 come, but the explanation says [2,4,5] come. There must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that friend 2 comes because friend 1 is invited, and friend 1's best friend is 3, who is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come, but friend 2 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

This is inconsistent with the explanation. Maybe I need to look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that when Monocarp invites friend i, friend i comes only if their best friend is also invited.

But the problem says: "the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, both conditions must be met: i is invited and p_i is invited.

Wait, but perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the example.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the friendships form cycles.

In the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 3's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 1. So, there is a cycle: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

Friend 4's best friend is 5, and friend 5's best friend is 4, so another cycle: 4 -> 5 -> 4.

So, there are two cycles: one of size 3 and one of size 2.

In general, the p_i form a permutation where no one is their own best friend, and all p_i are distinct.

So, the p_i form a derangement of the friends.

Given that, Monocarp wants to select a set of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party, and a friend comes only if both they and their best friend are invited.

He wants to minimize the number of invitations sent.

I need to find the minimal number of invitations to send such that at least 2 friends come.

Let me think about the cycles.

In the first test case, there is a cycle of size 3 and a cycle of size 2.

In the cycle of size 3: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

In the cycle of size 2: 4 -> 5 -> 4.

If Monocarp invites both friends 4 and 5, then friends 4 and 5 come, since both are invited and their best friends are invited.

So, in this case, he sends 2 invitations and gets 2 friends coming.

In the second test case:

n=4

p= [2,3,4,1]

So, cycles: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 (a single cycle of size 4).

Monocarp needs to send invitations in such a way that at least 2 friends come.

If he invites 3 friends, for example, 1,2,3, then:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=2 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- friend 2: invited, p_i=3 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

- friend 3: invited, p_i=4 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

If he invites only 2 friends, say 1 and 2:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=2 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- friend 2: invited, p_i=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is less than 2.

Similarly, inviting any 2 friends would result in only one friend coming, because in the cycle of 4, to have two friends come, their best friends also need to be invited, which would require inviting at least 3 friends.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 3.

In the third test case:

n=2

p=[2,1]

So, cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites both friends 1 and 2:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=2 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- friend 2: invited, p_i=1 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

So, both come, with 2 invitations.

If he invites only one friend, say 1:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=2 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

- friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, no one comes.

Hence, he needs to invite both, totaling 2 invitations.

From these examples, it seems that in cycles of size 2, inviting both is necessary to have both come, which totals 2 invitations and 2 friends coming.

In cycles of size greater than 2, inviting all but one person in the cycle seems to be sufficient to have at least 2 friends come.

Wait, in the second test case, with a cycle of 4, inviting 3 out of 4 makes 2 friends come.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, in a cycle of size k, to have at least one pair come, perhaps inviting k-1 people is sufficient.

Wait, but in the second test case, inviting 3 out of 4 makes 2 friends come.

Is there a general strategy here?

Let me think about the problem differently.

Let me model this as a graph where friends are nodes, and there is an edge between friends who are each other's best friends.

Given that p_i is distinct and p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct, this forms a perfect matching or a collection of cycles.

Wait, actually, since p_i is a permutation with no fixed points and all p_i are distinct, it forms a collection of cycles.

In the first test case, there is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.

In the second test case, a 4-cycle.

In the third test case, a 2-cycle.

Given that, Monocarp needs to select a set of friends to invite such that for at least 2 friends, both the friend and their best friend are invited.

He wants to minimize the number of invitations sent.

This sounds similar to covering problems in graph theory.

Let me think in terms of selecting edges in the cycle graph.

In a cycle, each edge represents a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.

To have a friend come, Monocarp needs to invite both ends of an edge.

He wants to select a subset of these edges such that at least 2 edges are selected, and minimize the number of unique vertices (invitations) needed.

This sounds like a set cover problem, where each edge is a set containing its two vertices, and we need to cover at least 2 edges with as few vertices as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to selecting matched pairs in a matching.

Wait, but in the problem, p_i forms a permutation, so it's a matching where each friend is matched to their best friend.

In other words, it's a perfect matching (since all p_i are distinct and p_i != i), but not necessarily a perfect matching in the graph theory sense, because in graph theory, a perfect matching requires that every vertex is included, which isn't the case here.

Wait, actually, since p_i is a derangement (permutation with no fixed points), and all p_i are distinct, it forms a collection of cycles of even length.

Wait, no, in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 3, which is odd.

Wait, but in a derangement, cycles can be of any length except length 1.

So, in this problem, cycles can be of any length greater than 1.

Given that, Monocarp needs to select a subset of these cycles to cover, in a way that minimizes the number of invitations while ensuring that at least 2 friends come.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting pairs.

In each cycle, to have a friend come, Monocarp needs to invite both friends in a pair.

So, in a cycle of length k, the number of such pairs is k.

But since it's a cycle, selecting one pair might cover two friends, and selecting another pair might cover one new friend and one already covered friend.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider the minimal number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends come.

In the first test case, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting 2 friends from the 2-cycle is sufficient to have 2 friends come.

In the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends is necessary to have at least 2 friends come.

In the third test case, with a 2-cycle, inviting both friends is necessary to have both come.

Is there a pattern here?

In cycles of even length, inviting half the cycle might be sufficient, but in cycles of odd length, inviting more is needed.

Wait, but in the first test case, the 3-cycle requires inviting 2 friends to have 2 come, but in the second test case, the 4-cycle requires inviting 3 friends to have 2 come.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends doesn't make 2 come, based on my earlier reasoning.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, if Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=3 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

- friend 2: invited, p_i=1 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

- friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, only friend 2 comes, which is less than 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], inviting friends 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, which is 2 friends.

But in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends doesn't make 2 come.

Wait, perhaps I need to invite all friends in a cycle of odd length to have at least 2 come.

Wait, in the 3-cycle, if Monocarp invites all 3 friends:

- friend 1: invited, p_i=3 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- friend 2: invited, p_i=1 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

- friend 3: invited, p_i=2 is invited, so friend 3 comes.

So, all 3 come, with 3 invitations.

But in the first test case, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, inviting 2 friends from the 2-cycle makes 2 friends come.

Alternatively, inviting 2 friends from the 3-cycle might not be sufficient, as per earlier reasoning.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that inviting friends 4 and 5 makes friends 2,4,5 come, but according to my reasoning, only friends 4 and 5 come.

Perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

In the first test case, p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3.

friend 2's best friend is 1.

friend 3's best friend is 2.

friend 4's best friend is 5.

friend 5's best friend is 4.

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- friend 4: invited, p_i=5 is invited, so friend 4 comes.

- friend 5: invited, p_i=4 is invited, so friend 5 comes.

- friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

- friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

- friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, only friends 4 and 5 come.

But in the explanation, it says friends [2,4,5] come. Maybe the explanation is wrong, or I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, perhaps friend 2 comes because friend 1 is invited and friend 1's best friend is 3, who is invited, but friend 2 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that if friend 1 is invited and friend 3 is invited, then friend 1 comes.

If friend 2 is invited and friend 1 is invited, then friend 2 comes.

Similarly for friend 3.

But in the first test case, if Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5, then only friends 4 and 5 come, as per the condition.

Perhaps the explanation has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that a friend comes only if both they and their best friend are invited, but their best friend doesn't necessarily come, just needs to be invited.

Wait, but the problem says "the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation"

So, both need to be invited for friend i to come.

So, in the first test case, inviting friends 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, which is 2 friends, satisfying the condition.

In the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends makes at least 2 friends come, as per earlier reasoning.

In the third test case, with a 2-cycle, inviting both makes both come.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is equal to the size of the smallest cycle in the permutation, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, in the first test case, the smallest cycle is of size 2, and the minimal invitations are 2.

In the second test case, the only cycle is of size 4, and the minimal invitations are 3.

In the third test case, the only cycle is of size 2, and the minimal invitations are 2.

So, it's not simply the size of the smallest cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number of invitations to cover at least 2 cycles.

But in the first test case, covering the 2-cycle requires 2 invitations, which makes 2 friends come.

In the second test case, covering part of the 4-cycle requires 3 invitations to make at least 2 friends come.

Is there a general formula based on the cycle structure?

Let me consider that in a cycle of length k, to have at least one pair come, Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends.

But in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends doesn't make 2 friends come, as per earlier reasoning.

Wait, in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is k.

Wait, no, in a cycle of length k, to have at least one pair come, Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends, but in practice, more are needed.

Wait, perhaps in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is ceil(2k/(k+1)).

Wait, that seems too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Monocarp invites a subset S of friends.

For each friend i in S, if p_i is also in S, then friend i comes.

Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come.

He needs to minimize |S|.

This is similar to finding a subset S of vertices in a graph such that the number of edges within S is at least 2, and minimizing |S|.

In graph terms, it's like selecting a subset of vertices such that at least 2 edges are within S, and minimizing |S|.

But in this problem, the graph is a collection of cycles, since p_i is a derangement with distinct p_i.

Given that, perhaps there is a way to compute the minimal S for each cycle separately and then combine them.

Wait, but in the first test case, there are two cycles: a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.

The minimal S that makes at least 2 friends come is to invite both friends in the 2-cycle, which makes 2 friends come, with 2 invitations.

Alternatively, inviting 2 friends in the 3-cycle makes only 1 friend come, which is insufficient.

Hence, the minimal number is 2.

In the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 friends makes 2 friends come.

Inviting only 2 friends would make only 1 friend come, which is insufficient.

Hence, the minimal number is 3.

In the third test case, with a 2-cycle, inviting both makes both come, with 2 invitations.

Hence, the minimal number is 2.

So, in general, for cycles of different lengths, the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come varies.

Perhaps I can compute for each cycle separately the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least one pair come, and then take the sum over all cycles, ensuring that at least 2 friends come in total.

Wait, but in the first test case, inviting 2 friends from the 2-cycle makes 2 friends come, which satisfies the condition.

In the second test case, inviting 3 friends from the 4-cycle makes 2 friends come, which satisfies the condition.

In the third test case, inviting 2 friends from the 2-cycle makes 2 friends come.

So, perhaps for a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is ceil(2k/(k+1)).

Wait, for k=2: ceil(4/3)=1, but in reality, it's 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min{k, ceil(2k/(k+1))}.

Wait, that also doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps for k >= 3, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is k-1.

Wait, for k=3, it would be 2, but in reality, in the first test case, inviting 2 from the 3-cycle only makes 1 friend come.

Wait, perhaps it's more complex.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length k, to have at least one pair come, Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends.

But in practice, for k=3, inviting 2 friends doesn't make 2 friends come.

Wait, perhaps in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is floor(2k/(k-1)).

Wait, for k=3, floor(6/2)=3, which matches the first test case (need to invite 3 out of 3 to have 2 come).

For k=4, floor(8/3)=2, but in reality, in the second test case, inviting 3 out of 4 makes 2 come.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's k - floor((k-2)/2).

Wait, for k=3, it's 3 - floor(1/2)=3-0=3, which matches.

For k=4, 4 - floor(2/2)=4-1=3, which matches.

For k=2, 2 - floor(0/2)=2-0=2, which matches.

So, maybe for a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is k - floor((k-2)/2).

Wait, but let's verify for k=2: inviting 2 friends makes 2 friends come, which is correct.

For k=3: inviting 3-0=3 friends makes 3 friends come.

For k=4: inviting 4-1=3 friends makes 2 friends come.

So, in general, for a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least floor(k/2) friends come.

Wait, but in the second test case, with k=4, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come, which is floor(4/2)=2.

Similarly, in the first test case, with k=3, inviting 3 makes floor(3/2)=1 friend come, but in reality, inviting 3 makes all 3 come.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps for each cycle, the minimal number of invitations to have at least one pair come is equal to the cycle length minus the floor of (cycle length minus 1 divided by 2).

Wait, for k=3: 3 - floor(2/2)=3-1=2, but in reality, inviting 2 makes only 1 friend come.

Wait, perhaps that's not it.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Monocarp needs to select a subset S of friends to invite, such that the number of friends i in S where p_i is also in S is at least 2.

He wants to minimize |S|.

This sounds like finding a subset S with at least 2 mutual best friends both invited.

This seems similar to finding a matching in the graph.

Wait, perhaps it's related to finding a set S where the number of edges within S is at least 2.

In graph terms, it's like selecting a subset S with at least 2 edges within S, and minimizing |S|.

In a cycle of length k, the minimal |S| with at least 2 edges is k if k=2, and k-1 for k>=3.

Wait, for k=3, S with |S|=3 has 3 edges, |S|=2 has 1 edge, |S|=1 has 0 edges.

So, to have at least 2 edges, need |S|=3.

For k=4, S with |S|=4 has 4 edges, |S|=3 has 3 edges, |S|=2 has 2 edges.

So, minimal |S| is 2.

Wait, but in the second test case, with k=4, inviting 2 friends makes only 1 friend come, because in a 4-cycle, inviting 2 friends can cover only 1 pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that at least 2 specific pairs are covered, not just 2 edges in the cycle.

Wait, I'm getting stuck in cycle details.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that in a cycle of length k, to have at least 2 friends come, Monocarp needs to invite at least ceil(2k/(k+1)) friends.

Wait, for k=2: ceil(4/3)=1, but needs to invite 2.

No, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min{k, ceil(2*k/k)} = min{k, 2}.

But for k=2, it's 2, for k>=3, it's 2.

But in the second test case, with k=4, it's 3, not 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k/2).

For k=2: 1, but needs to invite 2.

Wait, no.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that in any cycle, to have at least one pair come, Monocarp needs to invite at least 2 friends.

But in practice, for cycles of length k >= 3, inviting 2 friends might not be sufficient, as per earlier reasoning.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of length 2, minimal invitations are 2.

For cycles of length k >=3, minimal invitations are k.

But in the second test case, with k=4, minimal invitations are 3, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps for cycles of length k >=3, minimal invitations to have at least 2 friends come are k-1.

In the second test case, k=4, k-1=3, which matches.

In the first test case, k=3, k-1=2, but in the 3-cycle, inviting 2 friends makes only 1 friend come, so needs to invite all 3.

Hence, perhaps for k >=3, it's k.

Wait, but in the second test case, k=4, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come.

Wait, perhaps it's k - floor(k/3).

Wait, for k=3: 3-1=2, but needs to invite 3.

No, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's k - ceil(k/4).

For k=4: 4-1=3, which matches.

For k=3: 3-1=2, but needs to invite 3.

No, doesn't match.

This is too convoluted.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length k, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come is the minimal |S| such that the number of edges within S is at least 2.

In graph terms, it's the minimal |S| such that the subgraph induced by S has at least 2 edges.

In a cycle of length k, the minimal |S| with at least 2 edges is:

- For k=2: |S|=2 (only possible subset with 2 edges).

- For k=3: |S|=3 (the whole cycle).

- For k=4: |S|=3 (by selecting 3 vertices, which include 3 edges).

Wait, but in k=4, selecting any 3 vertices includes 3 edges, which is more than 2.

But in the problem, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come, which corresponds to 2 edges.

Wait, perhaps it's that in a cycle of length k, the minimal |S| such that the number of edges within S is at least 2 is k-1 for k >=3.

Wait, for k=3: |S|=3 has 3 edges, which is more than 2.

For k=4: |S|=3 has 3 edges, which is more than 2.

For k=2: |S|=2 has 2 edges.

Hence, perhaps in general, for a cycle of length k, the minimal |S| with at least 2 edges is k-1 if k >=3, and 2 if k=2.

But in the second test case, with k=4, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come, which matches.

In the first test case, with k=3, inviting 3 makes 3 friends come, which is more than 2.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is k-1 for k >=3, and 2 for k=2.

But in the first test case, there is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.

Inviting 2 from the 2-cycle makes 2 friends come, which is sufficient.

Hence, the overall minimal is 2.

In the second test case, with a 4-cycle, inviting 3 makes 2 friends come.

Hence, minimal is 3.

In the third test case, with a 2-cycle, inviting 2 makes 2 friends come.

Hence, minimal is 2.

So, in general, for a
