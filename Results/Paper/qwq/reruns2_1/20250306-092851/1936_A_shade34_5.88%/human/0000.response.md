Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to think about what information I can get from these queries. Each query gives me a comparison between (p_a OR p_b) and (p_c OR p_d). I need to use these comparisons to figure out which elements of the permutation are larger or have certain bit patterns, since XOR depends on the bits differing.

One approach could be to try to identify the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation, because the maximum XOR would likely come from these two. But permutations can be tricky, and the XOR operation is not straightforward.

Let me think differently. Since XOR is maximized when the bits of the two numbers differ, perhaps I can try to find two numbers that differ in the highest possible bit positions.

Wait, but I don't know the actual values of p_i; I only have access to comparisons of their ORs. So, maybe I need to find a way to compare elements indirectly through these OR queries.

I recall that in binary search and similar algorithms, we use comparisons to narrow down possibilities. Maybe I can adapt that here.

Let me consider the highest bit first. Suppose n is up to 10^4, so numbers can be up to 13 bits (since 2^13 = 8192). I need to consider the bits from the most significant to the least significant.

But wait, I'm not sure if thinking in terms of bit positions is directly helpful here because I'm dealing with OR and XOR operations, which are different.

Let me try to find the maximum possible XOR value. The maximum XOR would be achieved when p_i and p_j differ in as many bit positions as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can find two numbers that are as different as possible in their bit patterns.

But again, without knowing the actual values, I need to use the queries to gather information.

Maybe I can try to find the maximum and second maximum elements in terms of their OR values, and then use that to determine which two elements to XOR.

Wait, but OR combines bits in a different way than XOR. OR sets a bit if it's set in either number, while XOR sets a bit only if it's set in one but not both.

I need to find a way to use the OR comparisons to infer something about the XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find for each bit position, which elements have that bit set, and use that information to construct the XOR.

But that seems too involved, and I need to do it with limited queries.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the example, n=4, and the hidden permutation is [0,3,1,2].

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", they get "<" because (0 OR 1) =1 < (2 OR 3)=3.

Then "? 1 1 2 3", they get "=" because (3 OR 3)=3 == (1 OR 2)=3.

Then "? 1 2 0 3", they get ">" because (3 OR 1)=3 > (0 OR 2)=2.

Finally, they answer "! 3 2" which is indices 3 and 2 with values 2 and 1, XOR is 3, which is maximal.

Another valid answer would be "! 0 1", which is 0 and 3, XOR is 3.

So, in this case, any pair that includes the minimum and maximum values gives the maximal XOR.

Wait, in this specific permutation, the maximum XOR is between the smallest and largest numbers.

Is that always the case?

Let me try another permutation, say n=3, permutation [0,1,2].

Possible pairs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

1 XOR 2 = 3

So, the maximal XOR is 3, achieved by 1 and 2.

Similarly, in n=4, [0,3,1,2], 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is maximal.

Wait, but 3 XOR 2 = 1, which is not maximal.

Wait, no, 3 XOR 2 is actually 3 XOR 2 = 1, which is 0b11 XOR 0b10 = 0b01 =1.

Wait, in the example, they said p3 XOR p2 = 2 XOR 1 = 3, which is correct: 2 is 0b10, 1 is 0b01, XOR is 0b11 which is 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 is 3.

Yes, 1 is 0b01, 2 is 0b10, XOR is 0b11 which is 3.

Similarly, 3 XOR 2 is 0b11 XOR 0b10 = 0b01 which is 1.

So, in this case, the maximal XOR is between 1 and 2, not between the minimum and maximum values.

Wait, in that permutation, p1=3, p2=1, p3=2.

So, p1 XOR p2 = 3 XOR 1 = 2

p1 XOR p3 = 3 XOR 2 = 1

p2 XOR p3 = 1 XOR 2 = 3

So, indeed, the maximal XOR is between p2 and p3, which are 1 and 2.

So, it's not necessarily between the smallest and largest numbers.

Hmm.

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

XOR is maximized when the two numbers differ in the highest possible bit positions.

So, if I can find two numbers that differ in the most significant bits, their XOR will be larger.

So, perhaps I need to find the two numbers that have the most differing bits in their binary representation.

But how do I do that using only OR comparisons?

Wait, maybe I can try to find the maximum and second maximum numbers in terms of their OR values, but I'm not sure if that directly translates to maximum XOR.

Wait, OR combines the set bits, whereas XOR looks for differing bits.

They are different operations, so maximizing OR doesn't necessarily correlate with maximizing XOR.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a given permutation of 0 to n-1, all numbers are unique.

So, I can think in terms of bit manipulation to find which two numbers have the maximum XOR.

But I need to do this indirectly through OR comparisons.

Wait, maybe I can try to find, for each bit position, which elements have that bit set, and use that information to determine which pairs could have that bit set in their XOR.

But that seems complicated, and I need to do it within 3n queries.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I fix one element and compare its OR with another element to some other ORs, and see how that can help me find a good partner for XOR.

Wait, perhaps I can fix one element and try to find another element that differs from it in as many bit positions as possible.

But again, I need to do this through OR comparisons.

This is tricky.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program seems to be trying to find the maximum element first, and then find another element that, when OR'ed with the maximum, gives a certain value.

Wait, let's see step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n

- Initialize mak = 0

- For i from 1 to n-1:

- Ask "? mak mak i i"

- If the answer is '<', set mak = i

So, it's comparing (p_mak OR p_mak) with (p_i OR p_i), which is effectively comparing p_mak with p_i, since x OR x = x.

So, it's finding the maximum element in the permutation by comparing elements directly.

That makes sense.

After this loop, mak should hold the index of the maximum element in p.

Then, it sets mak2 = mak

Then, it initializes pans = []

Then, for i from 0 to n-1:

- Ask "? mak mak2 i mak2"

- If the answer is '<', set mak = i and set pans = [i]

- Else if the answer is '=', append i to pans

So, it's comparing (p_mak OR p_mak2) with (p_i OR p_mak2)

But since mak and mak2 both point to the same index, which has the maximum p value, (p_mak OR p_mak2) = p_mak | p_mak = p_mak

So, it's comparing p_mak with (p_i OR p_mak2)

Since p_mak is the maximum, and p_mak2 is also p_mak, it's comparing p_mak with (p_i OR p_mak)

If p_i OR p_mak > p_mak, then p_i must have some bits set that p_mak doesn't have, but since p_mak is the maximum, this seems unlikely.

Wait, actually, p_i OR p_mak could be equal to p_mak if p_i <= p_mak, or greater if p_i has some bits not present in p_mak.

But since p_mak is the maximum, p_i OR p_mak should be equal to p_mak for all i, because p_i <= p_mak.

So, in that case, all comparisons should return '='.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, after finding mak=3 (p3=2), and mak2=3, then:

- For i=0: p0=0 OR p3=2 => 2 < 2? No, equal

- For i=1: p1=3 OR p3=2 => 3 > 2 => '<'

- For i=2: p2=1 OR p3=2 => 3 > 2 => '<'

- For i=3: p3=2 OR p3=2 => 2 = 2 => '='

So, in this case, for i=1 and i=2, it gets '<', so it sets mak=i and pans=[i]

Wait, but p1 OR p3 = 3 > p_mak=2, which is correct because p1=3 > p_mak=2, but earlier I thought p_mak is the maximum, which in this case it is p3=2, but p1=3 is larger.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Wait, in the first loop, it finds mak=3 (p3=2), but in the second loop, when i=1, p1=3 OR p3=2 => 3 > 2, so '<', sets mak=1 and pans=[1]

Then for i=2, p2=1 OR p3=2 => 3 > 2, so '<', sets mak=2 and pans=[2]

Then for i=3, p3=2 OR p3=2 => 2 = 2, so appends 3 to pans, pans=[2,3]

So, pans=[2,3]

Then, it sets mak=0, and compares pans[0] with pans[1], i.e., p2=1 and p3=2.

Asks "? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]", which is "? 2 2 3 3"

Compares (p2 OR p2)=1 with (p3 OR p3)=2, which is '<', so sets mak=i=1

So, mak=1, which corresponds to index 2 (since pans=[2,3] and mak=1 points to 3)

Then, it prints "! mak2 mak", which is "! 3 1", but in the example, it's "! 3 2"

Wait, perhaps I misindexed.

Wait, pans=[2,3], mak=1, which is index 3, and mak2=3, which is index 3.

So, it's printing "! 3 1", but in the example, it's printing "! 3 2"

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the program or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps mak2 should be the original mak, and mak should be updated separately.

Wait, in the program, mak2 = mak, and then mak is updated in the loop.

Wait, in the example, after finding mak=3, mak2=3, then in the loop:

- i=0: ? 3 3 0 3, which is p3|p3=2 vs p0|p3=0|2=2 => '=', so no change

- i=1: ? 3 3 1 3, which is 2 vs 3|2=3 => '<', so mak=1, pans=[1]

- i=2: ? 3 3 2 3, which is 2 vs 1|2=3 => '<', so mak=2, pans=[2]

- i=3: ? 3 3 3 3, which is 2 vs 2|2=2 => '=', pans=[2,3]

Then, mak=0, and it compares pans[0]=2 and pans[1]=3:

- ? 2 2 3 3, which is 1 vs 2 => '<', so mak=1

So, mak=1, which corresponds to index 3 (p3=2), and mak2=3

So, it prints "! 3 1", but in the example, it's printing "! 3 2"

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the indexing.

Wait, perhaps the program is using 0-based indexing, so mak2=3, and mak=1, which corresponds to pans[1]=3, so it's printing "! 3 3", but in the example, it's "! 3 2"

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the program.

Wait, looking back at the code:

pans = []

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

So, in the example:

- i=0: '=', pans.append(0), pans=[0]

- i=1: '<', mak=1, pans=[1]

- i=2: '<', mak=2, pans=[2]

- i=3: '=', pans.append(3), pans=[2,3]

Then, mak=0

Then, loop over i in range(1, len(pans)):

i=1 (pans[1]=3)

Ask ? pans[mak=0]=2, 2 vs pans[1]=3,3

Which is p2|p2=1 vs p3|p3=2 => '<', so set mak=1

Then, print "! mak2 mak" => "! 3 1"

But in the example, it's printing "! 3 2"

So, perhaps the program is wrong.

Wait, perhaps mak2 should be updated or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is intended to find the two elements in pans that have the maximum OR, and then print their indices.

But in this case, pans=[2,3], p2=1, p3=2, OR is 3, which is same as p1=3 OR p2=1=3.

But in the example, it's printing "! 3 2", which corresponds to i=3 and j=2, which is p3=2 and p2=1, XOR=3.

Another valid answer is "! 0 1", which is p0=0 and p1=3, XOR=3.

So, any pair that gives XOR=3 is acceptable.

But in the program, it seems to be choosing mak2=3 and mak=1, which corresponds to indices 3 and 1, but in the example, it's printing "! 3 2".

Perhaps there's a confusion in the indexing.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to print "! mak2 pans[mak]", which would be "! 3 3", but in the example, it's "! 3 2".

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to choose mak2 and the best element from pans in terms of XOR.

But currently, it's choosing mak2 and mak, where mak is the index in pans with the maximum OR.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Perhaps I need to think of a different approach.

Let me consider that the maximum XOR will be between two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns.

So, perhaps I can try to find two numbers that have as many differing bits as possible.

To do this, I can try to select one number and find another number that differs from it in the highest possible bits.

But how do I do that using only OR comparisons?

Wait, maybe I can try to find the maximum and minimum elements, and their XOR would be large.

But in the example, p0=0 and p1=3 have XOR=3, which is maximal.

Similarly, p2=1 and p3=2 have XOR=3.

So, in this case, pairing the minimum and maximum gives the maximal XOR.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider n=3, permutation [0,1,2].

Possible pairs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

1 XOR 2 = 3

So, maximal is 3, achieved by 1 and 2.

Here, the maximum is 2, and the minimum is 0, but 0 XOR 2 = 2, which is not maximal.

So, pairing the minimum and maximum doesn't always give the maximal XOR.

Hence, that approach is invalid.

I need another strategy.

Let me consider that the maximum XOR between any two numbers in the permutation is equal to the maximum XOR of any two numbers in the set {0,1,...,n-1}, since it's a permutation.

So, for a given n, the maximum possible XOR depends on the binary representation of n-1.

Wait, no, not necessarily, because the permutation is a rearrangement of {0,1,...,n-1}, but the XOR depends on which two specific elements are chosen.

Wait, but since it's a permutation, all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present exactly once.

So, the maximum XOR would be the same as the maximum XOR among all pairs in {0,1,...,n-1}.

In that case, perhaps I can precompute the maximum XOR value possible for a given n, and then find any pair that achieves that XOR.

But the problem requires me to find such a pair using at most 3n queries.

So, I need to find a way to identify a pair with that maximum XOR using the allowed queries.

But I don't know the actual values, only their OR comparisons.

Wait, maybe I can find the two numbers that have the highest individual values, and their XOR would be large.

But in the earlier example, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to maximize the XOR bit by bit.

But again, without knowing the actual values, I need to use the queries effectively.

This is quite challenging.

Let me consider that for each bit position, I can try to find elements that have that bit set or not set, and use that information to construct the XOR.

But I'm not sure how to do that with only OR comparisons.

Wait, maybe I can try to find the elements that have the highest possible OR values, as that would indicate that they have higher bits set.

Then, among those, find elements that differ in the lower bits to maximize the XOR.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix one element and try to find another element that, when XOR'ed with the first, gives the maximum possible value.

To do this, I need to find an element that differs from the first in as many bit positions as possible.

But again, I need to do this using OR comparisons.

This is tricky.

Wait, maybe I can find the element with the maximum value, and then find the element that differs from it in the most significant bits.

But how do I determine that using OR comparisons?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the element that has the maximum XOR with the maximum element.

But again, I need to find a way to identify such an element using the allowed queries.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR.

XOR is maximized when the two numbers differ in the highest possible bit positions.

OR gives the combination of set bits from both numbers.

So, if I have two numbers with many differing bits, their XOR will be large, but their OR will also be large.

But OR doesn't directly indicate how many bits differ; it indicates which bits are set in either number.

Wait, maybe I can find the two numbers with the highest individual values, and their XOR would be large.

But in the earlier example, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the highest OR when combined.

But OR combines the set bits, whereas XOR looks for differing bits.

They are different.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that for any two numbers, their XOR is equal to the OR minus the AND.

But that might not help directly here.

Wait, perhaps I can try to find the two numbers that have the highest OR and the lowest AND, but I don't have a way to query the AND.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that in the first phase, I find the maximum element in the permutation.

Then, in the second phase, I find the element that, when XOR'ed with the maximum, gives the highest possible value.

But I need to find that element using only OR comparisons.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum XOR with the maximum element would be achieved by the element that has the most bits differing from the
