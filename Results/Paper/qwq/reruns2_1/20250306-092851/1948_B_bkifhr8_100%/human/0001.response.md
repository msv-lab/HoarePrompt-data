Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations I can perform and how they affect the array. The key point is that I can only perform the operation on elements that are at least 10, and when I do, I split that number into its individual digits.

So, for example, starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], if I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I then split 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Finally, splitting 67 gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which is sorted.

In this case, it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting all numbers that are at least 10.

Another example is [12, 28, 5]. If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Then, splitting 28 gives [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted. If I split 12 first, and then 28, I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is still not sorted. If I try splitting 28 first, getting [12, 2, 8, 5], and then splitting 12, I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is still not sorted. It seems like there's no way to make this array sorted through these operations.

The third example is [0, 0], which is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

From these examples, it seems that the operation allows me to break down numbers into their digits, and I need to see if, by doing so selectively, I can arrange the array in non-decreasing order.

Now, thinking about how to approach this problem programmatically. I need to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n (the length of the array) and then the array itself.

My initial thought is to simulate the process: start from the beginning of the array and, for each element, check if it's larger than the next element. If it is, and it's at least 10, split it into digits and see if that helps in ordering the array correctly.

But simulating the entire process for each test case might be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 50, and each element can be up to 99, meaning splitting a number into digits could potentially increase the array length.

I need a smarter way to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted without actually performing all possible splits.

Let me consider the properties of the numbers and their digits.

First, note that numbers less than 10 are already digits, so they don't need to be split.

For numbers >= 10, splitting them into digits will replace them with a sequence of digits.

So, for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and so on.

The operation can be applied any number of times, but once a number is split, it's replaced by its digits, and those digits can't be split further because they are less than 10.

So, for each number in the array, I have two choices: leave it as is (if it's less than 10) or split it into digits (if it's >=10).

My goal is to choose, for each number, whether to split it or not, such that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a decision problem where for each element that is >=10, I decide whether to split it or keep it as is, and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

Given that n is up to 50, and each element can be either split or not (if >=10), the number of possible configurations could be exponential in the worst case, which is not feasible for n=50.

However, perhaps there's a way to determine the correctness without exploring all possibilities.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array from left to right, and at each position, I consider the smallest possible value that can be placed there, given the choices I've made so far.

If, at any point, there's no valid choice that allows me to place a small enough value, then it's impossible to sort the array.

But I need to formalize this idea.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum value so far, and ensure that the next element is not smaller than that.

Wait, but since I can split numbers into digits, which are smaller, I need to consider the possible digits that can be inserted in place of a number.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, the function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases.

For each test case, it reads n (the number of elements), then reads the array arr.

Then, it initializes a variable `ans` to True, assuming that the array is already sorted.

It then iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if arr[i] < arr[i-1].

If it finds such a pair, it means that the array is not sorted at that point.

Then, it splits arr[i-1] into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits plus arr[i] is sorted.

If it's not sorted, it sets `ans` to False and breaks out of the loop.

Otherwise, it updates arr[i-1] to be the first digit of the split digits.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is True, otherwise 'NO'.

Wait, this seems like a specific approach, but I need to evaluate if this approach is correct.

Let me analyze this step by step.

First, it assumes that the array is sorted initially (`ans = True`).

Then, it iterates from the end to the beginning, checking if arr[i] < arr[i-1], which means the array is not sorted at that point.

If it finds such a pair, it splits arr[i-1] into its digits and checks if the digits followed by arr[i] form a sorted sequence.

If they do not, it sets `ans` to False and stops.

If they do, it replaces arr[i-1] with the first digit of the split digits and continues.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is still True, otherwise 'NO'.

Let me see if this logic holds.

Take the first example: [12, 3, 45, 67]

Iterate from the end:

- i=3: arr[3]=67, arr[2]=45; 67 >= 45, continue.

- i=2: arr[2]=45, arr[1]=3; 45 > 3, so split 3 (but 3 <10, can't split). Wait, but according to the problem, only elements >=10 can be split. So, since 3 <10, it can't be split. So, arr[2]=45 > arr[1]=3, and since arr[1] can't be split, it should set `ans` to False.

But in the example, the expected output is 'YES', because splitting 12 gives [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

But according to this approach, since 45 > 3, and 3 can't be split, it would set `ans` to False, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the approach.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

In this case, when i=2, arr[2]=45, arr[1]=3; 45 > 3.

Then, nums = [int(j) for j in str(3)] + [45] = [3, 45]

Check if [3,45] == sorted([3,45]), which is [3,45] == [3,45], so True.

Then, set arr[1] = 3 (the first digit of 3, which is just 3).

Continue to i=1: arr[1]=3, arr[0]=12; 3 < 12.

So, split arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and check if [1,2,3] is sorted, which it is.

Then, set arr[0]=1.

So, the final array would be [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

But according to the approach, it seems to handle this correctly.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought it would set `ans` to False, but actually, it doesn't because the condition passes.

Wait, perhaps I need to trace it more carefully.

Let's trace the first example:

Test case 1:

n=4

arr=[12,3,45,67]

Iteration:

i=3: 67 >=45, continue.

i=2: 45 >3, so split arr[1]=3 into digits: [3] + [45] = [3,45], which is sorted, so set arr[1]=3.

i=1: 3 <12, so split arr[0]=12 into digits: [1,2] + [3], which is [1,2,3], which is sorted, so set arr[0]=1.

So, final array is [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Hence, 'YES'.

Seems correct.

Second test case:

n=3

arr=[12,28,5]

Iteration:

i=2: 5 <28, so split arr[1]=28 into digits: [2,8] + [5] = [2,8,5], which is not sorted, so set `ans` to False and output 'NO'.

Indeed, in the example, the output is 'NO'.

Third test case:

n=2

arr=[0,0]

Already sorted, so 'YES'.

So, in these cases, the approach seems to work.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let me think about potential issues.

Suppose we have arr=[13, 4, 5].

According to the approach:

i=2: 5 <4, so split arr[1]=4 into digits: [4] + [5] = [4,5], which is sorted, so set arr[1]=4.

i=1: 4 <13, so split arr[0]=13 into digits: [1,3] + [4] = [1,3,4], which is sorted, so set arr[0]=1.

Final array: [1,4,5], which is sorted.

So, 'YES'.

Another example: arr=[21, 19, 5].

i=2: 5 <19, so split arr[1]=19 into [1,9] + [5] = [1,9,5], which is not sorted, so set `ans` to False, output 'NO'.

Indeed, it's not possible to sort this array through splitting.

Another example: arr=[10, 1].

i=1: 1 <10, split arr[0]=10 into [1,0] + [1] = [1,0,1], which is not sorted, so 'NO'.

Correct, because [1,0,1] is not sorted.

Wait, but if I split 10 into [1,0], and then the array becomes [1,0,1], which is not sorted.

But perhaps there's another way: split 10 into [1,0], then the array is [1,0,1]. Then, since 0 <1, I can't rearrange them to be sorted.

So, indeed, 'NO'.

Seems like the approach is correct.

But let's think about a more complicated example.

arr=[11, 11, 11]

i=2: 11 >=11, continue.

i=1: 11 >=11, continue.

i=0: can't go further.

So, 'YES', as [1,1,1,1,1,1] is sorted.

Wait, but according to the approach, it would just check pairs and in this case, no need to split, as it's already sorted.

Another example: arr=[19, 20]

i=1: 20 >=19, continue.

i=0: can't go further.

So, 'YES'.

But if I split 19, it becomes [1,9,20], which is sorted.

If I split 20, it becomes [19,2,0], which is not sorted.

But since the approach checks from the end, it sees 20 >=19, so no need to split.

Then, it's 'YES'.

Correct.

Another example: arr=[32, 23]

i=1: 23 <32, so split arr[0]=32 into [3,2] + [23] = [3,2,23], which is not sorted, so 'NO'.

Indeed, it's not possible to sort this array through splitting.

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if I split 23 first?

If I split 23 into [2,3], then the array becomes [32,2,3].

Then, 32 >2, which is not sorted.

So, 'NO'.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

I think the approach is valid.

It iterates from the end, and for each pair where arr[i] < arr[i-1], it considers splitting arr[i-1] into its digits and checks if the resulting sequence is sorted.

If it is, it proceeds by replacing arr[i-1] with the first digit; otherwise, it sets `ans` to False.

This seems to capture the essence of whether the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correct}}\]
