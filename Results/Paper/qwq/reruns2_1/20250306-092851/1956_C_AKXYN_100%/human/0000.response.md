Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n x n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. Nene can perform two types of operations on this matrix. Each operation allows her to choose a row or a column and assign a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to that row or column. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. For type 1 operation, she chooses a row i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and sets the elements of the i-th row to be p1, p2, ..., pn. Similarly, for type 2 operation, she chooses a column i and a permutation p, and sets the elements of the i-th column to be p1, p2, ..., pn.

Since she can perform these operations any number of times, but no more than 2n times, I need to figure out the best way to assign these permutations to rows and columns to maximize the sum of the matrix.

One important thing to note is that each operation overwrites the entire row or column with the chosen permutation. So, if I apply an operation to a row, it will set all the elements in that row to the permutation values, potentially overwriting any previous values in that row.

Similarly, applying an operation to a column will set all the elements in that column to the permutation values, overwriting any previous values in that column.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to assign permutations to rows and columns in such a way that the sum of the matrix is maximized, and I should use no more than 2n operations.

Let me think about how the matrix entries are affected by these operations. Suppose I apply a type 1 operation to row i with permutation p, and then a type 2 operation to column j with permutation q. The element at position (i,j) will be set to q_j in the type 2 operation, overwriting whatever was set in the type 1 operation.

Wait, no. Actually, when I apply a type 1 operation to row i with permutation p, it sets a_{i,j} = p_j for all j. Then, if I apply a type 2 operation to column j with permutation q, it sets a_{k,j} = q_k for all k, overwriting the previous value in a_{i,j}.

So, the last operation applied to a particular row or column will determine the values in that row or column.

Wait, more precisely, for each cell a_{i,j}, the value will be the one set by the last operation that affected that cell, whether it was a row operation on row i or a column operation on column j.

This seems a bit tricky. I need to find a way to assign permutations to rows and columns such that the maximum possible values are assigned to the matrix cells, considering that each cell is last set by either a row operation or a column operation.

Maybe I can think in terms of assigning permutations to rows and columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

Let me consider that each cell a_{i,j} will take the value from the last operation applied to row i or column j.

One approach could be to assign the highest possible values to the cells by choosing appropriate permutations for rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps I can assign increasing sequences to rows and columns in a specific order.

Let me consider assigning permutations to rows first.

Suppose I assign to each row i a permutation that places higher numbers in higher rows.

Wait, but since it's a permutation, each row will have numbers from 1 to n, just in some order.

But I need to maximize the sum of all elements, so I need to maximize the values in the matrix.

Wait, but since each operation sets a row or a column to a permutation of 1 to n, the maximum value in any cell is n, and the minimum is 1.

So, to maximize the sum, I need as many high values as possible in the matrix.

But each row or column operation sets the entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, meaning that in any row or column, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, the sum of a single row or column is always the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

Wait, but if I set a row and then set a column, the cell at their intersection is overwritten.

So, I need to consider how the operations interact.

Let me consider that each cell is affected by both its row and its column operations, and the last operation on either row or column determines the value in that cell.

Wait, more precisely, the value in a_{i,j} will be the one set by the last operation on row i or column j, whichever was performed last.

But since operations can be performed in any order, I need to think about the sequence in which operations are applied.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this as assigning permutations to rows and columns and then determining the cell values based on the last operation applied to their row or column.

Wait, maybe I can consider that each row operation sets the entire row, and each column operation sets the entire column, with later operations overwriting earlier ones.

So, if I perform operations in a certain order, some operations will overwrite others.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that each cell a_{i,j} can be set by either a row operation on row i or a column operation on column j, with the last operation taking effect.

So, for each cell, the value will be determined by the last operation that affected that cell, either through its row or its column.

I need to assign operations in such a way that the highest possible values are assigned to the cells.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning higher values to cells that are affected by later operations.

But this still seems unclear.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the permutations for the row operations and the column operations, and then decide the order in which to apply them.

Then, for each cell, the value will be set by the last operation that affects that cell.

So, if I have a sequence of operations, I can track for each cell which operation set its value last.

This seems too involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column sets all its cells to the chosen permutation, overwriting previous values.

So, if I perform operations in a certain order, the cells will have the values set by the last operation that affected them.

I need to maximize the sum of these values.

Perhaps I can consider that each cell is set by either a row operation or a column operation, and try to maximize the sum based on that.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes represent rows and columns, and edges represent cells, and then find a way to assign permutations to rows and columns to maximize the sum.

But that might be too complex.

Let me consider the following approach: assign permutations to rows and columns in such a way that higher values are assigned to cells that are set by operations performed later.

But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each cell is set by the last operation that affects it, and try to arrange operations so that higher-value cells are set later.

This still seems vague.

Let me try to think about smaller values of n to get some intuition.

Let's take n=1.

In this case, the matrix is 1x1. I can perform either a type 1 operation on row 1 or a type 2 operation on column 1, and set a_{1,1} to 1.

So, the maximum sum is 1, and I can do it with one operation.

That seems straightforward.

Now, n=2.

I need to maximize the sum of the 2x2 matrix using no more than 4 operations.

Let's see.

If I perform type 1 operations on both rows and type 2 operations on both columns, I need to see how the cell values are determined.

Suppose I perform:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2,1]

2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2,1]

3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2,1]

4. Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [2,1]

Now, let's see what values each cell has:

- a_{1,1}: set by row 1 operation to 2, then by column 1 operation to 2.

- a_{1,2}: set by row 1 operation to 1, then by column 2 operation to 2.

- a_{2,1}: set by row 2 operation to 2, then by column 1 operation to 1.

- a_{2,2}: set by row 2 operation to 1, then by column 2 operation to 2.

So, the matrix is:

2 2

1 2

Sum is 2+2+1+2 = 7.

Is this the maximum possible?

According to the example, yes, 7 is the maximum for n=2.

So, in this case, using 4 operations achieves the maximum sum.

But the example shows that 3 operations can also achieve 7.

Let me see.

In the example, they used 3 operations:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's see the matrix after these operations:

- After row 1 operation: a_{1,1}=1, a_{1,2}=2

- After row 2 operation: a_{2,1}=1, a_{2,2}=2

- After column 1 operation: a_{1,1}=1, a_{2,1}=2

So, final matrix:

a_{1,1}=1 (set by column 1 operation)

a_{1,2}=2 (set by row 1 operation)

a_{2,1}=2 (set by column 1 operation)

a_{2,2}=2 (set by row 2 operation)

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7.

Same as before.

So, with 3 operations, we can achieve the same sum.

Is it possible to achieve a higher sum?

Let me try.

Suppose I perform:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with [2,1]

3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with [2,1]

4. Type 2 operation on column 2 with [2,1]

As before, sum is 7.

Alternatively, suppose I perform only 3 operations:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with [2,1]

3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with [2,1]

Then:

a_{1,1}=2 (set by row 1), then 2 (set by column 1)

a_{1,2}=1 (set by row 1)

a_{2,1}=2 (set by row 2), then 1 (set by column 1)

a_{2,2}=1 (set by row 2)

So, matrix is:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 5, which is less than 7.

Another try:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 2 operation on column 1 with [2,1]

3. Type 2 operation on column 2 with [2,1]

Then:

a_{1,1}=2 (row 1), then 2 (column 1)

a_{1,2}=1 (row 1), then 2 (column 2)

a_{2,1}=0 (not set), but wait, row 2 is not set, so it remains 0.

Wait, but in the operations above, row 2 is not set, so its cells are 0.

So, matrix is:

2 2

0 2

Sum is 6, which is still less than 7.

Another try:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with [2,1]

2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with [2,1]

3. Type 2 operation on column 1 with [1,2]

Then:

a_{1,1}=2 (row 1), then 1 (column 1)

a_{1,2}=1 (row 1)

a_{2,1}=2 (row 2), then 2 (column 1)

a_{2,2}=1 (row 2)

Matrix:

1 1

2 1

Sum is 5, again less than 7.

So, it seems that 7 is indeed the maximum.

Now, for n=2, the sum is 7.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me see for n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: ?

Wait, maybe I can find a general formula for the maximum sum.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

Let me see, 7=2*(2+1)*(2*2+1)/6 + something?

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, for n=1: 1=1^3

n=2: 7=2^3 -1

n=3: perhaps 26=3^3 -1?

Wait, 3^3=27, 27-1=26, but let's check.

If n=3, and we can achieve sum=26, that would make sense.

But I need to confirm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n^3 - (n-1).

Wait, for n=1: 1^3 -0=1, matches.

n=2: 8 -1=7, matches.

n=3: 27-2=25.

But if n=3, can we achieve 25?

Let me try.

For n=3, if I perform type 1 operations on all three rows with permutation [3,2,1], and type 2 operations on all three columns with permutation [3,2,1].

Then, the last operation on each cell will determine its value.

Suppose I do:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: [3,2,1]

3. Type 1 on row 3: [3,2,1]

4. Type 2 on column 1: [3,2,1]

5. Type 2 on column 2: [3,2,1]

6. Type 2 on column 3: [3,2,1]

Now, let's see the matrix:

- a_{1,1}: set by row 1 to 3, then by column 1 to 3 → 3

- a_{1,2}: set by row 1 to 2, then by column 2 to 3 → 3

- a_{1,3}: set by row 1 to 1, then by column 3 to 3 → 3

- a_{2,1}: set by row 2 to 3, then by column 1 to 2 → 2

- a_{2,2}: set by row 2 to 2, then by column 2 to 2 → 2

- a_{2,3}: set by row 2 to 1, then by column 3 to 2 → 2

- a_{3,1}: set by row 3 to 3, then by column 1 to 1 → 1

- a_{3,2}: set by row 3 to 2, then by column 2 to 2 → 2

- a_{3,3}: set by row 3 to 1, then by column 3 to 1 → 1

So, matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 12 + 6 + 4 = 22

Is 22 the maximum?

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me try a different sequence.

Suppose I do:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: [3,2,1]

3. Type 1 on row 3: [3,2,1]

Then, don't perform any column operations.

Then, the matrix is:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 3*6 = 18

Wait, that's less than 22.

Another try:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1]

2. Type 2 on column 1: [3,2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 2: [3,2,1]

4. Type 2 on column 3: [3,2,1]

Then:

a_{1,1}: row 1 sets to 3, then column 1 sets to 3 → 3

a_{1,2}: row 1 sets to 2, then column 2 sets to 3 → 3

a_{1,3}: row 1 sets to 1, then column 3 sets to 3 → 3

a_{2,1}: not set by row, then column 1 sets to 2 → 2

a_{2,2}: not set by row, then column 2 sets to 2 → 2

a_{2,3}: not set by row, then column 3 sets to 2 → 2

a_{3,1}: not set by row, then column 1 sets to 1 → 1

a_{3,2}: not set by row, then column 2 sets to 1 → 1

a_{3,3}: not set by row, then column 3 sets to 1 → 1

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18

Which is less than 22.

Another try:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: [3,2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1: [3,2,1]

4. Type 2 on column 2: [3,2,1]

5. Type 2 on column 3: [3,2,1]

Then:

a_{1,1}: row 1 sets to 3, then column 1 sets to 3 → 3

a_{1,2}: row 1 sets to 2, then column 2 sets to 3 → 3

a_{1,3}: row 1 sets to 1, then column 3 sets to 3 → 3

a_{2,1}: row 2 sets to 3, then column 1 sets to 2 → 2

a_{2,2}: row 2 sets to 2, then column 2 sets to 2 → 2

a_{2,3}: row 2 sets to 1, then column 3 sets to 2 → 2

a_{3,1}: not set by row, then column 1 sets to 1 → 1

a_{3,2}: not set by row, then column 2 sets to 1 → 1

a_{3,3}: not set by row, then column 3 sets to 1 → 1

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18

Still 18.

Wait, earlier I had a sum of 22 with a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps I need to set more rows and columns appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can set rows and columns in a specific order to maximize the sum.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I assign to each row i a permutation that places higher numbers in higher rows.

Wait, but since it's a permutation, each row will have numbers from 1 to n, just in some order.

Similarly for columns.

I need to maximize the sum, so perhaps I should assign higher values to cells that are set by operations performed last.

Wait, maybe I need to prioritize setting higher values in cells that are less likely to be overwritten by later operations.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that each cell is set by the last operation on its row or column.

So, if I perform operations in a sequence where row operations are performed before column operations, then cells will have values set by column operations, unless the row operation was performed last.

Wait, perhaps I need to decide which cells should take their values from row operations and which from column operations.

Let me consider assigning row operations to certain rows and column operations to certain columns, in a way that maximizes the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of covering the matrix with rows and columns, and assigning permutations accordingly.

This sounds similar to a graph covering problem, where rows and columns are like edges covering vertices.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column sets all its cells, and later operations can overwrite them.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of layers, where each operation adds a layer that overwrites previous values.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to look for a pattern in the example.

For n=2, the maximum sum is 7, achieved by setting the matrix to:

2 2

1 2

Sum: 2+2+1+2=7

Alternatively:

1 2

1 2

Sum: 1+2+1+2=6

Which is less than 7.

So, the first configuration is better.

Wait, in the first configuration, a_{1,1}=2, a_{1,2}=2, a_{2,1}=1, a_{2,2}=2.

This seems to prioritize setting higher values in cells that are less likely to be overwritten.

But I need a general approach.

Let me consider that for each cell, its final value is determined by the last operation that affects it, either through its row or its column.

So, if I can arrange operations such that higher values are set in cells where possible, I can maximize the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize setting higher values in cells that are affected by operations performed later.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider performing all row operations first, followed by all column operations.

In this case, cells will have values set by the column operations, unless the row operation was performed last.

Wait, no. Since operations are performed in sequence, the last operation that affects a cell determines its value.

So, if I perform all row operations first, and then all column operations, cells will have values set by the last column operation, unless the row operation was performed last.

Wait, but since column operations are performed after row operations, the column operations will overwrite the row operations for the cells in their columns.

So, in this case, cells will have values set by the column operations.

Wait, but in the example, when they perform row operations followed by a column operation, some cells are set by row operations and some by column operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each cell is associated with both its row and its column, and the last operation on either determines its value.

So, perhaps I can assign higher values to cells that are set by operations performed later.

Wait, maybe I need to order the operations such that higher-value cells are set by later operations.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that for each row and column, the permutation assigned can be chosen independently, but the interactions between row and column operations determine the cell values.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to
