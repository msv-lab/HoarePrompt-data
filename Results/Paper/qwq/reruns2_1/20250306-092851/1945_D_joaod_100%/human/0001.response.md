Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a queue of n people, and Kirill comes late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, up to position m or better.

For each person at position i (starting from 1), there are two values: a_i and b_i.

- a_i is the cost to bribe person i to swap places with Kirill.

- b_i is the cost Kirill has to pay to person k, for every k between j and i, where j is the position he's swapping with.

Kirill can perform this swapping any number of times, and he wants to minimize the total cost while ensuring he ends up in one of the first m positions.

Okay, let's think about this.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j < i, pay a_j to person j, and also pay b_k for every k between j and i.

Wait, the problem says: "for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, if Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with position j (j < i), he pays a_j to person j, and for each position k where j < k < i, he pays b_k to person k.

I need to model this operation in a way that allows Kirill to move from position n down to position m.

Let me consider the positions as an array from 1 to n.

Kirill starts at position n+1, but in the input, n is the number of people in front of him, so perhaps positions are from 0 to n, with Kirill initially at n.

Wait, the problem says "the n-th person", so probably positions are from 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

But in the input, it's given as n and m, with n being the number of people in the queue, and m being the maximum allowable final position.

So, positions are from 1 to n+1, with Kirill at n+1.

But in the code provided, it seems like the positions are from 0 to n-1, since Python uses 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the code:

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

So, na_frente is n, pos_final is m, both adjusted to 0-based indexing.

Wait, no, in Python, lists are 0-based, but positions in the problem are 1-based.

Wait, the problem describes positions starting from 1.

So, position 1 is the first in the queue, position n is the last among the n people, and Kirill is at position n+1.

In the code, na_frente is n, pos_final is m, both decremented by 1, so they are now 0-based.

total = 0

best = sys.float_info.max

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

Okay, so the code iterates from v = na_frente down to 0.

na_frente is n-1 (since na_frente -=1), pos_final is m-1.

Wait, no, na_frente is n (number of people in front), pos_final is m (maximum allowable final position).

Both are decremented by 1, so na_frente is n-1, pos_final is m-1.

In the loop, for each v from na_frente down to 0:

- If v <= pos_final:

- Check if total + a[v] is less than current best, update best.

- If a[v] < b[v], add a[v] to total, else add b[v] to total.

- Else (v > pos_final):

- If a[v] < b[v], add a[v] to total, else add b[v] to total.

Then, print the best value found.

I need to verify if this logic correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position <= m.

Let me think about the operation again.

When Kirill swaps with position j, he pays a_j, and for each k between j and i, he pays b_k.

Wait, in the code, it seems like it's not exactly modeling swapping, but rather considering moving Kirill forward by bribing people.

I need to see if this approach correctly captures the cost of moving Kirill from position n+1 to some position <=m with minimum cost.

Perhaps a better way is to think in terms of graph where positions are nodes, and edges represent the cost to move from one position to another.

But that might be too slow for n up to 2e5.

Wait, maybe we can use dynamic programming.

Let dp[i] be the minimum cost for Kirill to reach position i.

He starts at position n+1.

He can move to any position j < i by paying a_j and b_k for j < k < i.

We need to compute dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + a_j + sum(b[k] for k in j+1 to i-1))

But this seems too slow for large n.

Perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be trying to accumulate costs in a certain way.

But I need to verify if it's correct.

Let me consider the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 (Kirill is at 5).

He wants to be at position <=2.

He can perform operations to swap with earlier positions, paying certain costs.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach position 1 or 2.

Let me try to simulate the process.

Option 1: Swap directly to position 1.

To swap from 5 to 1, he needs to pay a_1 and sum of b_2 to b_4.

a_1=7, b_2=4, b_3=3, b_4=8. Total: 7+4+3+8=22.

Option 2: Swap to position 2, then to position 1.

First, swap from 5 to 4: pay a_4=9 and sum b_5 to b_5 (but b_5 doesn't exist, so 0). Total:9.

Then, swap from 4 to 2: pay a_2=3 and sum b_3=8. Total:3+8=11.

Total cost:9+11=20.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 14.

Hmm, maybe there's a better way.

Option 3: Swap from 5 to 3, then to 2.

Swap from 5 to 4: pay a_4=9 and sum b_5=0. Total:9.

Swap from 4 to 3: pay a_3=6 and sum b_4=8. Total:6+8=14.

Swap from 3 to 2: pay a_2=3 and sum b_3=8. Total:3+8=11.

Total cost:9+14+11=34. Wait, worse than previous.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operation.

Wait, when swapping from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In option 1: from 5 to 1, pay a_1=7 and sum b_2 to b_4:4+3+8=15. Total:22.

Option 2: from 5 to 2, pay a_2=3 and sum b_3 to b_4:3+8=11. Total:14.

Wait, according to the sample output, it's 14.

So, directly swapping from 5 to 2: a_2=3 and sum b_3=8 and b_4=5. Total:3+8+5=16.

Wait, but sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.

"for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, when swapping from i to j, j < i, pay a_j and for each k where j < k < i, pay b_k.

In option 2: from 5 to 2, pay a_2=3 and sum b_3=8 and b_4=5. Total:3+8+5=16.

But sample output is 14. So, perhaps there's a better sequence.

Option 3: from 5 to 3, then to 2.

From 5 to 3: pay a_3=6 and sum b_4=5. Total:11.

From 3 to 2: pay a_2=3 and sum b_3=8. Total:11.

Wait, total cost:11+11=22.

Still 22, worse than 14.

Wait, maybe from 5 to 4, then to 2.

From 5 to 4: pay a_4=9 and sum b_5=0. Total:9.

From 4 to 2: pay a_2=3 and sum b_3=8. Total:11.

Total cost:9+11=20.

Still worse than 14.

How can the sample output be 14?

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps Kirill can swap from 5 to 3, paying a_3=6 and b_4=5. Total:11.

Then from 3 to 1, paying a_1=7 and b_2=4 and b_3=8. Total:19.

Total cost:11+19=30.

Still worse than 14.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 1 directly is 22, but there's a better way involving multiple swaps.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 4, paying a_4=9 and b_5=0. Total:9.

Then from 4 to 3, paying a_3=6 and b_4=5. Total:11.

Then from 3 to 1, paying a_1=7 and b_2=4 and b_3=8. Total:19.

Total cost:9+11+19=39.

Worse again.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 2 directly: a_2=3 and b_3=8 and b_4=5. Total:16.

But sample output is 14. So, perhaps another sequence.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 4: a_4=9 and b_5=0. Total:9.

Then from 4 to 1: a_1=7 and b_2=4, b_3=3, b_4=8. Total:7+4+3+8=22.

Total cost:9+22=31.

Still worse.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 3: a_3=6 and b_4=5. Total:11.

Then from 3 to 2: a_2=3 and b_3=8. Total:11.

Total cost:11+11=22.

Still worse.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 2 directly: a_2=3 and b_3=8 and b_4=5. Total:16.

But sample output is 14. So, perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe the code provided is doing something smarter.

Looking at the code:

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = float('inf')

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

For the first test case:

n=4, m=2 => na_frente=3, pos_final=1

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

Loop from v=3 down to 0:

v=3:

na_frente=3, pos_final=1

v=3 > pos_final=1:

if a[3]=9 < b[3]=5: no, so total += b[3]=5 => total=5

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1:

if a[2]=6 < b[2]=8: yes, so total += a[2]=6 => total=11

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1:

if best > total + a[1]=3:  inf > 11 + 3=14 => best=14

if a[1]=3 < b[1]=3: no, so total += b[1]=3 => total=14

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1:

if best > total + a[0]=7: 14 > 14 +7=21: no

if a[0]=7 < b[0]=4: no, so total += b[0]=4 => total=18

print(best=14)

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for this case.

Let me see another sample input.

Second sample:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

According to the sample output, it should be 22.

Let's simulate the code.

n=6, m=2 => na_frente=5, pos_final=1

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

total=0, best=inf

v=5:

v=5 > pos_final=1:

if a[5]=3 < b[5]=1: yes, total += a[5]=3 => total=3

v=4:

v=4 > pos_final=1:

if a[4]=8 < b[4]=4: no, total += b[4]=4 => total=7

v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=1:

if a[3]=1 < b[3]=1: equal, so total += b[3]=1 => total=8

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1:

if a[2]=7 < b[2]=8: yes, total += a[2]=7 => total=15

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1:

if best > total + a[1]=9: inf > 15+9=24 => best=24

if a[1]=9 < b[1]=8: no, total += b[1]=8 => total=23

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1:

if best=24 > total + a[0]=23+6=29: no

if a[0]=6 < b[0]=5: no, total += b[0]=5 => total=28

print(best=24)

But according to the sample output, it should be 22.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Sample output is 22, but according to this simulation, best=24.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulating.

Let me check again.

n=6, m=2 => na_frente=5, pos_final=1

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

total=0, best=inf

v=5:

v=5 > pos_final=1:

if 3 < 1: no, so total += b[5]=1 => total=1

v=4:

v=4 > pos_final=1:

if 8 < 4: no, total += b[4]=4 => total=5

v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=1:

if 1 < 1: no, total += b[3]=1 => total=6

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1:

if 7 < 8: yes, total += a[2]=7 => total=13

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1:

if best=inf > total + a[1]=13+9=22 => best=22

if 9 < 8: no, total += b[1]=8 => total=21

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1:

if best=22 > total + a[0]=21+6=27: no

if 6 < 5: no, total += b[0]=5 => total=26

print(best=22)

Ah, so best=22, which matches the sample output.

Wait, in my previous simulation, I mistakenly thought best=24, but actually it's 22.

So, the code seems correct.

Let me check another sample.

Third sample:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

n=7, m=7 => na_frente=6, pos_final=6

a=[7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b=[9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

total=0, best=inf

v=6:

v=6 > pos_final=6:

if 9 < 9: no, total += b[6]=9 => total=9

v=5:

v=5 > pos_final=6: no, so:

if 5 < 4: no, total += b[5]=4 => total=13

v=4:

v=4 > pos_final=6: no,

if 2 < 7: yes, total += a[4]=2 => total=15

v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=6: no,

if 2 < 7: yes, total += a[3]=2 => total=17

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=6: no,

if 9 < 10: yes, total += a[2]=9 => total=26

v=1:

v=1 > pos_final=6: no,

if 2 < 1: no, total += b[1]=1 => total=27

v=0:

v=0 > pos_final=6: no,

if 7 < 9: yes, total += a[0]=7 => total=34

print(best=inf, since no v <= pos_final=6)

Wait, pos_final=6, v=0 to 6.

At v=6, v <= pos_final=6, so:

if best=inf > total + a[6]=34 +9=43 => best=43

if a[6]=9 < b[6]=9: no, total += b[6]=9 => total=43

At v=5:

v=5 > pos_final=6: no

if 5 < 4: no, total += b[5]=4 => total=47

...

Wait, perhaps I need to follow the code precisely.

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = float('inf')

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

For the third sample:

n=7, m=7 => na_frente=6, pos_final=6

a=[7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b=[9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

total=0, best=inf

v=6:

v=6 <= pos_final=6:

if best=inf > total + a[6]=0+9=9 => best=9

if a[6]=9 < b[6]=9: no, total += b[6]=9 => total=9

v=5:

v=5 <= pos_final=6:

if best=9 > total + a[5]=9+5=14: no

if a[5]=5 < b[5]=4: no, total += b[5]=4 => total=13

v=4:

v=4 <= pos_final=6:

if best=9 > total + a[4]=13+6=19: no

if a[4]=6
