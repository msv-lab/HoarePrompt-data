Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a queue of n people, and Kirill arrives late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do this, he can bribe people ahead of him to swap places.

For each person i in the queue, there are two values: a_i and b_i.

- If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j where j < i, swap places with the person at position j, and he has to pay a_j coins to that person.

- Additionally, for every person k between j and i (j < k < i), Kirill has to pay b_k coins to them.

He can do this operation any number of times, and he wants to spend as few coins as possible to reach a position among the first m people.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position less than or equal to m.

First, I need to understand the operations and costs involved.

Let's consider the queue positions from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position n.

He wants to reach a position from 0 to m-1.

He can swap with anyone ahead of him (any position j < i), paying a_j, and for each position between j and i, he pays b_k.

I need to model this in a way that I can find the minimal cost to reach positions <= m.

Maybe I can model this as a graph, where each position is a node, and there are edges from position i to position j (j < i) with cost a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal cost path from position n to any position <= m.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard graph approach might be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the positions in reverse order, from n down to 0.

At each position, I can decide whether to swap with someone ahead or to just pay the b_k costs to pass through.

Wait, more carefully:

At position i, Kirill can:

- Swap with position j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

- Or, he can choose not to swap and stay at position i, but if i > m, that's not acceptable.

So, I need to find a sequence of swaps that gets him from position n to a position <= m, with minimal total cost.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position <= m.

I think dynamic programming can be used here.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

First, I need to find, for each position i, the minimal cost to reach i from position n.

But this seems too slow for large n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n and wants to reach any position <= m.

He can perform swaps, each swap allows him to jump to a position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as choosing a subset of people to swap with, in a certain order.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think of it as choosing a path where I select certain people to swap with, and pay the corresponding costs.

But again, with large n, I need something faster.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute the minimal cost without considering all possible swaps.

Let me consider that Kirill needs to move from position n to some position <= m.

Each swap allows him to jump to a position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is the same as the prefix sum of b from j+1 to i-1.

Maybe I can precompute prefix sums for b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[0 to i-1].

Then, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Therefore, total cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Hmm.

But I need to find a way to minimize the total cost.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill moves from position n to position n-1 to position n-2, and so on, choosing at each step whether to swap or not.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Kirill needs to remove people from in front of him to reach a position <= m.

Each removal can be done by either swapping with them (paying a_j) or paying b_k to pass through them.

Wait, perhaps I need to select a subset of people to swap with, and pay their a_j, and for the remaining people, pay b_k.

But I need to make sure that the swaps are possible in the allowed order.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

2 1

2 3

1 1

Sample Output:

14

22

9

3

Let me take the first sample input:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

I need to find the minimal cost for Kirill to reach position <=2, starting from position 4.

Position 4: Kirill starts here.

He can swap with position j <4, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to 3.

Let me see.

Option 1: Swap with position 3, paying a_3=9 + sum of b from 3 to 3 (since j=3, i=4), which is b_3=5, so total 9+5=14.

Then he is at position 3, and he can swap again with position 2, paying a_2=6 + sum of b from 2 to 2, which is b_2=8, so 6+8=14.

Then total cost so far is 14 +14=28.

Then swap with position 1, paying a_1=3 + sum of b from 1 to 1, which is b_1=3, so 3+3=6.

Total cost: 28+6=34.

But the sample output is 14, which is less than 34, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe swapping directly from 4 to 2.

Paying a_2=6 + sum of b from 2 to 3, which is b_2=8 and b_3=5, so 8+5=13, total 6+13=19.

Then swap from 2 to 1, paying a_1=3 + sum of b from 1 to 1=3, total 3+3=6.

Total cost: 19+6=25, which is still more than 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 4 to 1 directly.

Paying a_1=3 + sum of b from 1 to 3=3+8+5=16, total 3+16=19.

Which is still more than 14.

Hmm, maybe there's a better strategy.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum of b_k is only for the positions between j and i.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill has to pay b_k to the person at position k.

So, for example, swapping from i=4 to j=2, pays a_j = a_2=6, and for k=3 (since j=2, i=4), pays b_3=8.

So total cost is 6+8=14.

Then, from position 2, swap to position 1, paying a_1=3 and for k=1 (but j=1, i=2), pay b_1=3.

Total cost: 14 + 3 +3 =20, which is still more than 14.

Wait, maybe the minimal cost is achieved by swapping directly from 4 to 1, paying a_1=3 and sum of b from 1 to 3=3+8+5=16, total 3+16=19.

But sample output is 14, which is less than 19.

So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe sum of b_k is from j+1 to i-1.

In the first swap, from i=4 to j=2, pay a_j =6 and sum of b from 3=8, total 6+8=14.

Then from 2 to 1, pay a_1=3 and sum of b from 1=3, total 3+3=6.

Total cost: 14+6=20.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe I can swap from 4 to 3, paying a_3=9 and sum of b from 3=5, total 9+5=14.

Then from 3 to 2, paying a_2=6 and sum of b from 2=8, total 6+8=14.

Total cost: 14+14=28.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe I can just swap from 4 to 3 for 14, and then not swap, just stay at 3, which is position 3, which is position m=2, but position 3 is greater than m=2.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n, and m is the maximum allowable final position.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, position m=2 is the second position.

But in the sample input, n=4, m=2.

Kirill starts at position 5 (since n=4, and he's at the end).

Wait, the problem says "the n-th person", and Kirill stands after the n-th person, so position n+1.

But in the sample input, positions are 1 to 4, Kirill at 5, wants to be at position <=2.

Wait, maybe the positions are 0 to n-1.

I need to clarify the positions.

Wait, the problem says: "the n -th person in the queue. Then Kirill is standing at the end of the line after the n -th person."

So, positions are 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

He wants to be among the first m positions, which are positions from 1 to m.

So, he needs to reach position <=m.

In the first sample, n=4, m=2.

He starts at position 5.

He can swap with position j <5, which would be positions 1 to 4.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, the cost is 14, which matches swapping from 5 to 3, paying a_3=6 and sum of b from 4=5, total 6+5=11.

Wait, but in the sample input, b=[4,3,8,5], so sum from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the positions.

Let me assume positions are 1 to n, with Kirill at position n+1.

Then, to swap from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In the first sample, n=4, m=2.

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

So, positions 1 to 4.

Kirill at position 5.

To swap from 5 to j (1<=j<=4), he pays a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to 4.

For example, swap from 5 to 4: pay a_4=9 and sum of b from 5 to 4 (nothing, since j+1=5 to i-1=4, which is empty), so just a_4=9.

Wait, but in the sample, the output is 14, which is different from 9.

Wait, maybe I have miscounted.

Wait, positions are 1 to n=4, Kirill at 5.

Swap from 5 to j, pay a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to 4.

For j=4: a_4=9, sum b from 5 to 4 (empty), total 9.

For j=3: a_3=6, sum b from 4=5, total 6+5=11.

For j=2: a_2=3, sum b from 3 to 4=8+5=13, total 3+13=16.

For j=1: a_1=7, sum b from 2 to 4=3+8+5=16, total 7+16=23.

So, the minimal among these is 9, but the sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe he needs to perform multiple swaps.

For example, swap from 5 to 4 for 9, then from 4 to 3 for a_3=6 and sum b from 4=5, total 6+5=11.

Total cost: 9+11=20.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe there's another way.

Wait, maybe the sum of b_k is from j+1 to i-1, which in swap from 5 to 4 is b from 5 to 4 (empty), so 0.

So total cost is a_4=9.

Then from 4 to 3, pay a_3=6 and sum b from 4=5, total 6+5=11.

Total: 9+11=20.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that sum of b_k is from j+1 to i-1, but in swap from 5 to 4, sum from 5 to 4 is empty, so 0.

Then from 4 to 3, sum from 5 to 3 is b_4=5.

Wait, positions are 1 to 4.

Kirill at 5.

Swap from 5 to 4: pay a_4=9 and sum b from 5 to 4 (empty), total 9.

Then from 4 to 3: pay a_3=6 and sum b from 4 to 3, which is b_4=5, total 6+5=11.

Total cost: 9+11=20.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the sum of b_k is from j to i-1.

Wait, the problem says for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k to the person at position k.

So, from 5 to 4: j=4, i=5, k=4, pay b_4=5, plus a_j=9, total 9+5=14.

Which matches the sample output.

So, earlier I thought sum is from j+1 to i-1, but actually it's from j to i-1.

Wait, let's check.

"for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k to the person at position k."

So, k > j and k < i.

So, in swap from 5 to 4: j=4, i=5, then k=4, so pay b_4=5, plus a_j=9, total 14.

That matches the sample output.

So, earlier I had a mistake in the sum range.

It's from j < k < i, meaning k=j+1 to i-1.

In swap from 5 to 4: j=4, i=5, so k=4, sum b_k from 4 to 4, which is b_4=5, plus a_j=9, total 14.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, in general, to swap from i to j, pay a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in this case, from i=5 to j=4, sum from j+1=5 to i-1=4, which is empty, so only a_j=9.

Wait, now I'm confused again.

Wait, the condition is j < i, and pay a_j and for each k where j < k < i, pay b_k.

So, from i=5 to j=4, k goes from j+1=5 to i-1=4, which is no k's, so sum is 0.

So total cost is a_j=9 + 0 =9.

But the sample output is 14.

Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps the positions are 0-based or 1-based issue.

Let me assume positions are 0 to n.

Kirill at position n.

Swap from i to j, pay a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In sample input, n=4, m=2.

Positions 0 to 4.

Kirill at 4.

Swap from 4 to 3: pay a_3=9 and sum of b_k from 3 to 3 (since j=3, i=4, k=3), which is b_3=5, total 9+5=14.

Swap from 4 to 2: pay a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 2 to 3, which is b_2=8 and b_3=5, total 6+8+5=19.

Swap from 4 to 1: pay a_1=3 and sum of b_k from 1 to 3, which is b_1=3, b_2=8, b_3=5, total 3+3+8+5=19.

Swap from 4 to 0: pay a_0=7 and sum of b_k from 0 to 3, which is b_0=4, b_1=3, b_2=8, b_3=5, total 7+4+3+8+5=27.

So the minimal among these is 14, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, swapping directly from 4 to 3 costs 14, and since position 3 is m=2 (0-based), which is position 3 >=2, which is not acceptable.

Wait, m=2 means positions <=2 are acceptable.

In 0-based indexing, positions 0,1,2.

So, swapping to position 3 is still not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to perform multiple swaps.

From 4 to 3 for 14, then from 3 to 2.

Swapping from 3 to 2: pay a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 2 to 2, which is b_2=8, total 6+8=14.

Total cost: 14+14=28.

But sample output is 14, which is less than 28.

Wait, maybe I can swap directly from 4 to 2 for 19, then from 2 to 1 for another cost.

Wait, but 19 is already more than 14, so that can't be better.

Wait, maybe there's a way to reach position 2 directly with cost 14.

In the first swap from 4 to 2: pay a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 2 to 3, which is b_2=8 and b_3=5, total 6+8+5=19, which is more than 14.

Wait, but sample output is 14, so perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after swapping to position 3 for 14, I don't need to swap further because position 3 is acceptable since m=2 means positions <=2 are acceptable.

Wait, no, m=2 means positions <=2.

In 0-based indexing, positions 0,1,2.

Position 3 is not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the positions.

Wait, the problem says: "the n -th person in the queue. Then Kirill stands after the n -th person, that is, in position n +1 ."

So, positions are 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

He wants to be among the first m positions, which are positions from 1 to m.

In the sample input, n=4, m=2.

Positions are 1,2,3,4, and Kirill at 5.

He wants to be at position 1 or 2.

So, he can swap from 5 to j, where j <5, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to 4.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it's 14, which matches swapping from 5 to 3 for 14.

But position 3 is still not acceptable, as he wants position <=2.

Wait, maybe in that swap, he reaches position j=3, paying a_j=9 and sum of b_k from j+1=4 to i-1=4, which is b_4=5, total 9+5=14.

Then, he needs to swap again from 3 to 2, paying a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 3 to 2, which is b_3=5, total 6+5=11.

Total cost: 14+11=25.

But sample output is 14, which is less than 25.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence of swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps he can swap from 5 to 2 directly: pay a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 3 to 4, which is b_3=8 and b_4=5, total 6+8+5=19, which is more than 14.

Swap from 5 to 1: pay a_1=3 and sum of b_k from 2 to 4, which is b_2=8, b_3=5, b_4=5, total 3+8+5+5=21.

Swap from 5 to 0: pay a_0=7 and sum of b_k from 1 to 4, which is b_1=3, b_2=8, b_3=5, b_4=5, total 7+3+8+5+5=28.

So, the minimal is swapping from 5 to 3 for 14, but position 3 is not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after swapping to position 3, I can stay there, but it's not acceptable.

So, perhaps I need to perform another swap from 3 to 2.

Pay a_2=6 and sum of b_k from 3 to 2, which is b_3=5, total 6+5=11.

Total cost: 14+11=25.

But sample output is 14, which is less than 25.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I can swap from 5 to 1 for 21, then from 1 to 0 for a certain cost.

But position 0 is acceptable.

From 1 to 0: pay a_0=7 and sum of b_k from 1 to 0, which is b_1=3, total 7+3=10.

Total cost: 21+10=31, which is worse than 25.

Wait, this is worse than 25.

So, perhaps the minimal is indeed 14, achieved by swapping from 5 to 3 for 14, and then not swapping anymore, but position 3 is not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after swapping to position 3, I can perform another swap to position 2 for 11, total 25, which is worse than 14.

Wait, but sample output is 14, which is less than both 25 and 31.

So, perhaps there is a way to reach position 2 with cost 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 2 for 19 is too much, but there's a better path.

Wait, perhaps swapping from 5 to 4 for 9, then from 4 to 2 for 11, total 20, which is still more than 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 3 for 14, then from 3 to 1 for certain cost.

From 3 to 1: pay a_1=3 and sum of b_k from 2 to 2=8, total 3+8=11.

Total cost: 14+11=25.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe swapping from 5 to 2 for 19 is the only direct way, but it's more than 14.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the sum of b_k is from j to i-1, inclusive.

In swapping from 5 to 3: pay a_3=6 and sum of b_k from 3 to 4, which is b_3=5 and b_4=5, total 6+5+5=16.

But sample output is 14, which is less than 16.

Wait, perhaps in the sample explanation, they consider sum from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's j < k < i, which is k from j+1 to i-1.

So, from 5 to 3: j=3, i=5, sum b_k from 4=5, total a_3=6 +5=11.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, positions are 1 to n=4, Kirill at 5.

Swap from 5 to 3: j=3, i=5, sum b_k from 4=5, total a_3=6 +5=11.

Then, swap from 3 to 2: a_2=3 + sum b_k from 3=5, total 3+5=8.

Total cost: 11+8=19, which is less than 25.

Still more than 14.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach.

Perhaps, instead of thinking in terms of swaps, I can think of removing people from in front of Kirill.

Each person can be removed by either swapping with them (paying a_j) or paying b_k to pass through them.

Wait, maybe it's similar to selecting a subset of people to swap with, and paying a_j for each selected, and b_k for those not selected.

But I need to make sure that the swaps are done in a way that positions are correctly adjusted.

This seems complicated.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where p <= m.

To reach position p, he needs to have p-1 people in front of him.

So, he needs to "remove" n - (p-1) people from in front of him.

In other words, he needs to have p-1 people in front, so he needs to make sure that only p-1 people are in front, and the rest are either swapped behind him or he passes through them.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting which people to swap with.

Let me consider that Kirill needs to perform a series of swaps to reach a position <=m.

Each swap allows him to jump to a position j, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position <=m.

This seems like a shortest path problem, where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j with cost a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard shortest path algorithm would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Perhaps I can iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach each position, and then find the minimal cost to reach any position <=m.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let dp[i] be the minimal cost to reach position i.

We want dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

To compute dp[j], we can consider swapping from any position i > j to j, paying a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But this seems too slow for large n.

Wait, maybe I can precompute prefix sums for b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1 to i].

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Now, to compute dp[j], we can take the minimum over all i > j of dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

But this is still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[j] in O(n) time.

Let me rearrange the expression.

dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rewritten as:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, if I define a temporary variable temp = min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Then dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

Now, temp can be computed for all j by precomputing the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from j+1 to n.

This can be done in O(n) time by iterating from n down to 1 and keeping a running minimum.

Yes, this seems feasible.

So, the plan is:

1. Compute prefix_b, where prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1 to i].

2. Initialize dp[n+1] = 0, since Kirill starts at position n+1.

3. Iterate from i = n down to 1:

a. Compute temp = dp[i+1] + prefix_b[i]

b. If i+1 <= n, temp = min(temp, previous temp)

c. dp[i] = a[i] - prefix_b[i] + temp

4. Finally, find the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

Wait, I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me adjust the indices to be 0-based for easier handling.

Assume positions are 0 to n.

Kirill starts at position n.

He wants to reach position <= m-1.

So, in 0-based indexing, positions 0 to m-1.

I need to adjust the indices accordingly.

Let's redefine:

- positions: 0 to n.

- Kirill starts at position n.

- He wants to reach position <= m-1.

- a[0 to n-1]

- b[0 to n-1]

Now, to swap from i to j, pay a_j + sum of b[k] for j < k < i.

In 0-based indexing, sum of b[k] for k from j+1 to i-1.

So, sum b[j+1 to i-1] = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Where prefix_b[k] = sum of b[0 to k]

Now, dp[j] = a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Wait, no.

Wait, dp[j] = minimal cost to reach position j.

To reach j from i > j, cost is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

Which can be rearranged as:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, I can compute the minimal value of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j.

If I iterate j from n-1 down to 0, keeping a running minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1], that should work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Compute prefix_b[0 to n-1], where prefix_b[k] = sum of b[0 to k]

Initialize dp[n] = 0

Initialize temp = infinity

For j from n-1 down to 0:

if j < m:

dp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + temp

else:

# Kirill must reach j <= m-1, so if j >= m, dp[j] should be infinity or a very large number

dp[j] = infinity

if j < n:

temp = min(temp, dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j])

Then, the answer is the minimum dp[j] for j from 0 to m-1

Wait, but in the sample input, n=4, m=2.

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 4

prefix_b[1] = 4+3=7

prefix_b[2] = 7+8=15

prefix_b[3] = 15+5=20

Initialize dp[4]=0

temp = infinity

j=3:

if 3 < 2: dp[3]=infinity

temp = min(infinity, dp[4] + prefix_b[3]) = min(infinity, 0 + 20)=20

j=2:

if 2 < 2: dp[2]=infinity

temp = min(20, dp[3] + prefix_b[2}) = min(20, infinity +15)=20

j=1:

dp[1]=3 -7 +20=16

temp = min(20, dp[2] + prefix_b[1}) = min(20, infinity +7)=20

j=0:

dp[0]=7 -4 +20=23

Then, the minimal dp[j] for j=0 and j=1 is min(23,16)=16, but sample output is 14.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me check again.

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

where temp = min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

In the iteration:

for j from n-1 down to 0:

if j >= m:

dp[j] = infinity

else:

dp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + temp

temp = min(temp, dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j])

Wait, in j=1:

dp[1]=3 -7 +20=16

temp = min(20, dp[2] + prefix_b[1])

But dp[2]=infinity, so temp remains 20

j=0:

dp[0]=7 -4 +20=23

So, min(dp[0], dp[1})=min(23,16)=16, but sample is 14.

So, perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the way temp is updated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that dp[j] is the minimal cost to reach position j.

To reach j, Kirill can swap from any i > j to j, paying a_j + sum b[k] from j+1 to i-1.

So, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j of (dp[i] + sum b[k] from j+1 to i-1)

Which is equivalent to dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

So, dp[j] = a_j + min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) - prefix_b[j]

Let me define temp = min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

Now, temp can be computed by iterating j from n-1 down to 0, and keeping a running minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j.

So, in code:

Initialize temp = dp[n] + prefix_b[n-1]

Then, for j from n-1 down to 0:

if j < m:

dp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + temp

else:

dp[j] = infinity

temp = min(temp, dp[j] + prefix_b[j])

Wait, in j from n-1 down to 0:

At each step, temp is the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j

So, temp is initialized to dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j]

Then, for j from n-2 down to 0:

temp = min(temp, dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j])

dp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + temp

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the initialization.

Let me try with the sample input again.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

prefix_b=[4,7,15,20]

Initialize dp[4]=0

temp = dp[4] + prefix_b[3] = 0 + 20 =20

j=3:

if 3 <2: dp[3]=infinity

temp = min(temp, dp[4] + prefix_b[3})=min(20,0+20)=20

j=2:

if 2 <2: dp[2]=infinity

temp = min(20, dp[3] + prefix_b[2})=min(20, inf +15)=20

j=1:

dp[1]=3 -7 +20=16

temp = min(20, dp[2] + prefix_b[1})=min(20, inf +7)=20

j=0:

dp[0]=7 -4 +20=23

temp = min(20, dp[1] + prefix_b[0})=min(20,16+4)=20

Then, min(dp[0], dp[1})=min(23,16)=16, but sample output is 14.

So, discrepancy here.

Perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, maybe temp should be min over i > j of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]

So, when updating temp, it should be min(temp, dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j])

Because dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j] corresponds to i=j+1.

Then, for i > j+1, temp already contains the min
