Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with various lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. So, for example, an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length, a square has four, a pentagon has five, and so on.

Given that, the key point here is that each polygon must have sides of the same length, and each stick can only be used in one polygon. Also, sticks cannot be broken, so I have to use each stick as a whole side.

So, for each unique stick length, I can potentially form polygons using sticks of that length. The number of polygons I can form from a set of sticks of the same length depends on how many sticks I have of that length.

Wait a minute, but polygons have a minimum number of sides. A triangle has 3 sides, a square has 4, a pentagon has 5, and so on. So, for a given length, I need at least 3 sticks to form a polygon (a triangle). If I have more than 3, I can form multiple polygons, depending on how many sticks I have.

But, to maximize the number of polygons, I should try to form as many small polygons as possible, since smaller polygons require fewer sticks. For example, triangles require 3 sticks each, squares require 4, and so on. So, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to form as many triangles as possible, because they use the fewest sticks.

Wait, but that might not always be optimal. Let's consider an example.

Take the third test case from the example:

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

Here, we have two sticks of length 2 and four sticks of length 3. According to the explanation, we can use the four sticks of length 3 to make one square. So, the answer is 1.

But, if I tried to make triangles instead, with length 3, I would need 3 sticks per triangle. With four sticks, I could make one triangle and have one stick left over, which isn't enough to form another triangle. So, in this case, making a square is better because I use all four sticks in one polygon, but the answer is still 1.

Another test case:

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

According to the explanation, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4. So, that's 2 polygons.

Let's see:

- For length 2: there are five sticks of length 2. I can make a pentagon (5 sides), using all five sticks.

- For length 4: there are four sticks of length 4. I can make a square, using all four sticks.

So, total polygons: 2.

Alternatively, if I tried to make triangles with length 2, I would need 3 sticks per triangle. With five sticks, I could make one triangle and have two sticks left over, which isn't enough for another triangle. Similarly, with length 4, I could make one square with four sticks. So, total polygons: 2, same as the explanation.

Wait, but in this case, making a pentagon with the length 2 sticks uses more sticks than making a triangle, but the number of polygons is the same. So, in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, it's equivalent.

But, consider another scenario: suppose I have 6 sticks of length 2. If I make triangles, I can make two triangles (6 sticks / 3 per triangle). If I make a hexagon, I use all six sticks for one polygon. So, in this case, making triangles gives me more polygons.

So, it seems that making smaller polygons allows me to create more polygons, but in the previous cases, it was the same.

Wait, but in the first test case:

1

1

Output: 0

Which makes sense because you need at least 3 sticks to form any polygon.

Second test case:

2

1 1

Still not enough to form any polygon.

Third test case:

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

As explained, forms one square with the four sticks of length 3.

Fourth test case:

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Forms one pentagon with the five sticks of length 2 and one square with the four sticks of length 4.

Okay, so from these examples, it seems that for each unique stick length, I should determine how many polygons I can make with that length, and sum them up to get the total number of polygons.

But, I need to think about what's the minimum number of sticks required for a polygon. Since a triangle has the fewest sides (3), and polygons can have more sides, but the number of sides must be at least 3.

So, for each unique stick length, I need to see how many sticks I have of that length, and then determine how many polygons I can make with them.

Wait, but polygons with more sides use more sticks, but allow me to use up more sticks in a single polygon.

But, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many small polygons as possible.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with 6 sticks of length 2, making two triangles uses 6 sticks and gives me two polygons, whereas making one hexagon uses 6 sticks and gives me only one polygon. So, in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, making smaller polygons is better.

But, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is the only option, as I don't have enough to make a triangle and have sticks left over.

Wait, but with four sticks of length 3, I could make one square, or I could make one triangle and have one stick left over, but the triangle is a polygon and the leftover stick can't form anything, so making one square is better in terms of using all sticks, but the number of polygons is the same as making one triangle.

But, in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, I can make one pentagon, which is one polygon, or I could make one triangle and have two sticks left over, which can't form anything else. So, making the pentagon is just as good as making the triangle in terms of the number of polygons, but uses more sticks.

So, in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, it's better to make smaller polygons.

Wait, but in the earlier example I thought about having six sticks of length 2: making two triangles gives me two polygons, whereas making one hexagon gives me one polygon. So, making smaller polygons is better for maximizing the number of polygons.

But, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, I can only make one square or one triangle, so it's the same.

Wait, but actually, with four sticks of length 3, I could make one square, or one triangle and one stick left over, but the single stick can't form anything. So, making the square uses all sticks efficiently, but the number of polygons is the same.

In the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, making a pentagon gives one polygon, or making one triangle and leaving two sticks, which can't form anything else.

So, in that case, making the pentagon is equivalent to making the triangle in terms of the number of polygons, but uses more sticks.

But, since the goal is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily to use all sticks, making the pentagon and the square gives two polygons, which seems to be the maximum possible.

Wait, but making the pentagon uses five sticks, and the square uses four sticks, totaling nine sticks, which matches the input.

So, in this case, it's optimal to make the largest possible polygons to use all sticks, but in terms of number of polygons, sometimes making smaller polygons is better.

I need to think of a general approach.

I think the key is that for each unique stick length, I should determine how many complete polygons I can make with the sticks of that length, regardless of the number of sides.

Wait, but polygons must have at least 3 sides.

So, for each unique stick length, count the number of sticks of that length, and then divide that count by 3 (since each polygon must have at least 3 sides), taking the integer division.

Wait, but that might not be accurate, because for polygons with more sides, I can make fewer polygons with the same number of sticks.

Wait, but to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many triangles as possible, since they use the fewest sticks per polygon.

Wait, but in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is better than making one triangle and leaving one stick unused.

But, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same (one polygon), so it doesn't matter.

In the fourth test case, making one pentagon and one square gives two polygons, which seems to be the maximum possible.

Wait, but if I were to make two triangles with the sticks of length 2 and length 4, I could make one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one triangle with three sticks of length 4, but I have five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4.

Wait, with five sticks of length 2, I could make one triangle and have two sticks left over, which can't form anything else. With four sticks of length 4, I could make one square. So, total polygons: two, same as making a pentagon and a square.

So, in this case, it's equivalent.

But, if I had, say, six sticks of length 2 and three of length 3, I could make two triangles with the length 2 sticks and one triangle with the length 3 sticks, totaling three polygons.

Alternatively, I could make one hexagon with the six length 2 sticks and one triangle with the three length 3 sticks, totaling two polygons, which is fewer than the first option.

So, in this case, making smaller polygons gives more polygons.

Hence, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many triangles as possible.

Wait, but in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is better than making one triangle and leaving one stick unused.

But, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same (one polygon).

So, perhaps the general approach is, for each unique stick length, to determine how many triangles I can make with the sticks of that length, since triangles use the fewest sticks.

But, if I have sticks left over after making as many triangles as possible, I can't make any other polygons with fewer than 3 sticks.

Wait, but polygons must have at least 3 sides, so I can't make any polygons with fewer than 3 sticks.

Hence, for each unique stick length, the number of polygons I can make is floor(number of sticks of that length / 3).

Wait, but in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, floor(4/3) = 1, which matches making one square or one triangle.

In the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, floor(5/3) = 1, which matches making one pentagon or one triangle.

With six sticks of length 2, floor(6/3) = 2, which matches making two triangles.

So, this seems to be a consistent approach.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- For each unique stick length, count the number of sticks of that length.

- For each count, add floor(count / 3) to the total number of polygons.

- Sum these values across all unique stick lengths to get the total number of polygons.

This seems to align with the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = 1

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0

cnt = dict()

for x in a:

cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1

for x in cnt.values():

ans += x // 3

print(ans)

So, the program reads the number of test cases, t, then for each test case, it defines a function func_1() that reads n and the list of stick lengths a.

It then initializes a counter dictionary cnt to count the occurrences of each stick length.

Finally, for each count in cnt.values(), it adds floor(count / 3) to the answer, and prints the answer.

This aligns perfectly with the algorithm I just derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{t = \text{int(input())}} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{for each test case:}} \]

\[ \boxed{n = \text{int(input())}} \]

\[ \boxed{a = \text{list(map(int, input().split()))}} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{cnt} = \{\}} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{for each stick length } x \text{ in } a:} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{cnt}[x] = \text{cnt.get}(x, 0) + 1} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{ans} = 0} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{for each count in cnt.values():}} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{ans} += \text{count} // 3} \]

\[ \boxed{\text{print(ans)}} \]
