Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I perform this operation.

I need to minimize the number of cards I have in the end. So, I should try to perform this operation as many times as possible.

Let me think about how to maximize the number of operations I can perform. I need to group the cards by their numbers and see how many groups have at least k cards.

Wait, but I can perform the operation on a group as long as it has at least k cards, and after performing the operation, the group size reduces by 1.

So, for each group that has at least k cards, I can perform the operation on it, reducing its size by 1, and getting k-1 cards in return.

But, the k-1 cards I get can be any numbers, so I can choose numbers that might help me perform more operations in the future.

Wait, but since I can choose any numbers for the new cards, I can potentially create new groups or add to existing groups.

However, the problem is to minimize the number of cards in the end, so I should aim to reduce the total number of cards as much as possible.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the hand.

Let's say I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm for the different numbers in the hand.

For each frequency fi, if fi >= k, I can perform the operation on it, reducing fi by 1 and adding k-1 cards elsewhere.

But since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can strategically add them to other groups to make their sizes reach k so that I can perform operations on them as well.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the total number of cards.

Initially, there are n cards.

Each operation reduces the number of cards by 1 (since I replace k cards with k-1 cards).

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is n - m, where m is the number of unique numbers, because in the end, I need at least m cards (one for each unique number).

Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Actually, in the end, I can have fewer than m cards if some groups are reduced to zero.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I can keep performing operations as long as there are groups with at least k cards.

I think it's more about the frequencies and how many times I can perform the operations on each group.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

5 cards, k=3

Numbers: 4,1,1,4,4

So, frequencies:

4:3

1:2

Initially, only the group with 4 has at least k=3 cards.

So, I can perform the operation on the 4's: replace 3 fours with 2 cards of any number.

Let's say I choose to make them two 1's.

Now, the hand is: 1,1,1,4

Frequencies:

1:3

4:1

Now, the group with 1 has 3 cards, which is equal to k=3, so I can perform the operation again.

Replace 3 ones with 2 cards of any number. Let's say I make them two 4's.

Now, the hand is: 4,4,4

Frequencies:

4:3

Now, again, I can perform the operation on the 4's: replace 3 fours with 2 cards of any number. Let's say two 1's.

Hand: 1,1

Frequencies:

1:2

Now, no group has at least k=3 cards, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards left: 2

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, I was able to reduce the hand to 2 cards.

Let me see if there's a better sequence of operations that could reduce it further.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate this without simulating the operations.

I need a way to model this process mathematically.

I recall that this kind of problem can be modeled using the concept of repeatedly removing k cards and adding k-1 cards, which effectively reduces the total number of cards by 1 each time.

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is equal to the number of times I can find a group with at least k cards.

But, since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I can potentially create new groups or add to existing groups to enable more operations.

This seems a bit complicated to model directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the frequencies of the numbers.

Let me consider that for each group, I can perform floor(f_i / k) operations on it, each time reducing f_i by k and adding k-1 cards elsewhere.

But, since I can choose where to add the new cards, I can optimize this process.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimal number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

I need to find the smallest number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of k cards to perform operations.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of elements that cannot be reduced given a certain operation.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of elements that cannot be divided into groups of size k.

But, in this problem, I can choose where to add the new cards, which complicates things.

Let me try to find a general approach.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm.

I can perform operations on any fi that is >= k, reducing fi by k and increasing some other frequencies by k-1.

I need to maximize the number of operations performed, which will minimize the final number of cards.

Since I can choose where to add the new cards, I can strategically add them to frequencies that are most likely to reach k again.

But, to minimize the final number of cards, I need to keep performing operations as much as possible.

I think the key is to consider the total number of operations I can perform, which is the total number of times I can find a group with at least k cards.

But, since the new cards can be added to any groups, it's like I can redistribute the cards in a way that allows me to perform as many operations as possible.

This seems similar to solving for the minimal number of cards that cannot form a group of k.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to finding the minimal number of elements that cannot be divided into groups of size k, but with the ability to redistribute the remaining cards.

I need to find a way to model this.

Let me consider the total number of cards, n, and the number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, since I replace k cards with k-1 cards.

So, if I can perform o operations, then the final number of cards is n - o.

My goal is to maximize o, which means performing as many operations as possible.

The question is, what is the maximal number of operations I can perform?

Given that I can choose where to add the new cards, I can potentially create new groups that allow for more operations.

But, to maximize o, I need to maximize the number of times I can find groups with at least k cards.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total frequency and how many times I can remove k cards.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the whole hand as a single group and see how many times I can remove k cards and add k-1 cards, effectively reducing the total by 1 each time, until no group has k cards.

But, since I can choose the numbers of the new cards, I need to consider the best way to redistribute them to enable more operations.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

First sample:

n=5, k=3, cards=[4,1,1,4,4]

As we saw, it can be reduced to 2 cards.

Second sample:

n=1, k=10, card=[7]

Here, k=10, but n=1 < 10, so no operation can be performed. So, the answer is 1.

Third sample:

n=7, k=2, cards=[4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

Frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

I can perform operations on the two 2's: replace 2 cards with 1 card of any number.

Say I choose to make it a 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:2, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

Now, I can perform an operation on the two 1's: replace them with one card of any number.

Say I make it a 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

No group has at least k=2 cards, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards left: 5

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should be 1.

Wait, maybe I didn't interpret the problem correctly.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged)."

So, when I exchange k cards, I get k-1 cards that can have any number, including the same as the exchanged cards.

In the third sample, perhaps there is a better sequence of operations.

Let me try again.

Initial hand: [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

Frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

I can perform an operation on the two 2's: replace them with one card of any number.

Say I choose to make it a 1.

Now, hand: [1,1,4,100,5,3]

Frequencies: 1:2, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

Now, I can perform an operation on the two 1's: replace them with one card of any number.

Say I make it a 1.

Now, hand: [1,4,100,5,3]

Frequencies: 1:1, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

No group has at least k=2 cards, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards left: 5

But according to the sample output, it should be 1.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to make the new card a number that already exists, but in this case, it doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I can make a different choice.

Let's try again.

Initial hand: [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

Frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 4:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

Perform operation on two 2's: replace them with one card, say make it a 4.

Now, hand: [4,4,1,100,5,3]

Frequencies: 4:2, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

Now, perform operation on two 4's: replace them with one card, say make it a 1.

Now, hand: [1,1,100,5,3]

Frequencies: 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1

Perform operation on two 1's: replace them with one card, say make it a 100.

Now, hand: [100,100,5,3]

Frequencies: 100:2, 5:1, 3:1

Perform operation on two 100's: replace them with one card, say make it a 5.

Now, hand: [5,5,3]

Frequencies: 5:2, 3:1

Perform operation on two 5's: replace them with one card, say make it a 3.

Now, hand: [3,3]

Frequencies: 3:2

Perform operation on two 3's: replace them with one card, say make it a 3.

Now, hand: [3]

Frequencies: 3:1

No group has at least k=2 cards, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards left: 1

Ah, so by strategically choosing which numbers to add when performing operations, I can reduce the hand to a single card.

That makes sense now.

So, the key is to use the new cards to create new groups that can be operated on further.

In this case, by choosing to make the new cards numbers that already have at least one card, I can increase their frequencies and potentially perform more operations.

So, in general, to minimize the number of cards, I should aim to keep creating groups that can be operated on.

This seems like a greedy approach where I always try to add the new cards to groups that are most likely to reach k cards again.

But, implementing this directly would be complex.

Is there a mathematical way to compute the minimal number of cards without simulating the operations?

Let me think differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, the maximal number of operations I can perform is n - m, where m is the minimal number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

But, I need to find m.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of cards that cannot form a group of k.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to finding the minimal number of cards that are leftover when trying to group all cards into groups of size k.

But, since I can redistribute the cards in a smart way, it might not be directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps it's about the minimal number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets where each set has k-1 cards.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to model this with math.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm.

I can perform operations on any fi that is >=k, reducing fi by k and increasing some other frequencies by k-1.

I need to maximize the number of operations, o.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, so the final number of cards is n - o.

I need to find the maximal o such that it's possible to perform o operations.

But, since I can choose where to add the new cards, I can potentially create new groups that allow for more operations.

This seems similar to a process where I can convert k cards into k-1 cards, and I can choose which groups to add the new cards to.

This is reminiscent of the process of reducing a graph by removing edges, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of groups that cannot be reduced.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the ceiling of fi divided by (k-1).

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in some similar problems, the minimal number of cards left is n modulo (k-1).

Wait, let's see.

In the first sample, n=5, k=3.

5 modulo 2 is 1, but the answer is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

In the second sample, n=1, k=10.

1 modulo 9 is 1, and the answer is 1.

In the third sample, n=7, k=2.

7 modulo 1 is 0, but the answer is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n modulo (k -1), but if n modulo (k-1) == 0, then it's k-1, else n modulo (k-1).

Wait, in the first sample, 5 modulo 2 is 1, but the answer is 2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal number of cards that cannot form a group of size k.

But, again, I'm not sure.

Let me think about the process differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

So, I can perform operations until no group has at least k cards.

I need to find the minimal number of cards left, which is n minus the maximal number of operations I can perform.

The question is, what is the maximal number of operations o?

o is the maximal number such that, after performing o operations, no group has at least k cards.

Each operation reduces one group by k cards and adds k-1 cards to some groups.

This seems like a complicated process to model directly.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the total frequency and how it reduces.

Wait, maybe I can consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, and I can perform operations as long as some group has at least k cards.

So, I can keep performing operations until no group has at least k cards.

Therefore, the minimal number of cards left is the minimal n - o, where o is the maximal number of operations I can perform.

But, I need to find o.

This seems circular.

Wait, perhaps I can find a condition when no group has at least k cards.

Let me consider that after performing o operations, the frequencies are adjusted accordingly.

But, since I can choose where to add the new cards, it's tricky to model.

Let me try to find a different way.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm.

I can perform operations on fi as long as fi >=k.

Each operation on fi reduces fi by k and increases some other frequencies by k-1.

I need to maximize o, the number of operations.

I need to find the maximal o such that, after performing o operations, no fi >=k.

But, since I can choose where to add the new cards, I can strategically add them to minimize the final number of cards.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that the total number of cards after o operations is n - o.

And, among these n - o cards, no group has at least k cards.

So, I need to distribute the n - o cards into groups, each of size less than k.

Therefore, the minimal n - o is the smallest number such that it's possible to distribute them into groups where no group has at least k cards.

In other words, the minimal n - o is the smallest number where the maximal group size is less than k.

This sounds promising.

So, I need to find the smallest s such that s cards can be divided into groups where no group has k or more cards.

Given that, s is the smallest number where s <= m*(k-1), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But, I don't know m in advance, as m can change based on how I add new cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that m can be up to s, since I can choose to have as many unique numbers as I want.

But, in practice, m can be up to 100, as c_i can be up to 100.

Wait, but in the operation, I can choose the numbers of the new cards, so I can potentially create new unique numbers or add to existing ones.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

I found a formula that might be applicable.

The minimal number of cards left is n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)) * (k -1).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in some similar problems, the minimal number of cards left is n modulo (k-1).

But, in the first sample, n=5, k=3, 5 modulo 2 is 1, but the answer is 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(n / (k-1)).

Wait, 5 / 2 = 2.5, ceil(2.5) = 3, but the answer is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe floor(n / (k-1)).

5 / 2 = 2.5, floor(2.5) = 2, which matches the first sample.

In the second sample, n=1, k=10, 1 / 9 = 0.111, floor(0.111) = 0, but the answer is 1.

So, doesn't match.

In the third sample, n=7, k=2, 7 /1 =7, floor(7)=7, but the answer is 1.

So, no match.

This isn't working.

Let me try to think about the process in terms of base (k-1).

Wait, perhaps it's related to base (k-1) representation.

But, I'm not sure.

Let me consider the frequencies.

Suppose I have a frequency fi.

I can perform floor(fi / k) operations on this group alone.

Each operation reduces fi by k and adds k-1 cards to other groups.

So, the net reduction in total cards is 1 per operation.

But, the added k-1 cards can be distributed to other groups, potentially allowing more operations.

So, perhaps the total number of operations is the sum of floor(fi / k) over all i, plus the operations enabled by the added cards.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula.

I found that the minimal number of cards left is n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But, in the first sample, n=5, m=3 (numbers 1,4,7), so floor((5-3)/(3-1))=floor(2/2)=1, so n -1 =4, which doesn't match the answer of 2.

Wait, perhaps it's n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)) * (k-1).

In the first sample, that would be 5 - floor(2/2)*2 =5-1*2=3, which still doesn't match.

No, that's not it.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, and I can perform operations as long as some group has at least k cards.

So, the process stops when no group has at least k cards.

Therefore, the final distribution of cards must satisfy that no group has at least k cards.

So, the minimal number of cards left is the minimal s such that it's possible to distribute s cards into groups where no group has k or more cards.

Given that, s should be such that s <= m*(k-1), where m is the number of unique numbers.

But, since m can be up to s (if I choose to have s unique numbers), s <= s*(k-1), which is always true for s >=1 and k >=2.

So, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that m is the number of unique numbers in the final hand.

But, m can be up to s, so s <= s*(k-1), which is always true.

This seems too loose.

Perhaps I need to consider that in the final distribution, the maximal group size is at most k-1.

So, s <= ceil(n / (k-1)).

Wait, in the first sample, ceil(5 /2)=3, but the answer is 2.

No, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe floor(n / (k-1)).

In the first sample, floor(5/2)=2, which matches.

In the second sample, floor(1/1)=1, which matches.

In the third sample, floor(7/1)=7, but the answer is 1.

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's more involved.

Let me think about the fourth sample.

n=10, k=4, all cards are 1.

So, frequencies: 1:10

I can perform floor(10/4)=2 operations, reducing the group by 4 each time, and adding 3 cards each time.

After first operation: 1:6 + 3 new cards.

Say I add them to 1's: 1:9

Then, perform another operation: 1:5 + 3 new cards.

Add them to 1's: 1:8

Then, perform another operation: 1:4 + 3 new cards.

Add them to 1's: 1:7

And so on.

This seems inefficient.

Alternatively, I can add the new cards to different numbers.

For example:

Start with 1:10

Perform operation: 1:6 + 3 new cards, say 2:3

Now, 1:6, 2:3

Perform operation on 1:6: 1:2 + 3 new cards.

Say add them to 2's: 2:6

Now, 1:2, 2:6

Perform operation on 2:6: 2:2 + 3 new cards.

Say add them to 1's: 1:5

Now, 1:5, 2:2

Perform operation on 1:5: 1:1 + 3 new cards.

Say add them to 2's:
