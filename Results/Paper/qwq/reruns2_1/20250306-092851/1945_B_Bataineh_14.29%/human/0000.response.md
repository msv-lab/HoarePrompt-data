Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. Let's break it down.

For the first installation, it launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from the time it's launched up to m minutes after its launch. So, if a firework is launched at time x, it's visible from x to x + m, inclusive.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

6 7 4

So, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...

Fireworks from the second installation: 7, 14, 21, 28, ...

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (since m = 4).

So, for the first installation:

- Launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10

- Launched at 12: visible from 12 to 16

- Launched at 18: visible from 18 to 22

- And so on.

For the second installation:

- Launched at 7: visible from 7 to 11

- Launched at 14: visible from 14 to 18

- Launched at 21: visible from 21 to 25

- And so on.

Now, looking at the time intervals:

- From 6 to 7: only the first installation's firework is visible.

- From 7 to 10: both fireworks are visible (first installation's first firework and second installation's first firework).

- From 10 to 12: only the second installation's first firework is visible.

- From 12 to 14: first installation's second firework and second installation's first firework.

- From 14 to 16: both the first installation's second firework and second installation's second firework.

- And so on.

So, in this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

But according to the problem's example output, it's 2, which matches.

Now, look at the second input:

3 4 10

a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

Fireworks from first installation: launched at 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,...

Visible from:

- 3 to 13

- 6 to 16

- 9 to 19

- 12 to 22

- 15 to 25

- 18 to 28

- 21 to 31

- 24 to 34

- 27 to 37

- 30 to 40

- And so on.

Fireworks from second installation: launched at 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,...

Visible from:

- 4 to 14

- 8 to 18

- 12 to 22

- 16 to 26

- 20 to 30

- 24 to 34

- 28 to 38

- 32 to 42

- 36 to 46

- 40 to 50

- And so on.

Now, let's see overlapping intervals.

From 3 to 4: only first installation's first firework.

From 4 to 6: both first installation's first and second installation's first.

From 6 to 8: first installation's first and second, and second installation's first.

Wait, from 6 to 8:

- First installation's first firework: 3 to 13

- First installation's second firework: 6 to 16

- Second installation's first firework: 4 to 14

So, at time 6:

- Firework launched at 3 is visible (3 to 13)

- Firework launched at 6 is visible (6 to 16)

- Firework launched at 4 is visible (4 to 14)

So, at time 6, three fireworks are visible.

Wait, but according to the problem's output for this case, it's 7.

Hmm, maybe my approach is too simplistic.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible.

Each firework is visible from t to t + m, where t is the launch time.

So, for installation 1, fireworks are launched at multiples of a: a, 2a, 3a, ...

Similarly, for installation 2: b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each firework from installation 1 is visible from ka to ka + m, for k = 1,2,3,...

Each from installation 2 is visible from lb to lb + m, for l = 1,2,3,...

I need to find the time t where the number of intervals (ka, ka + m) and (lb, lb + m) that contain t is maximized.

This seems like an interval covering problem.

One way to approach this is to consider the launch times and the times when fireworks disappear (t + m).

So, I can think of events: launch times and disappearance times.

Sort these events and keep a counter of current visible fireworks.

But with a and b potentially being large numbers and t being up to 10^4, and m up to 10^18, I need an efficient way.

Maybe I can find the time when the most fireworks are launched within a small interval, considering their visibility periods.

Wait, perhaps I should look for times when multiple fireworks are launched close together.

But given that a and b can be large, and m can be even larger, I need a smarter approach.

Let's consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM of a and b is the time when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

But since a and b may not have a common multiple within the visibility period, I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible at a particular time.

If I can find a time t where the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible is maximized and similarly for installation 2, then sum them up.

But I think there's a better way.

Let's consider the number of fireworks launched by installation 1 that are visible at time t.

This would be the number of k such that t >= ka and t <= ka + m.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, for installation 1:

ka <= t <= ka + m

which implies ka <= t and t <= ka + m

But I'm not sure how to maximize this.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of k where ka <= t <= ka + m.

This can be rewritten as k <= t / a and t - m <= ka.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of integer divisions.

The number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at time t is floor((t - m)/a) to floor(t/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at any time t is floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t)/a).

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

The number of fireworks from installation 1 launched before or at t is floor(t / a).

The number of fireworks from installation 1 that have not yet disappeared at time t is ceil((t - m)/a).

So, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me look at the output for the third test case:

7 8 56

Output: 17

According to the note, after 112 minutes, there are 17 fireworks visible.

Let's verify that.

For installation 1 (a=7):

Fireworks launched at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112,...

Each visible for 56 minutes.

So, at time 112:

- Fireworks launched from 56 to 112 (56 to 56+56=112)

- Launched at 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112

That's 9 from installation 1.

For installation 2 (b=8):

Fireworks launched at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112,...

Each visible for 56 minutes.

At time 112:

- Fireworks launched from 56 to 112

- Launched at 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112

That's 8 from installation 2.

Total: 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the note.

So, in this case, the maximum number is 17.

But how to generalize this?

It seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is related to the number of launches within a certain time frame, considering the visibility period.

I need to find the time t where the sum of fireworks from both installations is maximized.

Perhaps I can calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation that are visible at time t, and find the t that maximizes this sum.

But with large a, b, and m, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible t.

Let me think about the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM is the smallest time when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

If I can find LCM(a, b), then I can find how often both installations launch together.

But I'm not sure if this directly helps.

Wait, maybe I can think about the density of launches.

The number of launches per unit time from installation 1 is 1/a, and from installation 2 is 1/b.

But since m can be large, I need to consider how many launches fall within the visibility window.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of launches from each installation that contribute to the visibility at time t.

For installation 1, the number of launches between t - m and t is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m -1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

Then, the total visible fireworks at time t is sum of both.

But I need to maximize this sum over all possible t.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that for installation 1, the number of visible fireworks at any time t is floor((t + m)/a) - floor(t / a)).

Wait, no.

Actually, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 at time t is floor((t + m)/a) - floor(t / a).

Similarly for installation 2.

Then, the total visible fireworks is sum of both.

To maximize this, I need to find t where both floor((t + m)/a) - floor(t / a) and floor((t + m)/b) - floor(t / b) are maximized.

But I'm not sure how to find such t efficiently.

Perhaps I need to consider the periodicity.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the maximum visible fireworks is the sum of the maximum visible from each installation, which would be floor(m / a) + 1 for installation 1 and floor(m / b) + 1 for installation 2.

But in the first example, m=4, a=6, b=7.

floor(4/6)+1=0+1=1 for installation 1

floor(4/7)+1=0+1=1 for installation 2

Sum is 2, which matches the first example.

In the second example, m=10, a=3, b=4.

floor(10/3)+1=3+1=4 for installation 1

floor(10/4)+1=2+1=3 for installation 2

Sum is 7, which matches the second example.

In the third example, m=56, a=7, b=8.

floor(56/7)+1=8+1=9 for installation 1

floor(56/8)+1=7+1=8 for installation 2

Sum is 17, which matches the third example.

So, it seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1 for installation 1 plus floor(m / b) + 1 for installation 2.

Wait, but in the first example, m=4, a=6, b=7.

floor(4/6)=0, so 0+1=1

floor(4/7)=0, so 0+1=1

Sum is 2, which matches.

In the second example, m=10, a=3, b=4.

floor(10/3)=3, so 3+1=4

floor(10/4)=2, so 2+1=3

Sum is 7, matches.

Third example: m=56, a=7, b=8.

floor(56/7)=8, so 8+1=9

floor(56/8)=7, so 7+1=8

Sum is 17, matches.

Fourth example: m=78123459896, a=5, b=6

floor(78123459896 / 5) +1 = 15624691979 +1 =15624691980

floor(78123459896 / 6) +1 =13020576649 +1=13020576650

Sum is 15624691980 +13020576650 =28645268630, which matches the fourth output.

Fifth example: a=1, b=1, m=1

floor(1/1)+1=1+1=2 from installation 1

floor(1/1)+1=1+1=2 from installation 2

Sum is 4, matches.

Sixth example: a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000/1)+1=1000000000000000000+1=1000000000000000001

floor(1000000000000000000/1)+1=1000000000000000000+1=1000000000000000001

Sum is 2000000000000000002, matches.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 is correct.

Wait, but why does this work?

Let's think about it.

For installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a).

But if I set t = m, then floor(m / a) - floor((m - m -1)/a) = floor(m / a) - floor(-1 / a) = floor(m / a) - (-1 if a >1 else 0)

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps at t = m, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor((m + a -1)/a), which is floor(m / a) +1 if m % a !=0.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

The number of fireworks from installation 1 that are launched before or at t and have not yet disappeared at t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a).

But for t >= m, this simplifies to floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a).

To maximize this, I need to choose t such that this difference is maximized.

Similarly for installation 2.

But in the examples above, using floor(m / a) +1 seems to work.

Wait, perhaps I can consider t = m.

At t = m, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor(m / a) +1, assuming that the last firework launched at floor(m / a)*a is still visible at t = m.

Wait, but this seems to hold for the examples.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

Therefore, the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

if m < a or m < b:

print(2)

else:

print(m // a + m // b + 2)

Seems to be implementing floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1, which is m//a +1 + m//b +1, which simplifies to m//a + m//b +2.

But in the code, it's written as m // a + m // b + 2.

Which matches the sum floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) +2.

But in my earlier calculation, it was floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1, which is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) +2.

So, it matches.

But wait, in the first example, m=4, a=6, b=7.

floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0+0+2=2, which matches.

In the second example, floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3+2+2=7, matches.

Third example: floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8+7+2=17, matches.

Fourth example: floor(78123459896 /5)=15624691979, floor(78123459896 /6)=13020576649, so 15624691979 +13020576649 +2=28645268630, matches.

Fifth example: floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1+1+2=4, matches.

Sixth example: floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 +1000000000000000000 +2=2000000000000000002, matches.

So, the formula seems correct.

But what about the case when m < a or m < b?

In such cases, the formula would still hold, but perhaps there are overlaps.

Wait, in the first example, m < a and m < b, and the output is 2.

So, the if condition checks if m < a or m < b, and if so, prints 2.

Otherwise, it prints m//a + m//b +2.

But is this necessary?

In the first example, m < a and m < b, and the output is 2.

Is this a special case?

Let's consider m < a or m < b.

If m < a, then floor(m / a) = 0, so floor(m / a) +1 =1

Similarly, if m < b, floor(m / b) +1 =1

So, if m < a and m < b, then total is 1 +1 =2, which matches the first example.

Hence, the if condition is handling the case when m < a or m < b, in which case the maximum visible fireworks is 2.

Otherwise, it's m//a + m//b +2.

So, the program seems correct.

I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time from two firework installations, given their launch frequencies and the visibility duration of each firework.

### Approach

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, read the integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the maximum number of visible fireworks at any time is 2. This is because no more than one firework from each installation can be in the sky simultaneously.

3. **General Case Calculation:**
   - Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible in the sky at the same time.
   - For installation 1: `floor(m / a) + 1`
   - For installation 2: `floor(m / b) + 1`
   - Sum these values to get the total maximum number of visible fireworks.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Special Case (`m < a` or `m < b`):**
   - When `m` is less than `a` or `b`, it means that the visibility period of a firework is shorter than the launch interval of at least one installation. Hence, only one firework from each installation can be in the sky at any time, leading to a maximum of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously.

2. **General Case:**
   - Calculate how many fireworks from each installation can be in the sky within the visibility period `m`.
   - For installation 1: `floor(m / a)` gives the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes, and adding 1 accounts for the firework launched at time 0.
   - Similarly, for installation 2: `floor(m / b) + 1`.
   - The total maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of these values.

This approach ensures an efficient and correct calculation for each test case, providing the desired output based on the given inputs.
