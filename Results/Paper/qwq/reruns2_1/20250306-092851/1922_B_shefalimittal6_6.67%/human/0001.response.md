Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have t test cases, and for each test case, we're given n sticks with lengths that are powers of 2, specifically 2^{a_i} for each stick i. We need to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle has an area greater than 0, which means the three sides must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

So, the task is to count the number of ways to choose such triples of sticks for each test case.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input starts with t, the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there's n, the number of sticks, followed by a list of n integers a_i, where each stick's length is 2^{a_i}.

Constraints:

- t is up to 10^4

- n is up to 3*10^5 per test case, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case or better, since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n across all test cases being 3*10^5.

First thoughts:

- Since stick lengths are powers of 2, which are distinct except when a_i are equal, this might simplify things.

- Powers of 2 are unique in that no two powers of 2 add up to another power of 2 because they are all distinct and form a basis for binary representation.

- This uniqueness might affect how the triangle inequality holds.

Recap of triangle inequality for sides a, b, c (assuming a <= b <= c):

- a + b > c

Given that all lengths are powers of 2, and powers of 2 are strictly increasing, I can consider sorting the a_i values.

Wait, but the stick lengths are 2^{a_i}, and since 2^{a} < 2^{b} if a < b, so sorting a_i in ascending order will correspond to sorting the stick lengths in ascending order.

So, if I sort the a_i values, the corresponding stick lengths will be in increasing order.

Let me think about the triangle inequality in terms of exponents.

Given three exponents a, b, c where a <= b <= c, the triangle inequality becomes:

2^a + 2^b > 2^c

Given the properties of exponents, can I simplify this?

Let’s consider that 2^a + 2^b = 2^a (1 + 2^{b-a}) = 2^a * (1 + 2^{k}), where k = b - a >= 0.

Similarly, 2^c = 2^{c}.

So, 2^a * (1 + 2^{k}) > 2^{c}

Dividing both sides by 2^a:

1 + 2^{k} > 2^{c - a}

Since k = b - a >= 0, and c >= b >= a, c - a >= 0.

So, 1 + 2^{k} > 2^{c - a}

I need to find when this inequality holds.

Let’s consider different cases based on the values of k and c - a.

Case 1: k = 0, meaning a = b.

Then, 1 + 1 = 2 > 2^{c - a}

So, 2 > 2^{c - a}

This implies c - a < 1, but c >= a, so c - a >= 0.

If c - a = 0, then 2 > 1, which is true.

If c - a = 1, then 2 > 2, which is false.

So, when a = b, the inequality holds only if c = a.

Wait, but c >= b = a, so c >= a.

The inequality holds only if c = a.

So, when a = b = c, the triangle inequality holds.

Case 2: k >= 1, meaning b > a.

Then, 1 + 2^{k} > 2^{c - a}

Since 2^{k} >= 2, 1 + 2^{k} >= 3.

So, 3 > 2^{c - a}

This holds if c - a <= 1, because:

- If c - a = 0, 2^{0} = 1, and 3 > 1.

- If c - a = 1, 2^{1} = 2, and 3 > 2.

- If c - a >= 2, 2^{2} = 4, and 3 < 4, so inequality fails.

Therefore, when b > a, the inequality holds only if c - a <= 1.

Meaning c <= a + 1.

But since c >= b >= a, and c is at most a + 1.

So, c can be a or a + 1.

Therefore, for the triangle inequality to hold:

- If a = b = c, it holds.

- If a = b < c, it holds only if c = a + 1.

Wait, but in the first case, when a = b = c, it holds.

In the second case, when a = b < c, it holds only if c = a + 1.

Wait, but in the first case, if a = b = c, then c - a = 0, which is <=1, so it holds.

But in the second case, when a = b < c, it holds only if c = a + 1.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, when a < b, c <= a + 1.

But in the case where a = b < c, it's a special case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to think in terms of the exponents.

Given that the stick lengths are powers of 2, and powers of 2 are distinct, perhaps there are specific patterns.

I recall that in a triangle with sides that are powers of 2, the only possible triangles are those where two sides are equal and the third is either equal or one less in exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should look for triplets where the exponents are equal or differ by at most 1.

But from the earlier analysis, it seems that for the triangle inequality to hold, the exponents should be such that the largest side is not more than one unit larger in exponent than the sum of the other two.

Wait, but sum of the other two is 2^a + 2^b.

If a = b, then 2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}.

So, for a = b <= c, the inequality holds if 2^{a+1} > 2^c, which implies a + 1 > c.

So, c < a + 1.

Since c >= a, the only possibilities are c = a or c = a + 1.

Similarly, if a < b <= c, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Since 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{b+1} (because 2^a <= 2^b), but this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the world of powers of 2, the largest side must be less than the sum of the other two, which, given the properties of exponents, can only happen in specific cases.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

n = 7

a_i = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

So, all sticks have length 2^1 = 2.

Any three sticks will form an equilateral triangle, which is valid.

Number of ways: C(7,3) = 35.

Example 2:

n = 4

a_i = [3,2,1,3]

Lengths: 8, 4, 2, 8.

Possible triangles:

- 2,4,4: 2 + 4 > 4 => 6 > 4 (yes)

- 2,8,8: 2 + 8 > 8 => 10 > 8 (yes)

- 4,8,8: 4 + 8 > 8 => 12 > 8 (yes)

Wait, but according to the sample output, only 2 triangles are possible.

Wait, maybe some of these don't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, sample output is 2 for this test case.

Wait, perhaps some of these triplets don't form a valid triangle.

Wait, 2,4,8: 2 + 4 = 6, which is not greater than 8. So, this is invalid.

Wait, but in my earlier list, I have 2,4,4: 2 + 4 > 4 (6 > 4, yes)

2,8,8: 2 + 8 > 8 (10 > 8, yes)

4,8,8: 4 + 8 > 8 (12 > 8, yes)

But in the sample output, it's only 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the sample input has a_i = [3,2,1,3], which corresponds to lengths [8,4,2,8].

Possible triplets:

- 2,4,8: 2 + 4 = 6 <= 8, invalid

- 4,8,8: 4 + 8 = 12 > 8, valid

- 2,4,8: already considered, invalid

- 2,8,8: 2 + 8 = 10 > 8, valid

So, only two valid triangles, which matches the sample output.

Hence, my earlier assumption that any three can form a triangle is incorrect.

I need a better approach to count the valid triplets.

Approach:

Given that stick lengths are powers of 2, which are strictly increasing, I can leverage sorting and properties of exponents to efficiently count the number of valid triangles.

Algorithm:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and the list a_i.

b. Sort the a_i in ascending order. This corresponds to sorting the stick lengths in ascending order since 2^{a_i} is increasing with a_i.

c. For each triplet (i,j,k) with i < j < k:

- Ensure that 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Given the sorted order, a_i <= a_j <= a_k.

Given that, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

I need an efficient way to count such triplets.

An efficient way to do this is to iterate over k from 2 to n-1 and find pairs (i,j) where i < j < k and 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

But since n can be up to 3*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but with sum of n across all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an O(n^2) or better solution per test case.

Wait, O(n^2) per test case would be too slow for t=10^4, but since sum of n across all test cases is 3*10^5, perhaps a O(n^2) approach per test case would be acceptable, as total operations would be around (3*10^5)^2 / 2, which is about 4.5*10^10 operations, which is too much for standard time limits.

Hence, I need a smarter approach.

Optimized Approach:

Given that the lengths are powers of 2, which are distinct except when a_i are equal, I can group sticks by their a_i values.

Let’s denote the frequency of each a_i as cnt[a_i].

Then, I can iterate through all possible triplets of a_i, a_j, a_k where a_i <= a_j <= a_k, and check if 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

But this seems inefficient for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through possible a_k and find the number of pairs (a_i, a_j) with a_i <= a_j < a_k and 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Given that 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}, and a_i <= a_j < a_k, I can analyze based on the relationship between a_i, a_j, and a_k.

Let’s consider that 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

If a_i < a_j, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} = 2^{a_j} (1 + 2^{a_i - a_j}) > 2^{a_k}.

If a_i = a_j, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} = 2^{a_j + 1} > 2^{a_k}.

Hence, 2^{a_j + 1} > 2^{a_k} ⇒ a_j + 1 > a_k ⇒ a_k < a_j + 1.

Similarly, for a_i < a_j, 2^{a_j} (1 + 2^{a_i - a_j}) > 2^{a_k} ⇒ 1 + 2^{a_i - a_j} > 2^{a_k - a_j}.

Since a_i - a_j < 0, 2^{a_i - a_j} < 1, so 1 + 2^{a_i - a_j} < 2.

Hence, 2 > 2^{a_k - a_j} ⇒ a_k - a_j < 1 ⇒ a_k < a_j + 1.

Therefore, in both cases, a_k < a_j + 1.

Given that a_j <= a_k, and a_k < a_j + 1, the only possibilities are a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j + 1.

Hence, for any triplet (a_i, a_j, a_k) with a_i <= a_j <= a_k, it forms a triangle if and only if a_k < a_j + 1.

This is a crucial observation.

Therefore, to count the number of valid triplets, I need to count the number of triplets where a_k < a_j + 1.

Given that, I can group the sticks by their a_i values and compute the counts.

Let’s sort the a_i in ascending order.

Then, for each possible a_k, I need to find the number of pairs (a_i, a_j) where a_i <= a_j < a_k.

But with the condition that a_k < a_j + 1.

Given that a_j <= a_k < a_j + 1 ⇒ a_j <= a_k < a_j + 1 ⇒ a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j + 1.

Wait, but a_k <= a_j + 1 - 1, since a_k < a_j + 1.

Hence, a_k <= a_j.

But a_k >= a_j, since a_i <= a_j <= a_k.

Hence, a_k = a_j.

Therefore, the only possible triplets are those where a_k = a_j.

Meaning, a_i <= a_j = a_k.

But in this case, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k} ⇒ 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j} ⇒ 2^{a_i} > 0, which is always true.

Hence, any triplet where a_k = a_j, i.e., a_k = a_j >= a_i, forms a valid triangle.

Wait, but in the earlier example, when a_k = a_j + 1, it was also allowed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me revisit.

From earlier:

a_k < a_j + 1 ⇒ a_k <= a_j.

Because a_k >= a_j, the only possibility is a_k = a_j.

Hence, triplets where a_k = a_j.

Therefore, triplets where a_i <= a_j = a_k.

Hence, for each pair of sticks with a_j = a_k, and for each a_i <= a_j, we can form a valid triplet.

Hence, the number of such triplets is the sum over all a_j, of cnt[a_j] choose 2 (for choosing two sticks with a_j) multiplied by the number of sticks with a_i <= a_j.

Wait, but this seems incomplete.

Wait, in the earlier example, when a_k = a_j + 1, it was also allowed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a_k <= a_j.

Wait, but from the inequality, a_k < a_j + 1.

Given that a_k >= a_j, the possibilities are a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j + 1.

Wait, but a_k cannot be greater than a_j + 1.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k} ⇒ a_k < a_j + 1.

Given that a_k >= a_j, the only possibilities are a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j + 1.

Wait, but in the case a_k = a_j + 1, we need to check if 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j + 1}.

Which is 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2 * 2^{a_j} ⇒ 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j}.

But since a_i <= a_j, 2^{a_i} <= 2^{a_j}, so 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j} only if a_i > a_j, which contradicts a_i <= a_j.

Hence, when a_k = a_j + 1, there are no valid triplets unless a_i > a_j, which cannot happen.

Therefore, only triplets where a_k = a_j are valid.

Hence, the number of valid triplets is the sum over all a_j of cnt[a_j] choose 3 (for a_i < a_j) plus cnt[a_j] * (sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i < a_j).

Wait, perhaps more carefully:

For each a_j, the number of ways to choose two sticks with a_j is cnt[a_j] choose 2, and for each such pair, we can choose any a_i <= a_j.

Hence, for each a_j, the number of valid triplets is cnt[a_j] choose 2 * (sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <= a_j).

But this includes cases where a_i < a_j and a_i = a_j.

Wait, but in the triplet, a_i can be less than or equal to a_j.

Hence, for each a_j, the number of ways to choose two sticks with a_j is cnt[a_j] choose 2, and for each such pair, we can choose any a_i <= a_j.

Hence, the total number of triplets for a_j is cnt[a_j] choose 2 * (sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <= a_j).

But sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <= a_j is the cumulative sum up to a_j.

Hence, I can sort the a_i and compute prefix sums.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and the list a_i.

b. Sort a_i in ascending order.

c. Compute the frequency count of each a_i.

d. Compute the prefix sum of counts up to each a_j.

e. For each a_j, compute cnt[a_j] choose 2 * prefix_sum[a_j]

f. Sum these values over all a_j to get the total number of valid triplets.

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seems to overcount.

Wait, in the first test case:

n = 7

a_i = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

So, a_j = 1 for all.

cnt[1] = 7

prefix_sum[1] = 7

Number of triplets: C(7,2) * 7 = 21 * 7 = 147, which is way more than the sample output of 35.

Wait, clearly, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I calculate the prefix sums.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract the cnt[a_j] choose 3 from the total.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Alternative approach:

Given that only triplets where a_k = a_j are valid, meaning a_k <= a_j.

But in reality, a_k >= a_j, so a_k = a_j.

Hence, the triplet is a_i <= a_j = a_k.

Hence, for each a_j, the number of ways to choose two sticks with a_j is cnt[a_j] choose 2, and for each such pair, we can choose any a_i <= a_j.

Hence, the total number of triplets is sum over a_j of C(cnt[a_j],2) * (prefix_sum[a_j]), where prefix_sum[a_j] is the total number of sticks with a_i <= a_j.

But in the first test case, a_j = 1 for all, so C(7,2) * 7 = 21 * 7 = 147, which is not matching the sample output of 35.

Wait, perhaps I need to divide by something or adjust the prefix_sum.

Wait, perhaps prefix_sum[a_j] should exclude the cnt[a_j] itself, to avoid overcounting.

Wait, no, prefix_sum[a_j] should include cnt[a_j], since a_i can be equal to a_j.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract the C(cnt[a_j],3) from the total, as those are the triplets where a_i = a_j = a_k.

Wait, but in the first test case, C(7,3) = 35, which matches the sample output.

Hence, perhaps only the triplets where a_i = a_j = a_k are valid.

Wait, but in the second test case, a_i = [3,2,1,3], sorted as [1,2,3,3]

Here, a_j = 3, cnt[3] = 2

C(2,2) * prefix_sum[3] = 1 * 4 = 4

But the sample output is 2, which is less than 4.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a_j = a_k, and a_i <= a_j, but in the second test case, a_j = 3, prefix_sum[3] = 4 (sticks with a_i <=3), C(2,2) * 4 = 4, but only 2 valid triplets.

Hence, my approach is overcounting.

Wait, perhaps some triplets are being counted multiple times.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract the cases where a_i + a_j <= a_k.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed.

Alternative Idea:

Given that a_k = a_j, and a_i <= a_j, I need to ensure that 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k} = 2^{a_j}.

Which simplifies to 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j} ⇒ 2^{a_i} > 0, which is always true.

Hence, in this case, all triplets where a_k = a_j are valid.

But in the second test case, according to this, there should be C(2,2) * 4 = 4 triplets, but the sample output is 2.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a_i must be strictly less than a_j when a_j = a_k.

Wait, but in the first test case, a_i = a_j = a_k is allowed.

Wait, in the first test case, all a_i are 1, so a_i = a_j = a_k =1 is allowed.

In the second test case, a_j =3, a_k=3, a_i can be 1,2,3.

But only certain combinations are valid.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a_j = a_k, and a_i < a_j, it's valid, and when a_i = a_j = a_k, it's also valid.

Hence, for each a_j, the number of valid triplets is:

- C(cnt[a_j],2) * (prefix_sum[a_j -1]) + C(cnt[a_j],3)

Where prefix_sum[a_j -1] is the number of sticks with a_i < a_j.

Hence, total triplets for a_j is:

C(cnt[a_j],2) * (prefix_sum[a_j -1]) + C(cnt[a_j],3)

Then, sum over all a_j.

In the first test case, a_j =1, cnt[1]=7, prefix_sum[1 -1] = prefix_sum[0] =0

Hence, C(7,2)*0 + C(7,3) =0 +35=35, which matches the sample.

In the second test case, a_j=3, cnt[3]=2, prefix_sum[2]=2 (a_i=1 and a_i=2)

Hence, C(2,2)*2 + C(2,3)=1*2 +0=2, which matches the sample.

Similarly, for a_j=2, cnt[2]=1, prefix_sum[1]=1

C(1,2)*1 + C(1,3)=0 +0=0

For a_j=1, cnt[1]=1, prefix_sum[0]=0

C(1,2)*0 + C(1,3)=0 +0=0

Total: 2 +0 +0=2, which matches.

Hence, this seems correct.

Hence, the correct approach is:

- Sort a_i in ascending order.

- Compute frequency counts cnt[a_i] for each a_i.

- Compute prefix_sum[a_j], the cumulative sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i < a_j.

- For each a_j, compute C(cnt[a_j],2) * prefix_sum[a_j -1] + C(cnt[a_j],3)

- Sum these over all a_j to get the total number of valid triplets.

This should work efficiently, as it's O(n) per test case, since sorting is O(n log n), and the rest are O(n) operations.

Given that the sum of n across all test cases is 3*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

Hence, I can implement this approach.

Let me try to implement this in code.

First, read t, then for each test case:

- Read n

- Read list a_i

- Sort a_i

- Compute cnt[a_i] using a dictionary or Counter

- Compute prefix_sum[a_j], which is the cumulative sum up to a_j -1

- For each a_j, compute C(cnt[a_j],2) * prefix_sum[a_j -1] + C(cnt[a_j],3)

- Sum these values and print the result.

Implementing C(n,k), which is the combination function, can be done using math.comb if available, or using a custom function.

Also, to handle large n, I need to ensure that the prefix_sum is computed efficiently.

I can iterate through the sorted a_i and keep a running sum.

Let me outline the steps in code-like pseudocode:

For each test case:

Read n

Read list a_i

Sort a_i

Initialize a dictionary cnt to count frequency of each a_i

Initialize a list prefix_sum where prefix_sum[j] = sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i < a_j

Initialize total = 0

For each unique a_j in sorted order:

cnt_j = cnt[a_j]

If cnt_j >=2:

total += C(cnt_j,2) * prefix_sum[a_j -1]

If cnt_j >=3:

total += C(cnt_j,3)

Print total

To implement prefix_sum[a_j -1], I need to map a_j to its prefix sum.

Hence, I can create a list of unique a_j in sorted order, compute the prefix sums accordingly.

Let me consider an example.

Second test case:

n=4

a_i=[3,2,1,3]

sorted a_i=[1,2,3,3]

cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=2

prefix_sum for a_j=1: sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <1, which is 0

prefix_sum for a_j=2: sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <2, which is cnt[1]=1

prefix_sum for a_j=3: sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i <3, which is cnt[1] + cnt[2]=2

Hence, prefix_sum = {1:0, 2:1, 3:2}

Then:

For a_j=1:

cnt_j=1, cnt_j >=2: no

cnt_j >=3: no

total +=0

For a_j=2:

cnt_j=1, cnt_j >=2: no

cnt_j >=3: no

total +=0

For a_j=3:

cnt_j=2, cnt_j >=2: yes

total += C(2,2) * 2 + C(2,3)=1*2 +0=2

Hence, total=2, which matches the sample.

Another example:

n=3

a_i=[1,2,3]

sorted=[1,2,3]

cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1

prefix_sum[1]=0

prefix_sum[2]=1

prefix_sum[3]=1+1=2

Then:

For a_j=1:

cnt_j=1, no contributions

For a_j=2:

cnt_j=1, no contributions

For a_j=3:

cnt_j=1, no contributions

Total=0, which matches the sample.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Implementing this in code should solve the problem.

Looking back at the given program, let's see if it matches this logic.

Given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

num_of_lens = {}

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

for x in nums:

num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1

res = 0

for cnt in num_of_lens.values():

if cnt >= 3:

res += math.comb(cnt, 3)

if cnt >= 2:

total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))

res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum

print(res)

Analysis:

- It reads t, then for each test case, reads n and the list a_i.

- It counts the frequency of each a_i using a dictionary num_of_lens.

- For each unique a_i (through its count cnt), it adds C(cnt,3) to res if cnt >=3.

- Then, if cnt >=2, it sums the counts of all other a_i (total_sum = sum of counts where i != cnt), and adds C(cnt,2) * total_sum to res.

Wait, this seems different from my approach.

In my approach, for each a_j, I add C(cnt_j,2) * prefix_sum[a_j -1] + C(cnt_j,3)

But in the given program, for each unique a_i with count cnt, it adds C(cnt,3) + C(cnt,2) * sum of counts of all other a_i.

Wait, sum of counts of all other a_i is sum of cnt[i] for i != a_i.

Wait, in my approach, prefix_sum[a_j -1] is the sum of cnt[a_i] for a_i < a_j.

But in the given program, it's sum of cnt[i] for i != a_i.

This is different.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Because, in my correct approach, for each a_j, I need to multiply C(cnt_j,2) with prefix_sum[a_j -1], which is the sum of counts of a_i < a_j.

But in the given program, it multiplies C(cnt,2) with sum of counts of all a_i != a_i, which includes a_i > a_j.

This is incorrect, because in the triangle inequality, a_i <= a_j.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
