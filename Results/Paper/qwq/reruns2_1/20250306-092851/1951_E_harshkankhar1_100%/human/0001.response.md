Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string into substrings where none of them is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition, and then the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters long, with a total sum of |s| across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably linear time per string.

Let's think about when such a partition is possible. If the entire string is not a palindrome, then the partition consisting of just the whole string satisfies the condition. So, in that case, I can immediately return "YES" and print the string as the single partition.

However, if the entire string is a palindrome, I need to find a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes. Let's consider some examples.

Take the string "lllllllll". Every substring of this string is a palindrome because all characters are 'l'. So, no matter how I partition it, each part will be a palindrome. Therefore, in this case, I should return "NO".

Another example is "uwuowouwu". Let's see:

- "uwuowouwu" itself is not a palindrome.

- So, I can partition it as a single substring: "uwuowouwu", which is not a palindrome.

- But the sample output shows a partition into three substrings: "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

- So, multiple partitions are possible, but I just need to find one.

Wait, but in the first test case, "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so the single-substring partition works.

In the second test case, "lllllllll", every substring is a palindrome, so no partition exists.

In the third test case, "uwuowouwu", although the whole string is not a palindrome, some substrings are palindromes, but I need to ensure that none of the parts in the partition is a palindrome.

So, I need a way to check if it's possible to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome.

Let me think about the conditions under which such a partition is possible.

If the entire string is not a palindrome, then I can use the whole string as one partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, if all possible splits result in at least one palindrome, then it's impossible.

Wait, in the case where all substrings are palindromes, like "lllllllll", it's impossible.

So, I need to find a way to split the string such that no part is a palindrome.

Let me consider that.

First, check if the whole string is not a palindrome. If it's not, then I can use it as a single partition.

If the whole string is a palindrome, then I need to split it into smaller parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, if all possible splits include at least one palindrome, then it's impossible.

So, I need to find a way to split the string such that no part is a palindrome.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

So, for a string to not be a palindrome, there must be at least one position where the character doesn't match its corresponding character from the end.

For example, in "ab", 'a' != 'b', so it's not a palindrome.

In "aab", 'a' == 'a', but 'a' != 'b', so it's not a palindrome.

In "aaa", it's a palindrome.

So, single-character strings are palindromes.

Wait, but according to the problem, single-character strings are palindromes.

So, if I have a string like "a", it's a palindrome.

So, in my partition, I cannot have single-character strings if they are palindromes.

Wait, but "a" is a palindrome, so I cannot have it in my partition.

Similarly, "aa" is a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome, and so on.

So, if I have a string like "aab", which is not a palindrome, I can partition it into "aab", which is not a palindrome.

Alternatively, I could partition it into "a" and "ab", but "a" is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

So, in this case, the only valid partition is ["aab"].

Another example: "aaa".

This is a palindrome, so I need to split it into smaller parts.

Possible splits:

- "a", "aa": both are palindromes.

- "aa", "a": both are palindromes.

- "a", "a", "a": all are palindromes.

So, in this case, it's impossible to partition "aaa" such that no part is a palindrome.

Another example: "abba".

This is a palindrome, so I need to split it.

Possible splits:

- "a", "bb", "a": "a" and "a" are palindromes.

- "ab", "ba": "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "ab" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, I can partition "abba" into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

So, it's possible.

So, in this case, the answer is "YES", with partition ["ab", "ba"].

So, from this example, I can see that even if the whole string is a palindrome, it might still be possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, I need a way to determine if such a partition exists.

Let me try to find a general approach.

First, check if the whole string is not a palindrome. If it's not, then I can use it as a single partition.

If the whole string is a palindrome, then I need to try splitting it into two or more parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, I need to ensure that none of the parts is a palindrome.

From the earlier example, "abba" can be partitioned into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

Another example: "racecar".

This is a palindrome.

Possible splits:

- "r", "aceca", "r": "r" is a palindrome.

- "ra", "cec", "ar": "ra" is not a palindrome, "cec" is a palindrome, "ar" is not a palindrome.

So, this partition includes a palindrome.

- "rac", "ecar": "rac" is not a palindrome, "ecar" is not a palindrome.

So, this partition works.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Another example: "aaaa".

This is a palindrome.

Possible splits:

- "a", "aaa": "a" is a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome.

- "aa", "aa": both are palindromes.

- "aaa", "a": both are palindromes.

- "a", "a", "a", "a": all are palindromes.

So, in this case, it's impossible to partition "aaaa" such that no part is a palindrome.

Wait, but in the earlier example, "abba" could be partitioned into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

Similarly, "racecar" could be partitioned into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

But, in "aaaa", every possible substring is a palindrome.

So, it seems that if all possible substrings are palindromes, then it's impossible.

Wait, but in "abba", not all substrings are palindromes, but in "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

Wait, no, in "abba", substrings like "a", "b", "ab", "bb", "ba", "abb", "bba", etc., some are palindromes, some are not.

But, in "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

So, perhaps the key is whether there exists a partition where no part is a palindrome.

I need to find a way to split the string such that none of the parts is a palindrome.

Let me think about this differently.

Suppose I have a string where all characters are the same, like "aaaa". Then, every possible substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

If I have a string where not all characters are the same, maybe there is a way to partition it to avoid palindromes.

Wait, but even in strings with different characters, some substrings can be palindromes.

For example, in "abba", "b" is a palindrome, "bb" is a palindrome, but "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

So, in that case, I can partition it into "ab" and "ba".

Another example: "abc".

This is not a palindrome, so I can use the whole string as one partition.

Alternatively, I can partition it into "a", "b", "c", but "a", "b", "c" are all palindromes, which is not allowed.

But since the whole string "abc" is not a palindrome, I can use it as a single partition.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but in the sample input, there's "uwuowouwu", which is not a palindrome, so I can use the whole string as one partition.

But the sample output shows a partition into three parts: "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

All of these are not palindromes.

So, multiple partitions are possible.

But I just need to find one.

So, in general, if the whole string is not a palindrome, I can use it as a single partition.

If the whole string is a palindrome, I need to try to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, in some cases, like "aaaa", it's impossible.

So, how do I determine when it's possible?

Let me consider that if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it might be possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

But, in "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes, so it's impossible.

In "abba", there are substrings that are not palindromes, like "ab" and "ba".

So, perhaps, if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

But, wait, in "abba", I can partition it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "aaaa", no such partition exists.

Wait, but in "abba", the whole string is a palindrome, but I can split it into non-palindrome substrings.

In "aaaa", the whole string is a palindrome, and I cannot split it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, if the whole string is a palindrome, I need to check if there exists a way to split it into non-palindrome substrings.

But, in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "aaaa", which is a palindrome, I cannot split it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome, and all possible splits result in at least one palindrome, then it's impossible.

But, in "abba", I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but "abba" is a palindrome, and I can split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

Similarly, in "racecar", I can split it into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for strings that are palindromes, I can always split them into two parts where neither is a palindrome, as long as the string is longer than a certain length.

Wait, but in "aaa", which is a palindrome, I cannot split it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, what's the difference?

Ah, maybe it depends on the length of the string.

Wait, in "abba", length 4, which is even.

In "racecar", length 7, which is odd.

In "aaa", length 3, which is odd.

In "aaaa", length 4, which is even.

So, maybe it's about the length?

Wait, doesn't seem directly related.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether all characters are the same.

In "aaaa", all characters are the same, so all substrings are palindromes.

In "abba", characters are not all the same.

Wait, but in "abba", some substrings are palindromes, like "bb", but I can choose partitions that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

In "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes, so it's impossible.

In "abba", there are substrings that are not palindromes, so it's possible.

In "racecar", there are substrings that are not palindromes, so it's possible.

So, maybe the key is to check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

If there is at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then I can partition the string into parts that are not palindromes.

If all possible substrings are palindromes, then it's impossible.

So, I need to check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

But, in "abba", I can find "ab" which is not a palindrome.

In "racecar", I can find "rac" which is not a palindrome.

In "aaaa", all substrings are palindromes.

So, perhaps, if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, my approach would be:

1. Check if the whole string is not a palindrome. If it's not, then I can use it as a single partition.

2. If the whole string is a palindrome, then I need to check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

- If such a substring exists, then I can partition the string into parts that include this substring.

- If no such substring exists, then it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

But, how do I efficiently check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome?

Well, I can iterate through the string and check for substrings of length >=2.

Wait, but checking all possible substrings would be too slow, as it would be O(n^2) time, and with n up to 10^6, it's not feasible.

So, I need a smarter way to check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that if there exists at least one pair of characters in the string that are not equal, then there exists a substring that is not a palindrome.

Because, a palindrome requires that all corresponding characters are equal.

So, if there is at least one pair of characters that are not equal, then there exists a substring that is not a palindrome.

Wait, but I need to confirm this.

Suppose there exists at least one pair of characters in the string that are not equal.

Does that imply that there exists a substring that is not a palindrome?

Well, consider that in a palindrome, all characters symmetrically opposite to the center are equal.

So, if there is a pair of characters that are not equal, then the string cannot be a palindrome.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true, because it might still be a palindrome if those characters are not symmetrically opposite.

Wait, for example, in "abba", 'a' and 'b' are not equal, but "abba" is a palindrome.

So, in "abba", 'a' and 'b' are not equal, but the string is still a palindrome because the characters are symmetrically equal.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.

Let me think again.

If the whole string is a palindrome, and I need to split it into non-palindrome substrings, when is this possible?

Well, in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

In "racecar", I can split it into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome, any split results in palindromes.

So, what's the difference?

Ah, perhaps it's related to the length of the parts.

If I can split the string into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome, so in "aaaa", I can't split it into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

Wait, but in "abba", I split it into "ab" and "ba", both of length 2, which are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if I can find a way to split the string into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, in "aaa", if I split it into "aa" and "a", both are palindromes.

If I split it into "aaa", it's a palindrome.

So, no partition exists.

In "abba", I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "racecar", I can split it into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if I can split the string into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes, then it's possible.

But, in "abba", I split it into two parts of length 2, both not palindromes.

In "racecar", I split it into "rac" (length 3, not palindrome) and "ecar" (length 4, not palindrome).

So, it seems possible when I can split into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

But, in "aaa", all parts of length >=2 are palindromes, so it's impossible.

So, perhaps, the condition is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then I can use the whole string as one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome, then I need to check if I can split it into parts of length >=2 that are not palindromes.

- If I can find at least one substring of length >=2 that is not a palindrome, then it's possible.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

But, in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can find substrings like "ab" and "ba" that are not palindromes.

In "racecar", I can find "rac" and "ecar" that are not palindromes.

In "aaaa", all substrings of length >=2 are palindromes.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and all its substrings of length >=2 are palindromes, then it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can find substrings that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and contains at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But, how do I check if all substrings of length >=2 are palindromes?

Well, in "aaaa", all substrings of length >=2 are palindromes.

In "abba", there are substrings like "ab" and "ba" that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if the string consists of repeated identical characters, then all substrings are palindromes, and it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible.

Wait, but in "abba", there are different characters, but it's still possible.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and has at least two different characters, then it's possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "aaa", all characters are the same, so it's impossible.

In "abba", there are different characters, so it's possible.

In "racecar", there are different characters, so it's possible.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome and contains at least two different characters, then it's possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But, wait, in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "racecar", I can split it into "rac" and "ecar".

In "aaaa", which is a palindrome with only one distinct character, it's impossible.

So, perhaps, the condition is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome and contains at least two different characters, then "YES", and I need to find a way to split it into non-palindrome substrings.

- Otherwise, "NO".

But, how do I ensure that the parts are not palindromes?

Let me think about how to construct such a partition.

Suppose the string is a palindrome and contains at least two different characters.

Then, there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[j], where i and j are symmetric positions.

I can try to split the string at positions that avoid creating palindromic parts.

But, this seems tricky.

Let me consider that if I can find a substring of length 2 that is not a palindrome, then I can use that in my partition.

For example, in "abba", "ab" is not a palindrome.

So, I can split the string into "ab" and "ba".

Similarly, in "racecar", "rac" is not a palindrome.

So, I can split it into "rac" and "ecar".

But, in "aaaa", no substring of length >=2 is not a palindrome.

So, in that case, it's impossible.

Therefore, perhaps the condition is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome and contains at least one substring of length >=2 that is not a palindrome, then "YES", and I can use that substring in my partition.

- Otherwise, "NO".

But, how do I efficiently check if there exists at least one substring of length >=2 that is not a palindrome?

Well, I can iterate through the string and check for substrings of length 2.

If I find any substring of length 2 that is not a palindrome, then I can use that.

Since a substring of length 2 is a palindrome only if both characters are equal.

So, if there exists at least one pair of consecutive characters that are not equal, then I can use a substring of length 2 that is not a palindrome.

Otherwise, all substrings of length 2 are palindromes.

Similarly, for longer substrings, but I only need one such substring to make the partition.

So, perhaps, I can check if there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[i+1].

If such a position exists, then I can choose a substring that includes this position and is not a palindrome.

For example, in "abba", s[0] != s[1], so "ab" is not a palindrome.

In "racecar", s[0] != s[1], so "ra" is not a palindrome.

In "aaaa", all s[i] == s[i+1], so no substring of length 2 is not a palindrome.

Therefore, the condition simplifies to:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one partition.

- If the string is a palindrome and there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[i+1], then "YES", and I can partition the string into substrings that include these positions.

- Otherwise, "NO".

This seems efficient because checking if the string is a palindrome is O(n), and checking if there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1] is also O(n).

Now, I need to think about how to construct the partition when the string is a palindrome and contains at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1].

Let's consider "abba".

It's a palindrome, and s[0] != s[1].

So, I can choose to split it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

Similarly, in "racecar", s[0] != s[1], so I can split it into "ra" and "cecar".

But "ra" is not a palindrome, but "cecar" is a palindrome.

Wait, "cecar" is not a palindrome because "cecar" != "racec" when reversed.

Wait, is "cecar" a palindrome?

"cecar" reversed is "racec", which is not equal to "cecar", so it's not a palindrome.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, "cecar" reversed is "racec", which is different from "cecar", so yes, it's not a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into "ra" and "cecar" works.

Alternatively, I could split into "rac" and "ecar", both of which are not palindromes.

So, in general, if I can find a position where s[i] != s[i+1], I can try to split the string into substrings that include these positions.

But, I need to ensure that the parts are not palindromes.

One way to do this is to choose a substring that starts and ends with these differing characters.

For example, in "abba", choosing "ab" and "ba".

In "racecar", choosing "ra" and "cecar".

But, in "racecar", "cecar" is not a palindrome.

So, this seems to work.

Another way is to choose a substring of length 2 that is not a palindrome.

So, in "abba", "ab" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, I can split it into two parts of length 2.

Similarly, in "racecar", I can split it into "ra" and "cecar".

But, "ra" is not a palindrome, and "cecar" is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Therefore, in the case where the string is a palindrome and there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], I can split the string into two parts:

- The first part being from the start to some position that includes a non-palindromic substring.

- The second part being the remainder of the string.

But, I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Let me think about how to choose the split positions.

Suppose I find the first position i where s[i] != s[i+1].

Then, I can choose the first part to be from s[0] to s[i+1], and the second part to be from s[i+2] to the end.

But, I need to check if these parts are not palindromes.

Wait, in "abba", if I choose i=0 where s[0] != s[1], then the first part is s[0:2] = "ab", which is not a palindrome, and the second part is s[2:4] = "ba", which is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

In "racecar", if I choose i=0 where s[0] != s[1], then the first part is s[0:2] = "ra", which is not a palindrome, and the second part is s[2:7] = "cecar", which is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "abcba".

This is a palindrome.

Looking for positions where s[i] != s[i+1]:

- s[0] != s[1]

So, I can split it into "ab" and "cba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "aabbcc".

Wait, "aabbcc" is not a palindrome.

Wait, is it a palindrome?

Wait, "aabbcc" reversed is "ccbaab", which is not equal to "aabbcc", so it's not a palindrome.

So, in this case, I can use the whole string as one partition.

But, let's say I have "aabbcc", which is not a palindrome.

But, for the sake of argument, if it were a palindrome and I had to split it, I would look for positions where s[i] != s[i+1].

But, in this case, it's not a palindrome, so I don't need to split it.

Wait, "aabbcc" is not a palindrome, so I can use it as one partition.

Ok, back to the general approach.

So, summarizing:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one partition being the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome and there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[i+1], then "YES", and I can split the string into two parts:

- The first part from s[0] to s[i+1], which is not a palindrome.

- The second part from s[i+2] to the end, which is also not a palindrome.

- Otherwise, "NO".

But, I need to verify if this splitting method always works.

In "abba", it works.

In "racecar", it works.

In "abcba", it works.

But, what if the second part is a palindrome?

Wait, in "racecar", "cecar" is not a palindrome.

But, is there a case where the second part is a palindrome?

Let me consider "abba".

Split into "ab" and "ba".

Both are not palindromes.

Another split could be "abb" and "a", but "a" is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

So, I need to choose the split such that both parts are not palindromes.

In "abba", "ab" and "ba" both are not palindromes.

In "racecar", "ra" and "cecar" both are not palindromes.

So, it seems to work.

But, to be thorough, let's consider another example.

Take "abcba".

Split into "ab" and "cba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Good.

Another example: "civic".

This is a palindrome.

Looking for positions where s[i] != s[i+1].

s[0]=c, s[1]=i: c != i, so i=0.

Then, split into s[0:2]="ci" and s[2:5]="vic".

"ci" is not a palindrome, "vic" is not a palindrome.

Good.

Another example: "level".

This is a palindrome.

Looking for positions where s[i] != s[i+1].

s[0]=l, s[1]=e: l != e, so i=0.

Split into s[0:2]="le" and s[2:5]="vel".

"le" is not a palindrome, "vel" is not a palindrome.

Good.

Another example: "redder".

This is a palindrome.

Looking for positions where s[i] != s[i+1].

s[0]=r, s[1]=e: r != e, so i=0.

Split into s[0:2]="re" and s[2:5]="der".

"re" is not a palindrome, "der" is not a palindrome.

Good.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if the string is a palindrome and all consecutive characters are equal, but the string has length >=3.

For example, "aaa".

It's a palindrome, and s[0]=a, s[1]=a, s[2]=a.

No position where s[i] != s[i+1].

So, in this case, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Another example: "aaaa".

Same situation.

So, the condition holds.

Therefore, my approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Given that there can be up to 10^4 test cases, each with up to 10^6 characters, but the total sum of |s| across all test cases is <=10^6, I need an efficient solution.

I can read all the inputs first, process them one by one, and ensure that my solution is O(n) per string.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read the string s.

b. Check if s is not a palindrome.

- If not, print "YES", followed by 1, and the string s itself.

- This is a valid partition.

c. If s is a palindrome, then:

i. Check if there exists at least one position i where s[i] != s[i+1].

- If such a position exists, then:

a. Choose the first such position i.

b. Split the string into two parts:

- Part 1: s[0: i+2] (substring from 0 to i+1)

- Part 2: s[i+2: ]

c. Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If they are not palindromes, print "YES", followed by 2, and the two parts.

- If one of them is a palindrome, try a different split.

- But, according to our earlier reasoning, it should work.

- However, to be safe, I might need to adjust the split if one of the parts is a palindrome.

ii. If no such position exists, print "NO".

2. Repeat for all test cases.

Now, I need to implement functions to check if a string is a palindrome.

A efficient way to check if a string is a palindrome is to compare characters symmetrically from the ends towards the center.

I can implement a function that takes a string and returns True if it's a palindrome, False otherwise.

Also, I need to find the first position i where s[i] != s[i+1].

I can iterate through the string and check for s[i] != s[i+1].

Once I find such a position, I can use it for splitting.

Now, I need to handle the case where after splitting, one of the parts might still be a palindrome.

But, according to our earlier examples, it seems that choosing the split at the first position where s[i] != s[i+1] works.

However, to be thorough, I should consider edge cases.

Edge cases:

1. String of length 1: e.g., "a"

- It's a palindrome.

- All substrings are palindromes.

- So, "NO".

2. String of length 2:

- If s[0] != s[1], then it's not a palindrome, so "YES" with one partition.

- If s[0] == s[1], it's a palindrome.

- If s[0] == s[1], and the string is of length 2, then all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

3. String of length 3:

- If it's a palindrome and s[0] == s[1], then all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

- If it's a palindrome and s[0] != s[1], then I can split it into s[0:2] and s[2:3].

- For example, "aba": split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

- Another example: "aaa": all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

4. String with all characters the same: e.g., "aaaa"

- It's a palindrome.

- All substrings are palindromes.

- So, "NO".

5. String with mixed characters, not a palindrome: e.g., "abc"

- Not a palindrome, so "YES" with one partition.

6. String with mixed characters, is a palindrome, and has at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1]: e.g., "abba"

- It's a palindrome.

- s[0] != s[1], so split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

- So, "YES".

7. String with mixed characters, is a palindrome, and all s[i] == s[i+1]: but this would mean all characters are the same, which is already covered in case 4.

So, my earlier approach seems to cover these cases.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

I need to make sure that checking for palindromes is efficient.

An efficient way to check if a string is a palindrome is to compare characters from the start and end moving towards the center.

I can implement this in O(n) time.

Similarly, finding the first position where s[i] != s[i+1] can be done in O(n) time.

Now, I need to think about how to handle the splitting.

In the case where the string is a palindrome and I have to split it, I choose to split at the first position where s[i] != s[i+1].

Then, I take the first part as s[0: i+2] and the second part as s[i+2: ].

I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

From the earlier examples, this seems to hold.

But, to be safe, I can check if the first part is not a palindrome.

If it's not a palindrome, then I can proceed.

Similarly, check if the second part is not a palindrome.

But, in practice, it's sufficient to choose the split as described, because:

- The first part includes the position where s[i] != s[i+1], which should make it not a palindrome.

- The second part is the remainder of the string, which, since the whole string is a palindrome, and the first part is not a palindrome, the second part should also not be a palindrome.

But, to be thorough, I can include checks to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

If one of them is a palindrome, I might need to adjust the split.

However, based on the examples, it should work.

Now, let's consider implementing this logic.

I'll write helper functions:

- func_1(s): returns True if s is a palindrome, False otherwise.

- func_2(): the main function to handle each test case.

In func_2(), I'll:

- Read the string s.

- Check if it's not a palindrome.

- If not, print "YES", 1, and s.

- If it is a palindrome, then:

- Find the first position i where s[i] != s[i+1].

- If such a position exists, split the string into s[0: i+2] and s[i+2: ].

- Print "YES", 2, followed by the two parts.

- If no such position exists, print "NO".

I need to make sure that the split parts are not palindromes.

To ensure this, I can check if the first part is not a palindrome.

If it is, I might need to adjust the split.

But, based on the earlier reasoning, it should be fine.

Let me think about a potential problematic case.

Take "ababa".

It's a palindrome.

Looking for positions where s[i] != s[i+1]:

- s[0]=a, s[1]=b: a != b, so i=0.

- Split into s[0:2]="ab" and s[2:5]="aba".

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "aba" is a palindrome.

- So, in this case, the second part is a palindrome, which is not allowed.

Hmm, so my earlier approach fails here.

So, I need to adjust my splitting strategy.

In this case, splitting into "ab" and "aba" is not valid because "aba" is a palindrome.

So, I need to find a different way to split.

Is there another way to split "ababa" into non-palindrome substrings?

Let's see:

- Split into "aba" and "ba".

- "aba" is a palindrome.

- "ba" is not a palindrome.

- Not valid.

- Split into "ab" and "aba".

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "aba" is a palindrome.

- Not valid.

- Split into "abab" and "a".

- "abab" is not a palindrome.

- "a" is a palindrome.

- Not valid.

- Split into "ab" and "ab" and "a".

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "ab" is not a palindrome.

- "a" is a palindrome.

- Not valid.

- Split into "aba" and "ba".

- "aba" is a palindrome.

- "ba" is not a palindrome.

- Not valid.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to split "ababa" into non-palindrome substrings.

But, according to my earlier logic, since "ababa" is a palindrome and there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], it should be possible.

But, in this specific case, it's not working.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe "ababa" is a special case where it's impossible, even though there exists a position where s[i] != s[i+1].

Wait, but in "ababa", when I split into "ab" and "aba", "aba" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, maybe I need to split it into more parts.

For example, split "ababa" into "ab", "a", "ba".

But, "a" is a palindrome.

So, not valid.

Alternatively, "aba" and "ba".

But, "aba" is a palindrome.

So, seems like no valid partition exists for "ababa".

But, according to the earlier logic, since "ababa" is a palindrome and contains positions where s[i] != s[i+1], it should be possible.

But, in practice, it's not working.

So, perhaps my approach is incomplete.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if the string is a palindrome and contains at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], then it's possible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

But, perhaps, I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

In the case of "ababa
