Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards for each number i. I can buy up to k new cards, and each new card can have any number from 1 to n. After buying the new cards and arranging all my cards in a line, I need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. Basically, I need to maximize how many times I have a sequence of n cards where each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means. It means that in any sequence of n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once, in any order. So, for n=2, possible permutations are [1,2] and [2,1]. For n=3, it's [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, I need to maximize the number of such subarrays in my arrangement of cards. The key here is that I can arrange the cards in any order I want after buying the new cards. So, I have flexibility in how I arrange them to maximize these permutations.

Let's consider the constraints:

- I have a_i cards for each i initially.

- I can buy up to k new cards, each with any number from 1 to n.

- The total number of cards after buying can be up to the sum of a_i plus k.

I need to maximize the number of n-length subarrays that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I recall that in some problems, to maximize the number of certain patterns, it's useful to think about sliding windows or how to arrange elements to maximize overlaps or occurrences of the desired pattern.

But in this case, since I can arrange the cards in any order, I can think of arranging them in such a way that as many n-length sequences as possible are permutations.

One approach that comes to mind is to try to create as many n-length blocks as possible, each being a permutation, and see how they can be arranged without overlapping unnecessarily.

Wait, but since the subarrays are contiguous and of length n, and they can overlap by n-1 elements, I need to think about how these subarrays overlap.

For example, for n=2:

If I have the array [1,2,1,2], then the subarrays are [1,2] and [2,1], both of which are permutations of [1,2]. So, that's two permutations.

If I have [1,2,3,1,2,3], for n=3, the subarrays are [1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [1,2,3], which are all permutations of [1,2,3].

So, in general, for an array of length L, the number of n-length subarrays is L - n + 1.

But not all of them will be permutations of [1,2,...,n]. I need to maximize how many of them are.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, I need to arrange them in such a way that as many n-length windows as possible are permutations.

I think the way to maximize this is to arrange the cards in a repeating pattern of a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

For example, for n=2, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,1,2,...] would give me multiple subarrays that are permutations.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging them as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...] would give me multiple permutation subarrays.

So, the idea is to arrange the cards in a sequence that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n] as many times as possible.

But I need to consider that I have initial counts a_i for each i, and I can buy up to k additional cards.

So, I need to decide how many cards of each number to buy to maximize the number of these permutation blocks.

Let me think about how many complete permutation blocks I can form.

Each permutation block of n cards requires exactly one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the number of complete blocks I can form is limited by the number of cards of the most constrained number, i.e., the minimum a_i.

Wait, but I can buy additional cards to increase the counts.

So, if I have a_i initial cards for each i, and I can buy up to k additional cards, I need to allocate these k cards to maximize the number of complete permutation blocks.

Each complete block requires one of each number from 1 to n.

So, if I have a_i cards for each i, the number of complete blocks I can form is limited by the smallest a_i.

But I can buy additional cards to increase the a_i's.

So, I need to distribute the k buys among the a_i's to maximize the minimum a_i.

This sounds like a standard problem of maximizing the minimum value by distributing additional resources.

I recall that to maximize the minimum value, I can use a binary search on the possible minimum values and check if I can achieve that minimum with the given k.

Wait, but in this problem, n can be up to 2e5, and t can be up to 100, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5e5, so I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log something).

But maybe there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider that I want to have all a_i at least m, where m is the desired minimum, and I need to spend k coins to buy additional cards.

Each increase in a_i by 1 costs one coin.

So, the total number of coins needed to make all a_i at least m is sum(m - a_i for a_i < m).

I need to find the maximum m such that sum(m - a_i for a_i < m) <= k.

This is a standard binary search problem.

Once I find the maximum m, then I can form m complete permutation blocks.

Each block contributes one permutation subarray at its position.

But wait, in the example provided:

First test case: n=1, k=10, a=[1]. So, I can buy 10 more cards of 1, so total 11 cards of 1. The only possible subarray is [1], and there are 11 of them. So, answer is 11.

Second test case: n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]. So, I have 8 cards of 1 and 4 cards of 2. I can buy 4 more cards, all of which can be 2's, so a becomes [8,8]. Then, I can arrange them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2]. Each pair [1,2] is a permutation. There are 15 such subarrays in an array of length 16 (since 16 - 2 + 1 = 15). The output is 15.

So, in general, if I can make all a_i at least m, then I can form m complete permutation blocks, and the number of n-length subarrays that are permutations would be m * something.

Wait, but in the second example, m=8, and n=2, so m=8, and the array length is 16, and 16 - 2 + 1 = 15, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the first example, m=11, n=1, array length=11, 11 -1 +1=11, which matches.

So, it seems that the number of permutation subarrays is equal to the total number of n-length subarrays in an array of length n*m, which is m*(n - n +1)=m*1=m.

Wait, no, in the second example, m=8, n=2, array length=16, number of subarrays is 15, which is m*(n - n +1)=8*1=8, but it's 15. So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

In the second example, with m=8, and n=2, total cards=16. Number of subarrays of length 2 is 15.

But not all of them are necessarily permutations.

Wait, but if I make a_i=8 for both i=1 and i=2, and arrange them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], then every subarray of length 2 is a permutation.

So, in this arrangement, all 15 subarrays are permutations.

Hence, the maximum score is 15.

Similarly, in the first example, with n=1, m=11, array length=11, and there is only one possible subarray, which is [1], appearing 11 times.

So, the score is 11.

Hence, in general, if I can make all a_i at least m, and arrange the cards in a way that every n-length subarray is a permutation, then the number of such subarrays is (n*m - n +1).

Wait, in the second example, n=2, m=8, n*m=16, 16 -2 +1=15, which matches the output.

In the first example, n=1, m=11, 11 -1 +1=11, which matches.

So, it seems that if I can make all a_i at least m, then the maximum score is n*m - n +1.

Wait, but in the third example, from the output, it's 15 for n=3, m=?

Wait, let's look at the third test case:

3 4

6 1 8

So, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

I can buy 4 cards, probably all of type 2, to make a=[6,5,8]

Then, m=min(6,5,8)=5

Then, total cards=6+5+8=19

Number of subarrays of length 3 is 19-3+1=17

But in the example, the output is 15.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe m is not simply the minimum a_i after buying cards.

Wait, perhaps m is the number of complete blocks of n cards where each number appears exactly once.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of sliding windows.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of permutation subarrays is equal to the number of positions where a window of size n contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

But calculating this directly seems too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Looking back at the problem, I need to maximize the number of n-length subarrays that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, I should arrange them in a way that maximizes the number of such subarrays.

One way to maximize this is to arrange the cards in a sequence that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n] as many times as possible.

For example, for n=2, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,1,2,...], which maximizes the number of [1,2] and [2,1] subarrays.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging them as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...]

In such arrangements, every n-length subarray is a permutation.

Hence, the number of such subarrays is equal to the total length minus n plus one.

So, if I can arrange the cards in such a way that the entire sequence consists of repeated permutation blocks, then the number of permutation subarrays is (total length - n +1).

Now, the question is, given that I can buy up to k additional cards, how long can I make this sequence of repeated permutation blocks?

Each block requires n distinct cards, one of each type.

So, the number of complete blocks I can form is limited by the number of cards of the most constrained type.

Specifically, if I have a_i cards of type i, the number of complete blocks I can form without buying any cards is m = min(a_i).

But I can buy up to k additional cards to increase the a_i's.

I need to maximize m such that sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <= k.

In other words, I need to find the maximum m where the total number of cards I need to buy to make all a_i at least m is at most k.

This can be computed using binary search on m.

Once I find the maximum m, then the total number of permutation subarrays is (n*m - n +1).

Wait, but in the second example, n=2, m=8, total length=16, number of subarrays=16-2+1=15, which matches the output.

In the first example, n=1, m=11, total length=11, number of subarrays=11-1+1=11, which matches.

In the third example, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8].

So, find the maximum m where sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <= k.

So, sum(max(m-6,0) + max(m-1,0) + max(m-8,0)) <=4.

We need to find the maximum m such that this sum is <=4.

Let's try m=5:

max(5-6,0) + max(5-1,0) + max(5-8,0) = 0 +4 +3 =7 >4.

m=4:

0 +3 +2=5 >4.

m=3:

0 +2 +1=3 <=4.

So, m=3.

Then, total length is n*m =3*3=9.

Number of subarrays:9-3+1=7.

But according to the sample output, it's 15.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the third test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8].

According to the sample output, the answer is 15.

If m=5 as in the second example, but earlier calculation showed that for m=5, sum=max(5-6,0)+max(5-1,0)+max(5-8,0)=0+4+3=7>4.

So, m=5 is not achievable with k=4.

But the sample output is 15, which would correspond to m=8, but m=8 would require sum=max(8-6,0)+max(8-1,0)+max(8-8,0)=2+7+0=9>4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe m is not the minimum a_i after buying cards.

Wait, perhaps m is the number of times I can repeat the permutation block.

Wait, but in the second example, m=8, n=2, total cards=16, number of subarrays=15, which matches the output.

But in that case, m=8, which is achievable by buying 4 cards for a_i=2 from initial a=[8,4].

Wait, no, in the second example, a=[8,4], n=2, k=4.

To make m=8, I need to make both a_i >=8.

a1=8, a2=4, so I need to buy 4 cards of type 2 to make a2=8.

Then, total cards=16, number of subarrays=15.

But in the third example, a=[6,1,8], n=3, k=4.

To make m=5, I need a1>=5, a2>=5, a3>=5.

a1=6, a2=1, a3=8.

So, need to buy max(5-6,0) + max(5-1,0) + max(5-8,0)=0+4+0=4 <=k=4.

So, m=5 is achievable.

Then, total cards=n*m=15, number of subarrays=15-3+1=13, but the sample output is 15.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the third example, output is 15, but according to my calculation, m=5, total cards=15, subarrays=13.

But according to the sample output, it's 15.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping.

Wait, no, for a sequence of length L, the number of n-length subarrays is L - n +1.

So, for L=15, n=3, it's 13, but sample output is 15.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some subarrays can be outside the complete blocks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of additional cards beyond the complete blocks.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that I can have incomplete blocks at the ends.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of permutation subarrays by arranging the cards in a way that overlaps the permutation blocks as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to arrange the cards in a way that every n-length window is a permutation, and the array is as long as possible.

So, the maximum array length is limited by the sum of a_i + k.

But I need to maximize the number of n-length subarrays that are permutations.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of positions where a sliding window of size n is a permutation.

This seems to be a maximum sliding window problem, but I need to maximize the count of permutation windows.

But checking each window is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the problem as covering the array with as many n-length permutation blocks as possible, allowing overlaps.

But I need to maximize the number of such blocks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times I can place a permutation block, shifting by 1 each time.

Wait, but that would be the same as L - n +1, where L is the total length.

But earlier calculations don't match the sample outputs.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that in some arrangements, I can have multiple permutation subarrays overlapping.

Wait, but in a sequence like [1,2,1,2], for n=2, I have two permutation subarrays: [1,2] and [2,1].

So, for m blocks, the number of permutation subarrays is m.

But in the second example, m=8, but the number of subarrays is 15.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose I have m complete blocks, each of size n, arranged in a sequence.

Then, the total length is m*n.

The number of n-length subarrays in this sequence is m*n - n +1.

But in reality, for m blocks, overlapping by n-1 elements, the total number of subarrays is m.

Wait, no, for m blocks of size n, overlapping by n-1, the total length is m + (n-1)*(m-1).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the arrangement more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should consider the problem as making the array as long as possible, with as many n-length permutation subarrays as possible.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, I should arrange them to maximize the number of n-length permutation subarrays.

I think the way to do this is to arrange the cards in a sequence that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n] as many times as possible, and then arrange any remaining cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutation subarrays.

So, first, find the maximum number of complete permutation blocks I can form, given the initial a_i and the k buys.

Each complete block requires one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the number of complete blocks is limited by the number of the least available number, after buying additional cards.

This sounds like finding the maximum m such that sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <=k.

This can be computed using binary search on m.

Once I have m, the number of complete permutation blocks is m, and each block contributes one n-length subarray that is a permutation.

But in reality, in the arrangement, each overlapping window could be a permutation.

Wait, for example, in [1,2,1,2], for n=2, there are two permutation subarrays: [1,2] and [2,1].

So, the number of permutation subarrays is m*(n - n +1)=m*1=m, but in this example, it's two, which matches m=2.

Wait, but in the second test case, m=8, n=2, total length=16, number of subarrays=15, but according to this, it should be m=8.

There's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that between the blocks, there can be additional permutation subarrays.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of permutation subarrays is equal to the total number of n-length subarrays in the entire arrangement, which is total_length - n +1, but only if the arrangement is such that as many n-length subarrays as possible are permutations.

But I need to maximize this count.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, I need to arrange them to maximize the number of n-length subarrays that are permutations.

One way to do this is to arrange the cards in a sequence that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n], as much as possible.

In such a sequence, every n-length subarray is a permutation.

So, if I can make the entire sequence consist of such repeating permutations, then the number of permutation subarrays is total_length - n +1.

So, the goal is to make the sequence as long as possible consisting of these repeating permutations.

To do this, I need to have enough cards of each type to form as many permutation blocks as possible.

Each permutation block requires one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the number of complete permutation blocks I can form is limited by the number of the least available number, after buying additional cards.

So, I need to find the maximum m such that sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <=k.

This can be computed using binary search on m.

Once I find m, then the total number of permutation subarrays is (m*n - n +1).

Wait, but in the second example, m=8, n=2, total_length=16, number of subarrays=16-2+1=15, which matches the sample output.

In the first example, m=11, n=1, total_length=11, number of subarrays=11-1+1=11, which matches.

In the third example, m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of subarrays=15-3+1=13, but the sample output is 15.

Wait, discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the number of permutation subarrays is m*(n - n +1)=m*1=m, but in the second example, m=8, and number of subarrays=15, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in addition to the complete blocks, there are overlapping subarrays.

Wait, in the second example, with m=8 and n=2, total_length=16, number of subarrays=15, which is correct because each overlapping pair is a permutation.

So, in general, for a sequence of length L, the number of n-length subarrays is L - n +1.

Hence, if I can make the sequence as long as possible consisting of repeating permutation blocks, then the number of permutation subarrays is L - n +1.

So, my goal is to maximize L, the total number of cards, which is sum(a_i) + k.

But I need to ensure that the arrangement allows as many n-length subarrays as possible to be permutations.

But, in practice, to have every n-length subarray be a permutation, I need to arrange the sequence in a way that each n-length window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

This is similar to arranging the sequence in a de Bruijn sequence or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as arranging the sequence in a way that it's a concatenation of permutation blocks, with overlaps.

Wait, but I need an efficient way to compute the maximum number of permutation subarrays.

Given time constraints, I need a O(n log n) or better solution.

Looking back, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Find the maximum m such that sum(max(m - a_i, 0)) <=k.

- Then, the total number of permutation subarrays is m*(n - n +1)=m*1=m.

But in the second example, m=8, but the number of subarrays is 15, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total length as m*n, and then the number of subarrays is m*n - n +1.

In the second example, m=8, n=2, total_length=16, number of subarrays=15, which matches.

In the first example, m=11, n=1, total_length=11, number of subarrays=11, matches.

In the third example, m=5, n=3, total_length=15, number of subarrays=13, but sample output is 15, so discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust m to make the total number of subarrays as high as possible.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after forming m complete blocks, I can have some additional cards that can form extra subarrays.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

But time is limited, and
