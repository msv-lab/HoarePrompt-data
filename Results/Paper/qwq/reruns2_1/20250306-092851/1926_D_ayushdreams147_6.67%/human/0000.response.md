Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bit values should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Each number is a 32-bit integer, but we're only considering bits from 1 to 31. The 32nd bit is likely the sign bit, but since all numbers are non-negative, I guess it's always 0. But the problem says "from bits 1st to 31st," so maybe we're ignoring the 32nd bit altogether.

Wait, the problem mentions "the 31 least significant bits," so yes, we're considering only the first 31 bits, from bit 1 (least significant) to bit 31.

So, the condition is that in any group, for any two numbers, their bit values differ in every position from 1 to 31. That means, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y must have all bits set in positions 1 to 31. In other words, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1, which is a mask with the first 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, actually, x XOR y should have all bits set in positions where x and y differ. So, if they differ in all positions from 1 to 31, then x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But the condition is stated as x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i) for all 1 ≤ i < 32. So, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits of x and y are different.

This is equivalent to saying that x AND y has no bits set in positions 1 to 31, but that's not quite right. Wait, no, x AND y would have bits set where both x and y have bits set. But if x and y differ in every bit position, then x AND y should be 0 in positions 1 to 31.

Wait, actually, if x and y differ in every bit position from 1 to 31, then for each position i in 1 to 31, if x has bit 0, y has bit 1, or vice versa. So, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Yes, that's correct. So, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But in terms of grouping, what does this mean? We need to group numbers such that any two numbers in the same group satisfy x XOR y = (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, but that seems too specific. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. The condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different. That means x XOR y should have all bits set from 1 to 31.

So, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But wait, consider that (1 << 31) - 1 is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

So, for two numbers x and y, x XOR y should be equal to this mask.

But, in terms of grouping, if I have numbers where x XOR y equals this mask, does that define some kind of equivalence relation?

Wait, no, because equivalence relations are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, and this relation might not satisfy those properties.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can think in terms of graph theory. Each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they can be in the same group, i.e., their XOR is equal to the mask.

But actually, the condition is that in a group, any two numbers must have XOR equal to the mask.

Wait, but that's problematic because if I have three numbers x, y, z in the same group, then x XOR y = mask, y XOR z = mask, then what is x XOR z?

Let's compute: x XOR z = (x XOR y) XOR (y XOR z) = mask XOR mask = 0.

So, x XOR z = 0 implies x = z.

But if x = z, then x XOR y = mask and y XOR x = mask, which implies x = z.

But if x = z, then x XOR z = 0, which is not equal to mask, unless mask is 0.

But mask is (1 << 31) - 1, which is not 0.

So, this suggests that in any group, there can be at most two elements, and they must satisfy x XOR y = mask.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." So, for any two numbers in the same group, their bits from 1 to 31 are all different.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, if x and y are in the same group, then x XOR y = mask, where mask has all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1.

But in the example given, in the second test case, a1=0 and a2=2147483647, which is 111...1 in binary (all 31 bits set), and they can be placed in the same group because for every bit position, a1 and a2 have different bits.

Yes, 0 and 2147483647 differ in all 31 bits.

So, in this case, x XOR y = 2147483647, which is (1 << 31) - 1.

So, the condition is that any two numbers in the same group must have XOR equal to this mask.

But in the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's see their binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

But we need to consider 31 bits, but for simplicity, let's look at these bits.

For example, 1 and 4: 001 and 100. Their XOR is 101, which is 5, not equal to 7 (which would be 111 in 3-bit representation).

Wait, but in 31-bit representation, mask is (1 << 31) - 1, which for 31 bits is all 1's.

But in this 3-bit example, mask would be 7 (111).

But 1 XOR 4 is 5 (101), which is not equal to 7.

So, according to the condition, 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 1 XOR 3 is 2 (010), not equal to 7.

3 XOR 4 is 7 (101 + 011 = 110, which is 6 in decimal, not 7).

Wait, 1 XOR 3 is 2, 4 XOR 3 is 7.

Wait, 4 is 100, 3 is 011, XOR is 111, which is 7.

So, in this case, 4 and 3 can be in the same group, but 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group with any other number.

Wait, but according to the example, in the first test case, the output is 4, meaning each number needs its own group.

But according to the condition, 4 and 3 can be in the same group because their XOR is 7, which is the mask for 3-bit representation.

But in the problem, it's 31 bits, so mask is (1 << 31) - 1.

But in this small example, it's considering only 3 bits.

Wait, perhaps in the first test case, the numbers are such that no two numbers satisfy the condition to be in the same group, hence each number needs its own group.

But according to my earlier reasoning, 4 and 3 should be able to be in the same group because their XOR is 7, which is the mask for 3 bits.

But perhaps in the full 31-bit representation, their XOR is not equal to the mask.

Wait, in the problem, it's 31 bits, so we need to consider all 31 bits.

In the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Assuming these are 31-bit integers, their higher bits are all 0's.

So, 1 is 000...001, 4 is 000...0100, 3 is 000...0011, and 4 is again 000...0100.

So, 4 XOR 3 is 000...0111, which is 7, which is the mask for the first 3 bits, but in 31 bits, mask is (1 << 31) - 1, which is all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, but in this case, 4 XOR 3 is only 000...0111, which is not equal to the mask (1 << 31) - 1.

So, in 31-bit representation, 4 XOR 3 is not equal to the mask, because only the first 3 bits are set, not all 31 bits.

Therefore, 4 and 3 cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number needs its own group, which matches the first test case output of 4.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, to generalize, two numbers can be in the same group if their XOR is equal to the mask, which is (1 << 31) - 1.

But in the first test case, 4 XOR 3 is not equal to the mask, because the higher bits are not set.

Hence, they cannot be in the same group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647, their XOR is 2147483647, which is equal to the mask, so they can be in the same group.

So, the minimal number of groups is 1 for the second test case.

Okay, now, how do I find the minimal number of groups required for each test case?

I need to group numbers such that any two numbers in the same group have their XOR equal to the mask.

This sounds like finding the number of maximal cliques in a graph where edges represent the condition that two numbers can be in the same group.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of equivalence classes.

If I can define an equivalence relation where two numbers are equivalent if they can be in the same group, then the number of groups would be the number of equivalence classes.

But the relation "can be in the same group" needs to be an equivalence relation: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Reflexivity: A number x and itself, x XOR x = 0, which is not equal to the mask, unless mask is 0, which it's not.

Wait, but the condition is that for any pair of numbers in the group, their XOR equals the mask.

But for a single number, there are no pairs, so each number can be in its own group.

But that would lead to each number being in its own group, which is not necessarily minimal.

Wait, in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group, so the minimal number of groups is 1.

So, it's not always the case that each number needs its own group.

So, perhaps I need to find the maximal set of numbers where any two numbers have XOR equal to the mask.

But is this relation transitive?

Let's see: if x can be with y, and y can be with z, does that mean x can be with z?

From earlier, if x XOR y = mask and y XOR z = mask, then x XOR z = 0, which means x = z.

So, in this case, the only way for three numbers to be in the same group is if x = z.

Therefore, groups can have at most two elements: x and y, where x XOR y = mask.

Hence, it's a matching problem, where each group can have at most two numbers that XOR to the mask.

So, the minimal number of groups is ceil(n / 2), but considering that some numbers cannot be paired.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, and the output is 4, which is not ceil(4/2)=2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, with numbers 1,4,3,4.

As we saw earlier, no two numbers can be paired together because their XOR is not equal to the mask.

Hence, each number must be in its own group, so 4 groups.

In the second test case, n=2, with numbers 0 and 2147483647, which can be in the same group, so only 1 group.

In the third test case, n=5, and the output is 3, meaning three groups: some groups have two numbers, and one group has one number.

So, it's not just ceil(n/2), but rather it depends on how many pairs we can form.

So, it's more about finding the maximum matching in a graph where edges represent the condition that two numbers can be paired together.

In graph theory terms, this is similar to finding a matching that covers as many nodes as possible, and the minimal number of groups would be ceil((n - m)/2 + m), where m is the number of pairs.

Wait, more carefully: the minimal number of groups is ceil(n - m), where m is the number of pairs.

Wait, actually, it's n - m, where m is the number of pairs, because each pair reduces the number of groups by one.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have m pairs, then I have m groups of 2, and then n - 2m numbers left, each in their own group.

So, total groups are m + (n - 2m) = n - m.

Hence, to minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize m, the number of pairs.

So, the minimal number of groups is n - floor(n/2), but that's not correct in all cases, as per the first test case.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, and output is 4, which would mean m=0 pairs.

In the second test case, n=2, output=1, which is 2 - 1 =1, so m=1.

In the third test case, n=5, output=3, which is 5 - 2=3, so m=2.

So, it seems that the minimal number of groups is n - m, where m is the maximal number of pairs that can be formed where each pair has XOR equal to the mask.

Hence, the problem reduces to finding the maximal matching in a graph where nodes are the numbers and edges exist between numbers that XOR to the mask.

In this case, since the mask is fixed, we can find for each number, the number it needs to be paired with is unique: it's number XOR mask.

So, for each number x, its potential pair is y = x XOR mask.

So, we can group the numbers into pairs where x and y = x XOR mask are both present.

Any number that doesn't have its pair present will need its own group.

Hence, we can iterate through the numbers, group them into pairs where possible, and count the number of such pairs.

The minimal number of groups is then n minus the number of pairs.

Wait, no, it's n minus the number of pairs, because each pair reduces the number of groups by one.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, and m=0 pairs, so groups=4-0=4, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=2, m=1 pair, groups=2-1=1, which matches.

In the third test case, n=5, m=2 pairs, groups=5-2=3, which matches.

So, this seems correct.

Hence, the approach is:

- Define mask = (1 << 31) - 1

- For each number x, its pair is y = x XOR mask

- Count how many such pairs can be formed

- The minimal number of groups is n minus the number of pairs

To implement this efficiently, we can use a frequency count:

- Create a frequency dictionary count

- For each number x in the list:

- If x is already in count and count[x] > 0:

- Decrement count[x]

- Increment the number of pairs

- Else:

- Set count[y] = count.get(y, 0) + 1, where y = x XOR mask

- After processing all numbers, the minimal number of groups is n minus the number of pairs

Wait, but in the first test case, for x=1, y=1 XOR mask

Similarly for x=4, y=4 XOR mask, and so on.

But in that test case, no two numbers XOR to the mask, so no pairs are formed, and each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are pairs, so one group.

In the third test case, depending on the numbers, some can form pairs, reducing the number of groups.

This seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

return res

So, in func_1:

- Initialize res = 0

- Initialize an empty dictionary count

- For each number num in a:

- If num is not in count:

- Increment count of (num XOR mask) by 1

- Increment res by 1

- Else:

- Decrement count of num by 1

- Return res

Wait, this seems similar to what I thought, but not exactly.

In my approach, I thought of counting pairs, but in this code, it's counting the number of single numbers that don't have their pair.

Let me see.

mask = (1 << 31) - 1

For each num:

if num not in count:

count[num XOR mask] += 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

So, when num is not in count, it adds num XOR mask to count and increments res.

When num is in count, it decrements count[num].

Wait, but in my approach, when a number has its pair, they form a pair and reduce the group count.

But in this code, when num is in count, it means its pair was previously added, so it decrements the count.

Wait, perhaps the logic is:

- For each num, check if its pair (num XOR mask) has been seen before.

- If not, mark that the pair is expected by adding count[num XOR mask] +=1 and increment res.

- If the pair has been seen before (i.e., num is in count and count[num] > 0), then decrement count[num] and do not increment res, meaning this num pairs with its counterpart.

Hence, res counts the number of unpaired numbers plus the number of expected pairs.

Wait, but in the first test case, all numbers are unpaired, so res should be 4, which matches the output.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are pairs, so res should be 0, but according to the code, it would be 1.

Wait, let's simulate it.

Test case 1:

n=4

a=[1,4,3,4]

mask=(1<<31)-1

count={}

Process 1:

1 not in count, so count[1 XOR mask] +=1, res +=1

count[(1 XOR mask)] =1, res=1

Process 4:

4 not in count, so count[4 XOR mask] +=1, res +=1

count[(4 XOR mask)] =1, res=2

Process 3:

3 not in count, so count[3 XOR mask] +=1, res +=1

count[(3 XOR mask)] =1, res=3

Process 4:

4 in count, so count[4] -=1

count[4 XOR mask] =1 -1=0, res=3

But the output should be 4, not 3. Wait, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Let me look again.

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

return res

So, in the first test case:

n=4

a=[1,4,3,4]

mask=(1<<31)-1

count={}

Process 1:

1 not in count, so count[1 XOR mask] =1, res=1

count={1 XOR mask:1}

Process 4:

4 not in count, so count[4 XOR mask] =1, res=2

count={1 XOR mask:1, 4 XOR mask:1}

Process 3:

3 not in count, so count[3 XOR mask] =1, res=3

count={1 XOR mask:1, 4 XOR mask:1, 3 XOR mask:1}

Process 4:

4 in count, so count[4] -=1

But count[4] was not set yet, only count[4 XOR mask] was set earlier.

Wait, count[4] is not in count, because we only have count[1 XOR mask], count[4 XOR mask], count[3 XOR mask].

Wait, perhaps I need to understand that count stores the expected pairs.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that count stores the number of expected pairs.

Wait, perhaps res counts the number of groups needed, which is the number of unpaired numbers.

Wait, but in the first test case, it should be 4, meaning all numbers are unpaired.

In the second test case
