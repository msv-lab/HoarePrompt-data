Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. Each test case starts with three integers: n, k, and x. n is the number of elements in the array, k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. Then, there's a list of n integers, which is the array they're working with.

The problem says that Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it, and they both play optimally. So, I need to consider their strategies in sequence: Alice goes first, then Bob.

Let me think about Alice's move. Alice can remove up to k elements from the array. Since she wants to maximize the sum, she should remove the elements that are least beneficial. But wait, since Bob will be multiplying some elements by -1 later, I need to consider how her removals affect Bob's potential moves.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the sum, and he does this by multiplying up to x elements by -1. So, he'll choose the elements that, when multiplied by -1, result in the greatest decrease in the total sum.

This seems like a two-player game where each player makes decisions that affect the outcome based on the other's actions.

To approach this, maybe I can think about the array and the possible operations step by step.

First, Alice removes up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove elements that would allow Bob to do the least damage with his multiplications.

Wait, but if she removes elements, she's reducing the pool that Bob can choose from for his multiplications.

So, perhaps she should remove the smallest elements, so that Bob has fewer low-value elements to multiply by -1, which would turn them into positive values.

But, on the other hand, if she removes positive elements, Bob might not have as much impact, but the total sum would decrease.

This is a bit tricky.

Maybe I should consider different scenarios.

Let me consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will multiply up to x elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

So, Bob will choose the x largest positive elements and multiply them by -1, because that would reduce the sum the most.

Wait, but he can only choose up to x elements.

But, if there are negative elements left, multiplying them by -1 would make them positive, increasing the sum, which is not what Bob wants. So, Bob would only want to multiply positive elements by -1, to make them negative and decrease the sum.

Therefore, Bob will target the largest positive elements to multiply by -1.

So, Alice needs to consider this and decide which elements to remove to minimize the impact of Bob's action.

Maybe Alice should remove the largest positive elements, so that Bob has fewer large positive elements to multiply by -1.

But, if she removes too many large positives, the sum would decrease, which is not what she wants.

Wait, Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's move.

So, she needs to balance between keeping large positive elements and removing some to limit Bob's ability to decrease the sum.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I can think in terms of sorting the array and then deciding which elements to remove and which to allow Bob to multiply.

Let me think about sorting the array in descending order.

So, the largest elements are first.

Then, Alice can choose to remove the last k elements, which are the smallest.

But, if she removes the smallest elements, Bob can still multiply the largest positives by -1.

Alternatively, maybe Alice should remove some of the largest positives to prevent Bob from multiplying them by -1.

But, that would decrease the total sum.

Wait, maybe Alice should remove the elements that would cause the least decrease in the sum while limiting Bob's ability to decrease it further.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to look at it differently.

Let me consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will multiply the top x positive elements by -1.

So, Alice needs to ensure that after her removals, the sum minus twice the sum of the top x positive elements is maximized.

Wait, why twice?

Because multiplying by -1 changes their contribution from positive to negative, so their net effect on the sum is minus two times their original value.

So, the sum after Bob's move would be the current sum minus twice the sum of the x largest positive elements remaining after Alice's removals.

Therefore, Alice wants to maximize sum - 2 * sum_of_top_x_positives.

So, to maximize this, she needs to minimize sum_of_top_x_positives.

Wait, but sum - 2 * sum_of_top_x_positives.

So, to maximize this, she needs to minimize sum_of_top_x_positives.

Wait, no.

Let's see: sum - 2 * sum_of_top_x_positives.

To maximize this expression, she needs to make sum as large as possible and sum_of_top_x_positives as small as possible.

But sum is the sum of the remaining elements after her removals, so she wants to maximize that.

Meanwhile, sum_of_top_x_positives are the x largest positives in the remaining elements.

So, she needs to balance between keeping the sum large and making the sum_of_top_x_positives small.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider different scenarios.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest elements, then the sum remains large, but Bob can multiply the largest positives by -1, which would decrease the sum significantly.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some of the largest positives, the sum decreases, but Bob has fewer large positives to multiply by -1, so perhaps the decrease is less.

I need to find a balance where the sum is maximized minus twice the sum of the top x positives.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over the possible number of elements Alice removes and compute the sum for each case.

So, Alice can remove 0 to k elements.

For each possible number of removals, i, where i ranges from 0 to k, I can compute the sum after removing the smallest i elements, and then subtract twice the sum of the top x positives among the remaining elements.

Then, I can choose the maximum among these values.

That seems like a possible approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given the array a of n elements, sorted in descending order.

For each i from 0 to k:

remaining = a[i:n]

sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n])

top_x_positives = sum of the first x elements in remaining

sum_after_bob = sum_remaining - 2 * top_x_positives

Then, the overall sum is the maximum over all i of sum_after_bob.

Wait, but in this case, I need to sort the array in descending order to easily pick the top x positives.

Wait, actually, in Python, list indices start from 0, so a[0] would be the largest if sorted in descending order.

So, for i from 0 to k:

remaining = a[i:n]

sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n])

top_x_positives = sum(a[i:i+x])

sum_after_bob = sum_remaining - 2 * top_x_positives

Then, the overall sum is the maximum over i of sum_after_bob.

This seems efficient.

Moreover, since the array is sorted in descending order, the top x positives are the first x elements.

Wait, but I need to make sure that x does not exceed the number of remaining elements.

So, I need to handle cases where x > n - i, in which case top_x_positives would be the sum of all remaining elements.

So, I need to set top_x_positives = sum(a[i:min(i+x, n)])

Wait, but in code, I need to handle that min(i+x, n).

Also, if i + x > n, then top_x_positives = sum(a[i:n])

Okay, I think I have a plan.

I can sort the array in descending order, then for each possible i from 0 to k, compute sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n]) and top_x_positives = sum(a[i:min(i+x, n)]), then sum_after_bob = sum_remaining - 2 * top_x_positives.

Then, take the maximum over all i of sum_after_bob.

That should give me the answer.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

First test case:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1]

Sort a in descending order: [1]

Now, for i from 0 to 1:

i=0:

remaining = a[0:1] = [1]

sum_remaining = 1

top_x_positives = a[0:1] = [1], sum=1

sum_after_bob = 1 - 2*1 = -1

i=1:

remaining = a[1:1] = []

sum_remaining = 0

top_x_positives = sum(a[1:min(1+1,1)] = a[1:1] = []) = 0

sum_after_bob = 0 - 2*0 = 0

So, maximum is max(-1, 0) = 0

Which matches the first output in the sample.

Good.

Second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Sort descending: [4,3,2,1]

For i from 0 to 1:

i=0:

remaining = [4,3,2,1]

sum_remaining = 4+3+2+1=10

top_x_positives = a[0:1] = [4], sum=4

sum_after_bob = 10 - 2*4 = 2

i=1:

remaining = a[1:4] = [3,2,1], sum=6

top_x_positives = a[1:2] = [3], sum=3

sum_after_bob = 6 - 2*3 = 0

Maximum is max(2,0) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Third test case:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Sort descending: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

For i from 0 to 6:

i=0:

sum_remaining = 6+5+4+3+2+1=21

top_x_positives = a[0:3] = [6,5,4], sum=15

sum_after_bob = 21 - 2*15 = -9

i=1:

sum_remaining = 5+4+3+2+1=15

top_x_positives = a[1:4] = [5,4,3], sum=12

sum_after_bob = 15 - 2*12 = -9

i=2:

sum_remaining = 4+3+2+1=10

top_x_positives = a[2:5] = [4,3,2], sum=9

sum_after_bob = 10 - 2*9 = -8

i=3:

sum_remaining = 3+2+1=6

top_x_positives = a[3:6] = [3,2,1], sum=6

sum_after_bob = 6 - 2*6 = -6

i=4:

sum_remaining = 2+1=3

top_x_positives = a[4:5] = [2], sum=2

sum_after_bob = 3 - 2*2 = -1

i=5:

sum_remaining = 1

top_x_positives = a[5:6] = [1], sum=1

sum_after_bob = 1 - 2*1 = -1

i=6:

sum_remaining = 0

top_x_positives = 0

sum_after_bob = 0 - 0 = 0

Maximum is 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Wait, but in the sample output for this test case, it's 0, but according to my calculation, it's 0, which matches.

Wait, no, in the sample output, it's 0, but according to my earlier reasoning, it's 0, which matches.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's 6 6 3, and the array is 1 4 3 2 5 6, and the output is 0.

Yes, matches.

Okay, seems correct.

So, this seems like a valid approach.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4

- n <= 2*10^5

- sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

So, I need an efficient solution, O(n log n) per test case should be acceptable, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is 2*10^5.

So, overall time complexity should be O(n log n) total.

Therefore, sorting the array once per test case is acceptable.

Now, in the code provided, it seems to implement this approach.

Let's look at the code.

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

product = func_2(k, x, a)

print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):

pos = []

s = sum(elements)

pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])

s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])

for i in range(1, removals + 1):

s -= elements[-i]

s2 -= elements[-i]

if negatives + i <= len(elements):

s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

return max(pos)

First, in func_1(), it reads t, then for each test case, reads n, k, x, reads the array a, sorts it, and calls func_2.

In func_2, it initializes pos as an empty list, computes s as sum of elements, and appends s - 2 * sum of the last x elements.

Wait, but in the code, it's sum(elements[-negatives:]), which, since a is sorted in ascending order, elements[-negatives:] are the largest elements.

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, I sorted the array in descending order.

In the code, a.sort() sorts in ascending order.

So, elements[-negatives:] are the largest elements.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I sorted in descending order, so a[0:x] would be the largest elements.

In the code, since it's sorted in ascending order, elements[-negatives:] are the largest.

So, s is sum of all elements.

Then, pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))

Which is sum - 2 * sum of top x positives.

Then, s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])

Then, for i in range(1, removals + 1):

s -= elements[-i]

s2 -= elements[-i]

if negatives + i <= len(elements):

s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

return max(pos)

So, it seems to be implementing the approach I described, but with a.sort() in ascending order.

Wait, but in my approach, I sorted in descending order.

In the code, since a.sort() sorts in ascending order, elements[-negatives:] are the largest elements.

So, it seems consistent.

Let me verify with the first test case.

n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1]

a.sort() -> [1]

s = 1

pos.append(1 - 2*1 = -1)

Then, s2 = 1

for i=1:

s -= elements[-1] = 1, s=0

s2 -= elements[-1] = 1, s2=0

negatives + i = 1 + 1 = 2 > len(elements)=1, so no s2 += elements[-2], which would be out of range.

pos.append(0 - 2*0 = 0)

Then, pos = [-1, 0], max is 0, which matches.

Good.

Second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4]

a.sort() -> [1,2,3,4]

s = 1+2+3+4=10

pos.append(10 - 2*(4)=10-8=2)

s2 = 4

for i=1:

s -= elements[-1]=4, s=6

s2 -=4, s2=0

negatives + i =1+1=2 <=4, s2 += elements[-2]=3, s2=3

pos.append(6 - 2*3 = 0)

max(pos)=max[2,0]=2, matches sample output.

Good.

Third test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3, a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

a.sort() -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

s=1+2+3+4+5+6=21

pos.append(21 - 2*(6+5+4)=21-18=3)

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, it was 21 - 2*15= -9.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, no, in the code, sum(elements[-negatives:]) is sum of the last x elements, which are [4,5,6], sum=15, so 21 - 2*15 = -9.

But in my earlier manual calculation, I had sum_remaining = 21, top_x_positives = 15, sum_after_bob = 21 - 2*15 = -9.

But in the code, it's pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])), which is 21 - 2*15 = -9.

Then, for i=1:

s -= elements[-1]=6, s=15

s2 -=6, s2=15-6=9

negatives + i=3+1=4 <=6, s2 += elements[-4]=3, s2=9+3=12

pos.append(15 - 2*12 = -9)

i=2:

s -= elements[-2]=5, s=10

s2 -=5, s2=12-5=7

negatives + i=3+2=5 <=6, s2 += elements[-5]=2, s2=7+2=9

pos.append(10 - 2*9 = -8)

i=3:

s -= elements[-3]=4, s=6

s2 -=4, s2=9-4=5

negatives + i=3+3=6 <=6, s2 += elements[-6]=1, s2=5+1=6

pos.append(6 - 2*6 = -6)

i=4:

s -= elements[-4]=3, s=3

s2 -=3, s2=6-3=3

negatives + i=3+4=7 >6, so no addition

pos.append(3 - 2*3 = -3)

i=5:

s -= elements[-5]=2, s=1

s2 -=2, s2=3-2=1

negatives + i=3+5=8 >6, no addition

pos.append(1 - 2*1 = -1)

i=6:

s -= elements[-6]=1, s=0

s2 -=1, s2=1-1=0

negatives + i=3+6=9 >6, no addition

pos.append(0 - 2*0 = 0)

So, pos = [-9, -9, -8, -6, -3, -1, 0], max is 0, which matches the sample output.

Wait, in my earlier manual calculation, I had sum_after_bob for i=0 to 6 as -9, -9, -8, -6, -1, -1, 0, and max is 0.

Yes, matches.

So, the code seems correct.

But in my earlier reasoning, I had sum_after_bob for i=0 to 6 as -9, -9, -8, -6, -1, -1, 0, but in the code, it's pos.append(s - 2 * s2), and s2 is being updated in a different way.

Wait, in the code, s2 starts as sum of the last x elements, then for each removal, s2 -= elements[-i], and if negatives + i <= n, s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

Wait, in my earlier manual calculation, I had sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n]), top_x_positives = sum(a[i:i+x])

But in the code, it's maintaining s and s2 in a different way.

Wait, perhaps it's an optimized way to compute sum_remaining - 2 * sum_of_top_x_positives for each i.

I need to verify if this is correctly implemented.

Let me check for i=0:

s = sum(a), s2 = sum(a[-x:])

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

Which is sum - 2 * sum of top x positives.

Then, for i=1:

s -= a[-1]

s2 -= a[-1]

if x + 1 <= n:

s2 += a[-(x + 1)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

This seems like it's updating s and s2 as if removing the largest element.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, for each i, sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n]), top_x_positives = sum(a[i:i+x])

But in the code, it's updating s and s2 by subtracting a[-i] each time.

Wait, perhaps it's maintaining s as sum(a[i:n]) and s2 as sum of the top x positives in a[i:n].

But I need to verify if s2 is correctly updated.

Wait, maybe it's using a sliding window approach to update s and s2 efficiently.

Let me consider what s and s2 represent at each step.

Initially, i=0:

s = sum(a[0:n])

s2 = sum(a[-x:])

Which are the top x positives.

Then, for i=1:

s -= a[-1]

Because a[-1] is the largest element, which is being potentially removed.

s2 -= a[-1]

Because a[-1] was part of the top x positives.

If x + i <= n, which is x + 1 <= n, then s2 += a[-(x + i)]

Which is a[-(x + 1)], which is the next element in the sorted list.

Wait, in the sorted ascending list, a[-(x + 1)] is smaller than a[-x].

So, as i increases, s2 is reduced by the removed element and possibly added the next element in the top x.

Wait, this seems like a way to maintain s2 as the sum of the top x positives after removing i elements.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me check with the third test case.

n=6, k=6, x=3, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

sorted a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

i=0:

s=21, s2=15 (sum of [4,5,6])

pos.append(21 - 30 = -9)

i=1:

s=21 - 6 = 15

s2=15 - 6 =9

since 3+1=4 <=6, s2 += a[-4]=3, s2=12

pos.append(15 - 24 = -9)

i=2:

s=15 - 5 =10

s2=12 -5 =7

3+2=5 <=6, s2 += a[-5]=2, s2=9

pos.append(10 - 18 = -8)

i=3:

s=10 -4=6

s2=9-4=5

3+3=6 <=6, s2 += a[-6]=1, s2=6

pos.append(6 - 12 = -6)

i=4:

s=6-3=3

s2=6-3=3

3+4=7 >6, no addition

pos.append(3 - 6 = -3)

i=5:

s=3-2=1

s2=3-2=1

3+5=8 >6, no addition

pos.append(1 - 2 = -1)

i=6:

s=1-1=0

s2=1-1=0

3+6=9 >6, no addition

pos.append(0 - 0 =0)

So, pos = [-9,-9,-8,-6,-3,-1,0], max is 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2, x=1

a=[4,3]

sorted a=[3,4]

sum s=7

s2=sum(a[-1:])=4

pos.append(7 - 8 = -1)

i=1:

s=7-4=3

s2=4-4=0

x+i=1+1=2 <=2, s2 += a[-2]=3, s2=3

pos.append(3 - 6 = -3)

i=2:

s=3-3=0

s2=3-3=0

x+i=1+2=3 >2, no addition

pos.append(0 - 0 =0)

So, pos = [-1,-3,0], max is 0.

Which should be correct.

Wait, but in the sample input, for this test case, the output is 0.

Yes, matches.

Another test case:

n=2, k=1, x=2

a=[1,3]

sorted a=[1,3]

sum s=4

s2=sum(a[-2:])=1+3=4

pos.append(4 - 8 = -4)

i=1:

s=4-3=1

s2=4-3=1

x+i=2+1=3 >2, no addition

pos.append(1 - 2*1 = -1)

So, pos = [-4,-1], max is -1, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's -1 for this test case.

Yes, matches.

So, seems correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See explanation for the solution code.}} \]

**Correctness: True**
