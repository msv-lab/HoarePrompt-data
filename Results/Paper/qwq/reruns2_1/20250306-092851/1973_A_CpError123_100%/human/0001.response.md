Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are three friends playing chess, and in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario isn't possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's possible given the scores. Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order, which might help in simplifying the problem.

Let's think about how points are awarded:

- In a win-lose game: one player gets 2 points, the other gets 0.

- In a draw: both players get 1 point each.

So, for each game played, the total points distributed are either 2 (in case of a win-lose) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, that's interesting. In both cases, the total points per game are 2. So, the total points across all games should be twice the number of games played.

Let's denote the total points as p1 + p2 + p3. Since each game contributes 2 points to the total, the total number of games, say g, should satisfy:

p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g

This means that the total points must be even; otherwise, it's impossible. So, if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, I should immediately return -1.

Okay, that's one condition.

Now, assuming p1 + p2 + p3 is even, I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

Let's think about what a draw implies. Each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point each. So, for d draws, that accounts for 2d points distributed (since each draw gives 1 point to each of the two players).

The remaining games are win-lose games, which also contribute 2 points per game, but in a different way: 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

Let’s denote:

- d = number of draws

- w = number of win-lose games

Then, total games g = d + w

And total points: 2d (from draws) + 2w (from win-lose games) = 2(g) = p1 + p2 + p3

Wait, but this seems consistent with what I said earlier.

But I need to maximize d, the number of draws.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

What constraints do I have on w?

Well, the distribution of points must match p1, p2, p3.

Let’s think about it differently.

Suppose I have d draws and w win-lose games.

Each draw involves two players, and each win-lose game also involves two players.

But the same pair can play multiple times.

Wait, but the problem says that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times, including zero, and it's also possible that no games were played at all.

So, any two players can play multiple games against each other.

Given that, I need to distribute the total points in such a way that the sum of points for each player matches p1, p2, p3.

Let me consider the possible pairs:

There are three players, so there are three possible pairs:

- Player 1 vs Player 2

- Player 1 vs Player 3

- Player 2 vs Player 3

Each pair can play multiple games.

In each game between two players, points are awarded as per the rules.

I need to find a combination of games between these pairs that results in the total points p1, p2, p3.

And among all possible valid combinations, I need to find the one with the maximum number of draws.

Alternatively, I need to maximize the number of draws d, given that the total points are p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(g) = 2(d + w).

But I need to ensure that the individual scores p1, p2, p3 can be achieved through some combination of draws and win-lose games.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider the total points again.

Since each game contributes exactly 2 points, the total number of games is g = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

As I thought earlier, if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, it's impossible, so return -1.

Assuming p1 + p2 + p3 is even, g = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, I need to maximize the number of draws d.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total (1 point to each player involved in the draw).

Each win-lose game also contributes 2 points to the total (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

But in terms of individual scores, draws affect the scores differently than win-lose games.

Let’s think about the constraints on individual scores.

For player 1, their total score is p1.

Similarly for player 2 and player 3.

I need to make sure that the sum of points from all games involving a particular player matches their total score.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe I can look for some inequalities or conditions that must hold for the scores to be achievable.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, perhaps there are some bounds on p1, p2, and p3 for the scenario to be possible.

Let’s consider some examples from the sample input.

First sample input:

0 0 0

Here, no games were played, so no draws, output 0.

Second sample input:

0 1 1

Total points: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, which is even. g = 1 game.

Possible scenarios:

- One game between player 2 and player 3, which ended in a draw. So, both get 1 point each.

- Or, one game between player 1 and player 2, where player 2 wins and gets 2 points, but then player 3 has 0 points, which doesn't match.

- Similarly, one game between player 1 and player 3, where player 3 wins and gets 2 points, but then player 2 has 0 points, which doesn't match.

- Or, one game between player 2 and player 3, where one wins and the other loses, but that would result in scores like 0,2,1 or 0,1,2, which don't match 0,1,1.

Wait, actually, if player 2 and player 3 play a draw, both get 1 point each, and player 1 has 0 points, which matches the input.

So, in this case, there was one draw, and the answer is 1.

Third sample input:

1 1 1

Total points: 3, which is odd. So, impossible, output -1.

Fourth sample input:

1 1 2

Total points: 4, which is even. g = 2 games.

Possible scenarios:

- Two games between player 2 and player 3:

  - Both draws: scores would be 1+1=2, 1+1=2, but player 1 has 0, which doesn't match.

  - One draw and one win-lose:

    - Draw: player 2 and player 3 get 1 each.

    - Win-lose: player 2 wins against player 3: player 2 gets 2, player 3 gets 0.

      So, total scores: player 2: 1+2=3, player 3:1+0=1, player 1:0.

      Doesn't match.

    - Draw: player 2 and player 3 get 1 each.

    - Win-lose: player 3 wins against player 2: player 3 gets 2, player 2 gets 0.

      Total scores: player 2:1+0=1, player 3:1+2=3, player 1:0.

      Doesn't match.

  - Two win-lose games:

    - Player 2 wins against player 3: player 2:2, player 3:0.

    - Player 2 wins against player 3 again: player 2:4, player 3:0.

      Doesn't match.

    - Other combinations won't match either.

- Games between different pairs:

  - One game between player 1 and player 2:

    - Draw: player 1:1, player 2:1.

    - Win-lose: player 1 wins: player 1:2, player 2:0; or player 2 wins: player 2:2, player 1:0.

  - One game between player 1 and player 3:

    - Draw: player 1:1, player 3:1.

    - Win-lose: player 1 wins: player 1:2, player 3:0; or player 3 wins: player 3:2, player 1:0.

  - And so on.

It seems complicated to manually check all possibilities.

I need a better approach.

Let’s consider the total points again.

Total points = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g, where g is the total number of games.

In terms of individual scores, each player's score comes from the games they played.

Let’s denote:

- Let’s say player 1 and player 2 played g12 games.

- Player 1 and player 3 played g13 games.

- Player 2 and player 3 played g23 games.

Total games: g = g12 + g13 + g23.

Now, for each pair, in each game, it can be either a draw or a win-lose.

Let’s denote:

- For pair 1-2: d12 draws and w12 win-lose games, with d12 + w12 = g12.

- Similarly for other pairs.

Then, the total points for player 1 would be:

- From games against player 2: d12*1 + w12*(2 if player 1 wins or 0 if player 2 wins).

- From games against player 3: d13*1 + w13*(2 if player 1 wins or 0 if player 3 wins).

Similarly for other players.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for some inequalities.

Let’s consider the maximum possible score for the highest scoring player.

Since in each game a player can get at most 2 points, the maximum possible score for any player is 2 times the number of games they played.

But tracking individual games is getting too complicated.

Let’s think differently.

Suppose I want to maximize the number of draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, and involves two players.

So, to maximize draws, I need to maximize the number of times two players can agree to a draw without exceeding their total scores.

But I need to ensure that the sum of points for each player matches p1, p2, p3.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a system of equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let’s say there are d12 draws between player 1 and player 2.

- d13 draws between player 1 and player 3.

- d23 draws between player 2 and player 3.

Similarly, let’s denote:

- w12_win1: number of times player 1 wins against player 2.

- w12_win2: number of times player 2 wins against player 1.

- Similarly for other pairs.

Then, the total points for each player can be expressed as:

p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*(w12_win1 + w13_win1)

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*(w12_win2 + w23_win2)

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*(w13_win3 + w23_win3)

This seems too many variables.

Maybe I can find a way to express this with fewer variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum and difference of scores.

Wait, maybe I can look for some bounds.

Let’s consider that in order to maximize draws, I need as many games as possible to be draws.

But I need to make sure that the points add up correctly.

Let’s consider the minimal number of win-lose games needed to make the scores work.

In other words, minimize w (the number of win-lose games), which would maximize d (the number of draws).

So, how do I minimize w?

I need to see if the scores can be achieved with only draws, and if not, find out how many win-lose games are needed.

Let’s consider that in all draws, each participating player gets 1 point.

So, if all games are draws, then each player's score would be equal to the number of games they played.

Wait, but in all draws, each player gets 1 point per draw they participated in.

But since each draw involves two players, the total points from draws would be twice the number of draws.

Wait, no.

Each draw involves two players, and each of them gets 1 point, so total points from draws would be 2*d, where d is the number of draws.

Similarly, each win-lose game contributes 2 points, either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser.

So, total points is 2*(d + w), where d is number of draws and w is number of win-lose games.

But I already have that.

Now, to maximize d, I need to minimize w.

So, what's the minimal number of win-lose games needed to achieve the scores?

Let’s consider that in draws, both players get 1 point each, whereas in win-lose games, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

So, the difference in scores can only be achieved through win-lose games.

Wait, that might be a key insight.

Let’s think about the differences in scores.

Suppose all games were draws, then all players would have the same number of points, equal to the number of games they participated in.

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and likely p3 > p1 in some cases, I need to account for the differences through win-lose games.

Each win-lose game can create a difference of 2 points between the winner and the loser.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total difference in scores.

Let’s calculate the total difference from the average.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let’s try to find a formula or a way to compute the minimal number of win-lose games needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the minimal number of win-lose games needed to achieve the score differences.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the sum of p1, p2, p3 is 2*(d + w), and I need to maximize d.

But I need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved.

Let’s consider that in draws, both players get 1 point each, and in win-lose games, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

So, for each draw, the two players involved get 1 point each.

For each win-lose game, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

So, the total points are distributed accordingly.

I need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of win-lose games.

To minimize the number of win-lose games, I need to maximize the points that can be achieved through draws.

Wait, but draws give 1 point per player per draw, so the maximum points from draws would be equal to the sum of the minimum number of draws each player can participate in.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let’s look at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

Sample Input 1:

0 0 0

Total points: 0, which is even. So, g = 0 games, and d = 0 draws.

Output: 0

Sample Input 2:

0 1 1

Total points: 2, which is even. g = 1 game.

Possible scenario: one draw between player 2 and 3, both get 1 point each.

So, d = 1 draw.

Output: 1

Sample Input 3:

1 1 1

Total points: 3, which is odd. Impossible.

Output: -1

Sample Input 4:

1 1 2

Total points: 4, which is even. g = 2 games.

Possible scenario:

- One draw between player 2 and 3: p2 = 1, p3 = 1

- One win-lose game between player 1 and 3: player 3 wins, so p3 += 2, p1 += 0

  Now, p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 3, which doesn't match.

- Or, one draw between player 1 and 2: p1 = 1, p2 = 1

- One draw between player 1 and 3: p1 = 2, p3 = 1

  Now, p1 = 2, p2 = 1, p3 = 1, which matches the input.

  So, d = 2 draws.

Output: 2

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2, which matches this.

Another sample input:

3 3 3

Total points: 9, which is odd. So, impossible.

Output: -1

Another sample input:

3 4 5

Total points: 12, which is even. g = 6 games.

Possible scenario:

- Let’s see, need to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

  Not sure, but the output is 6, which suggests all games were draws.

  Wait, but if all games were draws, each draw would give 1 point to each player involved.

  So, if all 6 games were draws, and assuming the draws are distributed in some way among the pairs, but it's not clear how to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

  Maybe it's not possible to have all draws, so perhaps there's another way.

Wait, the sample output is 6, which probably means that it's possible to have 6 draws.

Wait, but with 6 draws, if each draw gives 1 point to each player involved, then depending on which pairs draw, the points can be distributed differently.

For example:

- If all 6 draws are between player 2 and player 3, then p2 = 6, p3 = 6, p1 = 0, which doesn't match.

- If some draws are between different pairs, it's getting complicated.

  Maybe I need to accept that manual calculation isn't efficient here, and look for a formula.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:

            print(-1)

            continue

        x = (a + b + c) // 2

        y = a + b

        print(min(x, y))

So, it checks if the sum is even, and if not, prints -1.

Then, x = (a + b + c) // 2, which is the total number of games.

y = a + b

Then, it prints the minimum of x and y.

Wait, why?

Let’s see with sample input 4: 1 1 2

sum = 4, which is even.

x = 4 // 2 = 2

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(x, y) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input: 3 4 5

sum = 12, even.

x = 6

y = 3 + 4 = 7

min(6,7) = 6, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input: 1 1 10

sum = 12, even.

x = 6

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(6,2) = 2, which matches the sample output.

But why does this work?

Is there a reason to take min(x, y)?

Let’s think about what y = a + b represents.

a and b are the scores of the first two players.

In the context of draws, each draw involves two players, and both get 1 point each.

So, the total points from draws would be equal to twice the number of draws, because each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players.

Wait, no.

If there are d draws, and each draw involves two players, then the total points from draws would be 2*d, since each draw adds 1 point to each of the two players.

But also, in win-lose games, which are w in number, each contributes 2 points, all going to one player.

So, total points: 2*d + 2*w = 2*(d + w) = a + b + c

So, d + w = (a + b + c)/2 = x

Now, in terms of individual scores, the points from draws would be distributed among the players based on which pairs drew.

But in the code, y = a + b.

What's the significance of a + b?

Well, a and b are the scores of the first two players.

In the context of maximizing draws, perhaps the maximum number of draws is limited by the sum of a and b.

But why?

Wait, perhaps because draws can only contribute up to a certain limit based on the scores of the players.

Wait, maybe it's bounding the number of draws by the total points that players 1 and 2 can contribute.

But I'm not sure.

Let’s consider that in order to have a draw, two players must participate, and each draw increases their scores by 1.

So, the maximum number of draws involving player 1 is a, since each draw increases player 1's score by 1, and player 1 has a total score of a.

Similarly, the maximum number of draws involving player 2 is b.

So, the total maximum number of draws is limited by the sum of a and b, because each draw uses up one point from each participant.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, each draw increases both participants' scores by 1.

So, the total number of draws is limited by the minimum of the sum of a and b, and the sum of a and c, and the sum of b and c, because each draw uses up one point from each participant.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of (a + b), (a + c), (b + c).

But in the code, it's taking min(x, y), where y = a + b.

But x = (a + b + c) / 2.

Is min(x, y) equal to min((a + b + c)/2, a + b)?

In the sample input 4: a=1, b=1, c=2 → x=2, y=2 → min=2

Sample input 5: a=3, b=4, c=5 → x=6, y=7 → min=6

Sample input 6: a=1, b=1, c=10 → x=6, y=2 → min=2

But is this always correct?

Wait, perhaps it's because the total number of draws cannot exceed the sum of any two players' scores, since each draw involves two players and increases both their scores by 1.

So, the maximum number of draws is limited by the smallest sum of any two players' scores.

But in the code, it's taking y = a + b, which are the two smallest scores since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

So, a + b is the smallest sum of any two players' scores.

Therefore, the maximum number of draws cannot exceed a + b.

And also, it cannot exceed the total number of games, which is x = (a + b + c)/2.

Therefore, taking min(x, y) seems reasonable.

But is this always correct?

Let’s check with sample input 4: a=1, b=1, c=2

min(2,2) = 2

Is it possible to have 2 draws?

Yes, as shown earlier.

Let’s check sample input 5: a=3, b=4, c=5

min(6,7) = 6

Is it possible to have 6 draws?

Let’s see:

If all 6 games are draws, and we need to distribute the points accordingly.

Possible distribution:

- Suppose we have d12 draws between player 1 and 2.

- d13 draws between player 1 and 3.

- d23 draws between player 2 and 3.

With d12 + d13 + d23 = 6

And the points would be:

p1 = d12 + d13

p2 = d12 + d23

p3 = d13 + d23

We need p1 = 3, p2 = 4, p3 = 5.

So:

d12 + d13 = 3

d12 + d23 = 4

d13 + d23 = 5

Let’s solve these equations.

From the first two equations:

d12 + d13 = 3

d12 + d23 = 4

Subtracting: d23 - d13 = 1 → d23 = d13 + 1

From the third equation:

d13 + d23 = 5

Substitute d23:

d13 + (d13 + 1) = 5 → 2*d13 + 1 = 5 → 2*d13 = 4 → d13 = 2

Then, d23 = 2 + 1 = 3

And from d12 + d13 = 3 → d12 + 2 = 3 → d12 = 1

So, d12 = 1, d13 = 2, d23 = 3

Total draws: d12 + d13 + d23 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which matches.

And the points are:

p1 = 1 + 2 = 3

p2 = 1 + 3 = 4

p3 = 2 + 3 = 5

Perfect match.

So, in this case, it's possible to have 6 draws.

Hence, the answer is 6.

Another sample input: 1 1 10

min(x, y) = min(6,2) = 2

Is it possible to have 2 draws?

Let’s see:

Total games: g = 6

Number of draws: d = 2

Number of win-lose games: w = 4

We need to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10

From draws:

Suppose d12 = 1, d13 = 1, d23 = 0

Then, p1 = 1 + 1 = 2

p2 = 1 + 0 = 1

p3 = 1 + 0 = 1

But we need p1=1, p2=1, p3=10

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps another distribution.

If d13 = 1, d23 =1, d12=0

Then p1=0 +1=1

p2=0 +1=1

p3=1 +1=2

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe d13=1, d23=1, d12=0

Then, p1=0 +1=1

p2=0 +1=1

p3=1 +1=2

Now, remaining games are win-lose games: w=4

We need p3 to be 10, but currently p3 is 2 from draws.

So, p3 needs an additional 8 points from win-lose games.

Each win-lose game can give 2 points to a winner.

So, p3 needs to win 4 win-lose games to get 8 points.

But there are only 4 win-lose games available.

So, p3 needs to win all 4 win-lose games.

Now, who does p3 play against in these win-lose games?

Assuming p3 plays against p1 and p2 in these games.

But p1 and p2 have already got their points from draws.

p1 has 1 point, p2 has 1 point.

If p3 wins 4 win-lose games, all against p1 and p2, then:

- If p3 wins against p1, p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- If p3 wins against p2, p3 gets 2, p2 gets 0.

But p1 and p2 already have 1 point each from draws.

If p3 wins 4 games against p1 and p2, then:

- Suppose p3 plays 2 games against p1: p3 gets 4, p1 gets 0.

- p3 plays 2 games against p2: p3 gets 4, p2 gets 0.

But p1 and p2 already have 1 point from draws.

So, p1's total would be 1 + 0 + 0 =1

p2's total would be 1 + 0 + 0 =1

p3's total would be 1 (from draws) + 4 + 4 =9

But we need p3 to have 10.

Wait, perhaps p3 plays 3 games against p1 and 1 against p2.

But then p3 would get 6 from p1 and 2 from p2, total 8 plus draw points.

Wait, no.

Wait, p3 has 1 from draws, plus 8 from win-lose games, total 9, but need 10.

So, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, but according to the code, it prints 2, which seems to suggest that it's possible to have 2 draws.

But from my calculation, even with 2 draws, I can't reach p3=10.

Maybe the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2.

But according to my reasoning, it's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is accepting some invalid scenarios.

Wait, perhaps in the code, it's assuming that the maximum number of draws is min(x,y), but in reality, it's more constrained.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but the sample output says 2 for input 1 1 10.

But according to my reasoning, it's not possible to achieve p3=10 with only 2 draws and 4 win-lose games.

Wait, perhaps the sample output is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the code is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is even, which it is, 1+1+10=12, which is even.

Then, x = 6

y = 1 + 1 = 2

min(x,y) = 2

But is it possible to have 2 draws and 4 win-lose games to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10?

From 2 draws:

- Suppose p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1

- p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p3=1

But p1 should have only 1 point, so this doesn't work.

Alternatively:

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=1, p3=1

- p1 and p3 draw once: p1=1, p3=2

Now, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2

Now, need p3 to have 8 more points from win-lose games.

So, p3 needs to win 4 win-lose games, each giving p3 2 points.

If p3 plays 4 win-lose games, all wins, against p1 and p2.

But p1 and p2 have already 1 point each from draws.

If p3 wins 4 games against p1 and p2, then:

- p3 gets 8 points from these games.

- p1 and p2 get 0 from these games.

So, total points:

p1: 1 (from draws) + 0 =1

p2:1 (from draws) + 0 =1

p3:2 (from draws) +8 =10

Which matches the required scores.

Hence, it is possible with 2 draws and 4 win-lose games.

So, my earlier confusion was due to miscalculation.

Hence, the code seems correct for this case.

Therefore, perhaps the approach is valid.

So, the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
