Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n x n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. Nene can perform two types of operations on this matrix. Each operation allows her to set a entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing at most 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n.

Since I can perform up to 2n operations, I need to figure out the best way to use these operations to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Let me think about how the matrix sum increases with each operation. If I perform a type 1 operation on a row, I'm setting that entire row to a permutation of 1 to n, which means the sum of that row will be the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2. Similarly, if I perform a type 2 operation on a column, I'm setting that entire column to a permutation of 1 to n, summing to n(n+1)/2.

But here's the catch: if I perform both a type 1 and a type 2 operation on the same cell, the value of that cell will be overwritten by the last operation performed. So, I need to strategize to maximize the sum without unnecessary overwrites.

Wait, actually, since the operations set the entire row or column, and they can overwrite each other, I need to be careful about the order in which I perform these operations.

Let me consider the effect of performing all row operations first, followed by all column operations. If I do all row operations first, each row will be set to a permutation of 1 to n, and then if I perform column operations, they will overwrite the values in the specified columns.

Alternatively, if I do all column operations first, and then all row operations, the row operations will overwrite the columns.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum, given that some cells might be overwritten.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of which cells are set by row operations and which are set by column operations.

If I perform a row operation on a row, that sets all its cells to a permutation. Then, if I perform a column operation on a column, it will overwrite the value in the intersection of that column and the row that was previously set by a row operation.

So, perhaps I can partition the matrix into parts set by row operations and parts set by column operations, minimizing overlap.

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum. If I could set every cell in the matrix to n, that would be the maximum sum, which is n^3. But, since I'm limited to setting entire rows or columns to permutations that include numbers from 1 to n, I can't set all cells to n.

In fact, in a permutation, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, in each row or column that I set, the sum is fixed at n(n+1)/2.

Wait, but if I set a row and then set a column that intersects with that row, the value in the intersection is overwritten.

Let me try to calculate the maximum possible sum.

If I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n, what is the sum?

Each row operation sets one row to sum n(n+1)/2, and each column operation sets one column to sum n(n+1)/2, but with possible overlaps.

The total sum would be the sum of the row operations plus the sum of the column operations minus the overlaps.

But calculating the overlaps seems tricky.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look at small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.

For n=1:

- The matrix is 1x1.

- I can perform either a type 1 or type 2 operation.

- In either case, I set the single cell to 1.

- So, the sum is 1.

- The example matches this.

For n=2:

- The matrix is 2x2.

- I can perform up to 4 operations.

- According to the example, the maximum sum is 7 with 3 operations.

- Let's see how that works.

Suppose I perform:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1: set row 1 to [1, 2]. Sum increases by 3.

2. Type 1 operation on row 2: set row 2 to [1, 2]. Sum increases by 3, total sum is 6.

3. Type 2 operation on column 1: set column 1 to [1, 2]. This overwrites the first element of row 1 and row 2.

- After this, the matrix is:

- Row 1: [1, 2]

- Row 2: [2, 2]

- Sum is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.

Ah, so the third operation overwrites the first element of row 1 and row 2, changing row 2 from [1,2] to [2,2], increasing the sum.

So, by carefully ordering the operations, I can maximize the sum.

Is there a general pattern here?

It seems that by performing row operations first and then column operations on specific columns, I can maximize the sum.

Wait, in the example, they performed two row operations and one column operation.

Similarly, I could think of performing n row operations and n column operations, but in the example, they used only 3 operations for n=2.

So, perhaps I can optimize the number of operations.

But the problem says I don't need to minimize the number of operations, just use no more than 2n operations.

I need to maximize the sum, using at most 2n operations.

Looking back at n=2, with 3 operations, sum is 7.

What if I use 4 operations?

- Perform type 1 on row 1: [1,2]

- Type 1 on row 2: [1,2]

- Type 2 on column 1: [1,2]

- Type 2 on column 2: [1,2]

- Final matrix:

- Row 1: [1,1]

- Row 2: [2,2]

- Sum is 1+1+2+2=6, which is less than 7.

So, in this case, using more operations doesn't necessarily lead to a higher sum.

Hence, I need to be strategic about which operations to perform.

Let me consider a general n.

I need to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.

I should aim to set as many high values as possible in the matrix.

Given that each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, the highest possible value in each row or column is n.

However, due to overwrites, I need to plan carefully.

One idea is to perform operations in such a way that the higher numbers are placed in positions that are less likely to be overwritten.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where I can set rows and columns in a specific order to maximize the sum.

Let me consider performing all row operations first, setting each row to a permutation that maximizes the sum, and then performing column operations that overwrite certain cells to higher values.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform n row operations, setting each row to a permutation that maximizes the sum for that row.

Then, I perform n column operations, setting each column to a permutation that maximizes the sum for that column, considering that the row operations have already set some values.

But I need to consider the interactions between row and column operations.

Wait, maybe I can fix the permutations for rows and columns in a way that maximizes the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula to calculate the maximum sum directly, without explicitly performing the operations.

Let me try to find such a formula.

For n=1, sum=1.

For n=2, sum=7.

For n=3?

Let's compute it.

If I perform 3 row operations and 3 column operations optimally.

Suppose I set rows to [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], sum would be 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 18.

Then, if I set columns to [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], overwriting the corresponding columns.

The final matrix would be:

- Row 1: [3,2,1]

- Row 2: [2,2,1]

- Row 3: [1,2,1]

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 3+3+3 = 9.

Wait, that's not better than just row operations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, if I perform row operations first, setting each row to [3,2,1], sum is 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 18.

Then, performing column operations:

- Set column 1 to [3,2,1], overwriting row 1,2,3's first elements.

- Set column 2 to [3,2,1], overwriting row 1,2,3's second elements.

- Set column 3 to [3,2,1], overwriting row 1,2,3's third elements.

So, the final matrix would be:

- Row 1: [3,3,3]

- Row 2: [2,2,2]

- Row 3: [1,1,1]

Sum is 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18.

Same as just row operations.

Is there a better way?

What if I perform fewer column operations?

Suppose I perform 3 row operations and 2 column operations.

Set rows to [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], sum=18.

Then, set column 1 to [3,2,1], overwriting row 1,2,3's first elements.

Set column 2 to [3,2,1], overwriting row 1,2,3's second elements.

Now, the matrix is:

- Row 1: [3,3,1]

- Row 2: [2,2,1]

- Row 3: [1,1,1]

Sum is 3+3+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+1+1 = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15.

Not better.

What if I set columns differently?

Alternatively, maybe I should set rows to increasing order and columns to decreasing order.

Wait, perhaps there's a better strategy.

Let me try setting rows to [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], sum=6+6+6=18.

Then, set columns to [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], overwriting columns.

Final matrix:

- Row 1: [3,3,3]

- Row 2: [2,2,2]

- Row 3: [1,1,1]

Sum is 9 + 6 + 3 = 18.

Same as before.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Wait, perhaps by performing operations in a specific order, I can achieve a higher sum.

Let me consider performing row operations and column operations interleaved.

For example, for n=2:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [1,2], sum=3.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1, set to [1,2], sum=1 (row1,col1)+2 (row1,col2)+2 (row2,col1)=1+2+2=5.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2, set to [1,2], sum=1 (row1,col1)+2 (row1,col2)+2 (row2,col1)+2 (row2,col2)=1+2+2+2=7.

As in the example.

So, perhaps by performing operations in a specific order, I can maximize the sum.

Is there a general pattern for any n?

Let me try to generalize this approach.

For n=3:

Perform type 1 operations on rows in a specific order, and type 2 operations on columns in a specific order.

But I need to find a sequence of at most 2n operations that maximizes the sum.

Looking back at n=2, using 3 operations to get sum=7.

For n=3, perhaps using 4 operations to get a higher sum than 18.

Wait, for n=2, 7 is the maximum sum with 3 operations.

Is there a formula to calculate this maximum sum?

Let me try to find a pattern in the sums.

For n=1: sum=1.

For n=2: sum=7.

For n=3: let's see what's possible.

If I perform 3 row operations and 3 column operations, as above, sum=18.

But perhaps with a different strategy, I can get a higher sum.

Wait, maybe the maximum sum is n^3 - (n-1)^3.

Wait, for n=2: 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the example.

For n=3: 27 - 8 = 19.

Is 19 achievable?

Let me try.

Perform type 1 operations on rows 1,2,3, setting them to [3,2,1], sum=6+6+6=18.

Then, perform type 2 operation on column 1, setting it to [3,2,1], overwriting row1,col1=3, row2,col1=2, row3,col1=1.

Now, matrix is:

Row1: [3,2,1]

Row2: [2,2,1]

Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1=6+5+3=14.

Not better.

Alternatively, perform type 2 operations first.

Type 2 on column 1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6.

Type 2 on column 2: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Type 2 on column 3: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=18.

Then, type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=18 (since columns already set).

Not better.

Alternatively, perform type 1 on row 1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Type 2 on column 1: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col1)+2 (row2,col1)+1 (row3,col1)=3+2+1=6, total=6+6=12.

Type 1 on row 2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row2,col1=3, overwriting previous 2)+2 (row2,col2=2)+1 (row2,col3=1)=3+2+1=6, total=12+6=18.

Type 2 on column 3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col3=3, overwriting previous 1)+2 (row2,col3=2, overwriting previous 1)+1 (row3,col3=1)=3+2+1=6, total=18+6=24.

Wait, that seems better.

Matrix after these operations:

- Row1: [3,2,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+2+3 +3+2+2 +1+2+1=8 + 9 + 4 = 21.

But according to the earlier calculation, the sum is 24, but that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum.

Wait, in the operations:

1. Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1] → sum=3+2+1=6.

2. Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1] → row1,col1=3; row2,col1=2; row3,col1=1 → sum=3+2+1=6, total=6+6=12.

3. Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1] → row2,col1=3 (overwriting previous 2); row2,col2=2; row2,col3=1 → sum=3+2+1=6, total=12+6=18.

4. Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1] → row1,col3=3 (overwriting previous 1); row2,col3=2 (overwriting previous 1); row3,col3=1 → sum=3+2+1=6, total=18+6=24.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,2,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum: 3+2+3 +3+2+2 +1+2+1=8 + 9 + 4 =21.

Wait, but according to the operations, I added 6 for each operation, totaling 24.

Perhaps there's an overlap in the way I'm calculating the sum.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when I perform an operation, I'm setting the entire row or column, and the sum is the sum of the matrix after all operations, not the sum of the sums added in each operation.

In that case, the sum is indeed 8 + 9 + 4 =21.

Is there a better sequence of operations to get a higher sum?

Let me try a different sequence.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Operation 2: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column2: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=24.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,3,1]

- Row2: [3,2,1]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+3+1 +3+2+1 +1+2+1=7 + 6 + 4=17.

Wait, total sum is 17, which is less than 21.

So, the previous sequence was better.

Let me try another sequence.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row2,col3=1)+2+1=3+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col1=3)+2 (row2,col1=2)+1 (row3,col1=1)=6, total=24.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,2,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+2+3 +3+2+2 +1+2+1=8 + 9 + 4=21.

Same as before.

Is there a way to get higher than 21?

Let me try performing more operations.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row2,col1=2)+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col2=3, overwriting previous 2)+2 (row2,col2=2, overwriting previous 2)+1 (row3,col2=1)=6, total=24.

Operation 5: Type 1 on row3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row3,col1=1 and row3,col2=1)+2 (overwriting row3,col2=1)+1 (row3,col3=1)=3+2+1=6, total=30.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,3,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [3,2,1]

Sum=3+3+3 +3+2+2 +3+2+1=9 + 7 + 6=22.

Better than 21, now sum is 22.

Is there a way to get higher?

Let me try adding another operation.

Operation 6: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col3=3, no change)+2 (row2,col3=2, no change)+1 (row3,col3=1, no change)=6, total=36.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,3,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [3,2,1]

Sum=3+3+3 +3+2+2 +3+2+1=9 + 7 + 6=22.

Same sum as before, because column3 is already set to [3,2,1].

So, with 5 operations, sum=22.

Is there a way to get higher than 22?

Let me try a different sequence.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row2,col1=2)+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row1,col2=2)+2 (overwriting row2,col2=2)+1 (row3,col2=1)=6, total=24.

Operation 5: Type 1 on row3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row3,col1=1)+2 (overwriting row3,col2=1)+1 (row3,col3=1)=6, total=30.

Operation 6: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col3=3, no change)+2 (row2,col3=2, no change)+1 (row3,col3=1, no change)=6, total=36.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,3,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [3,2,1]

Sum=3+3+3 +3+2+2 +3+2+1=9 + 7 + 6=22.

Same as before.

Is 22 the maximum?

Is there a way to get higher?

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I perform type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to [3,2,1], sum=18.

Then, perform type 2 operations on columns 1 and 2, setting them to [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1 +3+2+1=12, total=18+12=30.

But the actual sum would be:

- Row1: [3,3,1]

- Row2: [2,2,1]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+3+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=7 + 5 + 3=15.

Less than 22.

So, not better.

Another approach: perform type 2 operations first.

Operation 1: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column2: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row1,col1=3)+2 (overwriting row1,col2=2)+1 (overwriting row1,col3=3)=3+2+1=6, total=24.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,2,1]

- Row2: [2,2,1]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+2+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=6 + 5 + 3=14.

Less than 22.

Another sequence:

Operation 1: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6.

Operation 2: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row1,col1=3)+2 (row1,col2=2)+1 (row1,col3=1)=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row2,col1=2)+2 (row2,col2=2)+1 (row2,col3=1)=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row1,col3=1)+2 (overwriting row2,col3=1)+1 (row3,col3=1)=6, total=24.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,2,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [1,2,1]

Sum=3+2+3 +3+2+2 +1+2+1=8 + 9 + 4=21.

Same as before.

Not better than 22.

So, it seems that 22 is the best I can get with 5 operations.

Is there a way to get higher with more operations?

Let me try with 6 operations.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row1: [3,2,1], sum=6.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column1: [3,2,1], sum=3+2+1=6, total=12.

Operation 3: Type 1 on row2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row2,col1=2)+2+1=6, total=18.

Operation 4: Type 2 on column2: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row1,col2=2)+2 (overwriting row2,col2=2)+1 (row3,col2=1)=6, total=24.

Operation 5: Type 1 on row3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (overwriting row3,col1=1)+2 (overwriting row3,col2=1)+1 (row3,col3=1)=6, total=30.

Operation 6: Type 2 on column3: [3,2,1], sum=3 (row1,col3=3, no change)+2 (row2,col3=2, no change)+1 (row3,col3=1, no change)=6, total=36.

Matrix:

- Row1: [3,3,3]

- Row2: [3,2,2]

- Row3: [3,2,1]

Sum=3+3+3 +3+2+2 +3+2+1=9 + 7 + 6=22.

Same as before.

Seems like 22 is the maximum sum for n=3 with at most 6 operations.

Is there a general formula for this?

Looking back at n=1: sum=1.

n=2: sum=7.

n=3: sum=22.

Is there a pattern here?

Let's see:

n=1: 1^3 - (1-1)^3 =1-0=1.

n=2: 2^3 -1^3=8-1=7.

n=3: 3^3 -2^3=27-8=19.

But in practice, for n=3, I could get 22, which is higher than 19.

So, perhaps the formula is not n^3 - (n-1)^3.

Alternatively, maybe it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + something.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1)^2.

For n=3: 27 -8 +4=23, which is close to 22.

Not exactly, but close.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1).

For n=3: 27-8+2=21, which is less than 22.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + something else.

I need a better approach.

Let me think in terms of how many times each cell is set.

Each cell can be set by row operations and column operations.

If a cell is set by both a row operation and a column operation, the last operation performed will determine its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the values set in the cells, preferably setting them to n, or as high as possible.

One way to think about it is to set as many cells as possible to n, and the rest to the highest possible values.

But given that operations set entire rows or columns to permutations, I need to strategize accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each row operation sets a row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and each column operation sets a column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, by performing operations in a specific order, I can maximize the sum.

But I need to find a general formula for any n.

Looking back at the example for n=2, the sum is 7, which is 2^3 -1^3=8-1=7.

For n=3, I got 22, which is higher than 3^3 -2^3=27-8=19.

So, perhaps the formula is sum = n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1)^2.

For n=3: 27-8+4=23, which is close to 22.

But in n=2: 8-1+1=8, which is not matching the sum of 7.

So, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum = n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1).

For n=3: 27-8+2=21, which is less than 22.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum = n^3 - (n-1)^3 + something else.

I need to find a general formula.

Let me consider that with each row operation, I set a row to sum n(n+1)/2.

Similarly for column operations.

But due to overlaps, I need to account for the overwrites.

Perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula.

Let me consider the sum for n, given the sum for n-1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of operations.

I have at most 2n operations.

Each row operation sets a row to sum n(n+1)/2.

Each column operation sets a column to sum n(n+1)/2.

But again, with overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximum sum as n*n*sum_of_permutation - overlaps.

But calculating overlaps is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are rows and columns, and edges represent cells, and try to maximize the sum.

But that might be overkill.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Each row operation adds sum of a permutation to the rows, and each column operation adds sum of a permutation to the columns, minus the overlaps.

But again, overlaps are tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each cell is set by at most one operation, either a row operation or a column operation, but not both.

Then, the sum would be the sum of the selected row operations and column operations, without any overlaps.

But in reality, cells can be set by both operations, with the last operation determining the value.

So, that's not accurate.

I need a better approach.

Let me look for a different pattern.

For n=1: sum=1.

For n=2: sum=7.

For n=3: sum=22.

For n=4: let's try to compute.

If I perform 4 row operations and 4 column operations optimally.

From n=3, sum=22 with 5 operations.

For n=4, perhaps sum=4^3 -3^3=64-27=37.

But in n=3, sum=22, which is higher than 19.

So, perhaps sum = n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1)^2.

For n=4: 64-27+9=46.

Is that achievable?

Let me try.

Perform type 1 operations on rows 1,2,3,4, each set to [4,3,2,1], sum=4+3+2+1=10 per row, total=40.

Then, perform type 2 operations on columns 1 and 2, set to [4,3,2,1], sum=4+3+2+1=10 per column, total=20.

But considering overlaps, the total sum would be 40 +20 - overlap.

What's the overlap?

Each column operation overwrites the corresponding column in all rows.

So, for column 1: overwrites row1 to row4's column1 to [4,3,2,1], sum=10.

Similarly for column 2: overwrites row1 to row4's column2 to [4,3,2,1], sum=10.

But the rows were already set to [4,3,2,1].

So, after column operations:

- Row1: [4,4,2,1]

- Row2: [3,3,2,1]

- Row3: [2,2,2,1]

- Row4: [1,1,2,1]

Sum=4+4+2+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+2+1=11 +9 +7 +5=32.

Which is less than 40.

So, perhaps performing more column operations isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perform type 1 operations on rows 1,2,3,4, sum=40.

Then, perform type 2 operations on columns 1,2,3, sum=10+10+10=30.

Total operations=7, which is more than 8, but for n=4, 2n=8.

But let's see the sum.

After operations:

- Row1: [4,4,4,1]

- Row2: [3,3,3,1]

- Row3: [2,2,2,1]

- Row4: [1,1,1,1]

Sum=4+4+4+1 +3+3+3+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+1+1=13 +10 +7 +4=34.

Still less than 40.

Wait, perhaps performing only row operations is better.

Sum=40.

But according to the earlier calculation, with 7 operations, sum=34, which is less than 40.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved with only n row operations, sum=n*(n(n+1)/2)=n^2(n+1)/2.

For n=4: 16*5/2=40.

But earlier, with additional column operations, the sum decreased.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me try again.

Perform type 1 operations on rows 1,2,3,4: sum=40.

Then, perform type 2 operations on columns 1 and 2: sum=10+10=20.

But the overlaps are:

- Column1: [4,3,2,1], sum=10.

- Column2: [4,3,2,1], sum=10.

But in the rows, row1 was [4,3,2,1], row2 was [4,3,2,1], etc.

After column operations:

- Row1: [4,4,2,1]

- Row2: [3,3,2,1]

- Row3: [2,2,2,1]

- Row4: [1,1,2,1]

Sum=4+4+2+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+2+1=11 +9 +7 +5=32.

So, total sum is 32, which is less than 40.

Hence, performing additional column operations decreases the sum.

Therefore, for n=4, sum=40 with 4 operations.

But according to the problem, I can perform up to 8 operations.

Is there a way to get a higher sum with more operations?

Let me try.

Perform type 1 operations on rows 1,2,3,4: sum=40.

Then, perform type 2 operations on columns 1,2,3: sum=10+10+10=30.

After operations:

- Row1: [4,4,4,1]

- Row2: [3,3,3,1]

- Row3: [2,2,2,1]

- Row4: [1,1,1,1]

Sum=4+4+4+1 +3+3+3+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+1+1=13 +10 +7 +4=34.

Still less than 40.

So, adding column operations doesn't help.

Similarly, adding more column operations won't help.

Hence, for n=4, sum=40 with 4 operations.

So, perhaps for general n, the maximum sum is n^3.

Wait, for n=2, n^3=8, but in the example, sum=7 <8.

For n=3, sum=22 <27.

For n=4, sum=40 <64.

So, n^3 is not achievable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3.

For n=2: 8-1=7.

For n=3:27-8=19.

For n=4:64-27=37.

But in practice, for n=3, sum=22>19.

For n=4, sum=40>37.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + c, where c is some constant.

For n=3:27-8+c=22 ⇒ c=3.

For n=4:64-27+3=40, which matches.

For n=2:8-1+3=10, but in example, sum=7.

So, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1).

For n=3:27-8+2=21, which is less than 22.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3 + (n-1)^2.

For n=3:27-8+4=23, which is higher than 22.

Not matching.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform n row operations, setting each row to [n,n-1,...,1], sum per row=n(n+1)/2, total sum=n*(n(n+1)/2)=n^2(n+1)/2.

Then, perform n column operations, setting each column to [n,n-1,...,1], sum per column=n(n+1)/2, total sum=n*(n(n+1)/2)=n^2(n+1)/2.

But due to overlaps, the total sum would be the sum after all operations, not the sum of individual operations.

In the overlaps, the last operation performed determines the value.

So, perhaps the total sum is n^2(n+1)/2 + n^2(n+1)/2 - sum of overlaps.

But calculating overlaps is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing only row operations or only column operations, and not both.

From the n=2 example, performing both row and column operations gives a higher sum than performing only row operations.

For n=2:

- Only row operations: sum=3+3=6.

- With one column operation: sum=7.

Hence, combining row and column operations gives a higher sum.

Similarly, for n=3:

- Only row operations: sum=6+6+6=18.

- With some column operations: sum=22.

Hence, combining gives a higher sum.

So, the general formula must consider both row and column operations.

I need to find a general formula for the sum.

Looking back, for n=1: sum=1.

n=2: sum=7.

n=3: sum=22.

n=4: sum=40.

Looking for a pattern:

1,7,22,40.

Looking at differences:

7-1=6.

22-7=15.

40-22=18.

Looking at second differences:

15-6=9.

18-15=3.

Not a constant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cubic function.

Let me try to fit a cubic polynomial to these points.

For n=1: sum=1.

n=2: sum=7.

n=3: sum=22.

n=4: sum=40.

Assume sum = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d.

Plug in n=1: a + b + c + d =1.

n=2: 8a +4b +2c +d=7.

n=3:27a +9b +3c +
