Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the i-th character of the template.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of the template.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there should be at least one position where the condition fails.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me try to rephrase the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it correctly. I need to create a template t where for each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], while c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], while c[i] must either be equal to the lowercase version of t[i] or not satisfy the condition, meaning c does not match the template.

Wait, actually, for c to not match the template, there should be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

My goal is to choose t[i] (either lowercase or uppercase) in such a way that both a and b match the template, and c does not match it.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, consider each position i from 1 to n independently.

For each position i, I have to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase:

- a[i] must be equal to t[i].

- b[i] must be equal to t[i].

- c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase:

- a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, actually, for uppercase t[i], the condition for the strings is that s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

But for c to not match the template, if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. For c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, to make c not match the template, I need to have at least one position where either:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

But for a and b to match the template, for all positions i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

I need to choose t[i] for each position i such that:

1. For a and b to match the template:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

2. For c to not match the template, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i], or

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

My task is to find if such a template t exists.

Let me consider each position independently and see what constraints they impose.

For each position i, I have two choices for t[i]: make it lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider the possibilities for t[i]:

Case 1: t[i] is lowercase.

- Then, a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i].

So, for this case to be possible:

- a[i] must be equal to b[i], because both must be equal to t[i].

- c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

So, a necessary condition for choosing t[i] as lowercase is that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

Case 2: t[i] is uppercase.

- Then, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

So, for this case:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Given that, I need to choose an uppercase t[i] such that:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is simply the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, t[i] is an uppercase letter, so lowercase(t[i]) is the corresponding lowercase letter.

So, for example, if t[i] = 'A', then lowercase(t[i]) = 'a'.

Given that, for t[i] being uppercase:

- a[i] != 'a'

- b[i] != 'a'

- c[i] == 'a'

Wait, more generally:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for this case, lowercase(t[i]) must be equal to c[i], and a[i] and b[i] must both be different from c[i].

Therefore, for this case to be possible:

- c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, more precisely:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

For example, if c[i] = 'a', then t[i] must be 'A'.

But, in this case, a[i] != 'a' and b[i] != 'a'.

Wait, no. Wait, t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is 'a'.

So, a[i] != 'a', b[i] != 'a', and c[i] == 'a'.

So, for this case:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

But, in this case, a[i] and b[i] must both be different from c[i].

Wait, but the condition is a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which is a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, for t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

But, in this case, c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no. a[i] and b[i] must be different from c[i], which is lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, more carefully:

- t[i] is uppercase, say 'A', so lowercase(t[i]) is 'a'.

- Then, a[i] != 'a', b[i] != 'a', and c[i] == 'a'.

So, for this position, c[i] == a[i] is not allowed, and c[i] == b[i] is not allowed.

Wait, no. c[i] == 'a', and a[i] != 'a', b[i] != 'a'.

So, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no. c[i] == 'a', and a[i] != 'a', b[i] != 'a'.

So, c[i] is different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, actually, a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, for t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Hence, for this choice to be possible, c[i] must be different from both a[i] and b[i].

Otherwise, if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then t[i] cannot be uppercase, because a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] would not hold.

So, summarizing:

For each position i, I have two options:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase:

- a[i] == b[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

- t[i] = a[i] (in lowercase)

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- t[i] = c[i].upper()

Now, I need to choose for each position i either option 1 or option 2, such that:

- For all positions where I choose option 1: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- For all positions where I choose option 2: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Moreover, to make c not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, in our choices:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in either case, for the positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i], and for positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Hence, if I choose at least one position where t[i] is uppercase (which implies c[i] == lowercase(t[i])), then c does not match the template.

Alternatively, if I choose all positions as lowercase, but ensure that c[i] != t[i] for at least one position, then c does not match the template.

Wait, no. If I choose all positions as lowercase, then for c to not match, c[i] != t[i] for at least one position.

But, if I choose t[i] as lowercase for all positions, and a[i] == b[i] == t[i] != c[i] for at least one position, then c does not match the template.

Wait, but in this case, if I choose t[i] as lowercase for all positions, then for c to not match, there must be at least one position where c[i] != t[i].

But, since a[i] == b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i], this is satisfied as long as there exists at least one position where c[i] != a[i].

Wait, no. If I choose t[i] as lowercase for all positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], and choose t[i] as uppercase where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], but wait, I need to consider the possibilities more carefully.

Actually, let's think in terms of constraints for each position.

For each position i:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase:

- Constraint: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase:

- Constraint: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Moreover, to ensure that c does not match the template, I need at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, in our choices:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in both cases, the condition for c not matching the template is satisfied for that position.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition that c does not match the template, I need at least one position where:

- Either t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, in our choices:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in both cases, c does not match the template at that position.

Hence, if I can choose t[i] for each position such that:

- For positions where t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- For positions where t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And I choose at least one position where either of these holds, then c does not match the template.

Wait, but actually, for c to not match the template, I need at least one position where the condition fails for c, but in our setup, for each position, the condition is such that c does not match the template.

Wait, no. Wait, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, if I choose t[i] in such a way that for at least one position, c does not satisfy the condition, then c does not match the template.

But in our choices:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in both cases, c does not satisfy the condition for that position.

Wait, no. If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i], which means c does not satisfy the condition for that position.

If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c does not satisfy the condition for that position.

Wait, actually, in the template matching rules:

- For c to match the template, for all positions i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] != lowercase(t[i])

So, if for at least one position, the condition fails, then c does not match the template.

In our choices:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i], so c does not match at that position.

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), so c does not match at that position.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, the condition for c to match is c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), but in our choice, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), so c does not match at that position.

Hence, in both cases, c does not match the template at the positions where we choose t[i] to be lowercase or uppercase as per our constraints.

Therefore, as long as I choose at least one position where the template is set in a way that c does not match, which is always the case based on our constraints, then c does not match the template.

So, my main task is to see if there exists a combination of choices for each position such that:

- For positions chosen as lowercase for t[i]:

a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- For positions chosen as uppercase for t[i]:

a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And I need to choose at least one position where c does not match the template, but since in both choices c does not match, I just need to ensure that such a choice is possible for all positions.

Wait, no. I need to ensure that for all positions, the chosen t[i] satisfies the constraints for a and b matching the template, and c not matching it.

But, to make c not match the template, I need at least one position where c does not satisfy the condition.

So, if I choose all positions as uppercase, provided that for each position, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then c does not match the template because for all positions, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which violates the template condition for uppercase t[i].

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase, the condition for c is c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c does not match the template because it should be c[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, no. Wait, for uppercase t[i], the template requires that s[i] != lowercase(t[i]), so for c to match, it should have c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), but in our choice, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), so c does not match.

Hence, in this case, c does not match the template.

Similarly, if I choose t[i] as lowercase, then t[i] = a[i] = b[i], and c[i] != t[i], so c does not match.

So, in both choices, c does not match the template at that position.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition that c does not match the template, I need to choose at least one position where t[i] is chosen such that c does not match, which is already guaranteed by the choices.

Hence, I just need to check if there exists a way to choose t[i] for each position satisfying the constraints for a and b matching the template, and c not matching it.

Now, to make this feasible, I can iterate through each position and see if I can choose t[i] as either lowercase or uppercase based on the constraints.

Specifically, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- I can choose t[i] as lowercase only if c[i] != a[i].

- Or, I can choose t[i] as uppercase only if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i] cannot hold if a[i] != b[i].

- So, I must choose t[i] as uppercase, and in this case, I need a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Hence, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I have no choice but to set t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

For positions where a[i] == b[i], I have a choice:

- Set t[i] as lowercase if c[i] != a[i].

- Or set t[i] as uppercase if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but in positions where a[i] == b[i], I have two options:

1. Set t[i] as lowercase, provided c[i] != a[i].

2. Set t[i] as uppercase, provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

But since a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then option 1 is possible.

If c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, so I must choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], but since c[i] == a[i], and a[i] == b[i], this would mean a[i] != c[i] is false, so I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase.

Wait, but if c[i] == a[i], then for t[i] uppercase, I need a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which is not satisfied since a[i] == c[i].

Hence, in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, and I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase because c[i] == a[i].

Therefore, in such positions, it's impossible to choose t[i] in a way that satisfies the conditions.

Hence, if there exists any position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible to find such a template t, because for that position, no choice of t[i] will satisfy the conditions.

Similarly, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

If a[i] != b[i], and either a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, hence it's impossible to find such a template.

So, summarizing:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to choose t[i].

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], I must choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Hence, my algorithm should be:

- For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible.

- Else:

- If a[i] == b[i] != c[i], set t[i] as lowercase.

- If a[i] != b[i], set t[i] as uppercase, provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

- After processing all positions, if there is at least one position where c does not match the template, then output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But, actually, since in all chosen positions, c does not match the template, I just need to ensure that such a template exists.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if for all positions, the constraints are satisfied, i.e., no position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], and for positions where a[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, no. Actually, if there exists any position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], it's fine.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

If all these conditions hold for all positions, then such a template exists.

Hence, I can iterate through all positions and check these conditions.

If all positions satisfy the conditions, then output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait, but in the problem, it's also required that c does not match the template, which is already ensured by the choices.

Hence, I just need to ensure that for all positions, the constraints are satisfied, and there is at least one position where c does not match the template.

But, since in all chosen positions, c does not match the template, and I need at least one such position, I just need to ensure that there exists at least one position where the constraints allow choosing t[i] in a way that c does not match.

Given that, I can implement the following logic:

- For each test case:

- Read n, a, b, c.

- Initialize a flag to track if it's possible.

- Iterate through each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible.

- Else:

- If a[i] == b[i] != c[i], it's fine.

- If a[i] != b[i], then ensure a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

- If all positions satisfy these conditions, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait, but in the example provided:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's verify the first test case:

n=1

a=a

b=b

c=c

Check position 0:

a[0]=a, b[0]=b, c[0]=c

a[0] != b[0], so must choose t[0] as uppercase, provided a[0] != c[0] and b[0] != c[0].

a[0] != c[0] (a != c), b[0] != c[0] (b != c), so it's fine.

Hence, "YES".

Second test case:

n=2

a=aa

b=bb

c=aa

Position 0:

a[0]=a, b[0]=b, c[0]=a

a[0] != b[0], so must choose t[0] as uppercase, provided a[0] != c[0] and b[0] != c[0].

a[0] != c[0] (a != a)? No, a == a, so cannot choose t[0] as uppercase.

Hence, impossible, "NO".

Third test case:

n=10

a=mathforces

b=luckforces

c=adhoccoder

I need to check each position:

For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

Check if c[i] != a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

Check if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

If all such conditions hold, then "YES".

Fourth test case:

n=3

a=acc

b=abd

c=abc

Check each position:

Position 0:

a[0]=a, b[0]=a, c[0]=a

a[0] == b[0] == c[0], so impossible, "NO".

Hence, the logic seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, my conclusion is that for each test case, I need to iterate through each position and check the conditions mentioned above.

If all positions satisfy their respective conditions, then output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Hence, the given program seems to implement this logic correctly.

In the given program:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

c = input().strip()

possible = False

for i in range(n):

if a[i] == b[i]:

if c[i] != a[i]:

possible = True

continue

elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:

continue

else:

possible = True

break

if possible:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

It seems to check for each position:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], set possible = True.

- Else, continue.

- Else (a[i] != b[i]):

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], set possible = True.

- Else, continue.

Then, if possible is True, print "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems to align with the logic I derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
