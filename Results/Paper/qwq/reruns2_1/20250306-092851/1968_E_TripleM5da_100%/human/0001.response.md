Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n x n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, each cell represented by its coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. It's essentially the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between two points, which makes sense for a grid layout.

Now, the problem is to select n cells in such a way that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between all possible pairs of these cells is as large as possible.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first example, n=2. The output is:

1 1

1 2

So, the cells chosen are (1,1) and (1,2). The distinct Manhattan distances are:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

So, the set H = {0, 1}, which has a size of 2. The problem states that this is the maximum possible for n=2.

In the second example, n=3. The output is:

2 1

2 3

3 1

The distinct Manhattan distances are:

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): 1

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): 3

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, H = {0,1,2,3}, which has a size of 4.

Similarly, for n=4, n=5, and n=6, the outputs are provided, and presumably, they achieve the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for those grid sizes.

Now, I need to find a general approach that works for any n between 2 and 1000.

Let me think about how to maximize the number of distinct distances.

One way to approach this is to select cells in such a way that the differences in their x and y coordinates are varied as much as possible.

One idea is to place the cells along the diagonal of the grid. For example, placing them at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), ..., (n,n). In this case, the Manhattan distances between any two cells would be |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| = 2*|x1 - x2|, since x and y coordinates change by the same amount. This might not give me the maximum number of distinct distances because many distances could be the same.

Looking back at the examples, in n=2, cells are placed in (1,1) and (1,2), which are in the same row but different columns.

In n=3, cells are placed in (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). Here, two cells are in the same row, and one is in a different row.

In n=4, the cells are placed in (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4).

In n=5, cells are placed in (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5).

In n=6, cells are placed in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1).

I need to find a pattern or a strategy that can be generalized for any n.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Place one cell at (1,1).

- Place another cell at (1,2).

- For the remaining cells, place them in a way that maximizes the variety of distances from the existing cells.

Wait, but in the first example with n=2, placing (1,1) and (1,2) gives us distances 0 and 1.

In n=3, placing (1,1), (1,2), and maybe (2,3), but in the example, they placed (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1).

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe placing cells along the main diagonal and one off-diagonal cell.

But looking at n=3, placing (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) would give Manhattan distances of 0, 2, and 4.

But in the example, they have (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), which gives distances 0, 2, 1, 3.

So, perhaps placing cells in a combination of rows and columns to cover more distance values.

Another idea: place cells in a way that their x-coordinates are all different, or their y-coordinates are all different.

But if I place all cells in the same row or same column, the distances would be limited.

For example, placing all cells in row 1: (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n). Then, the Manhattan distances would only be the differences in column indices, which are |y1 - y2|.

Similarly, placing all cells in the same column would only vary in row indices.

To maximize the variety of distances, perhaps I need to have variation in both row and column differences.

Maybe placing cells along a diagonal, but offset in a certain way.

Looking back at the provided examples, it seems like they are placing cells in a way that covers a range of row and column differences.

For n=4, the output is:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

Let's compute the distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): 6

- Between (1,3) and (1,3): 0

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): 4

- Between (4,3) and (4,3): 0

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): 1

- Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,6}

Is there a way to get more distinct distances with n=4? It seems like 6 distinct distances are achieved here.

Similarly, for n=5, the output is:

1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5

Computing distances:

- (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- (1,1) and (1,4): 3

- (1,1) and (2,1): 1

- (1,1) and (5,5): 8

- (1,3) and (1,3): 0

- (1,3) and (1,4): 1

- (1,3) and (2,1): 3

- (1,3) and (5,5): 6

- (1,4) and (1,4): 0

- (1,4) and (2,1): 4

- (1,4) and (5,5): 5

- (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- (2,1) and (5,5): 7

- (5,5) and (5,5): 0

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

That's 9 distinct distances for n=5.

Is this the maximum possible? It seems so, but I'm not sure.

Similarly, for n=6, the output is:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

5 5

6 1

Computing distances:

- (1,4) and (1,4): 0

- (1,4) and (1,5): 1

- (1,4) and (1,6): 2

- (1,4) and (5,2): 4

- (1,4) and (5,5): 5

- (1,4) and (6,1): 6

- (1,5) and (1,5): 0

- (1,5) and (1,6): 1

- (1,5) and (5,2): 5

- (1,5) and (5,5): 4

- (1,5) and (6,1): 5

- (1,6) and (1,6): 0

- (1,6) and (5,2): 6

- (1,6) and (5,5): 5

- (1,6) and (6,1): 7

- (5,2) and (5,2): 0

- (5,2) and (5,5): 3

- (5,2) and (6,1): 2

- (5,5) and (5,5): 0

- (5,5) and (6,1): 5

- (6,1) and (6,1): 0

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

That's 8 distinct distances for n=6.

Is there a way to get more than 8 distinct distances for n=6? Probably not, given this arrangement.

Now, I need to find a general pattern or strategy that can be applied for any n.

Looking at the examples:

- For n=2: 2 cells, H has 2 elements.

- For n=3: 3 cells, H has 4 elements.

- For n=4: 4 cells, H has 6 elements.

- For n=5: 5 cells, H has 9 elements.

- For n=6: 6 cells, H has 8 elements.

Wait, for n=6, H has 8 elements, but for n=5, it has 9. That seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern in the number of distinct distances.

But I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider placing cells in a way that maximizes the range of possible |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| values.

The maximum possible Manhattan distance in an n x n grid is 2*(n-1), which occurs between corners like (1,1) and (n,n).

The minimum is 0, which is the distance of a cell to itself.

So, the possible distances range from 0 up to 2*(n-1), in steps of 1.

But are all these values achievable?

For example, in a 2x2 grid:

Possible distances: 0,1,2.

In the first example, we have 0 and 1.

To get 2, we need to have cells at (1,1) and (2,2), which gives |1-2| + |1-2| = 2.

But in the provided solution, they have (1,1) and (1,2), which gives distances 0 and 1.

So, in that case, it's not achieving the maximum possible distance of 2.

But perhaps for n=2, 2 is the maximum achievable distance, but the provided solution only achieves 0 and 1.

Wait, but according to the note, for n=2, H={0,1}, which is size 2, and it's stated that it's the greatest possible.

Wait, but (1,1) and (2,2) would give H={0,1,2}, which is size 3, which is greater than 2.

But in the example, they only have H={0,1}.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no. For n=2, with cells (1,1) and (1,2):

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Distance between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

So, H={0,1}

But if I choose (1,1) and (2,2):

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Distance between (1,1) and (2,2): 2

- Distance between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

So, H={0,2}

Which is still size 2.

Wait, but in the note, it says that for n=2, H={0,1} is the greatest possible.

But actually, H={0,2} is also size 2.

So, perhaps for n=2, the maximum size of H is 2.

Wait, but in the note, it says that for n=2, H={0,1} is the greatest possible.

But according to my calculation, H={0,2} is also size 2.

So, maybe for n=2, the maximum size of H is 2.

Similarly, for n=3, H={0,1,2,3} is size 4.

For n=4, H={0,1,2,3,4,6} is size 6.

For n=5, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} is size 9.

For n=6, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} is size 8.

I need to see if there's a pattern in these numbers.

Wait, for n=2: H has 2 elements.

n=3: H has 4 elements.

n=4: H has 6 elements.

n=5: H has 9 elements.

n=6: H has 8 elements.

Hmm, not a straightforward pattern.

Wait, perhaps it's related to n*(n-1)/2 +1.

Wait, for n=2: 2*1/2 +1 =1+1=2, which matches.

n=3: 3*2/2 +1=3+1=4, matches.

n=4: 4*3/2 +1=6+1=7, but in the example, it's 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

n=5: 5*4/2 +1=10+1=11, but in the example, it's 9.

n=6: 6*5/2 +1=15+1=16, but in the example, it's 8.

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n choose 2 +1.

For n=2: 1+1=2.

n=3: 3+1=4.

n=4: 6+1=7, but example has 6.

n=5: 10+1=11, but example has 9.

n=6: 15+1=16, but example has 8.

Again, doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's n choose 2 - something.

For n=4: 6 - n=4: 6-0=6, matches.

n=5: 10-1=9.

n=6:15-7=8.

Wait, that seems closer.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (n-1)^2.

For n=2:1, but example has 2.

n=3:4, matches.

n=4:9, but example has 6.

n=5:16, but example has 9.

n=6:25, but example has 8.

No, doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*(n-1)/2.

n=2:1, but example has 2.

n=3:3, but example has 4.

n=4:6, matches.

n=5:10, but example has 9.

n=6:15, but example has 8.

Not matching.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is related to the number of possible sums of |x差异| and |y差异|.

Given that both |x差异| and |y差异| range from 0 to n-1, their sums range from 0 to 2*(n-1).

But not all sums between 0 and 2*(n-1) may be achievable, depending on the cell placements.

Wait, for n=2, sums can be 0,1,2.

In the example, H has 0 and 1.

But (1,1) and (2,2) would give 0 and 2.

So, H={0,2}, which is size 2.

Similarly, (1,1) and (1,2) give H={0,1}.

So, in both cases, H has size 2.

Is it possible to have H with size 3 for n=2? Let's see.

For n=2, choosing cells (1,1), (2,2):

H={0,2}

Choosing (1,1), (2,1):

H={0,1}

Choosing (1,1), (2,1):

H={0,1}

Choosing (1,2), (2,1):

H={0,2}

Choosing (1,2), (2,2):

H={0,1}

Choosing (1,1), (1,2):

H={0,1}

So, it seems that for n=2, the maximum size of H is 2, either {0,1} or {0,2}.

So, in the first example, H={0,1} is correct.

Similarly, for n=3, H={0,1,2,3} is size 4.

Is it possible to get more? Let's see.

For n=3, choosing cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3):

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(2,2):2

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (2,2)-(2,2):0

- (2,2)-(3,3):2

- (3,3)-(3,3):0

H={0,2,4}, which is size 3.

But in the example, H={0,1,2,3}, which is size 4.

So, placing cells at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1):

- (2,1)-(2,1):0

- (2,1)-(2,3):2

- (2,1)-(3,1):1

- (2,3)-(2,3):0

- (2,3)-(3,1):3

- (3,1)-(3,1):0

H={0,1,2,3}, which is size 4.

Is it possible to get H with size 5? Let's try.

Choose cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,1):

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(2,2):2

- (1,1)-(3,1):2

- (2,2)-(2,2):0

- (2,2)-(3,1):1

- (3,1)-(3,1):0

H={0,1,2}, which is size 3.

Not better than the example.

Another try: (1,1), (2,3), (3,5)

Wait, n=3, so coordinates are from 1 to 3.

(1,1), (2,3), (3,2):

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(2,3):4

- (1,1)-(3,2):3

- (2,3)-(2,3):0

- (2,3)-(3,2):2

- (3,2)-(3,2):0

H={0,2,3,4}, which is size 4.

Same as the example.

So, seems like for n=3, 4 is the maximum.

Similarly, for n=4, in the example, H={0,1,2,3,4,6}, which is size 6.

Is it possible to get more?

Let's try different placements.

Choose cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4):

- Distances: 0,2,4,6

H={0,2,4,6}, which is size 4.

Not better than the example.

Choose cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,3):

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,2)-(1,2):0

- (1,2)-(2,1):2

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (2,1)-(2,1):0

- (2,1)-(3,3):3

- (3,3)-(3,3):0

H={0,1,2,3,4}, which is size 5.

Still less than the example's 6.

Another try: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4):

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(1,3):2

- (1,1)-(4,3):6

- (1,1)-(4,4):7

- (1,3)-(1,3):0

- (1,3)-(4,3):3

- (1,3)-(4,4):4

- (4,3)-(4,3):0

- (4,3)-(4,4):1

- (4,4)-(4,4):0

H={0,1,2,3,4,6,7}, which is size 7.

Wait, the example only has size 6, but this gives size 7.

Maybe the example is not optimal.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, any optimal solution is acceptable.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum H size.

In this case, placing cells at (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4) gives H with 7 elements.

But in the example, it's only 6.

Maybe the example is not showing the maximum possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distances.

Let's recalculate:

Cells: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,1):0

- (1,1)-(1,3):2

- (1,1)-(4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,3)-(1,3):0

- (1,3)-(4,3):3

- (1,3)-(4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,3)-(4,3):0

- (4,3)-(4,4):1

- (4,4)-(4,4):0

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is size 7.

Wait, in the initial example for n=4, the output was:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

But according to this calculation, H should have 7 elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

But in the initial analysis, I thought it had 6 elements.

Perhaps I miscounted earlier.

So, it seems that for n=4, H can have up to 7 elements.

But in the example, it's shown with 6 elements.

Maybe the example is not optimal, or perhaps I miscounted.

Anyway, the problem allows any optimal solution, so it's fine.

Now, moving forward, I need to find a general strategy for any n.

Looking at the examples, it seems that placing cells in a way that they cover a range of row and column differences helps maximize the number of distinct distances.

One possible strategy is:

- Place one cell at (1,1).

- Place another cell at (1,n).

- Then, place cells at (k,1) for k from 2 to n.

This way, we have cells at (1,1), (1,n), and (k,1) for k=2 to n.

Let's see for n=3:

(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1)

But n=3 requires only 3 cells, so perhaps (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), but since n=3, we choose only 3.

Similarly, for n=4: (1,1), (1,4), (4,4), but n=4 requires 4 cells, so add (4,1).

Wait, but in the example for n=4, they have (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4).

Which seems similar.

In general, placing cells at (1,1), (1,k), (m,1), and (m,k), adjusting for the number of cells needed.
