Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, which defines an n by n grid. I need to choose n cells in this grid, specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is simply the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances is for a given n, and then figure out how to choose the n cells to achieve that.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For n=2, the output is:

  1 1

  1 2

  The distinct Manhattan distances are 0 (same cell) and 1 (between the two cells).

- For n=3, it's:

  2 1

  2 3

  3 1

  The distinct distances are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

- For n=4, it's:

  1 1

  1 3

  4 3

  4 4

  Which gives distinct distances of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

- For n=5 and n=6, similar patterns are shown.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to select cells in such a way that the differences in their coordinates cover as many possible sums as possible.

Let me think about the possible Manhattan distances in an n x n grid. The smallest possible distance is 0, which is the distance from a cell to itself. The largest possible distance would be between two corners, like (1,1) and (n,n), which would be |1 - n| + |1 - n| = 2*(n-1).

So, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 up to 2*(n-1), inclusive. That gives us a total of 2*n - 1 possible distinct distances.

Wait, let's verify that. For n=2:

Possible distances: 0, 1, 2. That's 2*2 - 1 = 3 distinct distances.

For n=3: 0,1,2,3. That's 2*3 - 1 = 5, but in the example, they have only 4 distances. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, for n=3, the maximum possible distance is between (1,1) and (3,3), which is 4, and the distances can be 0,1,2,3,4, which is 5 distances, but the example only shows 4 distances. Wait, but in the note, it shows distances 0,1,2,3 for n=3.

Wait, maybe with n cells, we can't achieve all possible 2n-1 distances. Maybe there's a different pattern.

Let me think differently. If I choose cells in such a way that no two pairs have the same Manhattan distance, that would be ideal, but I suspect that's not possible for n > 2, because distances can overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps placing the cells along a diagonal or anti-diagonal could maximize the number of distinct distances.

Wait, in the examples:

- n=2: cells (1,1) and (1,2), distances 0 and 1.

- n=3: cells (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), distances 0,1,2,3.

- n=4: cells (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), distances 0,1,2,3,4.

It seems like choosing cells in a way that they are spread out, possibly along rows and columns, to cover more distance sums.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

for i in range(0, int(input())):

n = int(input())

print(1, 1)

print(1, 2)

for i in range(3, n + 1):

print(i, i)

So, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Print (1,1) and (1,2).

- Then for i from 3 to n, print (i,i).

Let's see how this works for n=2:

- Print (1,1) and (1,2). That matches the first example.

For n=3:

- Print (1,1), (1,2), (3,3).

Wait, but in the example, they have (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Which gives distances 0,1,2,3.

In this program's output for n=3:

- (1,1), (1,2), (3,3).

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3

So, distances are 1,3,4, and 0 (for each cell to itself). So, set H = {0,1,3,4}. But for n=3, the example has H = {0,1,2,3}.

So, in this case, the program's output gives H = {0,1,3,4}, whereas the example has H = {0,1,2,3}. So, both have four elements, but different distances.

Is there a problem here? Well, the task is to maximize the size of H, and both have size 4. So, in terms of size, it's the same.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum possible is 5 for n=3, as 2*3 -1 =5, but in the note, it says it's 4. Wait, no, in the note for n=3, H has sizes 0,1,2,3, which is 4.

But earlier I thought 2*3 -1 =5, but maybe not all are achievable simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps with n cells, you can't have 2n-1 distinct distances, because some distances might not be achievable with only n points.

So, maybe the aim is to maximize the number of distinct distances, and for n=3, it's 4.

Wait, but in this program's output for n=3, H={0,1,3,4}, which is size 4, matching the example's size.

So, in terms of the size of H, it's the same as the example.

For n=4, the program would output:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): 5

- Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2

Plus 0 for each cell to itself.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is size 7.

But for n=4, in the example, they have:

(1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): 5

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): 2

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): 1

Plus 0 for each cell to itself.

So, H={0,1,2,3,5,6}, which is size 6.

Wait, in the program's output for n=4, H has size 7, which is better than the example's size 6.

So, perhaps the program's approach is better than the example's.

Wait, but is size 7 the maximum possible for n=4?

Well, 2*4 -1 =7, but I'm not sure if that's achievable.

In this case, the program achieves size 7, which seems optimal.

Another point: for n=2, the program outputs (1,1) and (1,2), H={0,1}, size 2, which is optimal.

For n=3, as earlier, H={0,1,3,4}, size 4.

For n=4, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Wait, in n=4, does the program output (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)?

Wait, no, for n=4, the program outputs:

for n=4:

print(1,1)

print(1,2)

for i in range(3,5):

print(i,i)

So, prints (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4).

Yes, as I considered earlier.

And as I calculated, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Whereas the example for n=4 has H={0,1,2,3,5,6}, size 6.

So, the program's output is better.

Does that mean the program is correct?

Well, I need to generalize this.

Let's see for n=5.

Program's output:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (1,2)-(5,5):7

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- (3,3)-(5,5):4

- (4,4)-(5,5):2

Plus 0 for each cell.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

In the example for n=5, the output is:

1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5

Which gives distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3):2

- (1,1)-(1,4):3

- (1,1)-(2,1):1

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,3)-(1,4):1

- (1,3)-(2,1):2

- (1,3)-(5,5):4

- (1,4)-(2,1):3

- (1,4)-(5,5):5

- (2,1)-(5,5):6

Plus 0 for each.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8}, size 8.

Again, the program's output achieves a larger H.

Similarly, for n=6.

Program's output:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,1)-(6,6):10

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (1,2)-(5,5):7

- (1,2)-(6,6):9

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- (3,3)-(5,5):4

- (3,3)-(6,6):6

- (4,4)-(5,5):2

- (4,4)-(6,6):4

- (5,5)-(6,6):2

Plus 0 for each.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11.

In the example for n=6:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

5 5

6 1

Distances:

- (1,4)-(1,5):1

- (1,4)-(1,6):2

- (1,4)-(5,2):4

- (1,4)-(5,5):2

- (1,4)-(6,1):5

- (1,5)-(1,6):1

- (1,5)-(5,2):4

- (1,5)-(5,5):4

- (1,5)-(6,1):5

- (1,6)-(5,2):4

- (1,6)-(5,5):4

- (1,6)-(6,1):5

- (5,2)-(5,5):3

- (5,2)-(6,1):2

- (5,5)-(6,1):5

Plus 0 for each.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5}, size 6.

Wait, that's significantly smaller than the program's output.

So, the program seems to be achieving a larger H than the example for n >=3.

Is the program correct?

Well, in all these cases, it seems to be achieving a larger H than the example, which suggests that it's correct.

But I need to think about whether this pattern holds for all n.

Let me consider n=1, but n starts from 2, so no need.

For n=2, it's correct.

For n=3, H has size 4, which seems optimal.

For n=4, H has size 7.

Wait, is 7 the maximum possible?

Well, in n=4, the grid is 4x4, and the maximum distance is 6 (between (1,1) and (4,4)).

But in the program's output, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which seems comprehensive.

Wait, but for n=5, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, which seems comprehensive up to the maximum distance of 8.

Similarly, for n=6, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which is comprehensive.

So, it seems like the program's approach is to choose points (1,1), (1,2), and then for each i from 3 to n, choose (i,i).

This seems to be achieving the maximum possible distinct distances in all the cases I've checked.

Is there any n where this approach fails?

Let me consider n=7.

Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,1)-(6,6):10

- (1,1)-(7,7):12

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (1,2)-(5,5):7

- (1,2)-(6,6):9

- (1,2)-(7,7):11

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- (3,3)-(5,5):4

- (3,3)-(6,6):6

- (3,3)-(7,7):8

- (4,4)-(5,5):2

- (4,4)-(6,6):4

- (4,4)-(7,7):6

- (5,5)-(6,6):2

- (5,5)-(7,7):4

- (6,6)-(7,7):2

Plus 0 for each cell.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}, size 13.

Which seems optimal.

I don't see any overlapping distances here.

Wait, but for larger n, might there be overlapping distances?

For example, in n=8:

Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8)

Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,1)-(6,6):10

- (1,1)-(7,7):12

- (1,1)-(8,8):14

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (1,2)-(5,5):7

- (1,2)-(6,6):9

- (1,2)-(7,7):11

- (1,2)-(8,8):13

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- (3,3)-(5,5):4

- (3,3)-(6,6):6

- (3,3)-(7,7):8

- (3,3)-(8,8):10

- (4,4)-(5,5):2

- (4,4)-(6,6):4

- (4,4)-(7,7):6

- (4,4)-(8,8):8

- (5,5)-(6,6):2

- (5,5)-(7,7):4

- (5,5)-(8,8):6

- (6,6)-(7,7):2

- (6,6)-(8,8):4

- (7,7)-(8,8):2

Plus 0 for each cell.

So, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}, size 15.

Again, no overlaps in distances.

It seems like this pattern avoids having any two pairs of points with the same Manhattan distance.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct in maximizing the size of H for any n within the given constraints.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
