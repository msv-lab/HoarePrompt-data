Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before all the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "1010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring. That means I can take a part of the string, say from position l to r, and rotate it so that the last character moves to the front. For example, if I have "1010" and I choose positions 2 to 3, which is "01", cycling it would make it "10", so the whole string becomes "1100". The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. That means I need to arrange the string so that all '0's are before '1's, using as few operations as possible, and each operation costs the length of the substring I shift.

First, I need to understand what operations can do. Cyclic shifting a substring can change the order of characters within that substring. But it's not straightforward how this affects the overall sorting.

Let me think about small examples to get an intuition.

Take "10". To sort it to "01", I can shift the entire string. That costs 2. That makes sense, as in the first test case.

Another example, "0000". It's already sorted, so no operations needed, cost 0.

Third example, "11000". One way is to shift "110" to "011", then "0110" to "0011", and "00110" to "00011". Each shift costs 3, total 9.

Another example, "101011". Maybe shift "1010" to "0101", then "01011" to "00111", total cost 4 + 1 = 5.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 5, which matches.

Last example, "01101001". Not sure, but the sample output is 11.

So, I need to find a general way to calculate the minimum cost for any given binary string.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

I notice that every time I have a '1' before a '0', I need to fix that. So, maybe I can count the number of such inversions.

But it's not just the number of inversions, because shifting a substring can fix multiple inversions at once.

Wait, in the first example, "10" has one inversion, and it costs 2 to fix.

In the third example, "11000" has three inversions: the first '1' with the three '0's, and the second '1' with the three '0's, but since they overlap, maybe it's not independent.

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of '1's that are before '0's and multiply by something.

Wait, in the first example, there's one '1' before one '0', and the cost is 2.

In the third example, there are two '1's before three '0's, so total inversions are 2*3=6, but the cost is 9, which is 6+3, doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the number of '1's before '0's, and each inversion costs 1 to fix, but in the first example, it's cost 2 for one inversion.

Not matching.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can model this as inversion distance, where each shift operation can reduce the number of inversions by a certain amount, and the cost is related to the operation.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it reads the string and processes it in func_1.

In func_1, it iterates through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered so far. Whenever it sees a '0', and there are '1's before it, it adds the number of '1's plus one to the answer.

Wait, in the first test case, "10", it sees '1', n=1, then '0', so ans += 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In "0000", no '1's before any '0', so ans remains 0.

In "11000", it sees '1', n=1, then '1', n=2, then '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 3, then '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 5, then '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 7. Wait, that's not matching the sample output of 9.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, let's simulate it.

For "11000":

- i=0, '1', n=1

- i=1, '1', n=2

- i=2, '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 3, ans=3

- i=3, '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 5, ans=8

- i=4, '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 7, ans=15

Wait, that's 15, but sample output is 9. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n + 1 for each '0' after '1's.

Wait, maybe it's n * something.

Wait, perhaps it's n for each '0', and then add the positions or something.

This seems off.

Wait, maybe it's a different approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to move all '1's to the end. Each cyclic shift can move a '1' closer to the end.

But it's not clear.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the positions where '0's and '1's should be.

In the final sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, for each '1' in the original string, I need to move it after all '0's.

Similarly, for each '0' that is after some '1's, I need to move it before the '1's.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me think about the cost.

Each shift operation costs the length of the substring shifted.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Maybe there's a way to group shifts to minimize the cost.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions, where an inversion is a '1' before a '0'.

But in the first example, one inversion, cost 2.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of '1's before '0's, and the cost is the position difference.

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as reversing substrings, but it's cyclic shifts.

This is different.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of bubble sort, where each shift moves a '0' past a '1'.

But bubble sort swaps adjacent elements, whereas here I can shift larger substrings.

Hmm.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can move a '1' to the right within the shifted substring.

So, if I have "10", shifting the whole string moves the '1' to the end.

Cost is 2.

In "11000", shifting "110" moves it to "011", effectively moving a '0' to the front.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of moving '0's to the front.

Each shift can move a '0' to the front within the shifted substring.

So, perhaps I can count how many '0's need to be moved past '1's.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to bubble sort, where each shift moves a '0' past a '1'.

But in bubble sort, each swap fixes one inversion.

Here, each shift can fix multiple inversions depending on the substring chosen.

But it's tricky.

Let me look back at the provided program.

In func_1, for each '0' encountered after some '1's, it adds n + 1 to the answer, where n is the number of '1's seen so far.

In the first example, "10", n=1, so ans = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches.

In the third example, "11000", it would be:

- see '1', n=1

- see '1', n=2

- see '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 3

- see '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 5

- see '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 7

Total ans = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15, but sample output is 9.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n for each '0', not n + 1.

Let me check.

If it's n for each '0', then for "11000", n=2 for each '0', so 2 * 3 = 6, but sample output is 9.

Still doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's the position of the '0's.

In "11000", positions 0: '1', 1: '1', 2: '0', 3: '0', 4: '0'.

To move the '0' at position 2 to before the '1's, it's like moving it to position 0 or 1.

Similarly for '0's at positions 3 and 4.

But not sure about the exact cost.

Wait, perhaps the cost is the distance each '0' needs to move to reach its sorted position.

But cyclic shifts can move multiple characters at once.

It's confusing.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can be used to move a '0' past a '1'.

Suppose I have "10", shifting the whole string moves it to "01", cost 2.

In "11000", maybe shifting "110" to "011", cost 3, then shifting "0110" to "0011", cost 4, then shifting "00110" to "00011", cost 5, total 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, but sample output is 9, so maybe there's a better way.

Wait, in the note, it says 3 shifts of length 3, each costing 3, total 9.

So, shifting positions 0-2, then 1-4, then 2-4.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, shifting positions 0-2, 1-4, 2-4 costs 3 + 4 + 3 = 10, not 9.

Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps shifting positions 0-2, then 2-4, then 3-4.

Wait, need to check the exact operations.

But anyway, the sample output is 9, and the provided program outputs 9 for this input.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but for "10", it outputs 2, which matches.

For "0000", outputs 0, matches.

For "11000", outputs 9, matches.

For "101011", it should output 5.

Let's simulate it.

"101011"

- i=0, '1', n=1

- i=1, '0', n=1, ans += 1 + 1 = 2

- i=2, '1', n=2

- i=3, '0', n=2, ans += 2 + 1 = 5

- i=4, '1', n=3

- i=5, '1', n=4

Total ans = 2 + 5 = 7, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, maybe it's the number of '1's before each '0', multiplied by something.

Wait, in "101011":

- first '0' at position 1, with one '1' before it -> cost 1 + 1 = 2

- second '0' at position 3, with three '1's before it -> cost 3 + 1 = 4

Total ans = 2 + 4 = 6, but sample output is 5.

Still doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n for the first '0', then n - 1 for the next, and so on.

Wait, in "101011":

- first '0' has one '1' before, so cost 1

- second '0' has three '1's before, so cost 3

Total cost 4, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the minimal cost is equal to the number of pairs of '1's and '0's where '1' is before '0', and each shift can reduce a certain number of such pairs.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of '1's that are before '0's, and the cost is the position difference or something.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider that in the final sorted string, all '0's are before '1's.

So, I need to move all '0's that are after some '1's to before the '1's.

Each cyclic shift can move a '0' past a substring, effectively reducing the number of inversions.

But it's not clear how to minimize the total cost.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the positions where '0's and '1's should be.

For each '0' that needs to be moved, calculate the minimal cost to move it before all '1's.

But it's still complicated.

Let me look back at the provided program.

In func_1, it's adding n + 1 for each '0' encountered after some '1's.

In "101011":

- n=1 for first '0', ans += 1 + 1 = 2

- n=2 for second '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 5

Total ans = 7, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n for the first '0', and n - 1 for the next '0', and so on.

Wait, in "101011":

- first '0' has one '1' before, so n=1, ans += 1

- second '0' has three '1's before, so n=3, ans += 3

Total ans = 4, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

This is perplexing.

Maybe the correct approach is to find the number of '1's before each '0' and sum them up.

In "101011":

- first '0' has one '1' before

- second '0' has three '1's before

Total inversions: 1 + 3 = 4

But sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of '1's after each '0'.

Wait, no, I think it's before.

Wait, maybe it's more complex.

Let me consider that each shift operation can fix multiple inversions.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is less than the number of inversions.

But I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the shifted substrings.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that shifting a substring that contains both '1's and '0's can rearrange them in a way that reduces multiple inversions at once.

So, perhaps shifting a larger substring can be more cost-effective.

But in the first example, shifting the whole string of length 2 costs 2.

In the third example, shifting substrings of length 3 three times costs 9.

In the fourth example, perhaps shifting substrings of total length summing to 5.

I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's before '0's, multiplied by the average position difference or something.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different pattern.

In "10", cost 2.

In "11000", cost 9.

In "101011", cost 5.

In "01101001", cost 11.

Is there a formula that can generate these costs based on the string?

Wait, perhaps it's the number of '1's before '0's, multiplied by the position of the '0's.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of '1's before each '0', summed up.

In "10", it's 1.

In "11000", it's 2 for the first '0', 2 for the second '0', 2 for the third '0', total 6.

But sample output is 9, so doesn't match.

In "101011", it's 1 for the first '0', 3 for the second '0', total 4, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

In "01101001", I need to calculate the number of '1's before each '0'.

- position 0: '0', 0 '1's before

- position 1: '1'

- position 2: '1'

- position 3: '0', 2 '1's before

- position 4: '1'

- position 5: '0', 3 '1's before

- position 6: '0', 3 '1's before

- position 7: '1'

Total: 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 8, but sample output is 11.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the positions of the '0's that are after '1's.

In "101011":

- '0' at position 1, with one '1' before, position 1

- '0' at position 3, with three '1's before, position 3

Total positions: 1 + 3 = 4, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

This is frustrating.

Let me consider that each shift operation can be used to move a '0' past a '1', effectively reducing the number of inversions.

If I can find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost, that would be ideal.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's before '0's, multiplied by the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

But it's still unclear.

Let me think about the provided program again.

In func_1, it's adding n + 1 for each '0' encountered after some '1's.

In "10", it's 1 + 1 = 2, matches.

In "11000", it's 2 + 1 for each '0', three '0's, so 3*(2 + 1) = 9, matches.

In "101011", it's 1 + 1 for the first '0', and 2 + 1 for the second '0', total 2 + 3 = 5, matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I thought it was adding n + 1 for each '0', but in "101011", when it sees the first '0', n=1, so ans += 1 + 1 = 2, then the second '0', n=2, so ans += 2 + 1 = 3, total 5, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in "01101001", let's see:

- i=0, '0', n=0

- i=1, '1', n=1

- i=2, '1', n=2

- i=3, '0', ans += 2 + 1 = 3

- i=4, '1', n=3

- i=5, '0', ans += 3 + 1 = 4, total ans=7

- i=6, '0', ans += 3 + 1 = 4, total ans=11

- i=7, '1', n=4

Total ans=11, matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
