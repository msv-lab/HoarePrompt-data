Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. We need to find out what the sum would be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's think about this step by step.

First, Alice is going to remove elements to maximize the sum. That means she probably wants to remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller numbers would leave larger numbers in the array, which would increase the sum.

But wait, hold on. Actually, it's a bit more complicated because Bob will then be able to flip some of the remaining numbers to negative. So, Alice has to consider what Bob might do after she removes some elements.

Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll try to flip the largest positive numbers to negative to reduce the sum as much as possible.

So, Alice needs to anticipate Bob's moves and perhaps leave a array that, even after Bob flips some elements, the sum is still as large as possible.

This seems like a game theory problem where each player is making optimal moves based on what the other might do.

Let me try to formalize this.

We have an array a1, a2, ..., an. Alice can remove up to k elements, so she chooses which k elements to remove. Then, Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1.

Alice's goal is to maximize the sum after Bob's moves, and Bob's goal is to minimize that sum.

So, the sum after both moves would be sum of the remaining array after Alice's removal and Bob's flipping.

Since Bob flips up to x elements, and he wants to minimize the sum, he'll flip the largest positive elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice needs to consider that Bob will do that, and choose which elements to remove accordingly.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first example in the input:

1

1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1. The array is [1]. Alice can remove up to 1 element, which is the only element, and then Bob can multiply up to 1 element by -1, but there are no elements left, so the sum is 0. That matches the first output.

Second example:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Alice can remove up to 1 element. She wants to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to 1 element.

If she removes the smallest element, which is 1, the array becomes [3,2,4]. Bob will flip the largest element, which is 4, to -4. So, the sum would be 3 + 2 - 4 = 1.

If she removes the largest element, 4, the array is [3,1,2], and Bob will flip the largest, which is 3, to -3. Sum is -3 +1 +2 = 0.

If she removes 2, the array is [3,1,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 +1 -4 = 0.

If she removes 3, the array is [1,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 1 +2 -4 = -1.

So, the best for Alice is to not remove any element. Then, Bob will flip the largest, which is 4 to -4, sum is 3 +1 +2 -4 = 2.

Wait, but according to the explanation, in the second test case, it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, resulting in a sum of 2.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another example:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Alice can remove up to 6 elements. If she removes all, the sum is 0.

If she removes less, Bob can flip up to 3 elements.

But removing all gives sum 0, which might be better than other options.

Wait, in the output, it's 0, which matches removing all elements.

In another case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Alice can remove up to 5 elements. Bob can flip up to 3 elements.

If Alice removes the largest elements, say the two 9's and some others, then Bob will flip the remaining largest positives to negative.

We need to find the optimal strategy.

This seems tricky. Let's try to find a general approach.

I need to think about how Alice and Bob's moves interact.

Alice removes up to k elements. Then, Bob flips up to x elements.

To maximize the sum after Bob's moves, Alice needs to leave an array where, even after Bob flips up to x elements, the sum is as large as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the sum by flipping the largest remaining positive elements.

So, Alice should try to minimize the impact of Bob's flips.

One way to think about this is that Bob will always flip the largest remaining positive elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice should try to remove elements in such a way that the elements Bob can flip are minimized in their impact.

Perhaps it's best for Alice to remove the smallest elements, so that the remaining elements are larger, but then Bob can flip the largest ones.

Wait, but if she removes the smallest elements, the remaining ones are larger, and Bob can flip the largest ones to negative, which would reduce the sum more.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some of the larger elements, then Bob has less impact because the elements he can flip are smaller.

But, by removing larger elements, Alice directly decreases the sum.

So, there's a trade-off between removing smaller elements to keep larger ones for the sum, but allowing Bob to flip larger elements, and removing larger elements to reduce Bob's impact, but decreasing the sum directly.

This is complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of sorting the array and considering different possibilities.

Let's sort the array in descending order.

Then, the largest elements are first.

Alice can choose to remove the last k elements (smallest ones), or some other combination.

Bob will then flip the first x elements to negative.

But since Bob wants to minimize the sum, he'll flip the largest positive elements.

So, if Alice leaves the array sorted descending, Bob will flip the first x elements.

Therefore, the sum would be sum of elements from x+1 to n - sum of elements from 1 to x.

Wait, no. If Bob flips the first x elements to negative, then their contribution to the sum is negative.

Wait, no. If Bob multiplies them by -1, then positive elements become negative, and negative elements become positive.

But in the array, all elements are positive as per the input constraints: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

So, Bob multiplying up to x elements by -1 would turn positive elements into negative ones.

Therefore, to minimize the sum, Bob would choose to flip the x largest positive elements.

Hence, if Alice leaves the array sorted descending, Bob will flip the first x elements.

So, the sum would be sum of elements from x+1 to n - sum of elements from 1 to x.

Wait, no. It's sum of elements from x+1 to n plus sum of elements from 1 to x multiplied by -1.

Wait, no. If Bob flips the first x elements to negative, then in the sum, those elements are now negative.

So, sum = - (sum of first x elements) + sum of remaining elements.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, sum = - sum(a1 to ax) + sum(ax+1 to an).

Alice wants to maximize this sum, knowing that Bob will flip the first x elements.

So, Alice needs to choose which elements to remove to maximize - sum of the first x elements after removal + sum of the remaining elements.

This is getting a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that Alice can remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements.

I need to find the optimal combination of removals and flips to maximize the sum for Alice, considering Bob's minimizing action.

Perhaps I can think in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Alice is effectively choosing to keep n - k elements, and then Bob is flipping up to x of them.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

So, Alice should choose the n - k elements such that after Bob flips up to x of them, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like Alice wants to select n - k elements where the sum of the elements minus twice the sum of the top x elements among them is maximized.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Let S be the set of elements Alice keeps (n - k elements).

Bob will flip the x largest elements in S to negative.

Therefore, the sum after Bob's move is sum(S) - 2 * sum of the top x elements in S.

Alice wants to maximize this: sum(S) - 2 * sum of the top x elements in S.

Which is equivalent to sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in S.

Alice needs to choose S to maximize this expression.

This can be rewritten as sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Sort the array in descending order.

- Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

- To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), perhaps it's best to remove some of the larger elements to reduce the impact of Bob's flips.

Wait, but removing larger elements directly reduces sum(S).

So, it's a trade-off.

Let me consider extreme cases.

If k >= n, Alice removes all elements, sum is 0.

If k = 0, Alice removes nothing, Bob flips up to x elements.

If x >= n, Bob flips all elements to negative, sum is -sum(original array).

But in the problem, x can be up to n.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of choosing which elements to keep and then considering the cost of Bob flipping the top x elements.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice keeps n - k elements.

Bob will flip the top x of those elements to negative.

Therefore, the final sum is sum of the kept elements minus twice the sum of the top x kept elements.

Because flipping them to negative means they contribute negative their value to the sum.

So, sum = sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

Alice wants to maximize this.

So, she wants to maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

This can be rewritten as sum(S) - 2 * (sum(top x in S)).

This seems like she wants to maximize the sum of the remaining elements after subtracting twice the sum of the top x elements.

This is equivalent to sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

But sum(S) - sum(top x in S) is sum of the remaining elements after removing the top x in S.

This seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe another approach: consider all possible subsets of size n - k, and for each subset, compute sum(S) - 2 * sum of the top x elements in S, and choose the subset that maximizes this.

But that's not practical for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the array in descending order.

- Consider that Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

- To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), perhaps it's best to remove some of the elements that Bob would flip.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the elements that Bob will flip.

Bob will flip the top x elements among the ones Alice keeps.

So, to minimize the impact of Bob's flips, Alice should try to keep the elements that, when flipped, cause the least damage to the sum.

In other words, Alice should try to keep elements where the top x elements are as small as possible.

But, at the same time, she wants to keep the sum of S as large as possible.

This seems like a trade-off between keeping large elements to maximize sum(S), but also keeping the top x elements as small as possible to minimize the impact of Bob's flips.

This is tricky.

Maybe I can consider different choices for which elements to remove and compute the resulting sum.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Sort the array in descending order.

- Then, Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

- To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), perhaps it's best to remove the elements that are most beneficial for Bob to flip.

Which elements are most beneficial for Bob to flip? The largest ones, because flipping them reduces the sum the most.

So, if Alice removes the largest elements, that reduces Bob's options to flip large elements.

But, removing large elements also reduces the sum S.

So, Alice needs to find a balance.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to remove the elements that are in the top x if she doesn't remove any.

In other words, remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but not so many that the sum S drops too much.

This seems plausible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose Alice removes the first m elements from the sorted descending array, where m <= k.

Then, the remaining elements are from position m+1 to n.

Bob will flip the top x elements from the remaining elements, which are the largest x from positions m+1 to n.

To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), Alice needs to choose m optimally.

Wait, perhaps not exactly m, but perhaps she removes some elements from the top.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice can remove any k elements, not necessarily the top ones.

But to maximize sum(S), she would want to remove the smallest elements.

But in this case, Bob can flip the top x of the remaining elements.

So, perhaps the best strategy is to remove the smallest k elements, so that the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements, and then Bob flips the top x of them.

But is that optimal?

Wait, maybe not.

Because by removing the smallest elements, she leaves the largest elements, but Bob can flip the largest among them.

So, perhaps she should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But removing largest elements decreases sum(S).

So, it's a trade-off.

This is confusing.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose Alice removes k elements.

Then, Bob flips up to x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

To maximize the final sum, Alice wants to maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

Let me denote S as the set of n - k elements after Alice's removal.

Then, the final sum is sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

Alice wants to maximize this.

This can be rewritten as (sum(S) - sum(top x in S)) - sum(top x in S).

Which is (sum(S) - sum(top x in S)) - sum(top x in S).

Wait, that seems redundant.

Alternatively, think of it as sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

I need to maximize this.

This is equivalent to sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice chooses to remove k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the top x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

So, the final sum is sum of the remaining n - k elements minus twice the sum of the top x elements among them.

So, sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

I need to maximize this over all possible S where S is obtained by removing k elements from the original array.

To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), perhaps I can think of it as sum(S) minus twice the sum of the x largest elements in S.

This seems like a optimization problem that can be tackled by sorting and choosing which elements to remove.

Let me try to sort the array in descending order.

Let's say the sorted array is a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes the last k elements, she removes the smallest k elements, leaving a1 to a(n-k).

Then, Bob will flip the top x elements among the remaining, which are a1 to ax, making them negative, and leaving a(x+1) to a(n-k) as is.

So, the sum would be - (a1 + ... + ax) + (a(x+1) + ... + a(n-k)).

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some other elements, say removing some of the top elements, then the remaining array would have different elements, and Bob would flip the top x among them.

But it's not straightforward.

Maybe the optimal strategy is to remove the smallest k elements, as that leaves the largest possible elements for the sum, and then Bob flips the top x of them.

But perhaps there are cases where removing some of the top elements is better.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=4, k=1, x=1, and array [4,2,3,1].

If Alice removes the smallest element, which is 1, the remaining array is [4,3,2]. Bob flips the largest, which is 4, to -4. Sum is -4 +3 +2 =1.

If Alice removes 2, remaining is [4,3,1], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is -4 +3 +1=0.

If Alice removes 3, remaining is [4,2,1], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is -4 +2 +1=-1.

If Alice removes 4, remaining is [3,2,1], Bob flips 3 to -3, sum is -3 +2 +1=0.

So, the best for Alice is to remove 1, resulting in sum=1.

But according to the initial approach, if Alice removes the smallest element, sum is 1, which is better than removing others.

Another example:

n=4, k=1, x=1, array [3,1,2,4].

Same as the second test case, sum=2.

Wait, in that case, removing nothing and letting Bob flip 4 to -4 gives sum=3+1+2-4=2, which is better than removing any one element.

So, in that case, not removing any element is better.

So, perhaps the initial approach of removing the smallest k elements isn't always optimal.

Wait, in the second test case, removing nothing is better.

So, maybe Alice should sometimes choose to remove fewer than k elements.

But the problem says "remove up to k elements", so she can choose to remove fewer.

In that case, perhaps the optimal strategy is to remove the smallest k elements, but only if it benefits the sum.

But in the second test case, removing nothing is better.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to remove the elements that are least beneficial for Bob to flip.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and then Bob flips up to x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

To maximize the sum after Bob's flips, Alice needs to maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

This can be rewritten as sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

Which is (sum(S) - sum(top x in S)) - sum(top x in S).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

Which is (sum(S) - sum(top x in S)) - sum(top x in S).

The first part, sum(S) - sum(top x in S), is the sum of the remaining elements excluding the top x.

But I'm not sure.

Maybe I need to consider that sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S) can be expressed in terms of the sum of the smallest n - k - x elements minus the sum of the top x elements.

But I'm getting lost.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Alice can choose to remove elements such that the sum after Bob's flips is maximized.

To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), perhaps it's best to minimize sum(top x in S) while maximizing sum(S).

But these are conflicting objectives because sum(S) increases with larger elements, but sum(top x in S) also increases with larger elements.

So, Alice needs to find a balance where the increase in sum(S) outweighs the cost of sum(top x in S).

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider that for each possible number of elements removed, from 0 to k, calculate the sum after Bob's flips, and choose the maximum among these.

In other words, for each m from 0 to k, remove the smallest m elements, and calculate sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S), where S is the remaining n - m elements.

Then, choose the m that maximizes this expression.

This seems feasible.

Given that n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, this approach might be too slow because for each test case, we'd have to iterate over m from 0 to k, which could be up to 2e5 operations per test case.

But since the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2e5, and k can be up to n, it's acceptable as long as the total time is O(n log n) per test case.

Wait, sorting the array would be O(n log n), and then iterating over m from 0 to k would be O(k), which is acceptable since sum of n over all test cases is 2e5.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me try to formalize the expression sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

Suppose the array is sorted in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes the smallest m elements, the remaining elements are a1 to a(n-m).

Then, Bob will flip the top x elements, which are a1 to ax, making them -a1 to -ax.

The sum would be - (a1 + ... + ax) + (a(x+1) + ... + a(n-m)).

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

So, the sum is - sum(a1 to ax) + sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)).

Alice wants to maximize this expression.

Let's denote s = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

We need to maximize s.

To maximize s, we need to maximize sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) and minimize sum(a1 to ax).

But sum(a1 to ax) is minimized when a1 to ax are as small as possible, but a1 to ax are the largest elements, so to minimize sum(a1 to ax), we need to make a1 to ax as small as possible.

But since the array is sorted descending, a1 to ax are the largest elements.

Therefore, to minimize sum(a1 to ax), we need to make a1 to ax as small as possible, which contradicts the sorted order.

Wait, no. Since a1 to ax are the largest elements, to minimize their sum, we need to have them as small as possible, but they are fixed by the array.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Given that a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an, sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) is the sum of the elements from position x+1 to n-m.

To maximize s = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax), we need to maximize the difference between these two sums.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider that for a fixed x, and varying m, the sum s changes.

I need to find m between 0 and k that maximizes s.

Let me try to compute s for m from 0 to k and choose the maximum.

Given that n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, this should be acceptable in terms of time constraints.

So, here's a plan:

- For each test case:

- Read n, k, x and the array a.

- Sort a in descending order.

- Compute prefix sums of the array.

- Let's denote prefix_sum[i] = sum of a1 to ai.

- Then, for each m from 0 to k:

- The sum s = - prefix_sum[x] + (prefix_sum[n-m] - prefix_sum[x])

- Wait, no.

- Wait, if m elements are removed, the remaining elements are a1 to a(n-m).

- So, sum(S) = sum(a1 to a(n-m)).

- Sum of top x in S = sum(a1 to ax).

- Therefore, sum after Bob's flips = sum(S) - 2 * sum(a1 to ax) = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

Wait, no.

Wait, sum(S) = sum(a1 to a(n-m)).

Sum of top x in S = sum(a1 to ax).

Therefore, sum after flips = sum(S) - 2 * sum(a1 to ax) = sum(a1 to a(n-m)) - 2 * sum(a1 to ax) = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) + sum(a1 to ax) - 2 * sum(a1 to ax) = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

So, s = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

To maximize s, we need to maximize sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

This seems like we need to find m such that this difference is maximized.

This is equivalent to sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax) = sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) - sum(a1 to ax).

Given that a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an, sum(a(x+1) to a(n-m)) is the sum of elements from a(x+1) to a(n-m).

Sum(a1 to ax) is the sum of the top x elements.

To maximize s, perhaps m should be chosen such that a(n-m) is as large as possible, but also considering the subtraction of sum(a1 to ax).

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S) can be maximized by choosing S such that the top x elements in S are as small as possible, while keeping sum(S) as large as possible.

In other words, Alice wants to keep elements where the top x elements are small, but the overall sum is large.

This seems like a trade-off.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to remove the elements that are in the top x + k positions.

Wait, maybe not.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided code and see what approach it's taking.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)

ans1 = sum(a)

for i in range(x):

ans1 -= a[i] * 2

ans2 = ans1

for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

print(ans2)

So, let's understand this code.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, k, x and the array a.

It sorts a in descending order.

Then, it computes ans1 as sum(a).

Then, it subtracts 2 * sum of the first x elements from ans1.

This seems like it's assuming that Bob will flip the top x elements.

Then, it sets ans2 to ans1.

Then, it iterates over i from 0 to k-1:

- Adds a[i] back to ans1 (since removing i elements means adding back the removed elements)

- If i + x < n, it subtracts 2 * a[i + x]

- Then, takes the maximum of ans1 and ans2.

Finally, it prints ans2.

Wait, this seems similar to what I was thinking earlier.

Let me try to understand this logic.

Initially, ans1 is sum(a) - 2 * sum(first x elements).

This corresponds to removing no elements (m=0), and Bob flipping the top x elements.

Then, for each m from 1 to k:

- ans1 += a[m-1]: this corresponds to not removing the m-th smallest element, i.e., adding it back to the sum.

- If m + x < n, subtract 2 * a[m + x -1]: this seems to adjust for the new top x elements after adding back a[m-1].

- Then, ans2 keeps track of the maximum ans1 seen so far.

This seems like it's trying to simulate removing m elements, and adjusting the sum accordingly.

But I need to verify if this correctly captures the sum after Bob's flips.

Let me consider the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]

sum(a) = 4+3+2+1=10

ans1 = 10 - 2*(4) = 10 - 8 = 2

ans2 = 2

Then, for i=0 to k-1=0:

ans1 += a[0] = 4 => ans1 = 2 + 4 = 6

since 0 + 1 < 4, ans1 -= 2 * a[0 +1] = 2 * a[1] = 2*3=6 => ans1 = 6 - 6 = 0

ans2 = max(0, 2) = 2

Then, print ans2 = 2, which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

sorted: [1]

ans1 =1 -2*1= -1

ans2=-1

for i=0 to 0:

ans1 +=1 => ans1=0

since 0+1<1 is False, so no subtraction

ans2 = max(0, -1) =0

print 0, which matches the first test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

sorted: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

ans1=21 -2*(6+5+4)=21-2*15=21-30=-9

ans2=-9

then, for i from 0 to 5:

i=0:

ans1 +=6 => -9+6=-3

since 0+3<6, ans1 -=2*a[3]=2*3=6 => -3-6=-9

ans2=max(-9,-9)=-9

i=1:

ans1 +=5 => -9+5=-4

since 1+3<6, ans1 -=2*a[4]=2*2=4 => -4-4=-8

ans2=max(-8,-9)=-8

i=2:

ans1 +=4 => -8+4=-4

since 2+3<6, ans1 -=2*a[5]=2*1=2 => -4-2=-6

ans2=max(-6,-8)=-6

i=3:

ans1 +=3 => -6+3=-3

since 3+3=6 not <6, so no subtraction

ans2=max(-3,-6)=-3

i=4:

ans1 +=2 => -3+2=-1

since 4+3>6, no subtraction

ans2=max(-1,-3)=-1

i=5:

ans1 +=1 => -1+1=0

no subtraction

ans2=max(0,-1)=0

So, it prints 0, which matches the third test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[3,7,3,3,32,15]

sorted: [32,15,7,3,3,3]

sum=32+15+7+3+3+3=63

ans1=63 -2*(32)=63-64=-1

ans2=-1

for i from 0 to 5:

i=0:

ans1 +=32 => -1+32=31

since 0+1<6, ans1 -=2*a[1]=2*15=30 =>31-30=1

ans2=max(1,-1)=1

i=1:

ans1 +=15 =>1+15=16

since 1+1<6, ans1 -=2*a[2]=2*7=14 =>16-14=2

ans2=max(2,1)=2

i=2:

ans1 +=7 =>2+7=9

since 2+1<6, ans1 -=2*a[3]=2*3=6 =>9-6=3

ans2=max(3,2)=3

i=3:

ans1 +=3 =>3+3=6

since 3+1<6, ans1 -=2*a[4]=2*3=6 =>6-6=0

ans2=max(0,3)=3

i=4:

ans1 +=3 =>0+3=3

since 4+1=5<6, ans1 -=2*a[5]=2*3=6 =>3-6=-3

ans2=max(-3,3)=3

i=5:

ans1 +=3 =>-3+3=0

no subtraction

ans2=max(0,3)=3

So, it prints 3, which matches the fourth test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=8, k=5, x=3

a=[5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9]

sorted: [9,9,5,5,3,3,3,2]

sum=9+9+5+5+3+3+3+2=39

ans1=39 -2*(9+9+5)=39-2*23=39-46=-7

ans2=-7

for i=0 to 4:

i=0:

ans1 +=9 =>-7+9=2

since 0+3=3<8, ans1 -=2*a[3]=2*5=10 =>2-10=-8

ans2=max(-8,-7)=-7

i=1:

ans1 +=9 =>-8+9=1

since 1+3=4<8, ans1 -=2*a[4]=2*3=6 =>1-6=-5

ans2=max(-5,-7)=-5

i=2:

ans1 +=5 =>-5+5=0

since 2+3=5<8, ans1 -=2*a[5]=2*3=6 =>0-6=-6

ans2=max(-6,-5)=-5

i=3:

ans1 +=5 =>-6+5=-1

since 3+3=6<8, ans1 -=2*a[6]=2*3=6 =>-1-6=-7

ans2=max(-7,-5)=-5

i=4:

ans1 +=3 =>-7+3=-4

since 4+3=7<8, ans1 -=2*a[7]=2*2=4 =>-4-4=-8

ans2=max(-8,-5)=-5

So, it prints -5, which matches the fifth test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2, x=1

a=[4,3]

sorted: [4,3]

sum=7

ans1=7 -2*4=7-8=-1

ans2=-1

for i=0 to 1:

i=0:

ans1 +=4 =>-1
