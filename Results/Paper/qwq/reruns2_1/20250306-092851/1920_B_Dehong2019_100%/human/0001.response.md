Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Wait, no. Actually, it's not that simple because Bob will then get to flip some signs to minimize the sum.

Let me think differently. Since Bob gets to flip up to x elements to negative, Alice needs to anticipate that. So, Alice should consider which elements Bob might flip and try to minimize the damage.

Wait, maybe I should consider the final sum after both players have made their moves. The sum will be the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals, with up to x of them negated by Bob.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice wants to keep the largest possible elements and remove the smallest ones, but Bob will flip the most positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Hmm. This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum considering that Bob will minimize it.

Let me consider the array sorted in descending order. So, the largest elements are first.

If Alice removes the smallest elements, that would be the end of the array. But Bob can flip up to x elements to negative. So, he would flip the most positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Wait, but if Alice removes some elements, she might want to remove those that Bob would otherwise flip.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at some examples.

Take the first example in the input:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1, array=[1]

Alice can remove up to 1 element, which is the only one, so she removes it. Then, Bob has no elements left to flip, so the sum is 0. That makes sense.

Second example:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Alice can remove up to 1 element. She wants to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to 1 element.

If she removes the smallest element, which is 1, the array becomes [3,2,4]. Bob can flip one element; he'll flip the largest one to negative to minimize the sum, so he flips 4 to -4. Sum is 3 + 2 + (-4) = 1.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, if Alice removes 4, the array is [3,1,2]. Bob flips 3 to -3. Sum is -3 +1 +2 = 0, which is worse for Alice.

If Alice removes 2, array is [3,1,4]. Bob flips 4 to -4. Sum is 3 +1 +(-4) = 0.

If Alice removes 3, array is [1,2,4]. Bob flips 4 to -4. Sum is 1 +2 +(-4) = -1.

So, the best for Alice is to not remove any element.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 +1 +2 +(-4) = 2.

But according to my calculation, if Alice removes nothing, Bob flips the largest element, which is 4, to -4, sum is 2.

If Alice removes any element, the sum is less than or equal to 2.

So, Alice should not remove any elements to maximize the sum.

Got it. So, in this case, Alice chooses not to remove any elements.

Another example:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Alice can remove up to 6 elements. If she removes all, sum is 0.

But according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, but she can remove up to 6, but she might not want to remove all.

After removing some elements, Bob can flip up to 3 elements to negative.

I need to find the optimal number of elements Alice should remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements. Then, Bob flips x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

I need to choose k elements to remove such that the sum of the remaining n - k elements, with x of them flipped to negative, is maximized.

To maximize this sum, I need to minimize the negative impact of Bob's flips.

Bob will flip the x largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

So, if Alice removes the x largest elements, then Bob can't flip any, and the sum is the sum of the remaining elements.

But, Alice might not want to remove all x largest elements; she needs to balance between removing small elements and keeping large elements that Bob might flip.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array in descending order and consider the first n - k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the first x of these elements to negative.

Wait, no. If Alice removes k elements, the remaining n - k elements are sorted in descending order, and Bob will flip the first x elements to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of elements from x+1 to n - k plus sum of negative of elements from 1 to x.

But I need to consider that Alice can choose which k elements to remove.

So, perhaps it's better to iterate over the possible number of removals, from 0 to k, and choose the one that maximizes the sum after Bob's flips.

Wait, maybe I should fix the number of elements Alice removes and compute the sum after Bob's flips.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes the last k elements, the remaining elements are a1 to a(n - k).

Then, Bob will flip the first x of these to negative.

So, the sum would be sum from x+1 to n - k of a_i plus sum from 1 to x of (-a_i).

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

So, if the array is sorted in descending order, he'll flip a1 to ax to negative.

Therefore, the sum would be sum from x+1 to n - k of a_i plus sum from 1 to x of (-a_i).

Alice needs to choose k (from 0 to k) to maximize this sum.

So, I need to iterate over k from 0 to K (given k), compute the sum for each k, and choose the maximum sum.

Wait, but k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, so she can choose any number from 0 to k.

Wait, no, k is the exact number of elements she removes. Wait, the problem says "remove up to k elements", so she can remove from 0 to k elements.

Wait, let's read the problem again.

"First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array."

So, Alice can choose to remove anywhere from 0 to k elements.

So, I need to consider all possibilities of removing 0 to k elements and choose the one that maximizes the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

So, for each possible number of removals r (from 0 to k), compute the sum after removing r smallest elements and Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative.

Wait, but in the sorted array, the largest elements are first.

So, if Alice removes r elements, she should remove the smallest ones, which are the last r elements in the sorted array.

Then, the remaining elements are a1 to a(n - r).

Bob will flip the x largest among these, which are a1 to ax, to negative.

So, the sum would be sum from x+1 to n - r of a_i plus sum from 1 to x of (-a_i).

I need to compute this sum for each r from 0 to k and choose the maximum sum.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, let's formalize this.

Let's sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

For each r from 0 to k:

sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i)

Choose the maximum sum_r over r from 0 to k.

Wait, but if r + x > n, then sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} would be empty, which is 0.

Wait, need to handle that carefully.

Also, need to ensure that n - r >= x, otherwise Bob can't flip x elements.

If n - r < x, then Bob flips all n - r elements to negative.

So, need to adjust the sum accordingly.

Wait, in code, I need to handle cases where r > n - x, because if r > n - x, then after removing r elements, there are less than x elements left, and Bob will flip all of them to negative.

So, perhaps it's better to iterate r from 0 to min(n - x, k), and compute the sum accordingly.

Wait, no, need to think again.

Let me consider:

- If r <= n - x, then after removing r elements, there are n - r elements left, and Bob can flip x of them.

So, sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i)

- If r > n - x, then n - r < x, meaning Bob can flip all remaining n - r elements to negative.

So, sum_r = sum_{i=n - r + 1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to n - r} (-a_i) = 0 + sum_{i=1 to n - r} (-a_i) = -sum_{i=1 to n - r} a_i

Wait, but n - r < x, so Bob flips all remaining n - r elements to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removal, with all of them flipped to negative.

Wait, no.

Wait, after Alice removes r elements, there are n - r elements left.

Bob can flip up to x elements to negative, but if n - r < x, he can only flip n - r elements.

So, he'll flip all n - r elements to negative.

Therefore, the sum would be -sum of the remaining n - r elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, Bob wants to minimize the sum.

So, if he can flip up to x elements to negative, but n - r < x, he'll flip all n - r elements to negative.

Thus, the sum would be -sum of the remaining n - r elements.

Wait, but if he flips all n - r elements to negative, the sum is -sum of those elements.

But, if n - r >= x, then he flips the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, in that case, sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i)

And if n - r < x, then sum_r = -sum_{i=1 to n - r} a_i

So, in code, I need to handle these two cases separately.

Therefore, for each r from 0 to k:

if r <= n - x:

sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i)

else:

sum_r = -sum_{i=1 to n - r} a_i

Then, choose the maximum sum_r over r from 0 to k.

Wait, but I need to make sure that r <= k and r <= n.

Also, r >= 0.

So, r ranges from 0 to min(k, n)

And in the case where n - r < x, which is equivalent to r > n - x, then sum_r = -sum_{i=1 to n - r} a_i

Otherwise, sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i - sum_{i=1 to x} a_i

Wait, sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i) is -sum_{i=1 to x} a_i

Yes.

So, in code, I can sort the array in descending order.

Then, precompute the prefix sums.

Let's define prefix_sum[j] = sum of a1 to aj.

Then, sum_{i=1 to x} a_i = prefix_sum[x]

sum_{i=x+1 to m} a_i = prefix_sum[m] - prefix_sum[x]

So, for each r from 0 to k:

if r <= n - x:

sum_r = (prefix_sum[n - r] - prefix_sum[x]) - prefix_sum[x]

else:

sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

Then, choose the maximum sum_r over r from 0 to k.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i = prefix_sum[n - r] - prefix_sum[x]

sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i) = -prefix_sum[x]

So, sum_r = (prefix_sum[n - r] - prefix_sum[x]) + (-prefix_sum[x]) = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, no:

sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i + sum_{i=1 to x} (-a_i) = (prefix_sum[n - r] - prefix_sum[x]) + (-prefix_sum[x]) = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

Wait, that seems correct.

And if r > n - x, then sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

So, in code, I can precompute the prefix sums.

Sort the array in descending order.

Then, for each r from 0 to k:

if r <= n - x:

sum_r = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

else:

sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

Then, choose the maximum sum_r over r from 0 to k.

Wait, but in the case where n - r < x, which is r > n - x, sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

Otherwise, sum_r = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

Yes.

Also, need to handle the case when n - r < x, which is r > n - x.

Wait, in the first case, when r <= n - x, sum_r = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

In the second case, when r > n - x, sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

So, in code, I need to iterate r from 0 to k, and for each r, compute sum_r accordingly.

Then, choose the maximum sum_r.

Wait, but in the second case, when r > n - x, which is equivalent to n - r < x, sum_r = -prefix_sum[n - r]

Yes.

Also, need to make sure that n - r >= 0, i.e., r <= n.

But since r <= k and k <= n, this is already satisfied.

Wait, but in the code, need to make sure that n - r <= n.

Ok, moving on.

So, in code, I can precompute the prefix sums.

Sort the array in descending order.

Then, iterate r from 0 to k, compute sum_r as above, and keep track of the maximum sum_r.

Finally, print the maximum sum_r for each test case.

Let me see if this logic holds with the sample input.

First test case:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1, array=[1]

Sort descending: [1]

prefix_sum = [1]

For r=0:

since r <= n - x => 0 <= 1 - 1 => 0 <= 0, so sum_r = prefix_sum[1 - 0] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = prefix_sum[1] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = 1 - 2*1 = -1

For r=1:

since r > n - x => 1 > 1 - 1 => 1 > 0, so sum_r = -prefix_sum[1 - 1] = -prefix_sum[0] = 0

So, maximum sum_r is max(-1, 0) = 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Sort descending: [4,3,2,1]

prefix_sum = [4, 7, 9,10]

For r=0:

r <= 4 - 1 => 0 <= 3, so sum_r = prefix_sum[4 - 0] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = 10 - 2*4 = 10 - 8 = 2

For r=1:

r > 4 - 1 => 1 > 3? No, so sum_r = prefix_sum[4 - 1] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = 9 - 8 = 1

So, maximum sum_r is max(2,1) = 2, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Third test case:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Sort descending: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

prefix_sum = [6,11,15,18,20,21]

For r=0:

r <= 6 - 3 => 0 <= 3, sum_r = prefix_sum[6 - 0] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 21 - 2*15 = 21 - 30 = -9

For r=1:

sum_r = prefix_sum[5] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 20 - 30 = -10

For r=2:

sum_r = prefix_sum[4] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 18 - 30 = -12

For r=3:

sum_r = prefix_sum[3] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 15 - 30 = -15

For r=4:

sum_r = prefix_sum[2] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 11 - 30 = -19

For r=5:

sum_r = prefix_sum[1] - 2 * prefix_sum[3] = 6 - 30 = -24

For r=6:

sum_r = -prefix_sum[0] = 0

So, maximum sum_r is max(-9,-10,-12,-15,-19,-24,0) = 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

2 2 1

4 3

Sort descending: [4,3]

prefix_sum = [4,7]

For r=0:

r <= 2 - 1 => 0 <=1, sum_r = prefix_sum[2 - 0] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = 7 - 2*4 = 7 - 8 = -1

For r=1:

r <= 1? 1 <=1, sum_r = prefix_sum[1] - 2 * prefix_sum[1] = 7 - 8 = -1

For r=2:

sum_r = -prefix_sum[0] = 0

So, maximum sum_r is max(-1,-1,0) = 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

2 1 2

1 3

Sort descending: [3,1]

prefix_sum = [3,4]

For r=0:

r <= 2 - 2 => 0 <=0, sum_r = prefix_sum[2 - 0] - 2 * prefix_sum[2] = 4 - 2*4 = 4 - 8 = -4

But wait, x=2, n=2, r=0, n - r =2 >=x=2, so sum_r = sum_{i=2+1 to 2} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=1 to 2} a_i = 0 - 2*4 = -8

Wait, but according to the earlier formula, sum_r = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

Which is prefix_sum[2] - 2 * prefix_sum[2] = 4 - 8 = -4

But according to the explanation, it should be -8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, if n - r >=x, then sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i - sum_{i=1 to x} a_i

So, when n - r >=x, sum_r = (prefix_sum[n - r] - prefix_sum[x]) - prefix_sum[x] = prefix_sum[n - r] - 2 * prefix_sum[x]

But in this case, n - r =2 >=x=2, so sum_r = prefix_sum[2] - 2 * prefix_sum[2] =4 - 8=-4

But according to the sample output, it should be -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in this case, x=2, n=2, r=0, so after Alice removes 0 elements, Bob flips the top 2 elements to negative.

So, sum is -3 + (-1) = -4, which matches the formula.

But sample output is -1, which suggests that Alice should remove one element.

Wait, sample output is -1 for the last test case.

Wait, let's look back.

Wait, the last test case is:

2 1 2

1 3

So, n=2, k=1, x=2, array=[1,3]

Sort descending: [3,1]

For r=0:

sum_r = prefix_sum[2] - 2 * prefix_sum[2] =4 -8=-4

For r=1:

since r > n - x =>1 > 2 -2 =>1 >0, so sum_r = -prefix_sum[1] = -3

For r=2:

sum_r = -prefix_sum[0] =0

But k=1, so r can be 0 or 1.

So, sum_r for r=0: -4

sum_r for r=1: -3

Maximum is -3, but sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, Bob can flip up to x elements, but he doesn't have to flip all x elements.

Wait, the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", meaning he can flip any number from 0 to x elements.

So, in my earlier reasoning, I assumed he flips all x elements.

But actually, he can choose to flip fewer elements to minimize the sum.

Wait, this changes things.

So, Bob can choose to flip any number from 0 to x elements.

So, in the earlier approach, I considered that Bob flips x elements, but actually, he can choose to flip fewer.

So, I need to adjust the sum accordingly.

This complicates things.

Let me think again.

If Alice removes r elements, then Bob can flip up to x elements from the remaining n - r elements.

To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

Wait, no.

Wait, Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

But he can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

So, if the remaining array has positive and negative elements, he might choose to flip only some of them.

Wait, but in this problem, the array elements are initially positive integers.

So, after Alice removes some elements, the remaining elements are positive.

Bob can choose to flip up to x of them to negative to minimize the sum.

So, he'll flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

Wait, but he can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

But, since flipping any positive element to negative reduces the sum, his best strategy is to flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

Wait, but if x is less than the number of remaining elements, and the remaining elements include both positive and negative, but since initially all elements are positive, after Alice's removal, they're still positive.

So, Bob will flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

Wait, but in my earlier example, for the last test case:

n=2, k=1, x=2, array=[1,3]

After Alice removes 0 elements, Bob can flip up to 2 elements.

He'll flip both 3 and 1 to negative, sum is -3 + (-1) = -4

If Alice removes one element, say 1, then Bob flips up to 2 elements from the remaining [3], so he flips 3 to -3, sum is -3

If Alice removes the other element, 3, then Bob flips up to 2 elements from [1], flips 1 to -1, sum is -1

If Alice removes both elements, sum is 0

So, the maximum among -4, -3, -1, 0 is 0, but the sample output is -1.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, it's -1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, the sample output for the last test case is -1.

But according to my calculation, the maximum is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the problem.

Wait, the problem says "find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally."

So, Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it.

In the last test case:

If Alice removes 0 elements, Bob flips both 3 and 1 to negative, sum is -4

If Alice removes 1 element:

- If she removes 1, sum is -3

- If she removes 3, sum is -1

If Alice removes 2 elements, sum is 0

So, the best for Alice is to remove 3, getting sum -1, which is better than -3 or -4.

Hence, the output is -1.

But according to my earlier formula, I was getting sum_r for r=0: -4, r=1: -3, r=2:0

But according to the sample, it's -1.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

In the case where n - r < x, Bob can flip all n - r elements, but he can also choose to flip fewer.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "multiply at most x elements by -1", which means he can flip any number from 0 to x elements.

So, in the case where n - r < x, he can flip up to n - r elements.

But in reality, since he wants to minimize the sum, he'll always flip the x largest elements available.

Wait, but in the last test case, when Alice removes 3, leaving [1], Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but there's only one element left, so he flips it to -1.

Hence, sum is -1.

Similarly, if Alice removes 1, leaving [3], Bob flips it to -3.

If Alice removes both, sum is 0.

So, the maximum among -3, -1, 0 is 0, but the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, the sample output is -1 for the last test case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Alice can choose to remove any subset of up to k elements, and Bob will then flip up to x elements from the remaining.

So, in this case, Alice can choose to remove 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum is -1.

Alternatively, she can remove 1, leaving [3], Bob flips it to -3.

Or remove both, sum is 0.

So, the best for Alice is to remove 3, getting sum -1, which is better than -3 or 0.

Hence, the output should be -1.

But according to my earlier formula, for r=1, sum_r = prefix_sum[1] - 2 * prefix_sum[2]

Wait, no, for r=1, n - r =1, x=2, since r > n -x =>1 > 2 -2 =>1 >0, so sum_r = -prefix_sum[1] = -3

But in reality, when r=1, and Alice removes 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum is -1.

Wait, so my formula is incorrect in this case.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in the case where r > n - x, which is r > n - x, meaning n - r < x, Bob can flip all n - r elements to negative.

So, sum_r should be -sum of the remaining n - r elements.

In the last test case, for r=1, n - r =1, x=2, since 1 < 2, Bob flips both remaining 1 element to negative, sum is -1.

But according to my earlier formula, sum_r = -prefix_sum[1] = -3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the array [3,1], after removing 1, remaining is [3], Bob flips it to -3, sum is -3.

But according to the earlier reasoning, when r=1, n - r =1 < x=2, so sum_r = -prefix_sum[1] = -3.

But in reality, when Alice removes 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1.

So, sum is -1.

Wait, there's a mismatch here.

It seems that my formula doesn't account for choosing which elements to remove.

In the formula, for r=1, sum_r = -prefix_sum[1] = -3, but in reality, if Alice removes the smallest element, which is 1, Bob flips the remaining [3] to -3, sum is -3.

If Alice removes 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum is -1.

So, the maximum among -3 and -1 is -1, which matches the sample output.

Hence, in this case, my formula gives -3 for sum_r when r=1, but in reality, it can be -1.

So, my formula is incomplete.

I need to adjust it to consider that when r > n - x, Bob can flip all remaining n - r elements to negative, but Alice can choose which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

In this case, when r=1, n - r =1 < x=2, so Bob flips all remaining 1 element to negative.

But, Alice can choose which element to remove.

So, to maximize the sum after Bob's flips, Alice should remove the element that, when removed, leads to the highest sum after Bob flips the remaining elements.

In the last test case, if Alice removes 3, sum is -1, and if she removes 1, sum is -3.

So, she chooses to remove 3, getting sum -1.

Hence, the formula needs to consider that Alice can choose which elements to remove, not just how many.

But in my earlier approach, I assumed that Alice removes the smallest r elements.

But in this case, removing the smallest element leads to a worse sum.

So, perhaps I need to adjust which elements Alice removes.

Wait, but the problem allows Alice to remove any subset of up to k elements.

So, in general, Alice needs to choose which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

This seems more complicated than just removing the smallest r elements.

I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that after Alice removes r elements, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice should prevent Bob from flipping the largest elements.

Hence, she should remove some of the largest elements that Bob would flip.

This seems counterintuitive at first, but in some cases, it's better to remove larger elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

In the last test case, if Alice removes 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum is -1.

If she removes 1, leaving [3], Bob flips it to -3, sum is -3.

So, removing the larger element (3) leads to a better sum (-1 vs -3).

Hence, in some cases, it's better to remove larger elements.

Wait, but in other cases, it's better to remove smaller elements.

So, I need a general approach to decide which elements Alice should remove.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove any r elements, up to k.

But iterating over all possible subsets is not feasible due to time constraints.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the elements sorted in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes the smallest r elements, i.e., a(n - r +1) to a(n), then Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements, which are a1 to ax.

So, sum_r = sum_{i=x+1 to n - r} a_i - sum_{i=1 to x} a_i

Wait, but in the last test case, when r=1, sum_r = a2 - (a1 + a2) = a2 - a1 - a2 = -a1

Which is -3, matching the earlier calculation.

But in reality, Alice can choose to remove a1=3, leaving a2=1, Bob flips it to -1, sum is -1, which is better.

So, in this case, removing a1 leads to a better sum than removing a2.

Hence, my formula assumes that Alice removes the smallest r elements, but in reality, she can choose to remove any r elements.

So, perhaps I need to consider removing the r elements that, when removed, lead to the maximum sum after Bob's flips.

This seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting n - r elements to keep, and then Bob flips up to x of them to negative.

So, Alice chooses which n - r elements to keep, and Bob flips up to x of them to negative.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

This is similar to selecting a subset of n - r elements and then subtracting twice the sum of the x largest elements in that subset.

Wait, because flipping the x largest to negative is equivalent to subtracting twice their values from the total sum.

Hence, the sum would be sum of the selected subset minus twice the sum of the x largest elements in the subset.

Wait, but this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let S be the set of elements Alice keeps (n - r elements).

Bob will flip the x largest elements in S to negative.

Hence, the sum is sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in S.

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

So, she needs to choose S to maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in S.

This is equivalent to choosing S to maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in S.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider sorting the elements and then choosing which elements to keep.

Let me think about the greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the elements in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Then, the x largest elements are a1 to ax.

If Alice keeps a subset S of size n - r, then sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest in S.

To maximize this, Alice needs to balance between keeping large elements (which increase sum(S)) and keeping smaller elements (to minimize the impact of Bob flipping the x largest).

This seems like a trade-off.

Perhaps it's optimal for Alice to keep the elements from position p to p + n - r - 1 in the sorted list, for some p.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the overall sum.

The sum after Alice's removal and Bob's flips is equal to the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, it's the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removal, with up to x of them flipped to negative.

So, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Hence, the sum is sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative, then the sum becomes sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Because flipping an element to negative is equivalent to subtracting twice its value from the sum.

Hence, sum = sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(top x of remaining)

So, to maximize this sum, Alice needs to choose which elements to remove to maximize sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(top x of remaining).

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to iterate over the possible number of elements Alice removes, and for each possible removal, compute the sum after Bob's flips.

But as we've seen, it's not sufficient to just remove the smallest r elements; Alice needs to strategically remove elements to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

This seems too time-consuming for large n and k.

Given the time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that the optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the impact of Bob's flips.

In other words, remove the elements that Bob would flip anyway.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that Bob would flip if she doesn't remove them.

So, if Alice removes the elements that Bob would flip, then Bob can't flip them, and the sum might be higher.

This seems like a plausible strategy.

Hence, Alice should remove the x largest elements, so that Bob can't flip them to negative.

But, she can remove up to k elements, so she should remove the elements that would cause the least harm after Bob's flips.

Wait, this is still confusing.

Let me consider that Alice should remove the elements that, if Bob flips them, cause the most decrease in the sum.

Hence, she should remove the x largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But, she can remove up to k elements, so she should remove the top min(k,x) largest elements.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me test this with the last test case.

n=2, k=1, x=2, array=[1,3]

If Alice removes the largest element, 3, then Bob flips the remaining 1 to -1, sum is -1.

If she removes the smallest element, 1, Bob flips 3 to -3, sum is -3.

Hence, removing the largest element leads to a better sum.

So, in this case, removing the largest element is better.

Another test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

If Alice removes the largest element, 4, Bob flips the next largest, 3, to -3, sum is -3 +1 +2 = 0

If she removes the smallest element, 1, Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 +2 +(-4)=1

If she removes nothing, Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 +1 +2 +(-4)=2

Hence, the best is to remove nothing, sum=2.

So, in this case, removing nothing is better than removing the largest or smallest element.

Hence, the strategy of always removing the largest elements isn't optimal.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Alice should remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the sum of the remaining elements after Bob flips the x largest remaining elements.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I can model this as choosing r elements to remove such that the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This can be written as:

max_{S subset of [n], |S|=n - r} (sum_{i in S} a_i - 2 * sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i)

Where top_x(S) are the x largest elements in S.

This is equivalent to:

sum_{i in S} a_i - 2 * sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i - sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i - sum_{i in top_x(S)} a_i

Wait, that seems redundant.

Alternatively, it's sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

This can be rewritten as:

sum(S) - 2 * sum(top_x(S)) = sum(S) - sum(top_x(S)) - sum(top_x(S)) = (sum(S) - sum(top_x(S))) - sum(top_x(S)) = sum(S \ top_x(S)) - sum(top_x(S))

Which is sum of the elements not in the top_x(S) minus sum of the top_x(S).

This still seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the final sum is equal to sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements after Alice's removal.

Hence, sum = sum(all) - 2 * sum(top_x after removal)

Alice wants to maximize this sum, which is equivalent to minimizing sum(top_x after removal).

Hence, Alice should remove the x largest elements to minimize sum(top_x after removal).

Wait, but she can remove up to k elements.

So, if k >= x, she can remove the x largest elements, making sum(top_x after removal) = sum of the next x largest elements.

If k < x, she can remove k largest elements, and Bob will flip the x - k largest remaining elements.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

If Alice removes the k largest elements, then the remaining elements are a_{k+1} to a_n.

Bob will flip the x largest among these to negative.

Hence, sum = sum(a_{k+1} to a_n) - 2 * sum(top_x of a_{k+1} to a_n)

But, in reality, Alice can choose which k elements to remove, not necessarily the largest k.

She needs to choose which k elements to remove to maximize sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(top_x of remaining)

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that Alice should remove the x largest elements if k >= x, to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But in the last test case, k=1, x=2, n=2.

If Alice removes 1 element, she can remove either 1 or 3.

If she removes 1, remaining is [3], Bob flips it to -3, sum=-3

If she removes 3, remaining is [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum=-1

Hence, removing 3 is better.

But in this case, removing the largest element is better.

Similarly, in the second test case, removing nothing is better.

Hence, I need a general strategy.

Let me consider that Alice should remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Hence, she should remove the elements that are in the top x of the remaining.

So, she should remove elements from the top x if possible.

Wait, but in the second test case, removing nothing is better.

Wait, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me consider that Alice should remove elements from the top x + 1 to top x + k.

Wait, that might make sense.

Let me think.

If Alice removes the top x + 1 to top x + k, then the top x remaining are the original top x.

But Bob will flip the top x remaining to negative.

Hence, by removing elements below the top x, she doesn't affect Bob's ability to flip the top x.

But in the last test case, removing a top element (3) improves the sum.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that Alice should remove elements that are potential candidates for Bob's flips.

Hence, she should remove elements that are large enough to be in the top x after her
