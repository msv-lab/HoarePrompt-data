Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what XOR means. XOR, or exclusive or, is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Okay, so the problem is about subdividing a subarray into multiple parts where each part has the same XOR value. The subarray is from index l to r, and I need to check if it's possible to split this subarray into at least two consecutive segments where the XOR of each segment is equal.

Let me think about how to approach this. I know that XOR is associative, meaning that the way we group the numbers doesn't matter. So, XORing a sequence of numbers can be done in any order.

I recall that for XOR, if I have a prefix XOR array, where pf[i] is the XOR of all elements from the start up to index i, then the XOR of elements from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] gives me the XOR of the subarray from l to r.

Now, I need to divide this subarray into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value. Let's say I divide the subarray into k parts, each with XOR equal to some value y.

Since the XOR of the entire subarray is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times), and for XOR, if k is even, this becomes 0, and if k is odd, it's y.

Wait, that's an important observation. If k is even, the total XOR is 0, and if k is odd, it's y.

But in our case, we need to have k > 1, so k can be 2,3,4,...

So, if k is 2, total XOR is 0.

If k is 3, total XOR is y.

If k is 4, total XOR is 0.

And so on.

But actually, wait a minute. Let's think differently.

Suppose the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r is X. If I can split this subarray into k parts where each part has XOR equal to Y, then:

- If k is even, X = 0.

- If k is odd, X = Y.

But in our problem, we need to have k > 1.

So, if k is 2, X = 0.

If k is 3, X = Y.

If k is 4, X = 0.

Wait, but Y is the XOR of each part, and Y should be equal for all parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total XOR being equal to Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

But the problem is to have at least two parts, and all parts have the same XOR value.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider an example.

Take the example from the problem:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5: subarray is [1,1,2,3,0]

We can split it into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and XOR of each is 1,1,1, so yes, it's interesting.

Another query: l=2, r=4: subarray is [1,2,3]

We can split it into [1,2],[3], XOR is 3 and 3, so yes.

Another query: l=3, r=5: [2,3,0]

We can't split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, can we?

If I split it into [2,3],[0], XOR is 1 and 0, which are not equal.

Or [2],[3,0], XOR is 2 and 3 XOR 0 = 3, which are not equal.

Or [2],[3],[0], XOR are 2,3,0, which are not equal.

So, no, it's not interesting.

Another query: l=1, r=3: [1,1,2]

Possible splits:

[1],[1,2], XOR are 1 and 1 XOR 2 = 3, not equal.

[1,1],[2], XOR are 0 and 2, not equal.

So, no, not interesting.

Another query: l=3, r=4: [2,3], XOR are 2 and 3, not equal.

So, not interesting.

From this, it seems that for the subarray to be interesting, there should be at least two parts with equal XOR.

But looking back at the first query, l=1 to r=5, [1,1,2,3,0], we can split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR=1.

Similarly, l=2 to r=4, [1,2,3], split into [1,2],[3], both with XOR=3.

So, in both cases where it's "YES," we have splits where each part has the same XOR.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need a way to check, for a given subarray from l to r, whether it's possible to split it into at least two consecutive segments where the XOR of each segment is equal.

I need an efficient way to do this, considering the constraints: n and q can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is limited to 2e5.

So, per test case, n + q <= 2e5 in total.

Thus, overall time complexity should be O(n + q).

Now, how to approach this?

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts where each part has the same XOR value, say Y.

Then, the total XOR of the subarray would be Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

Wait, no.

Wait, XOR is associative and commutative.

So, if I have k parts, each with XOR Y, then the total XOR is Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y.

If k is even, this is 0.

If k is odd, this is Y.

So, in our case, if k is even, the total XOR should be 0.

If k is odd, the total XOR should be Y.

But in our problem, we need to have k > 1.

So, if k is even, total XOR should be 0.

If k is odd, total XOR should be Y.

But Y is not zero, because Y is the XOR of at least one element.

Wait, no, Y could be zero.

Wait, if Y is zero, then any k would make the total XOR zero.

But in that case, k can be any even number or odd number.

But in our problem, k > 1.

So, in summary:

- If the total XOR from l to r is 0, then it's possible to split it into an even number of parts, each with XOR Y, where Y can be zero.

- If the total XOR from l to r is Y (non-zero), then it's possible to split it into an odd number of parts greater than 1, each with XOR Y.

Wait, but Y is the same for all parts.

Wait, in the first case, if total XOR is 0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

In the second case, if total XOR is Y (non-zero), then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts greater than 1 with each part having XOR Y.

But is this always true?

Let me think about it.

Suppose the total XOR from l to r is 0.

Then, to split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR, each part should have XOR Y, and since k is even, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = 0.

Which matches the total XOR.

Similarly, if total XOR is Y (non-zero), and k is odd and greater than 1, then Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = Y.

Because Y XOR Y = 0, and 0 XOR Y = Y, and so on.

So, the condition seems to hold.

But, is this sufficient? That is, if the total XOR is 0, can I always split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR?

And if the total XOR is Y (non-zero), can I always split it into an odd number of parts greater than 1 with each part having XOR Y?

I think not necessarily.

I need to ensure that such a split exists.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider the prefix XORs.

Let pf[i] be the XOR of elements from the start up to index i.

Then, the XOR of a subarray from i to j is pf[j] XOR pf[i-1].

Now, if I want to split the subarray from l to r into k parts, each with XOR Y, then:

- For k even, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y = 0, which matches pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0.

- For k odd, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y = Y, which should match pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y.

So, in the case where pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, I need to split into an even number of parts.

In the case where pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, I need to split into an odd number of parts greater than 1.

But I need to ensure that such a split exists.

How can I check if such a split exists?

One way is to look for intermediate points where the cumulative XOR up to that point is equal to Y.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the XOR of a segment is Y, so I need to find points where the cumulative XOR differs by Y.

Let me think about this more carefully.

Suppose I have pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y.

I need to split the subarray into segments where each segment has XOR Y.

So, starting from l, I need to find a point m1 such that pf[m1] XOR pf[l-1] = Y.

Then, from m1+1 to m2, pf[m2] XOR pf[m1] = Y, and so on.

So, in other words, I need to find points m1, m2, ... where pf[m1] = pf[l-1] XOR Y, pf[m2] = pf[m1] XOR Y, and so on.

This seems like a way to find the split points.

But I need to ensure that there are at least two such parts.

So, for the subarray from l to r:

- If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, then I need to split it into an even number of parts, each with XOR Y.

- If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, then I need to split it into an odd number of parts greater than 1, each with XOR Y.

But in both cases, I need to ensure that there are at least two parts.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, then it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

But I need to ensure that there is at least one such split.

Similarly, if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, then I need to split it into an odd number of parts greater than 1 with each part having XOR Y.

But I need to find a way to check this efficiently.

Maybe I can precompute the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value and then check for the existence of the required splits.

Let me think about it.

I can create a map that stores for each prefix XOR value, the list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

Then, for a given subarray from l to r, I can look for intermediate points where the prefix XOR matches the required value.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the total XOR pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] should be equal to Y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But I need k > 1.

So, if pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, then k must be even, and greater than 1.

If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y, then k must be odd, and greater than 1.

But I need to ensure that such a k exists.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Y appears in the prefix XOR from l to r.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look back at the example.

In the first query, l=1 to r=5, subarray [1,1,2,3,0], total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 = 0 XOR 2 = 2 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 = 1.

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 0 XOR 1 = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

pf[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

pf[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

pf[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1, which is Y.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's split into three parts, k=3, which is odd, and total XOR is Y=1.

That matches.

In the second query, l=2 to r=4, subarray [1,2,3], total XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

So, pf[4] XOR pf[1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0.

Here, k=2, which is even, and total XOR is 0.

In the third query, l=3 to r=5, subarray [2,3,0], total XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1.

But in this case, it's not possible to split it into parts with equal XOR.

Wait, why not?

If k=3, which is odd, total XOR should be Y, which is 1.

So, each part should have XOR=1.

But as we saw earlier, no such split exists.

So, just having pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y doesn't guarantee that such a split exists.

There must be intermediate points where the prefix XOR matches pf[l-1] XOR Y.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there are at least k-1 points where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y, and these points are in the range [l,r].

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of times pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR Y within the range [l,r].

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y in the range [l,r].

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = Y.

Then, to split the subarray into k parts with each part having XOR Y, I need to have k-1 split points where pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR Y, for l <= i <= r.

Because each segment's XOR is Y, so pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR Y.

Similarly, for k even, pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, which implies that pf[r] = pf[l-1].

So, I need to have k-1 split points where pf[i] = pf[l-1].

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of times pf[i] equals pf[l-1] XOR Y in the range [l,r].

But I need to make sure that these points are in increasing order and within the subarray.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me consider using the prefix XOR array and some data structure to quickly check if there are enough split points.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient way, probably O(1) or O(log n) per query.

Looking back at the reference solution, it seems to be implementing something similar.

In the reference solution, for each pf[i], it maintains a list of indices where pf[i] occurs.

Then, for each query, it computes pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X.

If X == 0, it answers "YES", else it checks some condition using bisect_left.

Wait, why does it answer "YES" immediately if X == 0?

From earlier reasoning, if X == 0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

But in the third query of the first test case, X == 1, and it's "NO".

In the first query of the first test case, X ==1, and it's "YES".

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the first query, X ==1, and it's "YES".

In the second query, X ==0, and it's "YES".

In the third query, X ==1, and it's "NO".

So, the reference solution answers "YES" if X ==0, which in the second query is correct.

But in the first query, X ==1, and it's "YES".

So, it seems that answering "YES" only when X ==0 is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Let me look at the reference solution more carefully.

In the code:

if x == 0:

results.append('YES')

continue

v1 = mp[pf[r]]

v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)

it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

So, it answers "YES" if X ==0, or if there exists some condition involving bisect_left.

Wait, bisect_left is used to find the first occurrence in a sorted list.

Here, mp is a dictionary mapping pf[i] to a list of indices where pf[i] occurs.

So, mp[pf[r]] is the list of indices where pf[i] == pf[r].

Similarly, mp[pf[l-1]] is the list of indices where pf[i] == pf[l-1].

Then, it1 is the first index in mp[pf[r]] that is >= l.

it2 is the first index in mp[pf[l-1]] that is > r, then subtracting 1 to get the last index <= r.

Then, it checks if v1[it1] < v2[it2], which means there is an index in mp[pf[r]] after l and an index in mp[pf[l-1]] before r, and the former is less than the latter.

I'm not fully following this logic.

Perhaps the idea is to check if there is at least one split point where pf[i] == pf[l-1] XOR X in the range [l,r].

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

Compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If X ==0, then I need to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If X !=0, I need to split into an odd number of parts >1 with each part having XOR X.

To check if such a split exists, I need to see if there are at least k-1 split points where pf[i] == pf[l-1] XOR X, for l <= i <= r.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of times pf[i] == pf[l-1] XOR X in the range [l,r].

If there is at least one such i, then k=2, which is even, and total XOR would be X XOR X =0, which matches X==0.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that for X ==0, any even k would work, as long as there are at least two split points where pf[i] == pf[l-1].

But in the reference solution, it answers "YES" immediately if X ==0.

But in the first test case, first query, X ==1, and it's "YES".

So, perhaps answering "YES" only when X ==0 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says to output "YES" if the subarray is interesting, "NO" otherwise.

In the first test case, for l=1 to r=5, X ==1, and it's "YES".

But according to the reference solution, it would check the condition after answering "YES" for X ==0.

Wait, no, in the code, it answers "YES" only if X ==0, and for X !=0, it checks the condition with bisect_left.

But in the first query, X ==1, so it would go to the else part and check the condition.

In that case, v1 = mp[pf[r]] = mp[1], which has indices where pf[i]==1, which are [1,4,5].

v2 = mp[pf[l-1]] = mp[0], which has [0].

But l=1, r=5.

it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)=bisect_left([1,4,5],1)=0

it2 = bisect_left(v2, r)-1=bisect_left([0],5)-1=0-1=-1

So, it2 is -1, which is less than 0, so the condition is not satisfied, and it answers "NO".

But according to the problem, it should be "YES".

Wait, but in the output, it's "YES" for the first query.

Wait, perhaps I misread the output.

Looking back at the sample output:

YES

YES

NO

NO

NO

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

NO

NO

NO

YES

NO

YES

YES

So, for the first query, it's "YES".

But according to the reference solution, for X ==1, it would check the condition, which in this case seems to fail.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the indices.

Let me re-examine.

In the first test case:

n=5, q=5

a=[1,1,2,3,0]

Compute pf:

pf[0]=0

pf[1]=0 XOR 1=1

pf[2]=1 XOR 1=0

pf[3]=0 XOR 2=2

pf[4]=2 XOR 3=1

pf[5]=1 XOR 0=1

So, mp:

mp[0]: [0,2]

mp[1]: [1,4,5]

mp[2]: [3]

First query: l=1, r=5

X = pf[5] XOR pf[0] =1 XOR 0=1

So, X ==1

Then, v1 = mp[pf[5]] = mp[1] = [1,4,5]

v2 = mp[pf[0]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left([1,4,5],1)=0

it2 = bisect_left([0,2],5)-1=2-1=1

So, v1[0]=1 < v2[1]=2, which is true, so it should append "YES".

Wait, but earlier I thought it would append "NO", but actually, according to the code, it should append "YES".

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Yes, in the code, if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >=0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2], then "YES", else "
