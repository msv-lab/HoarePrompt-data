Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly performs element-wise integer division on the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns the results as a new tuple. The use of the `zip()` function ensures that the elements are paired correctly, and the generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor efficiently computes the division results. The test cases provided in the assertions confirm that the function works as intended for the given inputs. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
