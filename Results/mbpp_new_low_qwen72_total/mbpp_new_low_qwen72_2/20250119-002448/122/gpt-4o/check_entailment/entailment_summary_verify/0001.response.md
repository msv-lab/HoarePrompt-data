Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose and behavior of the function `func_1`. The function performs element-wise integer division using the `//` operator on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The use of `zip` ensures that elements from both tuples are paired correctly, and the generator expression within the `tuple` constructor efficiently constructs the resulting tuple.

The test cases provided in the original assessment are accurate and cover a range of inputs, verifying that the function produces the correct output for different sets of input tuples. Each test case correctly calculates the integer division of the corresponding elements and confirms that the resulting tuple matches the expected output.

The function summary also aligns with the implementation and the original assessment. It correctly states that the function assumes the input tuples are of the same length and that no element in the second tuple (`tup2`) is zero, which prevents a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Given the alignment between the problem description, the function implementation, the function summary, and the test cases, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
