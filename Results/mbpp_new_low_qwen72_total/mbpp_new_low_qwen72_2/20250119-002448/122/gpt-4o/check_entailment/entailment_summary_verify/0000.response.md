### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division on two tuples.
   - It uses a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple containing the results of the division.
   - The generator expression iterates over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using the `zip()` function, ensuring that the division is applied element-wise.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases:
     ```python
     assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
     assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
     assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)
     ```
     These test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Each pair of elements from the input tuples is divided correctly, and the results are collected into a new tuple.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function summary mentions that all elements in `tup2` are non-zero. This is a crucial precondition because if any element in `tup2` were zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` would occur. However, the problem description and the function summary both assume valid inputs, so this is not a concern.
   - The function does not handle tuples of different lengths. However, the problem description implies that the input tuples will always be of the same length, so this is also not a concern.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function is correct and provides a detailed explanation of why.
   - The assessment is thorough and accurately describes the function's behavior and the test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly performs element-wise integer division on the input tuples and returns the expected results. There are no identified issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions.

Final: **True**
