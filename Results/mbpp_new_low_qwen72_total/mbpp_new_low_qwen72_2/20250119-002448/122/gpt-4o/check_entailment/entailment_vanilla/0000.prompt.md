Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

# Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple((a // b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
    return result



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
