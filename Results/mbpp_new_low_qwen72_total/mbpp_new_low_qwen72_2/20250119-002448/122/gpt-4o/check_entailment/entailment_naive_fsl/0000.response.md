Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly performs element-wise division (using integer division `//`) on the elements of the two tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to iterate over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using `zip()`. This approach ensures that the division is applied element-wise and the results are collected into a tuple. The test cases provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
