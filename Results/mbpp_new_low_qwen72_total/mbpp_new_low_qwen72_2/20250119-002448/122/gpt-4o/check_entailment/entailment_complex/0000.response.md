Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division between two tuples of the same length, where it is assumed that no element in the second tuple is zero. The implementation uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple containing the results of the integer division of corresponding elements from the input tuples. The use of the floor division operator `//` ensures that the result is an integer, which aligns with the problem's requirement for mathematical division.

The provided assertions test the function with different sets of tuples, and they all pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected for these cases. Additionally, the comment about the state of the program before the function call confirms that the input tuples meet the necessary conditions (same length and no zero in `tup2`), and the comment about the final state of the program confirms that the function returns the correct results.

Given that the function meets the problem's requirements and the provided test cases pass, the function can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
