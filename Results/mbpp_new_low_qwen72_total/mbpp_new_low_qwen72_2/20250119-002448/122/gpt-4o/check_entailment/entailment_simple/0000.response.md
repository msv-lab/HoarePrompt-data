Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division between two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`. The program uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. 

The given assertions test the function with different sets of input tuples, and the expected results are provided. The function is correctly implemented to perform the specified operation, and the state of the program ensures that both tuples are of the same length and that no division by zero will occur. The integer division operator `//` is used appropriately to ensure that the result is an integer.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works as intended and produces the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
