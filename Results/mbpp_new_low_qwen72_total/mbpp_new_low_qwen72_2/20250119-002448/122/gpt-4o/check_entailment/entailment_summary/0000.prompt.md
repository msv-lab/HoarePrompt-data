Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

# Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple((a // b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
    return result





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples of the same length, with the condition that all elements in `tup2` are non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. If any element in `tup2` were to be zero (which is not expected based on the precondition), a `ZeroDivisionError` would occur. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `result` contains the integer division results of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
