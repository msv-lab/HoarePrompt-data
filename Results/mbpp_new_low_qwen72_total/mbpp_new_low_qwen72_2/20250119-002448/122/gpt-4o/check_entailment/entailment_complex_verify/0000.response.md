Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` performs the intended operation of element-wise integer division on the elements of the two input tuples and returns the results as a new tuple. The use of the generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor effectively handles the iteration and collection of the results. The provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. The annotations also align with the expected behavior, ensuring that the elements in `tup2` are non-zero to avoid division by zero errors. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
