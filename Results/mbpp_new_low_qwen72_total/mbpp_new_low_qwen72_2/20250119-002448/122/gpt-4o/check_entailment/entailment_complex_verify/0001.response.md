Reasoning: 
The original assessment is thorough and accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division on two tuples of the same length. The use of the `zip` function pairs elements from both tuples correctly, and the generator expression within the `tuple` constructor efficiently handles the division operation.

The test cases provided in the original assessment cover various scenarios and confirm that the function produces the expected results:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 3)`.
2. `func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 4)`.
3. `func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9))` results in `(4, 2, 6, 2)`.

Each test case confirms that the function correctly performs the integer division and returns the expected tuple. The annotations also support the original assessment by detailing the state of the program and the operations performed.

Given that the function works as intended and all test cases pass, there is no reason to overturn the original assessment.

Final: **True**
