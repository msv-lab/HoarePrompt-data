Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples of the same length, with the condition that all elements in `tup2` are non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. If any element in `tup2` were to be zero (which is not expected based on the precondition), a `ZeroDivisionError` would occur. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `result` contains the integer division results of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. **
