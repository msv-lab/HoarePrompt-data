The code creates a new tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Since each element in `tup2` is non-zero, the operation is valid for all elements. The initial state specifies that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, and this condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, and each element in `tup2` is non-zero; `result` is a tuple where each element is the integer division of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
