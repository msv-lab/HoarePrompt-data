#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (each element converted to a string and joined together) is found within the string representation of `main_list` (each element converted to a string and joined together).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input and returns a boolean value. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is also converted to a string and concatenated). Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless `sub_list` is empty, in which case it will return `True` because an empty string is considered a substring of any string.
- If the elements of `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised.
