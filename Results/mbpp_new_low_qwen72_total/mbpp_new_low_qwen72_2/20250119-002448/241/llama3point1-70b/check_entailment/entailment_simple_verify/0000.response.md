Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. While this approach can work for some cases, it fails to correctly identify whether `sub_list` is a contiguous subsequence of `main_list` in all scenarios. 

For instance, as pointed out in the original assessment, the function incorrectly returns `True` for `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [2, 4]`, even though `[2, 4]` is not a contiguous subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. This is a significant flaw because the problem description requires checking if `sub_list` is a sublist (contiguous subsequence) of `main_list`, not just a sequence of elements found in any order or non-contiguously.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is correct in stating that the function is incorrect.

Final: **False**
