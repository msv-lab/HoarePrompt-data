Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (each element converted to a string and joined together) is found within the string representation of `main_list` (each element converted to a string and joined together).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input and returns a boolean value. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is also converted to a string and concatenated). Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless `sub_list` is empty, in which case it will return `True` because an empty string is considered a substring of any string.
- If the elements of `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
