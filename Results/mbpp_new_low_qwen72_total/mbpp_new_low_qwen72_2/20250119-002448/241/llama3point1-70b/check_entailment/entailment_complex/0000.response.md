Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into string representations by concatenating their stringified elements and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for many cases where the lists contain simple data types like integers or strings. However, there are a few considerations:

1. **Empty Lists**: The function correctly handles the case where `sub_list` is empty by returning `True`, as an empty string is a substring of any string. If `main_list` is empty and `sub_list` is not, it correctly returns `False`.

2. **Type Conversion**: The function assumes that all elements in the lists can be converted to strings. If an element cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised. This is a potential issue but is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement to handle in the problem description.

3. **Sublist Check**: The function checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This works well for simple cases but may not work correctly for more complex scenarios where the order of elements matters or the elements themselves are lists or other non-primitive data types. For example, `[1, [2, 3]]` would not be correctly identified as a sublist of `[1, 2, 3]` using this method.

Given the problem description and the constraints provided, the function is generally correct for the intended use case of checking if a simple list is a sublist of another simple list. However, it has limitations in handling more complex data structures or edge cases involving type conversion.

Correctness: **True**  

The function is correct for the basic problem of checking if a list is a sublist of another list, given the assumptions and the problem constraints.
