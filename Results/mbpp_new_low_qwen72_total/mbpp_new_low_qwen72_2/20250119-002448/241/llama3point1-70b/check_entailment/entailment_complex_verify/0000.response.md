Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This method can lead to incorrect results in cases where the elements of the subsequence need to be contiguous in the main list. For instance, in the example provided:

```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sub_list = [2, 4]
```

The function returns `True` because `'24'` is a substring of `'1234'`, but `[2, 4]` is not a contiguous subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. This means the function does not correctly identify whether `sub_list` is a true subsequence of `main_list` according to the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the function is incorrect is justified.

Final: **False**
