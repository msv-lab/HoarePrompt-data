Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a comprehensive overview of the function's behavior and its limitations. However, let's break down the function's correctness in detail:

1. **String Conversion and Substring Check**:
   - The function converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` to strings using `map(str, ...)` and `''.join(...)`.
   - It then checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Lists**: If `sub_list` is empty, the function correctly returns `True` because an empty string is a substring of any string. If `main_list` is empty and `sub_list` is not, the function correctly returns `False`.
   - **Non-Convertible Elements**: If the elements in the lists are not convertible to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised. This is a valid concern, but the problem description does not specify constraints on the types of elements in the lists. Therefore, this is an edge case that the user should be aware of.

3. **Complex Data Types**:
   - The function may not work correctly for lists containing nested lists or other complex data types. For example, `func_1([1, [2, 3]], [1, [2, 3]])` would fail because the string representation of nested lists might not accurately reflect the structure.
   - However, the problem description only specifies checking if one list is a sublist of another, and does not mention nested lists or complex data types. Therefore, this limitation is outside the scope of the problem description.

4. **Order of Elements**:
   - The function correctly checks the order of elements in the sublist. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], [2, 3])` returns `True`, while `func_1([1, 2, 3], [3, 2])` returns `False`.

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The function is efficient for small to medium-sized lists. However, for very large lists, the string conversion and substring check could become performance bottlenecks. This is a valid consideration but not a correctness issue.

Given the problem description and the limitations outlined, the function `func_1` is correct for the intended use case of checking if one list is a sublist of another, assuming the lists contain elements that can be meaningfully compared as strings.

Final: **True**
