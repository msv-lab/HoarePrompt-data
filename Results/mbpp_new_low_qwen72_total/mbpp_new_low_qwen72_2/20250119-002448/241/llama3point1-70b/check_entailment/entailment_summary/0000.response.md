Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` works by converting both `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and then checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach is effective for simple cases where the elements are single characters or numbers that do not overlap when concatenated.

However, this method has limitations and can produce incorrect results in certain scenarios:
1. **Overlapping Elements**: If the elements in the lists are such that their string representations can overlap in a way that creates a false positive, the function will incorrectly return `True`. For example, if `main_list = [1, 23, 4]` and `sub_list = [2, 3]`, the function will return `True` because `"23"` is a substring of `"1234"`, even though `[2, 3]` is not a true sublist of `[1, 23, 4]`.

2. **Non-String Convertible Elements**: The function assumes that all elements in the lists can be converted to strings. If an element cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

3. **Empty Lists**: The function correctly handles the case where `sub_list` is empty by returning `True`, and it returns `False` if `main_list` is empty and `sub_list` is not.

Given these limitations, the function is not entirely correct for all possible inputs and scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
