Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

# Program:
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input and returns a boolean value. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is also converted to a string and concatenated). Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless `sub_list` is empty, in which case it will return `True` because an empty string is considered a substring of any string.
- If the elements of `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
