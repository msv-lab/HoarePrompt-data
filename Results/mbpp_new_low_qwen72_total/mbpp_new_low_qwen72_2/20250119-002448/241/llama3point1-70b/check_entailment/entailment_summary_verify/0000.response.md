Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed has a flaw in its logic. The problem description requires checking if a list is a sublist of another, which means the elements of the `sub_list` must appear in the same order and consecutively within the `main_list`. The function `func_1` converts both lists to strings and checks for substring presence, which can lead to false positives in cases where the elements of `sub_list` are not consecutive in `main_list`.

For example, as noted in the original assessment:
- `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [2, 4]` should return `False` because `[2, 4]` is not a contiguous subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but the function returns `True` because `'24'` is a substring of `'1234'`.

This demonstrates that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, specifically the requirement that the elements of the `sub_list` must appear in the same order and consecutively in the `main_list`.

Final: **False**
