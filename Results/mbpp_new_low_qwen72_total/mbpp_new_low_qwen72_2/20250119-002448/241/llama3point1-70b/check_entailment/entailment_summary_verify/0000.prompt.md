You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

- Program:
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input and returns a boolean value. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is also converted to a string and concatenated). Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless `sub_list` is empty, in which case it will return `True` because an empty string is considered a substring of any string.
- If the elements of `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works in many cases but fails in specific scenarios where the elements of the lists are not distinct or when the order of elements matters.

For example, consider the following case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sub_list = [2, 3]
```
The function will return `True` because `'23'` is a substring of `'1234'`.

However, consider this case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sub_list = [2, 4]
```
The function will return `True` because `'24'` is a substring of `'1234'`, but `[2, 4]` is not a contiguous subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

This demonstrates that the function does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
