Reasoning:
The original assessment is largely accurate in its evaluation of the function `func_1`. The function converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach is indeed effective for lists containing elements that can be converted to strings and where the order of elements matters.

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **String Conversion Assumption**: The function assumes that all elements in the lists can be converted to strings. If this assumption holds, the function will work correctly. However, as noted in the function summary, if the elements cannot be converted to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised. This is a limitation but not necessarily an incorrectness in the context of the problem description, which does not specify constraints on the types of elements.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. An empty `sub_list` will return `True` (since an empty string is a substring of any string), and an empty `main_list` will return `False` unless `sub_list` is also empty. These behaviors align with the expected outcomes.

3. **Complex Data Types**: As mentioned in the original assessment, the function may not work correctly for lists containing nested lists or other complex data types. However, the problem description does not specify such cases, so this is not a violation of the problem requirements.

4. **Uniqueness of String Representations**: The function relies on the uniqueness of string representations of the elements. If two different elements have the same string representation, the function could produce incorrect results. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[12]` would be incorrectly identified as having a sublist relationship. However, this is a limitation rather than an outright error, especially since the problem description does not specify such scenarios.

Given the problem description and the assumptions made, the function `func_1` is correct for the intended use case of checking if one list is a sublist of another, provided the elements can be meaningfully converted to strings.

Final: **True**
