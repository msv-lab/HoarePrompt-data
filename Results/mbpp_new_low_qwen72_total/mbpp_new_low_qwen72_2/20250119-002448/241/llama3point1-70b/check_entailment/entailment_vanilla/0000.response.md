Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` works by converting both the `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and then checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach is effective for lists containing elements that can be converted to strings (e.g., integers, characters) and where the order of elements matters.

However, this method has limitations:
1. It assumes that the elements in the lists are convertible to strings and that the string representations of the elements are unique.
2. It may not work correctly for lists containing nested lists or other complex data types, as the string representation might not accurately reflect the structure.
3. It does not handle cases where the elements in the lists are not directly comparable in their string form (e.g., if the lists contain objects with custom string representations).

Despite these limitations, for the given problem description, which does not specify any constraints beyond checking if one list is a sublist of another, the function is correct and will work as expected for simple, flat lists of elements that can be meaningfully compared as strings.

Correctness: **True**
