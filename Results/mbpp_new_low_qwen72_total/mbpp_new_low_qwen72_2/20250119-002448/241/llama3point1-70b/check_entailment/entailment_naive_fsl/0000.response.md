Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works in many cases but fails in specific scenarios where the elements of the lists are not distinct or when the order of elements matters.

For example, consider the following case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sub_list = [2, 3]
```
The function will return `True` because `'23'` is a substring of `'1234'`.

However, consider this case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sub_list = [2, 4]
```
The function will return `True` because `'24'` is a substring of `'1234'`, but `[2, 4]` is not a contiguous subsequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

This demonstrates that the function does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
