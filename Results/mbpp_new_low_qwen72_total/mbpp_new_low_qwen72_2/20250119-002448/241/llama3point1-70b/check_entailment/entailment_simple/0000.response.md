Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings by concatenating their string representations. It then checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works correctly for lists containing elements that can be meaningfully compared as strings, such as integers or single characters. However, it may not work correctly for more complex data types or nested structures, but since the problem does not specify these edge cases and assumes valid inputs, we can consider the function correct within the given context.

Correctness: **True**
