The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `main_list` and `sub_list`. Both parameters are lists. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (with each element converted to a string and joined together) is found within the string representation of `main_list` (with each element converted to a string and joined together).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_list` and `sub_list`, both of which are lists. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` is found within the string representation of `main_list`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
