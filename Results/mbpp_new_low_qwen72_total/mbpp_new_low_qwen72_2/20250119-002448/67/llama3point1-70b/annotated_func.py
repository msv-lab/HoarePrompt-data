    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly calculates the sum of divisors by iterating up to the square root of `n` and adding both divisors when a divisor pair is found. If `n` is a perfect square, it ensures that the square root is only added once. The function handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1`, where the function will return 0 since 1 has no proper divisors.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is `n + 1`, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. Here, `num` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. The function iterates over each number from 1 to `n`, checks these conditions, and accumulates the sum of numbers that meet all the criteria. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the computed sum. If no numbers satisfy the conditions, the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the function will return 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can satisfy the conditions), and when `n` is a very large number, which could affect performance due to the nested calls to `func_1`.
