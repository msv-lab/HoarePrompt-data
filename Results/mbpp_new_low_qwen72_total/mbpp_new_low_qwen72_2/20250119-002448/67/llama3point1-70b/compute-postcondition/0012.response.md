The value of `num` is 3, and `amicable_sum` is incremented by this value. Since `amicable_sum` could initially be 0, 1, 2, or 3, after adding 3 to it, the new value of `amicable_sum` will be 3, 4, 5, or 6 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is 3, and `amicable_sum` is 3, 4, 5, or 6 depending on the results of `func_1`.**
