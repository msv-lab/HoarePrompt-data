Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, `num` is 1, and the result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`. If `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.***
