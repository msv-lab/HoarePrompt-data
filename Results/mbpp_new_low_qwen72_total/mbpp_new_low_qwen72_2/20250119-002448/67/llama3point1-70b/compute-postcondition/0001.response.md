The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range function will generate numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `num` will be set to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0, `num` is 1**
