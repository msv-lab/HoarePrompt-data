The value of `amicable_sum` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `num` is 1, `amicable_sum` becomes `amicable_sum + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 1, `num` is 1, the result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`, `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num`, and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`**
