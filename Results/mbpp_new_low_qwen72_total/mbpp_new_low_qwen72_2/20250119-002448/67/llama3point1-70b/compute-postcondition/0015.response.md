To determine the output state after all executions of the loop, let's follow the steps outlined in the prompt:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over each number from 1 to `n` inclusive. For each number (`num`), it performs the following checks:
1. If `func_1(num) < n`.
2. If `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.

If both conditions are met, `num` is added to `amicable_sum`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Variable `num`**: Increases from 1 to `n` in each iteration.
- **Variable `amicable_sum`**: Starts at 0 and increases by `num` whenever the conditions are met.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute exactly `n` times, once for each integer from 1 to `n`.
- For each `num` from 1 to `n`, if the conditions are met, `num` is added to `amicable_sum`.
- If no `num` satisfies the conditions, `amicable_sum` will remain 0.
- If one or more `num` satisfy the conditions, `amicable_sum` will be the sum of all such `num`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The relationship between `n` and `amicable_sum` depends on the behavior of `func_1`.
- The loop will always execute `n` times, regardless of the values returned by `func_1`.

### Final Output State
After the loop has finished executing `n` times, the final state will be:
- `n` remains the same positive integer.
- `num` will be `n + 1` (since the loop ends after `num` reaches `n`).
- `amicable_sum` will be the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is `n + 1`, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.**
