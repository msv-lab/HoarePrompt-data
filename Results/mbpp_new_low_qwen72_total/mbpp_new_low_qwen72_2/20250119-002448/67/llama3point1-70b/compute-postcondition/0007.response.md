The only objects in the loop head are variables `num` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `num` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is 2, and `amicable_sum` is 0 or 1 depending on the results of `func_1`. If `func_1(1)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(1))` equals 1 while 1 is not equal to `func_1(1)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.**
