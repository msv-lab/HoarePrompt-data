Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `num` is 1, and `amicable_sum` is 0 or 1 depending on the results of `func_1`. If `func_1(num)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` while `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.***
