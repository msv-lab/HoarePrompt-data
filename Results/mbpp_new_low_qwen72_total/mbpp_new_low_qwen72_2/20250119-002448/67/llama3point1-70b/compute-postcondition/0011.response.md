The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the upper limit `n`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `n` must still be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `num` is 3, and `amicable_sum` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the results of `func_1` as previously described.**
