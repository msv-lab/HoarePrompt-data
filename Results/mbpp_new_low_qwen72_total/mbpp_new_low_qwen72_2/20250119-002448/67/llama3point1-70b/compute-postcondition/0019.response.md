Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` iterates from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5)`, `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` including `1` and `n` itself, but each divisor pair `(i, n // i)` is only counted once. If `n` is a perfect square, the square root is counted only once.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `n`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (`n % i == 0`).

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `i` changes with each iteration, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until `int(n ** 0.5)`.
   - `divisors_sum` is updated based on whether `i` is a divisor of `n` and whether `i * i` equals `n`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `n` and `i * i != n`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to `divisors_sum`.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `n` and `i * i == n` (i.e., `i` is the square root of `n`), only `i` is added to `divisors_sum`.
   - If `i` is not a divisor of `n`, `divisors_sum` remains unchanged.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop correctly sums the divisors of `n` without double-counting pairs.
   - If `n` is a perfect square, its square root is only counted once.
   - The final value of `divisors_sum` will be the sum of all unique divisors of `n`.

Thus, the final output state reflects the sum of all divisors of `n`, ensuring that each divisor pair is counted only once, and the square root is counted only once if `n` is a perfect square.
