The value of `amicable_sum` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is 2, and `amicable_sum` is 2 or 3 depending on the results of `func_1`. If `func_1(1)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(1))` equals 1 while 1 is not equal to `func_1(1)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 3. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` is set to 2.
