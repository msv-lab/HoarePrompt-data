Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `num` is 2, and `amicable_sum` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the results of `func_1`. If `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 2 or 3. Specifically, if `func_1(1)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(1))` equals 1 while 1 is not equal to `func_1(1)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 3. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` is set to 2. If the condition `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` does not hold, `amicable_sum` remains 0 or 1, depending on whether the initial condition `func_1(1)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(1))` equals 1 while 1 is not equal to `func_1(1)` held true.***
