Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly calculates the sum of divisors by iterating up to the square root of `n` and adding both divisors when a divisor pair is found. If `n` is a perfect square, it ensures that the square root is only added once. The function handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1`, where the function will return 0 since 1 has no proper divisors. **
