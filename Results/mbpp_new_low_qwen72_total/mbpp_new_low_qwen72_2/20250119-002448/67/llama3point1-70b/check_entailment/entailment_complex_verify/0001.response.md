### Reasoning:

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Correctness**: The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates up to the square root of `n` to find divisors, ensuring efficiency. For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, except when `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it adds `i` only once. Finally, it subtracts `n` itself to get the sum of proper divisors.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (returns 0 since 1 has no proper divisors).

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Correctness**: The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number forms an amicable pair with another number. It uses `func_1` to find the sum of proper divisors and then checks if the sum of proper divisors of the result equals the original number. It also ensures that the number is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors to avoid counting perfect numbers. If these conditions are met, it adds the number to the `amicable_sum`.
- **Efficiency**: The function is efficient in terms of checking amicable pairs but could be optimized further for very large values of `n` due to the nested calls to `func_1`.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (returns 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can form an amicable pair).

#### Annotations:
- The annotations for both functions are accurate and correctly describe the state of the program at key points. They confirm that the functions are implemented as intended and handle edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions together correctly implement the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers up to `n`.

Final: **True**
