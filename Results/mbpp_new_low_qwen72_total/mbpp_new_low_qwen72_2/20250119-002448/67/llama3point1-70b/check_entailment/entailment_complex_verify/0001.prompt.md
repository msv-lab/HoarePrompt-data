You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` iterates from 1 to `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly calculates the sum of divisors by iterating up to the square root of `n` and adding both divisors when a divisor pair is found. If `n` is a perfect square, it ensures that the square root is only added once. The function handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1`, where the function will return 0 since 1 has no proper divisors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is `n + 1`, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. Here, `num` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. The function iterates over each number from 1 to `n`, checks these conditions, and accumulates the sum of numbers that meet all the criteria. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the computed sum. If no numbers satisfy the conditions, the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the function will return 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can satisfy the conditions), and when `n` is a very large number, which could affect performance due to the nested calls to `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the sum of all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. An amicable pair consists of two integers for which the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of each is equal to the other number. 

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`. It correctly iterates up to the square root of `n` and checks for divisors. If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that perfect squares are only added once. Finally, it subtracts `n` itself to get the sum of proper divisors.
  
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number forms an amicable pair with another number. It uses `func_1` to find the sum of proper divisors and then checks if the sum of proper divisors of the result equals the original number. It also ensures that the number is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors to avoid counting perfect numbers. If these conditions are met, it adds the number to the `amicable_sum`.

Both functions together correctly implement the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers up to `n`.
