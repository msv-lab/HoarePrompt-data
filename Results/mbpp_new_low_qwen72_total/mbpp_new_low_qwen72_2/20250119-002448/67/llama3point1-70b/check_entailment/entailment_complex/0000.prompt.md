Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` iterates from 1 to `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly calculates the sum of divisors by iterating up to the square root of `n` and adding both divisors when a divisor pair is found. If `n` is a perfect square, it ensures that the square root is only added once. The function handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1`, where the function will return 0 since 1 has no proper divisors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is `n + 1`, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. Here, `num` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. The function iterates over each number from 1 to `n`, checks these conditions, and accumulates the sum of numbers that meet all the criteria. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the computed sum. If no numbers satisfy the conditions, the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the function will return 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can satisfy the conditions), and when `n` is a very large number, which could affect performance due to the nested calls to `func_1`.
