Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It iterates up to the square root of `n` to find divisors, ensuring efficiency.
   - If `n` is a perfect square, it correctly adds the square root only once.
   - The function returns `divisors_sum - n`, which is the sum of all proper divisors of `n`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over each number from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is part of an amicable pair.
   - The conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)` are used to identify amicable pairs.
   - The function correctly accumulates the sum of all numbers that satisfy these conditions.
   - Edge cases are handled appropriately, such as when `n` is 1 (the function will return 0).

Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` provides the necessary utility to find the sum of proper divisors, and `func_2` uses this to identify and sum amicable numbers.

Correctness: **True**
