Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the sum of all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. An amicable pair consists of two integers for which the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of each is equal to the other number. 

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`. It correctly iterates up to the square root of `n` and checks for divisors. If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that perfect squares are only added once. Finally, it subtracts `n` itself to get the sum of proper divisors.
  
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number forms an amicable pair with another number. It uses `func_1` to find the sum of proper divisors and then checks if the sum of proper divisors of the result equals the original number. It also ensures that the number is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors to avoid counting perfect numbers. If these conditions are met, it adds the number to the `amicable_sum`.

Both functions together correctly implement the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers up to `n`.
