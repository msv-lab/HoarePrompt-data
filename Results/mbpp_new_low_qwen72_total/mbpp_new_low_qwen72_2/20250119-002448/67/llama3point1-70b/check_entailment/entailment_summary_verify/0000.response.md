### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the implementation.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Behavior**: It iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors. For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum (if `i * i != n` to avoid adding the square root twice). Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Behavior**: It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the current number `num` forms an amicable pair with another number. Specifically, it checks:
  - `func_1(num) < n`: Ensures the sum of divisors of `num` is within the range.
  - `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`: Ensures the sum of divisors of `func_1(num)` equals `num`.
  - `num != func_1(num)`: Ensures `num` is not amicable with itself.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value that is equal to `num`. However, this is not entirely accurate. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:

1. **Condition `func_1(num) < n`**: This ensures that the sum of proper divisors of `num` is within the range of 1 to `n`.
2. **Condition `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`**: This ensures that the sum of proper divisors of the sum of proper divisors of `num` equals `num`.
3. **Condition `num != func_1(num)`:** This ensures that `num` is not amicable with itself.

The third condition `num != func_1(num)` is crucial for identifying amicable pairs. If `func_1(num) == num`, the number `num` is not considered amicable with itself, and the condition `num != func_1(num)` correctly excludes such cases.

### Example Verification

Let's consider the number 6:
- `func_1(6)` calculates the sum of proper divisors of 6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
- Since `func_1(6) == 6`, the condition `num != func_1(num)` fails, and 6 is not added to the sum of amicable numbers.

This behavior is correct because 6 is a perfect number, not an amicable number. The program correctly identifies that 6 is not part of an amicable pair with itself.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly handles the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value equal to `num` by excluding such numbers using the condition `num != func_1(num)`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
