### Reasoning:

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
  - For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors_sum` if `i * i != n` (to avoid double-counting the square root).
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` from `divisors_sum` to get the sum of proper divisors (excluding `n` itself).

This function is correct in its implementation of finding the sum of proper divisors. However, there is a potential issue: if `n` is a perfect square, the square root is added twice. To fix this, we should ensure that the square root is only added once.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if each number `num` forms an amicable pair with another number.
  - It uses `func_1` to find the sum of proper divisors of `num` and then checks if the sum of proper divisors of the result equals the original number `num`.
  - It also ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors to avoid counting perfect numbers.
  - If these conditions are met, it adds `num` to `amicable_sum`.

The function correctly implements the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers. However, the condition `func_1(num) < n` in the loop is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the function. This condition does not align with the problem description, which simply asks to sum all amicable numbers up to `n`.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Correct, but the handling of perfect squares can be improved.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Correct, but the condition `func_1(num) < n` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Given the minor issues in `func_1` and the unnecessary condition in `func_2`, the original assessment is mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

Final: **False** (due to the minor issues mentioned)
