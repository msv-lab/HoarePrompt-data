You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. The function iterates over each number from 1 to `n`, checks these conditions, and accumulates the sum of numbers that meet all the criteria. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the computed sum. If no numbers satisfy the conditions, the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the function will return 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can satisfy the conditions), and when `n` is a very large number, which could affect performance due to the nested calls to `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value that is equal to `num`. This can lead to incorrect results because the condition `num != func_1(num)` will always be true, even when `func_1(num)` returns `num`, which is not the correct behavior for identifying amicable numbers.

For example, consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. According to the definition of amicable numbers, a number is not amicable with itself, but the current implementation would incorrectly consider 6 as part of an amicable pair with itself.

To fix this, the condition `num != func_1(num)` should be checked before calling `func_1` again to ensure that the number is not amicable with itself.
