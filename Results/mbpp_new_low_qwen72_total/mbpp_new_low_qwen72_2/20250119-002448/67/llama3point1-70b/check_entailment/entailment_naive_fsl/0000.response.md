Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value that is equal to `num`. This can lead to incorrect results because the condition `num != func_1(num)` will always be true, even when `func_1(num)` returns `num`, which is not the correct behavior for identifying amicable numbers.

For example, consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. According to the definition of amicable numbers, a number is not amicable with itself, but the current implementation would incorrectly consider 6 as part of an amicable pair with itself.

To fix this, the condition `num != func_1(num)` should be checked before calling `func_1` again to ensure that the number is not amicable with itself.
