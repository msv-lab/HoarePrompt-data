### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Amicable Numbers:**
   - Two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of \(a\) (excluding \(a\)) equals \(b\) and the sum of the proper divisors of \(b\) (excluding \(b\)) equals \(a\), with \(a \neq b\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the sum of the proper divisors of \(n\) (excluding \(n\)).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \) to find divisors. If \(i\) is a divisor of \(n\), it adds both \(i\) and \(n // i\) to the sum, unless \(i\) is the square root of \(n\), in which case it only adds \(i\) once.
   - Finally, it subtracts \(n\) from the sum to exclude \(n\) itself.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function sums all amicable numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - It iterates through each number from 1 to \(n\).
   - For each number, it checks if the sum of its proper divisors (`func_1(num)`) is less than \(n\).
   - It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors of `func_1(num)` equals the original number (`num`) and ensures `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds `num` to the `amicable_sum`.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value equal to `num`.
   - However, this is not a concern because the condition `num != func_1(num)` explicitly excludes such cases.
   - The assessment is incorrect in suggesting that `func_1(num)` returning `num` would cause problems, as the condition `num != func_1(num)` ensures that `num` is not considered amicable with itself.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers.
   - The condition `num != func_1(num)` ensures that a number is not considered amicable with itself.
   - The program handles all necessary cases and conditions for identifying amicable numbers.
