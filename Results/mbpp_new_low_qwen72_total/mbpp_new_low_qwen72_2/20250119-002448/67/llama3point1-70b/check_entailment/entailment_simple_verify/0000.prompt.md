You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` iterates from 1 to `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) and `n` is a positive integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `num` is `n + 1`, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. Here, `num` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `func_1(num)` returns a value that is equal to `num`. This can lead to incorrect results because the condition `num != func_1(num)` will always be true, even when `func_1(num)` returns `num`, which is not the correct behavior for identifying amicable numbers.

For example, consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The sum of proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. According to the definition of amicable numbers, a number is not amicable with itself, but the current implementation would incorrectly consider 6 as part of an amicable pair with itself.

To fix this, the condition `num != func_1(num)` should be checked before calling `func_1` again to ensure that the number is not amicable with itself.
