Reasoning: 

The original assessment is largely correct, but there are a few subtle points that need to be addressed to ensure the program is entirely accurate:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates up to the square root of `n` and checks for divisors. If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that perfect squares are only added once.
   - The subtraction of `n` at the end is correct because it ensures that the number itself is not included in the sum of proper divisors.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number forms an amicable pair with another number.
   - The condition `if func_1(num) < n` is used to filter out numbers whose sum of proper divisors exceeds `n`. This is a reasonable optimization but not strictly necessary for correctness.
   - The condition `if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num)` correctly checks if the number forms an amicable pair with another number. This ensures that the sum of proper divisors of the sum of proper divisors of `num` equals `num`, and that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors.
   - If these conditions are met, the number is added to the `amicable_sum`.

However, there is a minor issue in the original assessment:
- The condition `if func_1(num) < n` is not strictly necessary for correctness. While it can be used as an optimization to reduce the number of unnecessary calculations, it does not affect the correctness of the algorithm. Removing this condition would still yield the correct sum of amicable numbers.

Given that the program logic is sound and the conditions are correctly implemented, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
