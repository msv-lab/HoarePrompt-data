### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: To compute the sum of all proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors. For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that if `n` is a perfect square, the square root is only added once. Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.
   - **Output Hints**: The function correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1` (where the function returns 0).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: To compute the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number `n`.
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates over each number from 1 to `n`. For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` and if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` while ensuring `num != func_1(num)`. If all conditions are met, `num` is added to the `amicable_sum`.
   - **Output Hints**: The function correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1` (where the function returns 0 since no number less than or equal to 1 can be an amicable number). It also handles larger values of `n`, although performance may be affected due to the nested calls to `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
- Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and meet their respective purposes.
- The combination of these functions correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers from 1 to `n` as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
