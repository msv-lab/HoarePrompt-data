Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It iterates over potential divisors from 1 to the square root of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum` if `i * i != n` (to avoid adding the square root twice for perfect squares).
   - Finally, it returns `divisors_sum - n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum of divisors.
   - This implementation correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the sum of all amicable numbers up to `n`.
   - It iterates over numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` (which is not strictly necessary but does not affect correctness).
   - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` to determine if `num` is part of an amicable pair.
   - If both conditions are met, `num` is added to `amicable_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns `amicable_sum`, which is the sum of all amicable numbers up to `n`.

The logic and implementation of both functions are correct and align with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
