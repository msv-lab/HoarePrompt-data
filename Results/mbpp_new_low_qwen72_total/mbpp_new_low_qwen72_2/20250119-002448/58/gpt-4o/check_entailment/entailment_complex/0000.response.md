Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` booleans in a given list. The implementation uses the `sum` function on the list of booleans, which works because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list directly counts the number of `True` values.

The provided assertions test different scenarios:
- `[True, False, True]` should return `2` (two `True` values).
- `[False, False]` should return `0` (no `True` values).
- `[True, True, True]` should return `3` (three `True` values).

All of these assertions pass, indicating that the function behaves correctly for the given test cases.

Additionally, the comment explaining the state of the program and the overall functionality of the function is accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
