Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` uses the `sum` function to add up the values in the list `bool_list`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, using `sum` on a list of booleans will effectively count the number of `True` values in the list.

However, the function definition and the assertions should be in the same code block for the test cases to run correctly. The provided code has the assertions and the function definition separated, which could cause an issue if the function is not defined before the assertions are executed.

Despite this, the logic of the function itself is correct. If the assertions were placed after the function definition, they would pass, indicating that the function works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
