Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` uses the built-in `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in the given list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, summing the list directly gives the count of `True` values. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with mixed boolean values, all `False`, and all `True`. Since the function handles these cases correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is considered correct.
