Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` boolean values in the given list. In Python, boolean values can be treated as integers where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. The function uses the `sum` function to add up all the values in the list. Since `True` values contribute `1` to the sum and `False` values contribute `0`, the sum of the list will indeed give the count of `True` values.

The provided assertions test different scenarios:
1. `assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2` - This list has two `True` values, so the sum should be `2`.
2. `assert func_1([False, False]) == 0` - This list has no `True` values, so the sum should be `0`.
3. `assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3` - This list has three `True` values, so the sum should be `3`.

All these assertions are correct and pass without any issues, indicating that the function works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
