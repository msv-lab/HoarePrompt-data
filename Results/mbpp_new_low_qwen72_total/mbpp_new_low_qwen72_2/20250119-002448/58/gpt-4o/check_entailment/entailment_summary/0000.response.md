Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` boolean values in a given list. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works correctly because in Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` is treated as `0`. Therefore, summing the list will effectively count the number of `True` values. The provided test cases in the assertions are also correct and cover different scenarios, including lists with mixed boolean values, all `False` values, and all `True` values. The function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
