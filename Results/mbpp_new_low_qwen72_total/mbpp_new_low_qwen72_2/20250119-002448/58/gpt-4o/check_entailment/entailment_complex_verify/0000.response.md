Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` values in the given list by leveraging Python's treatment of `True` as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function effectively adds up all the `True` values (each contributing `1`) and ignores the `False` values (each contributing `0`). The provided test cases validate this behavior for different scenarios:

1. `func_1([True, False, True]) == 2`: This case correctly sums `1 + 0 + 1`, resulting in `2`.
2. `func_1([False, False]) == 0`: This case correctly sums `0 + 0`, resulting in `0`.
3. `func_1([True, True, True]) == 3`: This case correctly sums `1 + 1 + 1`, resulting in `3`.

The annotated code confirms that the function's behavior matches the intended functionality and the original assessment's explanation. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
