Reasoning:  
The original assessment is mostly correct but omits a critical point regarding the placement of the assertions and the function definition. The function `func_1` indeed works as intended by counting the number of `True` values in the list because `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in Python. However, the original code snippet provided has the assertions and the function definition in separate blocks, which can lead to a `NameError` if the function is not defined before the assertions are executed. This is a syntactical issue that, while not affecting the logical correctness of the function, could prevent the code from running successfully in some environments.

Given that the problem statement assumes valid inputs and the focus is on the correctness of the function logic, we can consider the function logically correct. However, for the sake of completeness and ensuring the code runs without issues, it is important to place the assertions after the function definition.

Final: **True** (The function logic is correct, but the code structure should be adjusted for proper execution.)
