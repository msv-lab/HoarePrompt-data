Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the core functionality of the `func_1` function. It accurately explains that the `sum` function can be used to count the number of `True` values in a list because `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations. This is indeed how Python handles boolean values in such contexts.

However, the original assessment also points out a potential issue with the placement of the assertions. The assertions should be placed after the function definition to ensure that the function is available when the tests are run. This is a valid point, but it does not affect the correctness of the function itself, only the structure of the code.

Given the function summary, which states that the function `func_1` returns the sum of the boolean values in the list, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, the function's behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description and the expected output.

Therefore, the function logic is correct, and the only concern is the placement of the assertions, which is a minor structural issue rather than a functional one.

Final: **True**
