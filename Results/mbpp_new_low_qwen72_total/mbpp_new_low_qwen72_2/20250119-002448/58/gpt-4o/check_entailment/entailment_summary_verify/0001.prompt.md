You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values, and returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. If the list is empty, the function returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` uses the `sum` function to add up the values in the list `bool_list`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, using `sum` on a list of booleans will effectively count the number of `True` values in the list.

However, the function definition and the assertions should be in the same code block for the test cases to run correctly. The provided code has the assertions and the function definition separated, which could cause an issue if the function is not defined before the assertions are executed.

Despite this, the logic of the function itself is correct. If the assertions were placed after the function definition, they would pass, indicating that the function works as intended.

Correctness: **True**

End of Original Assessment
