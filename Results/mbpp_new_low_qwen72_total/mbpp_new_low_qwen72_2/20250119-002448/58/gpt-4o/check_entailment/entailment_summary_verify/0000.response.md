Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` boolean values in a given list. According to the function summary, the function treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, and returns the sum of these values. This approach is correct because in Python, boolean values can be used in arithmetic operations where `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0.

Let's break down the behavior of the function based on the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([True, False, True]) == 2`
   - The list contains two `True` values and one `False` value.
   - Summing the list: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
   - The function returns 2, which is correct.

2. `func_1([False, False]) == 0`
   - The list contains only `False` values.
   - Summing the list: `0 + 0 = 0`
   - The function returns 0, which is correct.

3. `func_1([True, True, True]) == 3`
   - The list contains three `True` values.
   - Summing the list: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - The function returns 3, which is correct.

The function summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, and the provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with mixed boolean values, all `False`, and all `True`. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
