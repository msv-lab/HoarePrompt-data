Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` indeed uses the `sum` function to add up the values in the list `bool_list`. As noted in the original assessment, in Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` is treated as `0` in arithmetic operations. Therefore, using `sum` on a list of booleans will count the number of `True` values in the list, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function logic itself is sound. However, it also correctly points out that the assertions and the function definition should be in the same code block for the test cases to run without errors. This is a critical point because if the function is not defined before the assertions are executed, the program will raise a `NameError`.

Given that the logic of the function is correct and the issue with the placement of the assertions can be easily fixed by moving the assertions below the function definition, the function would work as intended.

Final: **True** 

The function is logically correct, and the only issue is with the placement of the assertions, which does not affect the correctness of the function itself but rather the structure of the code.
