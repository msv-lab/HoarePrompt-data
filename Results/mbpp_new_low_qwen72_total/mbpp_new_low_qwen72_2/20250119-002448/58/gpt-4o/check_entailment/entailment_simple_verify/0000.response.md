Reasoning: The original assessment is indeed accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` booleans in the given list by leveraging the fact that in Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function effectively adds up all the `True` values (each contributing 1) and `False` values (each contributing 0), resulting in the total count of `True` values in the list. The provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including:

- A list with mixed boolean values: `[True, False, True]` (expected output: 2)
- A list with all `False` values: `[False, False]` (expected output: 0)
- A list with all `True` values: `[True, True, True]` (expected output: 3)

These test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
