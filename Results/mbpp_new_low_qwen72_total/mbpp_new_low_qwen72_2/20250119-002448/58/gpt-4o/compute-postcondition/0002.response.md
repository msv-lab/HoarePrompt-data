Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values, and returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. **

### Explanation:
- **Parameters**: The function accepts one parameter, `bool_list`, which is expected to be a list of boolean values (`True` or `False`).
- **Return Value**: The function returns an integer representing the sum of the boolean values in the list, where `True` is counted as 1 and `False` is counted as 0.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bool_list` is an empty list, the function will return 0.
  - If `bool_list` contains non-boolean values, the behavior is undefined (e.g., it may raise a `TypeError` if non-boolean values are present).

### Final State:
- After the function execution, the program will have returned an integer value that represents the count of `True` values in the input list. The original `bool_list` remains unchanged.
