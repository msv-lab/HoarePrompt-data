The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and returns the list sorted in ascending order. The length of the returned list remains the same as the input list. The function uses a series of reversals to ensure that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list in each iteration. After the function concludes, the list `arr` is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order, and the variable `size` will have decreased from the initial length of `arr` to 1. If the input list is empty or contains only one element, it is returned unchanged.
