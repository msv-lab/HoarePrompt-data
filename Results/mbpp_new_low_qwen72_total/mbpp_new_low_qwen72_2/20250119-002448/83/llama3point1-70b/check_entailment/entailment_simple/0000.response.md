Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` appears to implement a sorting algorithm that repeatedly moves the maximum element of the unsorted portion of the list to its correct position by using reversals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `n` to the length of the input list `arr`.

2. **Loop Over Unsorted Portion**: The outer loop iterates from `n` down to 1, effectively considering the unsorted portion of the list from the end towards the beginning.

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**: For each iteration, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`).

4. **Reversal Operations**:
   - If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion (`max_index != size - 1`), the function performs two reversals:
     - First, it reverses the sublist from the start to the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1]`).
     - Then, it reverses the entire unsorted portion (`arr[:size]`).

5. **Final State**: After the loop, the list `arr` should be sorted in ascending order. The comments confirm that the loop ensures the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list, and this process continues until the entire list is sorted.

6. **Return Statement**: The function returns the sorted list `arr`.

To verify correctness, let's consider a few key points:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion.
- The reversals ensure that the maximum element is moved to the correct position.
- The loop structure guarantees that the entire list is processed, and the final state of `arr` is indeed sorted in ascending order.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
