Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to sort a list of elements. However, it uses a specific sorting algorithm known as "Pancake Sort," which repeatedly flips the largest unsorted element to the front and then to its correct position. This algorithm works under certain conditions, but it has a flaw in the implementation provided.

The issue lies in the condition `if max_index != size - 1:`. This condition checks if the maximum element in the current segment of the array is already in its correct position. If it is, the function should skip the flipping step for that element. However, the code does not handle the case where the maximum element is already in the correct position but is not the last element of the current segment.

For example, consider the input list `[3, 1, 2]`. The correct sorted list should be `[1, 2, 3]`. Let's trace the function:

1. `size = 3`, `max_index = 0` (since 3 is the maximum element).
2. Since `max_index != size - 1`, the function will flip the first two elements (`[3, 1]`), resulting in `[1, 3, 2]`.
3. The function then flips the entire segment (`[1, 3, 2]`), resulting in `[2, 3, 1]`.

At this point, the function has not sorted the list correctly. The list should be `[1, 2, 3]`, but it is `[2, 3, 1]`.

This example demonstrates that the function does not work correctly for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
