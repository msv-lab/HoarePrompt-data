Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to sort a list of elements using a variant of the selection sort algorithm, but with a twist: it uses reversals to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by determining the length of the input list `arr` and initializes `n` with this value.

2. **Loop Structure**: The function uses a `for` loop that iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive). This loop is responsible for ensuring that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list.

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**: Inside the loop, the function finds the index of the maximum element in the first `size` elements of the list (`arr[:size]`). This is done using `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`.

4. **Reversal Operations**:
   - If the maximum element is not already at the last position of the unsorted portion (`size - 1`), the function performs two reversal operations:
     - If `max_index` is not `0`, it reverses the sublist from the start to `max_index + 1` to bring the maximum element to the front.
     - It then reverses the sublist from the start to `size` to move the maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.

5. **Loop Invariant**: After each iteration of the loop, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list. This ensures that after `n` iterations, the entire list is sorted in ascending order.

6. **Return Statement**: The function returns the sorted list `arr`.

The comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, and the logic of the function is consistent with the problem description. The function correctly sorts the list using the described method.

Correctness: **True**
