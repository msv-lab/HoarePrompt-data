Reasoning:

The function `func_1` implements a sorting algorithm known as "Pancake Sort." This algorithm works by repeatedly flipping (reversing) portions of the list to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by determining the length of the input list `arr`.

2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates from the length of the list down to 1. This loop ensures that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list in each iteration.

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**: Inside the loop, the function finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`).

4. **First Flip**: If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion, the function performs a flip to bring the maximum element to the front of the unsorted portion. This is done by reversing the sublist from the start to the maximum element's index.

5. **Second Flip**: The function then performs another flip to move the maximum element to the end of the unsorted portion. This is done by reversing the entire unsorted portion of the list.

6. **Return**: After all iterations, the function returns the sorted list.

Based on the execution summary, the function correctly sorts the list in ascending order by moving the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each iteration. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by returning the list unchanged.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
