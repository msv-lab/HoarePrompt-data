Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a list of elements.

# Program:
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and returns the list sorted in ascending order. The length of the returned list remains the same as the input list. The function uses a series of reversals to ensure that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list in each iteration. After the function concludes, the list `arr` is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order, and the variable `size` will have decreased from the initial length of `arr` to 1. If the input list is empty or contains only one element, it is returned unchanged.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
