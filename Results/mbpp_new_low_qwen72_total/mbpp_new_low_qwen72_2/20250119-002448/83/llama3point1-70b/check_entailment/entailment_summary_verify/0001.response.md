Reasoning:

The original assessment is thorough and accurate. The function `func_1` indeed implements a sorting algorithm that uses a series of reversals to move the maximum element to its correct position in each iteration. Let's break down the key points and validate them:

1. **Outer Loop**: The loop `for size in range(n, 0, -1)` iterates over the array from the last element to the first, reducing the size of the unsorted portion of the array in each iteration.

2. **Finding Maximum Element**: In each iteration, the function finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array using `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`.

3. **Reversal Operations**:
   - If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion (`if max_index != size - 1`):
     - If the maximum element is not at the start of the array (`if max_index != 0`), it reverses the subarray from the start to the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`), bringing the maximum element to the start of the unsorted portion.
     - It then reverses the entire unsorted portion (`arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`), placing the maximum element at the end of the unsorted portion.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function was tested with various inputs, including edge cases like an empty list and a single-element list, and it produced the expected sorted results.

Given the detailed reasoning and the successful test cases, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does indeed sort the list as described.

Final: **True**
