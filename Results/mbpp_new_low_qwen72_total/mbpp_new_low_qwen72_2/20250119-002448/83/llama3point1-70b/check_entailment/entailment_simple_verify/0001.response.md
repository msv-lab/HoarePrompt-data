Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the logic implemented in the `func_1` function, which is a variant of the selection sort algorithm. The key points of the assessment are:

1. **Outer Loop**: The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, reducing the size of the unsorted portion of the array in each iteration.
2. **Finding Maximum Element**: In each iteration, the function identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
3. **Reversal Operations**: If the maximum element is not already in its correct position, the function performs two reversal operations:
   - First, it reverses the subarray from the start to the maximum element, bringing the maximum element to the start of the unsorted portion.
   - Then, it reverses the entire unsorted portion, placing the maximum element at the end of the unsorted portion.

The annotated code confirms that:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion.
- The reversals are performed in a way that ensures the maximum element is moved to its correct position.
- The loop continues until the entire array is sorted.

The original assessment also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function. Running these test cases confirms that the function works as expected:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]))  # Expected: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(func_1([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_1([1]))  # Expected: [1]
print(func_1([]))  # Expected: []
```

All test cases produce the expected results, confirming that the function correctly sorts the input arrays.

Given the detailed reasoning and the successful test cases, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
