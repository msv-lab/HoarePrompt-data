Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the sublist from the start to `max_index` (inclusive) is reversed.***
