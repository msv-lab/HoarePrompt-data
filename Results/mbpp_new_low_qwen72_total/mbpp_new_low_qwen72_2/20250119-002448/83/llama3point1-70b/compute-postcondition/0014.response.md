Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 1`. If `max_index` is not `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:size]` is reversed, and `max_index` may no longer be valid. If `max_index` is `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:size]` remains unchanged, and `max_index` is still the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.***
