The code snippet updates the value of `max_index` by finding the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`.

- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `size` is `n - 1`.
- `max_index` is initially the index of the maximum element in `arr`.

The code changes `max_index` to the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
