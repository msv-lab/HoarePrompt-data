The code snippet assigns to `max_index` the index of the maximum element in the slice of `arr` from the start up to (but not including) the position `size`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, which is the length of `arr`, the slice `arr[:size]` is equivalent to the entire list `arr`.

Therefore, `max_index` will be the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`.

The values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`**
