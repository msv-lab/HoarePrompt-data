The only objects in the loop head are the variable `size` and the list `arr`. The loop's continuation is determined by the value of `size` and the length of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `size` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `size` should be decremented to `n - 2`.
- `arr` remains the same as its length does not change and is not directly modified by the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 2`**.
