To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for size in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `size`, `n`, and the `range` function.

2. **Range Function:**
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). This means the loop will run as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
   - `n` is the length of `arr`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the `range` function will not generate any values, and the loop will not execute.

5. **Initial Values:**
   - Before the loop starts, `size` will be initialized to `n` (the first value in the range).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `size` will be `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
