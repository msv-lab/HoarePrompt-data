Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is 0. The loop ensures that after each iteration, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Variables `n` and `arr` remain constant throughout the loop, while `size` decreases from `n` to 1. The loop always executes `n` times, assuming `n > 0`.**
