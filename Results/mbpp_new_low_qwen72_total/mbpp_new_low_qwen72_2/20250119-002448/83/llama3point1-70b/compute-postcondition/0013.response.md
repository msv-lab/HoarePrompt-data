The code snippet `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the sublist `arr[:size]`. This means that the elements from the start of the list up to (but not including) the index `size` will be reversed.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements
- `n` is the length of `arr`
- `size` is `n - 1`
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not 0, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.

After executing the code:
- The sublist `arr[:size]` is reversed, meaning the first `size` elements of `arr` are now in reverse order.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `arr`.
- The value of `size` remains unchanged as it is derived from `n`.
- The value of `max_index` is no longer necessarily valid since the elements in `arr[:size]` have been reversed, which could change the position of the maximum element.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 1`, `arr[:size]` is reversed, `max_index` may no longer be valid.**
