The given code snippet reverses the slice of the list `arr` from the start up to (and including) the element at the index `max_index`. This operation modifies the portion of the list up to and including `max_index`.

Let's break down the impact:

- The original values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` remain unchanged.
- The slice `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, meaning the elements from the start of the list up to and including the element at `max_index` are reversed in their order.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 2`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed**.
