The given code snippet reverses the sublist from the start of `arr` up to and including the element at `max_index`. This operation affects the order of elements in this sublist but does not change the lengths or the overall structure of the list `arr`. The variables `n`, `size`, and `max_index` retain their roles but `max_index` specifically points to the maximum element within the sublist `arr[:size]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.**
