Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 2`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the first `n - 2` elements of `arr` are reversed, while the last two elements of `arr` remain unchanged.***
