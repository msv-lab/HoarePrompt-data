`n` is assigned the value `len(arr)`, which is the number of elements in the list `arr`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`**
