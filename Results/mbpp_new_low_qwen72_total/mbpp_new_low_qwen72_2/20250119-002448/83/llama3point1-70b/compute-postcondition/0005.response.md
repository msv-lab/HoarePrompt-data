The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist of `arr` from the beginning up to and including the element at `max_index`.

- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is equal to `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` or `0`.
- The operation `arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` creates a reversed version of the sublist from the start of `arr` to the element at `max_index`.
- This reversed sublist is then assigned back to the same slice of `arr`, effectively reversing the order of elements in the sublist from the start to `max_index`.

Since the reversal only affects the sublist from the start to `max_index`, the rest of the list remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain the same, but the elements in the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` are now in reverse order.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements where the sublist from the start to `max_index` (inclusive) is reversed, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` or `0`.**
