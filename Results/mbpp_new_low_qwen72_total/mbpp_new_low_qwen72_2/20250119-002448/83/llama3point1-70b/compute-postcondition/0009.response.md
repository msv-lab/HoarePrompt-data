The only objects in the loop head are `size` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop continues as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented by 1, so it becomes `n - 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as it represents the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `arr` is reversed, and `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the original `arr` (before reversal). If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged.**
