Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `arr` is reversed, and `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the original `arr` (before reversal). If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged.***
