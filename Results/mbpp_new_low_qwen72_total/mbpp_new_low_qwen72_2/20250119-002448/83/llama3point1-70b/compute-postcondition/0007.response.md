The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the entire list `arr` up to the index `size - 1`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, which is the length of `arr`, the entire list `arr` is reversed. The variables `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged. However, the condition that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` may no longer hold true after the reversal, as the positions of the elements have changed.

Output State: **`arr` is reversed, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the original `arr` (before reversal), and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`.**
