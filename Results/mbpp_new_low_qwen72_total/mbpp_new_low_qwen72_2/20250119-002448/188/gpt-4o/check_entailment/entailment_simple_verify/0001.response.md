Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function `func_1` correctly implements this calculation using the formula \((a + b) / 2\).

The annotated code confirms that the function takes two positive integers `a` and `b` as the lengths of the two parallel sides and returns their average. The third parameter `_` is indeed a placeholder and is not used in the calculation, which aligns with the problem description.

The test cases provided in the program are consistent with the expected results:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` correctly returns \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\)
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` correctly returns \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\)
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` correctly returns \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\)

Since the function correctly implements the required logic and all test cases pass, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
