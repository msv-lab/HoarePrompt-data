You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average length of the two parallel sides of a trapezium, calculated as (a + b) / 2, where `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three parameters, but the third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation. The problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which is calculated as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (a and b). However, the third parameter is likely intended to represent the height of the trapezium, which is not needed for calculating the median length. This suggests that the function signature might be incorrect or misleading, as it includes an unused parameter. Additionally, the median length of a trapezium is correctly calculated as `(a + b) / 2`, but the presence of the unused parameter makes the function signature incorrect for the given problem description.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2
```

This would remove the unnecessary parameter and make the function match the problem description more accurately.
