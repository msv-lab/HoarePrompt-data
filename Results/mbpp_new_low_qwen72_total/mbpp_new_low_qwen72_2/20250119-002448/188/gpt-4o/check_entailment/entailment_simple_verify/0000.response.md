Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed calculates the median length of a trapezium correctly as `(a + b) / 2`. However, the function signature includes an unused parameter `_`, which is misleading and does not align with the problem description. The presence of this unused parameter could confuse users about the function's purpose and the required inputs. A more appropriate function signature should only include the two parameters `a` and `b` that are actually used in the calculation.

Therefore, while the logic inside the function is correct, the function signature is incorrect, making the overall implementation flawed according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
