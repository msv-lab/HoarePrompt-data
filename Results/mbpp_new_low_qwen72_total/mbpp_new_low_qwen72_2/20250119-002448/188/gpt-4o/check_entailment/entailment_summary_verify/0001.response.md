Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The problem description clearly specifies that the task is to find the median length of a trapezium, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function `func_1` correctly implements this by using the formula \((a + b) / 2\).

The function summary confirms that the third parameter `_` is not used and is irrelevant to the computation, which aligns with the problem description that only requires the lengths of the two parallel sides. The test cases provided in the program correctly verify the functionality of the function:

- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` returns \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\)
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` returns \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\)
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` returns \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\)

These test cases cover different scenarios and all pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is valid.

Final: **True**
