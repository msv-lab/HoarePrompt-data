Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the third parameter `_` is unused and potentially misleading. The function `func_1` does indeed calculate the median length of a trapezium correctly using the formula `(a + b) / 2`, which is the average of the two parallel sides. However, the presence of the unused parameter `_` in the function signature is inconsistent with the problem description, which does not mention a third parameter. The function's logic is correct, but the function signature is not aligned with the problem statement, leading to potential confusion or misuse of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out the issue with the function signature.

Final: **False**
