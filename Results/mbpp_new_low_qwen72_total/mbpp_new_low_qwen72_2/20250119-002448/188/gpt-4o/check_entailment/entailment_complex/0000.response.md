Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is correctly computed as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (`a` and `b`). The formula `(a + b) / 2` is mathematically correct for this purpose. The function ignores the third parameter, denoted by `_`, which is not used in the calculation. This is acceptable since the problem only requires the lengths of the two parallel sides.

The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` returns `20`, which is correct.
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` returns `15`, which is correct.
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` returns `7.5`, which is correct.

Since the function implements the correct formula and passes all the provided test cases, it can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
