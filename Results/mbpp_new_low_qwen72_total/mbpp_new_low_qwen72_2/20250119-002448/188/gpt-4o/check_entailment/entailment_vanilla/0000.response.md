Reasoning:  
The problem statement asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium. The median length of a trapezium is calculated as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases). The formula for the median length is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides.

In the given program, the function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, which suggests that it might be a placeholder for an unused value. This is consistent with the problem description, which only requires the lengths of the two parallel sides.

The function correctly implements the formula \((a + b) / 2\) to calculate the median length. The test cases provided also verify this:

- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\)
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\)
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\)

All the test cases pass, indicating that the function is working as expected.

Correctness: **True**
