Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which is correctly defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases). The function `func_1` indeed calculates this average using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two parallel sides.

The annotated code confirms that:
1. The function takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, which is consistent with the problem statement.
2. The function correctly returns the average of `a` and `b`.
3. The test cases provided in the assertions are valid and correctly verify the function's behavior:
   - `func_1(15, 25, 35)` returns \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\)
   - `func_1(10, 20, 30)` returns \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\)
   - `func_1(6, 9, 4)` returns \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\)

All these test cases pass, confirming that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The function does not handle non-integer or non-positive values, but the problem statement assumes valid inputs, so this is not a concern for the correctness evaluation.

Final: **True**
