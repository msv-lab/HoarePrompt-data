Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the third parameter `_` is unused and potentially misleading. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula `(a + b) / 2`, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. However, the presence of the unused third parameter violates the principle of least surprise and can lead to confusion for users who might expect all parameters to be used. Therefore, the function signature should be revised to only include the necessary parameters `a` and `b`.

The annotated code confirms that the function works correctly for the given test cases, but it also highlights the issue with the unused parameter. The annotations do not contradict the original assessment but rather support it by emphasizing the irrelevance of the third parameter.

Final: **False**
