You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average length of the two parallel sides of a trapezium, calculated as (a + b) / 2, where `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and an unused parameter (denoted by `_`). It calculates and returns the average length of the two parallel sides of a trapezium, given as `(a + b) / 2`. The parameters `a` and `b` are expected to be positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function does not use the third parameter, and its presence is irrelevant to the computation. The function does not handle non-integer or non-positive values for `a` and `b`, which could lead to incorrect results or exceptions. After the function concludes, the program state remains unchanged except for the returned value, which is the average length of the two parallel sides.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The problem statement asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium. The median length of a trapezium is calculated as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases). The formula for the median length is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides.

In the given program, the function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, which suggests that it might be a placeholder for an unused value. This is consistent with the problem description, which only requires the lengths of the two parallel sides.

The function correctly implements the formula \((a + b) / 2\) to calculate the median length. The test cases provided also verify this:

- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\)
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\)
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\)

All the test cases pass, indicating that the function is working as expected.

Correctness: **True**
