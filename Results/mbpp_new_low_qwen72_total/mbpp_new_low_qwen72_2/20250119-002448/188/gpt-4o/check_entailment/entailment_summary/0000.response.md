Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function correctly computes this by returning `(a + b) / 2`. The third parameter `_` is indeed unused and does not affect the computation, but its presence does not make the function incorrect. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers, and the test cases provided in the `assert` statements confirm that the function works as intended for these inputs. Since the problem description and the provided test cases do not specify any requirements for handling non-integer or non-positive values, we can assume that the function is correct within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
