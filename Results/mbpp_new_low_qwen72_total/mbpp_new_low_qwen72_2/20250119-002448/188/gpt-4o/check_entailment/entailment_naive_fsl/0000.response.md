Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three parameters, but the third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation. The problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which is calculated as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (a and b). However, the third parameter is likely intended to represent the height of the trapezium, which is not needed for calculating the median length. This suggests that the function signature might be incorrect or misleading, as it includes an unused parameter. Additionally, the median length of a trapezium is correctly calculated as `(a + b) / 2`, but the presence of the unused parameter makes the function signature incorrect for the given problem description.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2
```

This would remove the unnecessary parameter and make the function match the problem description more accurately.
