Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the median length of a trapezium, which is the average length of the two parallel sides. The function `func_1` takes three parameters, but only uses the first two (`a` and `b`) to calculate the median length. The third parameter `_` is not used and seems to be a placeholder, which is acceptable as it does not affect the calculation.

The formula `(a + b) / 2` correctly calculates the median length of the trapezium. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` returns `20`, which is the average of 15 and 25.
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` returns `15`, which is the average of 10 and 20.
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` returns `7.5`, which is the average of 6 and 9.

Since the function correctly implements the required logic and passes all the test cases, it can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
