The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides of a trapezium. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation. The function returns the average length of the two parallel sides of the trapezium, calculated as `(a + b) / 2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b` (both positive integers) and returns the average length of the two parallel sides of a trapezium, calculated as `(a + b) / 2`.**
