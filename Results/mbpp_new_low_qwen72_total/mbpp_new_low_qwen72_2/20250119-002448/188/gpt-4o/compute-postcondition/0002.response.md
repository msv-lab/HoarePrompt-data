Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and an unused parameter (denoted by `_`). It calculates and returns the average length of the two parallel sides of a trapezium, given as `(a + b) / 2`. The parameters `a` and `b` are expected to be positive integers representing the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function does not use the third parameter, and its presence is irrelevant to the computation. The function does not handle non-integer or non-positive values for `a` and `b`, which could lead to incorrect results or exceptions. After the function concludes, the program state remains unchanged except for the returned value, which is the average length of the two parallel sides. **
