Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `arr`. If `x` is equal to `num`, the program returns 1. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to `num` and the program does not return anything specific.***
