To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the components:

- The loop uses `enumerate(arr)`, which means it will iterate over the elements of `arr` along with their indices.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least one element.
- Before the loop starts, the index `i` should be 0, and `x` should be the first element of `arr`.

Given this, we can state the conditions as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least 1 element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`**
