The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_3**: The function returns 2.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that `num` was not found in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and return a specific value based on the conditions outlined above.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and returns 0, 1, 2, or -1 (indicating that `num` was not found in the list `arr`) based on specific conditions.**
