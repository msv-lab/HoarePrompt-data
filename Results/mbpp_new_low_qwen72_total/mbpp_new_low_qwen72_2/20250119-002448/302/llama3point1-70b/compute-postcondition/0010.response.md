Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, and the loop has completed iterating through all elements of `arr`. If `num` was found in `arr`, the function returned the index of `num`. If `num` was not found in `arr`, the function did not return any value (or implicitly returned `None`). The variables `i` and `x` will have the values corresponding to the last element of `arr` if the loop completes without finding `num`.**
