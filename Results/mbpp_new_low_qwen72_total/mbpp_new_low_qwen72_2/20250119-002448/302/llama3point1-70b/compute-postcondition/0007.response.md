The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `x`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `arr`.**
