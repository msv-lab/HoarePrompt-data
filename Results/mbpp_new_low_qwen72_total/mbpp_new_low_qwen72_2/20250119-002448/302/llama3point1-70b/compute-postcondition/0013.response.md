Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of `num` in `arr` is returned, or `-1` is returned if `num` is not present in `arr`. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function will return `-1` since the loop will not execute.
- The function assumes that `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, but it does not enforce this condition. If `arr` is not sorted, the function may still return an index, but it may not be the correct index for `num`.
- The function only returns the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` if `num` appears multiple times. If the user needs all occurrences, this function would need to be modified.
