The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of `num` in `arr` is returned, or `-1` is returned if `num` is not present in `arr`.
