Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates through the array using a `for` loop and checks each element to see if it matches `num`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of the matching element. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `num` is not present in the array.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and the provided annotations. The function correctly handles the case where `num` is found and the case where `num` is not found. The function also does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
