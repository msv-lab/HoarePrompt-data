Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. According to the problem description, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`, or `-1` if `num` is not found. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of `num`, it returns the corresponding index. If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1`.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected: it returns the index of `num` if it is found, or `-1` if it is not found. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
