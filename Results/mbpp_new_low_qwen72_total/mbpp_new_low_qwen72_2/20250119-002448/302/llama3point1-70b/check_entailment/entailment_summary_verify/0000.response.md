Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that while the function `func_1` works correctly in terms of producing the correct output, it does not utilize the most efficient algorithm given the constraint that the array is sorted. The function performs a linear search, which is less efficient (O(n)) compared to a binary search (O(log n)) for finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array. However, the question of "correctness" can be nuanced. If we strictly consider whether the function meets the functional requirements (returns the correct index or -1 as specified), then `func_1` is correct. But from a performance perspective, especially for large arrays, the function is suboptimal.

Given the problem description and the emphasis on the array being sorted, the original assessment's point about efficiency is valid and important. Therefore, while the function is technically correct in its output, the assessment that it is not the best solution for the given problem is accurate.

Final: **False** (The function is correct in its output but inefficient for the given problem, thus not fully meeting the requirements.)
