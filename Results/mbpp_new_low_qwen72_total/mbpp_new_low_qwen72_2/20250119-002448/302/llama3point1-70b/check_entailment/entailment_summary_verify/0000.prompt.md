You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

- Program:
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of `num` in `arr` is returned, or `-1` is returned if `num` is not present in `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` performs a linear search through the array to find the first occurrence of the given number. However, the problem description specifically asks for a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array. For a sorted array, a more efficient approach would be to use a binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n), rather than a linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n).

A case where the program does not work efficiently (though it still works correctly in terms of output) is when the array is very large. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 2]` (with a large number of `1`s followed by a single `2`). The linear search will take O(n) time to find the first occurrence of `2`, whereas a binary search would find it in O(log n) time.
