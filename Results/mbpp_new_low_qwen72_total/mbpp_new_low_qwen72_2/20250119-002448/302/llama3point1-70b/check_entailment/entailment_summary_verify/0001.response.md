Reasoning:
The function `func_1` indeed implements a linear search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The function correctly iterates over each element in the array, compares it with `num`, and returns the index of the first match. If no match is found, it returns `-1`, which aligns with the problem description.

However, the function does not leverage the fact that the array is sorted, which could allow for a more efficient search algorithm, such as binary search. Despite this inefficiency, the function still meets the requirements of the problem description and behaves correctly for the given inputs.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, confirming that it returns the correct index or `-1` as appropriate. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function works correctly for the specified problem.

Final: **True**
