Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` performs a linear search through the array to find the first occurrence of the given number. However, the problem description specifically asks for a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array. For a sorted array, a more efficient approach would be to use a binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n), rather than a linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n).

A case where the program does not work efficiently (though it still works correctly in terms of output) is when the array is very large. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 2]` (with a large number of `1`s followed by a single `2`). The linear search will take O(n) time to find the first occurrence of `2`, whereas a binary search would find it in O(log n) time.
