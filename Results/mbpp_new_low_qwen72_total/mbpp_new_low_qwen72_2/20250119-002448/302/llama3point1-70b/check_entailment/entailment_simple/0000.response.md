Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using a for loop, and if it finds the number, it returns the index immediately. If the loop completes without finding the number, the function returns `-1`, which correctly indicates that the number was not found in the array. The comments accurately describe the state of the program at each relevant point, and the logic of the function aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
