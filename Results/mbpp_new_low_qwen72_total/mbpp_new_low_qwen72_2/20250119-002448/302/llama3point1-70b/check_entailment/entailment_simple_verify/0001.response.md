Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function iterates over the array `arr` and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`. This aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

The annotations provided also confirm that:
1. The function correctly initializes the loop to iterate over the array.
2. The loop correctly checks each element against `num`.
3. The function returns the index of the first match found.
4. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`.

The original assessment also mentions that the function does not take advantage of the sorted nature of the array, which is true. However, this does not affect the correctness of the function for the given problem. The function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
