Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses a linear search approach, which is less efficient than a binary search for a sorted array. However, the original assessment states that the function is **incorrect** because it is inefficient. Efficiency is a concern, but it does not necessarily make the function **incorrect** in terms of producing the correct output for the given problem description. The function `func_1` will indeed return the correct index of the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array, or `-1` if the number is not found. Therefore, while the function is not optimal, it is still correct in terms of its output.

Final: **True**
