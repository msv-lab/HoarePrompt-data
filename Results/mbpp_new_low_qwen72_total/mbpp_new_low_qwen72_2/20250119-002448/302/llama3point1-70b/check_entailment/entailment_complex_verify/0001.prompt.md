You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

- Program: 
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, and the loop has completed iterating through all elements of `arr`. If `num` was found in `arr`, the function returned the index of `num`. If `num` was not found in `arr`, the function did not return any value (or implicitly returned `None`). The variables `i` and `x` will have the values corresponding to the last element of `arr` if the loop completes without finding `num`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that `num` was not found in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of `num` in `arr` is returned, or `-1` is returned if `num` is not present in `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. The function works correctly for a sorted array as well, although it does not take advantage of the sorted nature of the array to optimize the search (e.g., using binary search).

Correctness: **True**
