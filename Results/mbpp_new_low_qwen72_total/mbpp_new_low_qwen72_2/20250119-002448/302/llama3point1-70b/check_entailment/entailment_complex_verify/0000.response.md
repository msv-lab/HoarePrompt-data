Reasoning: 

The original assessment raises a valid point regarding the efficiency of the provided solution. The function `func_1` indeed uses a linear search to find the index of the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array. While this approach is correct in terms of producing the right output, it is not optimal for a sorted array. A binary search algorithm would be more appropriate for this scenario, as it leverages the sorted nature of the array to achieve a time complexity of O(log n) instead of O(n).

However, the original assessment's correctness rating is **False** because it focuses on the efficiency of the solution rather than its correctness. The function `func_1` does correctly implement the specified functionality according to the problem description: it finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and returns `-1` if the number is not found. The function does not violate the problem constraints and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**

While the function can be optimized for better performance, it is correct in terms of its functionality and meets the requirements of the problem description.
