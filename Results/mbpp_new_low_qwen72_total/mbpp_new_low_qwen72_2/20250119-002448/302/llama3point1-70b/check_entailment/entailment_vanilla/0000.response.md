Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. The function works correctly for a sorted array as well, although it does not take advantage of the sorted nature of the array to optimize the search (e.g., using binary search).

Correctness: **True**
