The provided code snippet performs the following operations:

1. Converts `list1` and `list2` into sets named `set1` and `set2`, respectively. This removes any duplicate elements within each list.
2. Computes the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, which consists of elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. The result is stored in `diff_elements`.
3. Converts `diff_elements` back into a list named `result_list`.
4. Sorts `result_list` based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

Since the initial state only specifies that `list1` and `list2` are lists without providing their contents, we can only describe the final state in terms of the transformations applied to these lists.

Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists, set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1, set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2, diff_elements is a set containing elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both, result_list is a sorted list of elements in diff_elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list list1 + list2**.
