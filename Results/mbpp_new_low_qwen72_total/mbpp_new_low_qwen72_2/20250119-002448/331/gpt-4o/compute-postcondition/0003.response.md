Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The sorting is based on the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return a sorted list of elements from the non-empty list. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. **

### Explanation:
- **Parameters**: The function takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`.
- **Return Value**: A sorted list of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.
- **Sorting Criteria**: The elements are sorted based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `list1` is empty and `list2` is not, the function returns a sorted list of elements from `list2`.
  - If `list2` is empty and `list1` is not, the function returns a sorted list of elements from `list1`.
  - If both `list1` and `list2` are empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - If there are duplicate elements within `list1` or `list2`, only the unique elements that meet the symmetric difference criteria are considered.
- **Missing Functionality**:
  - The function does not handle cases where the elements in `list1` and `list2` are not hashable (e.g., lists, dictionaries), which would cause a `TypeError` when converting them to sets. This should be noted as a potential limitation.
