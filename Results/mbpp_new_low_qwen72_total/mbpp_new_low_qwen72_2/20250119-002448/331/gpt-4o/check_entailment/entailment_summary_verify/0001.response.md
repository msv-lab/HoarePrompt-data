Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the function `func_1` and its behavior. Let's re-evaluate the function and the test cases to ensure the correctness.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Conversion to Sets**:
   - The lists `list1` and `list2` are converted to sets `set1` and `set2`. This step is correct and efficient for finding unique elements and their differences.

2. **Symmetric Difference**:
   - The `symmetric_difference` method is used to find elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This is the correct approach for identifying the symmetric difference.

3. **Conversion to List**:
   - The result of the symmetric difference is converted back to a list. This step is necessary to prepare for sorting.

4. **Sorting by Original Order**:
   - The `sort` method with a custom key is used to sort the elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are returned in the order they appear in the original lists.

### Test Case Verification:
1. **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
   - Symmetric difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
   - Sorted by original order: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
   - Expected: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
   - Result: Matches expected output.

2. **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
   - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
   - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - Expected: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - Result: Matches expected output.

3. **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
   - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
   - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
   - Expected: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
   - Result: Matches expected output.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return the elements of the non-empty list in the order they appear.
  - If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. These edge cases are handled correctly by the function.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the symmetric difference between two lists and sorts the result based on the original order of appearance. All provided test cases are correctly handled, and the function behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
