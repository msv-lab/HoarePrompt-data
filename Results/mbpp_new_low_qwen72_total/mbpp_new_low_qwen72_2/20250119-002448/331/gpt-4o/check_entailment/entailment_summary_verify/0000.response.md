### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the sorting step. Specifically, it points out that using the `index` method on the concatenated list `(list1 + list2)` can lead to incorrect ordering when there are duplicate elements in the lists.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It converts `list1` and `list2` to sets and finds the symmetric difference.
- It sorts the resulting list based on the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list `(list1 + list2)`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Symmetric Difference**: The use of `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)` correctly identifies elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.
2. **Sorting**: The sorting step is intended to maintain the order of elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `(list1 + list2)`. However, the `index` method used for sorting can indeed cause issues with duplicate elements.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 6])
```
- The symmetric difference is `{4, 5, 6}`.
- The concatenated list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6]`.
- The `index` method will return:
  - `4` at index `3`
  - `5` at index `4`
  - `6` at index `9`
  - `1` at index `0` (but this is the first `1`, not the second)

Thus, the sorted list will be `[4, 5, 1, 6]`, which is incorrect.

#### Corrected Approach:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the sorting key respects the order of the first occurrence of each element in the original lists. One way to do this is to create a dictionary that maps each element to its first index in the concatenated list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the first index of each element
    index_dict = {}
    for i, x in enumerate(list1 + list2):
        if x not in index_dict:
            index_dict[x] = i
    
    # Sort the result list based on the first occurrence in the concatenated list
    result_list = sorted(diff_elements, key=lambda x: index_dict[x])
    return result_list
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the sorting step. The provided function does not handle duplicate elements correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
