Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to return the symmetric difference between two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and then sort the resulting list based on the order of the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

Let's break down the function and the test cases:

1. **Function Logic:**
   - Convert `list1` and `list2` to sets (`set1` and `set2`).
   - Compute the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2` to get elements that are in either set but not in both.
   - Convert the symmetric difference set back to a list (`result_list`).
   - Sort `result_list` based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

2. **Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 40, 35]`: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
     - Expected output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
     - Actual output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
     - **Correct**

   - **Test Case 2:** `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Expected output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Actual output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - **Correct**

   - **Test Case 3:** `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - Expected output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - Actual output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - **Correct**

All test cases pass, and the function logic matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
