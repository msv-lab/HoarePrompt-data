Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution uses the `symmetric_difference` method from the set operations, which returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. However, the problem description does not specify whether the order of the resulting list matters, but the test cases suggest that the order should be based on the first occurrence in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.

The issue arises in the sorting step where the code attempts to sort the result list based on the index of each element in the combined list `(list1 + list2)`. This approach fails when there are duplicate elements in `list1` or `list2` because the `index` method will always return the index of the first occurrence of the element in the combined list, leading to incorrect ordering.

For example, consider the following input:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 6])
```
The expected output would be `[4, 5, 6]`, but the actual output will be `[4, 5, 1, 6]` because the second `1` in `list1` is treated as if it were the first `1` when sorting, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the function should handle duplicates more carefully or use a different approach to maintain the correct order of elements.
