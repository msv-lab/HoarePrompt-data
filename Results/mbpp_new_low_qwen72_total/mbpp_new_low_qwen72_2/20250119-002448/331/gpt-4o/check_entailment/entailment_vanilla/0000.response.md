Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the symmetric difference between two lists and return the result as a sorted list based on the order of appearance in the combined original lists. The symmetric difference means elements that are in one of the sets but not both. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Conversion to Sets**: The lists `list1` and `list2` are converted to sets `set1` and `set2`. This helps in efficiently finding the unique elements and their differences.
2. **Symmetric Difference**: The `symmetric_difference` method is used to find elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This correctly identifies the elements that should be in the result.
3. **Conversion to List**: The result of the symmetric difference is converted back to a list.
4. **Sorting by Original Order**: The `sort` method with a custom key is used to sort the elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are returned in the order they appear in the original lists.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

Since all test cases match the expected outputs, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
