Reasoning:
The original assessment is thorough and accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. Let's break it down further using the annotated version of the code to ensure there are no overlooked issues.

1. **Conversion to Sets**:
   ```python
   set1 = set(list1)
   set2 = set(list2)
   ```
   - This step is correct as it converts the input lists into sets, which is necessary for finding the symmetric difference.

2. **Symmetric Difference**:
   ```python
   diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
   ```
   - The `symmetric_difference` method is used correctly to find elements that are in one of the sets but not in both. This step is crucial for identifying the elements that should be in the result.

3. **Conversion to List**:
   ```python
   result_list = list(diff_elements)
   ```
   - Converting the result of the symmetric difference back to a list is necessary because the final output needs to be a list.

4. **Sorting by Original Order**:
   ```python
   result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
   ```
   - The `sort` method with a custom key is used to sort the elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are returned in the order they appear in the original lists.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return result_list
   ```
   - The function returns the sorted list of elements that are in either list but not in both.

### Verification with Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

All test cases pass, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the symmetric difference between two lists and returns the result as a sorted list based on the order of appearance in the combined original lists.

Final: **True**
