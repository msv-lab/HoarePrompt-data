Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the handling of duplicates in the sorting step. Specifically, the `index` method used in the sorting lambda function will always return the index of the first occurrence of an element in the combined list `(list1 + list2)`, which can lead to incorrect ordering if there are duplicates.

Let's break down the behavior of the function step-by-step using the provided test cases and the annotated code:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
   ```
   - `set1` = `{10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}`
   - `set2` = `{25, 40, 35}`
   - `diff_elements` = `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
   - `result_list` = `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
   - Sorting based on the first occurrence in `(list1 + list2)` results in `[10, 20, 30, 15]`
   - The output matches the expected result.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
   - `set1` = `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
   - `set2` = `{1, 6, 7}`
   - `diff_elements` = `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
   - `result_list` = `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - Sorting based on the first occurrence in `(list1 + list2)` results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - The output matches the expected result.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 6, 7]
   ```
   - `set1` = `{1, 2, 3}`
   - `set2` = `{1, 6, 7}`
   - `diff_elements` = `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
   - `result_list` = `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
   - Sorting based on the first occurrence in `(list1 + list2)` results in `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
   - The output matches the expected result.

However, the original assessment provides a counterexample that demonstrates the issue with the current implementation:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 6])
```
- `set1` = `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `set2` = `{1, 2, 3, 6}`
- `diff_elements` = `{4, 5, 6}`
- `result_list` = `[4, 5, 6]`
- Sorting based on the first occurrence in `(list1 + list2)` results in `[4, 5, 1, 6]` because the second `1` in `list1` is treated as if it were the first `1` when sorting.

This clearly shows that the function does not handle duplicates correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue.

Final: **False**
