Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly breaks down the function `func_1` and its steps. Let's re-evaluate the function using the provided annotations and test cases to ensure the reasoning is accurate:

1. **Conversion to Sets**:
   - `set1 = set(list1)`: Converts `list1` to a set, removing duplicates.
   - `set2 = set(list2)`: Converts `list2` to a set, removing duplicates.

2. **Symmetric Difference**:
   - `diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`: Finds elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This correctly identifies the elements that should be in the result.

3. **Conversion to List**:
   - `result_list = list(diff_elements)`: Converts the set of symmetric differences to a list.

4. **Sorting by Original Order**:
   - `result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))`: Sorts the elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are returned in the order they appear in the original lists.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by original order: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Matches expected output.

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the function works correctly. The original assessment's reasoning and conclusion are accurate.

Final: **True**
