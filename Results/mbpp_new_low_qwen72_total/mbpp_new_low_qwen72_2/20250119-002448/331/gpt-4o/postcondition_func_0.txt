The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The sorting is based on the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return a sorted list of elements from the non-empty list. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list.
