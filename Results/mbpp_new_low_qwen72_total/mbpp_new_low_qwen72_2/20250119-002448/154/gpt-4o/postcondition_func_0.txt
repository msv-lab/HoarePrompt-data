The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `d`, which is expected to be a dictionary. The function returns an integer representing the depth of the deepest nested dictionary within `d`. If `d` is an empty dictionary or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. For non-empty dictionaries, the function returns 1 plus the maximum depth of the nested dictionaries found in the values of `d`. The function handles both non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is not a dictionary (returns 1), when `d` is an empty dictionary (returns 1), and when `d` contains a mix of non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries (returns the correct depth).
