#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each value is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value returned by func_1 for all values in the dictionary d, where each value in d is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary, and d is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `d`, which is expected to be a dictionary. The function returns an integer representing the depth of the deepest nested dictionary within `d`. If `d` is an empty dictionary or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. For non-empty dictionaries, the function returns 1 plus the maximum depth of the nested dictionaries found in the values of `d`. The function handles both non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is not a dictionary (returns 1), when `d` is an empty dictionary (returns 1), and when `d` contains a mix of non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries (returns the correct depth).
