Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2
assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each value is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value returned by func_1 for all values in the dictionary d, where each value in d is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary, and d is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `d`, which is expected to be a dictionary. The function returns an integer representing the depth of the deepest nested dictionary within `d`. If `d` is an empty dictionary or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. For non-empty dictionaries, the function returns 1 plus the maximum depth of the nested dictionaries found in the values of `d`. The function handles both non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is not a dictionary (returns 1), when `d` is an empty dictionary (returns 1), and when `d` contains a mix of non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries (returns the correct depth).

# Your response:
