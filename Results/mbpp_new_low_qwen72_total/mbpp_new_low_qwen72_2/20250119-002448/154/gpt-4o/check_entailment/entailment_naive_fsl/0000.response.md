Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty correctly. According to the problem description, the function should find the depth of a dictionary, but the current implementation returns `1` for an empty dictionary, which is incorrect. The depth of an empty dictionary should be `0`.

For example:
```python
assert func_1({}) == 0
```
This assertion would fail with the current implementation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
