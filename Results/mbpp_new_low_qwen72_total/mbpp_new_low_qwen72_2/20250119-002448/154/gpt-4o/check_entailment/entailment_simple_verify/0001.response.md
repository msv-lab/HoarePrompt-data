Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nesting within the dictionary. The function works recursively by checking if the input is a dictionary and if it is not empty. If the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns a depth of 1. If the input is a non-empty dictionary, the function calculates the maximum depth of the values (which can themselves be dictionaries) and adds 1 to account for the current level of nesting.

Let's break down the correctness of the function with respect to the provided test cases and the annotated code:

1. `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4`
   - The dictionary has four levels of nesting: `{a}`, `{b}`, `{c}`, and `{d}`.
   - The function correctly returns 4 because:
     - `d` is a dictionary and not empty.
     - The maximum depth of its values (`1` and `{'c': {'d': {}}}`) is 3 (for `{'c': {'d': {}}`).
     - Adding 1 for the current level gives 4.

2. `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2`
   - The dictionary has two levels of nesting: `{a}` and `{b}`.
   - The function correctly returns 2 because:
     - `d` is a dictionary and not empty.
     - The maximum depth of its values (`1` and `{'c': 'python'}`) is 1 (for `{'c': 'python'`).
     - Adding 1 for the current level gives 2.

3. `func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3`
   - The dictionary has three levels of nesting: `{1}`, `{2}`, and `{3}`.
   - The function correctly returns 3 because:
     - `d` is a dictionary and not empty.
     - The maximum depth of its values (`'Sun'` and `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}`) is 2 (for `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}`).
     - Adding 1 for the current level gives 3.

The annotations in the code confirm that the function correctly handles the recursive calculation of the depth by returning 1 for non-dictionaries or empty dictionaries and adding 1 to the maximum depth of the values in the dictionary.

Given the analysis and the test cases, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
