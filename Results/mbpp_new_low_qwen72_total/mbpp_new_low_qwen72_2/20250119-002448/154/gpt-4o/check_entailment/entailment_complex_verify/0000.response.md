Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a potential issue with the handling of an empty dictionary. However, the problem description does not explicitly define what the depth of an empty dictionary should be. The function `func_1` as implemented returns `1` for an empty dictionary, which can be interpreted as the base case of the recursion: an empty dictionary has no deeper levels, so it is considered to have a depth of `1`. This interpretation is consistent with the recursive nature of the function and the examples provided in the test cases.

The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the function:
- It returns `1` for non-dictionary inputs or empty dictionaries.
- It returns `1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())` for non-empty dictionaries, ensuring that the depth is calculated correctly for nested dictionaries.

Given the lack of explicit requirements for the depth of an empty dictionary in the problem description, the current implementation is reasonable and consistent with the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
