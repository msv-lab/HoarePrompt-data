Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary, and it does so correctly based on the provided test cases and the logic implemented.

1. **Test Case 1: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4`**
   - The dictionary has four levels of nesting: `{a}`, `{b}`, `{c}`, and `{d}`.
   - The function correctly returns 4 because:
     - `{'d': {}}` has a depth of 1 (empty dictionary).
     - `{'c': {'d': {}}}` has a depth of 2 (1 + depth of `{'d': {}}`).
     - `{'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` has a depth of 3 (1 + depth of `{'c': {'d': {}}`).
     - `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` has a depth of 4 (1 + depth of `{'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`).

2. **Test Case 2: `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2`**
   - The dictionary has two levels of nesting: `{a}` and `{b}`.
   - The function correctly returns 2 because:
     - `'python'` is not a dictionary, so it has a depth of 1.
     - `{'c': 'python'}` has a depth of 1 (since `'python'` is not a dictionary).
     - `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` has a depth of 2 (1 + depth of `{'c': 'python'`).

3. **Test Case 3: `func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3`**
   - The dictionary has three levels of nesting: `{1}`, `{2}`, and `{3}`.
   - The function correctly returns 3 because:
     - `'Mon'` is not a dictionary, so it has a depth of 1.
     - `{4: 'Mon'}` has a depth of 1 (since `'Mon'` is not a dictionary).
     - `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}` has a depth of 2 (1 + depth of `{4: 'Mon'`).
     - `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` has a depth of 3 (1 + depth of `{3: {4: 'Mon'`).

The annotated code confirms that the function correctly handles both non-dictionary objects and nested dictionaries within the input dictionary. The function also correctly handles edge cases such as empty dictionaries and non-dictionary inputs.

Final: **True**
