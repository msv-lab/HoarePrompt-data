Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. It correctly handles the following cases:

1. **Empty Dictionary**: If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the function returns 1. This is consistent with the problem description, as an empty dictionary has no further nesting.
2. **Non-Dictionary Input**: If the input `d` is not a dictionary, the function also returns 1. This is a reasonable default behavior since the depth of a non-dictionary object is considered to be 1.
3. **Non-Empty Dictionary**: For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each nested dictionary found in the values of `d` and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the deepest level of nesting.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A deeply nested dictionary (`{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`) with a depth of 4.
- A dictionary with mixed types where the deepest dictionary has a depth of 2 (`{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}`).
- A dictionary with multiple levels of nesting (`{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}`) with a depth of 3.

The function behaves as expected in all these cases, and the execution summary confirms that it handles edge cases and mixed types correctly.

Correctness: **True**
