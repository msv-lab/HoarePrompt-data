To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `i`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
  - All other elements are 0.
- If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[3]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- `i` remains 3 because it is the upper bound of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, and all other elements are 0. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[3]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1.**
