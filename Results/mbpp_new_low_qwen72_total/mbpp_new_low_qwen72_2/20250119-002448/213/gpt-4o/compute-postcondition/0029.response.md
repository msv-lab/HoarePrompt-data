Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, otherwise it is `max(0, max_products[2] * arr[3])`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 3, `j` is 2.***
