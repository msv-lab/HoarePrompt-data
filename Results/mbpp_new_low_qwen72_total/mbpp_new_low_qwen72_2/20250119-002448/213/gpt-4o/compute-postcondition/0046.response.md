The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of positive integers. The function has two cases for its return value:

- **Case_1:** If the conditions do not allow for any valid subsequence product calculations (e.g., the list is empty or does not meet the criteria for forming subsequences as described), the function returns 0.
- **Case_2:** If valid subsequence product calculations can be made, the function returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`, where `max_products` contains the maximum products of each element in `arr` with any subsequence of previous elements in `arr` that are less than the current element, or the element itself if no such subsequence exists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of positive integers `arr` and return the maximum product value as described, or 0 if no valid product can be calculated.
