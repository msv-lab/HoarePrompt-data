The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. The fourth element of `max_products` is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])` if any of `arr[0] < arr[3]`, `arr[1] < arr[3]`, or `arr[2] < arr[3]` is true, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 4, `j` is 3**
