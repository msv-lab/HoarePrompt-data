The code snippet updates the value of `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `j` is 0, so `max_products[4]` will be updated based on the comparison between `max_products[4]` and `max_products[0] * arr[4]`.

Let's assume the initial values of `max_products` and `arr` are as follows (since the specific values are not provided, we'll use placeholders):

- `max_products = [a, b, c, d, e, ...]` (where `a, b, c, d, e, ...` are the specific initial values)
- `arr = [p, q, r, s, t, ...]` (where `p, q, r, s, t, ...` are positive integers)

The code will compute:
- `max_products[4] = max(e, a * t)`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `max_products[4]` is `max(e, a * t)`**.
