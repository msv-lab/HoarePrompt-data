To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, and all other elements are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `j` and `i`.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `0` to `i-1`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- However, since `j` is already 0 and the range is `range(1)`, the loop will only execute once (when `j` is 0).
- After this iteration, `j` will be out of the range, and the loop will terminate.

### Adjusted State:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop will not execute again because `j` will be out of the range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute again.
- The state remains the same for the next iteration, but the loop will not run again because `j` will be 1, which is not within the range `range(1)`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, and all other elements are 0. `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
