Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. The fourth element of `max_products` is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])` if any of `arr[0] < arr[3]`, `arr[1] < arr[3]`, or `arr[2] < arr[3]` is true, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 3, `j` is 3.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 2 (since `i` is 3 and `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`).
   - For each iteration, if `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the `max_products[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `arr` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `n` remains constant.
   - `max_products` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `i` remains constant at 3.
   - `j` increments from 0 to 2.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
     - If `arr[0] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max_products[0] * arr[3])`.
     - Since `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, this becomes `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3])`.
   - **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
     - If `arr[1] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max_products[1] * arr[3])`.
     - Since `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, this becomes `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3])`.
   - **Third Iteration (`j = 2`)**:
     - If `arr[2] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])`.
     - Since `max_products[2]` is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, this becomes `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final value of `max_products[3]` is the maximum product of any two elements from `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` multiplied by `arr[3]`, provided the corresponding condition `arr[j] < arr[3]` holds.
   - If none of the conditions hold, `max_products[3]` remains `arr[3]`.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
