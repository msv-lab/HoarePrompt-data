Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 3. If `arr[3]` is less than `arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `max_products[3] * arr[4]`.***
