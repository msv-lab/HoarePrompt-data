The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `i` remains 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0. `i` is 3, `j` is 2.**
