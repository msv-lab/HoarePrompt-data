Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0. `i` is 3, `j` is 1.***
