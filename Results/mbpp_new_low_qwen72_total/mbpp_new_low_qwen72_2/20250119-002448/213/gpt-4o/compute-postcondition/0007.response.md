To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[1]`, and all other elements are 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head is `for j in range(i)`.
- The loop will execute if `range(i)` produces a sequence of numbers. In Python, `range(i)` will produce a sequence from 0 to `i-1`.
- For `i = 1`, `range(i)` will produce the sequence `[0]`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute one time.

### State Before the Loop Executes:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[1]`, and all other elements are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` will be 0 during the first (and only) iteration of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute once because `i` is 1, and `range(i)` will produce the sequence `[0]`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[1]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
