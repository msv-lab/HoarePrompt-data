The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `max_products[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `max_products[1]` is now equal to `arr[1]`.

- `arr` remains a list of positive integers.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, and now the second element (index 1) is `arr[1]`.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[1]`, all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
