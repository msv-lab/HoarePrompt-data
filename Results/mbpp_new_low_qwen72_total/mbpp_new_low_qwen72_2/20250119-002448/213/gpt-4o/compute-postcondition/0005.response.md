The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute its first iteration, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and all other elements are 0.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
