To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 3.
- If `arr[3]` is less than `arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `max_products[3] * arr[4]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `i`.
- At the start of the next iteration, the loop variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The variable `i` remains the same because it defines the upper bound of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
- Since `j` is currently 3, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is 4, the loop will execute one more time when `j` is 4.

### Updated State:
- `arr` remains a list of positive integers.
- `n` remains greater than 4.
- `max_products` remains a list of length `n` with specific initial values.
- `i` remains 4.
- `j` is now 4.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 4.**
