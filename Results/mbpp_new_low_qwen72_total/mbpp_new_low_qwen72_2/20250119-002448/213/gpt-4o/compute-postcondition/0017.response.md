To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's follow the steps as outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: 
  - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
  - `n` is greater than 1.
  - `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[1]`, all other elements are 0.
  - `i` is 1.
- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for j in range(i):
      if arr[j] < arr[i]:
          max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
  ```

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `arr` remains constant throughout the loop.
  - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Variables that Change**:
  - `max_products` is updated based on the condition `arr[j] < arr[i]`.
  - `i` is incremented outside the loop (not shown in the given code).

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates over the range `0` to `i-1` (inclusive).
- For each `j` in this range, if `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the value of `max_products[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `j` ranges from 0 to 0.
  - If `arr[0] < arr[1]`, then `max_products[1]` is updated to `max(arr[1], max_products[0] * arr[1])`.
  - Since `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, this becomes `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])`.
  - Therefore, `max_products[1]` will be `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.

- After the second iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
  - If `arr[0] < arr[2]`, then `max_products[2]` is updated to `max(max_products[2], max_products[0] * arr[2])`.
  - If `arr[1] < arr[2]`, then `max_products[2]` is updated to `max(max_products[2], max_products[1] * arr[2])`.
  - Since `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, this becomes `max(max_products[2], (arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[2])`.

### Final Output State
- **Final Values of Variables**:
  - `arr` remains the same list of positive integers.
  - `n` remains greater than 1.
  - `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
    - The first element is `arr[0]`.
    - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
    - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
    - All other elements remain 0.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `j` is 1 (last value before the loop ends).

### Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, and the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 2, `j` is 1.**
