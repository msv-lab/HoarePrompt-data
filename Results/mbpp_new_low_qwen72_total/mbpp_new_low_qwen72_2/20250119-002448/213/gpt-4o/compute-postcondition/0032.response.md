The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `max_products[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, this means `max_products[4]` is set to `arr[4]`.

- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n`.
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
  - The fourth element is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])` if any of `arr[0] < arr[3]`, `arr[1] < arr[3]`, or `arr[2] < arr[3]` is true, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`.
  - All other elements (including the fifth) are initially 0.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 3.

After executing the code snippet, `max_products[4]` is now `arr[4]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])` if any of `arr[0] < arr[3]`, `arr[1] < arr[3]`, or `arr[2] < arr[3]` is true, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`, and the fifth element is `arr[4]`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 4, `j` is 3.**
