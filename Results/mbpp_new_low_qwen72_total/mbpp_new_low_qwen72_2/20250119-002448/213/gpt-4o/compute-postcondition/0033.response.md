To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
  - The fourth element is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], arr[0] * arr[2] * arr[3], arr[1] * arr[2] * arr[3])` if any of `arr[0] < arr[3]`, `arr[1] < arr[3]`, or `arr[2] < arr[3]` is true, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`.
  - The fifth element is `arr[4]`.
  - All other elements are 0.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head is `for j in range(i)`.
- The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0.
- The value of `i` is 4, which is greater than 0.
- The initial value of `j` is 3, but this is not relevant to whether the loop will execute for the first time.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the only condition that needs to be true is that `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is 4, this condition is satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values as described, `i` is 4, `j` is 3**.
