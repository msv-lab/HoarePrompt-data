To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(i):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j` and the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(i)` produces a sequence of values. This means `i` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 1.

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - Given `i` is 3, `range(i)` will produce the sequence `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - Since `i` is 3, the loop will execute.

5. **State of Variables at the Start of the First Execution:**
   - `j` will be 0 during the first execution of the loop.
   - All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `max_products`, `i`) remain as they were initially provided.

### Final State:
The loop will execute because `i` is 3, and `j` will be 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, the fourth element is `arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0**
