The code updates the `max_products` list at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial conditions, let's evaluate the impact:

- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.

We need to evaluate `max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])`:

1. `max_products[i]` initially is 0 (since all other elements in `max_products` except the first two are 0).
2. `max_products[j]` is `arr[0]` because `j` is 0.
3. `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`.

Thus, the expression `max_products[j] * arr[i]` evaluates to `arr[0] * arr[2]`.

Since `max_products[i]` is 0, the new value of `max_products[i]` will be `arr[0] * arr[2]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, and the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, and the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0.**
