Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n`:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
  - All other elements are 0.
- If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the fourth element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[3]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the indices and values involved:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `max_products[3]` is initially 0 (since all other elements are 0).
   - `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.

2. **Calculate the new value for `max_products[3]`:**
   - The code updates `max_products[3]` to the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[1]` and `arr[3]`.
   - Current value of `max_products[3]` is 0.
   - New value to consider is `max_products[1] * arr[3]`.

3. **Determine the value of `max_products[1]`:**
   - `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.

4. **Update `max_products[3]`:**
   - The new value of `max_products[3]` is `max(0, arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3])`.
   - Since `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[3]` are positive integers, `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` is also a positive integer.
   - Therefore, `max(0, arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3])` is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]`.

### Output State:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n`:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
  - The fourth element is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`.
  - All other elements are 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, the fourth element is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 1.**
