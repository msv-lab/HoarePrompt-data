The code snippet `max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])` updates the fourth element of `max_products` (since `i` is 3) based on the maximum value between the current fourth element and the product of the third element of `max_products` (since `j` is 2) and the fourth element of `arr`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `max_products` is a list of length `n`.
     - The first element is `arr[0]`.
     - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
     - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
     - The fourth element is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The fourth element of `max_products` (`max_products[3]`) is updated to the maximum of its current value and the product of the third element of `max_products` (`max_products[2]`) and the fourth element of `arr` (`arr[3]`).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Current value of `max_products[3]` is `arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3]` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, otherwise it is 0.
   - Value of `max_products[2]` is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
   - New value of `max_products[3]` is `max(max_products[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `max_products` is a list of length `n`.
     - The first element is `arr[0]`.
     - The second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`.
     - The third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`.
     - The fourth element is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, otherwise it is `max(0, max_products[2] * arr[3])`.
   - All other elements are 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])` if `arr[1] < arr[3]`, otherwise it is `max(0, max_products[2] * arr[3])`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 2.**
