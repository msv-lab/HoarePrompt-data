To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to follow the provided steps and analyze the given conditions and code.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, and `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values.
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1` (where `i` is 4), and for each `j`, it checks if `arr[j] < arr[i]`. If true, it updates `max_products[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**:
     - `arr` remains constant.
     - `n` remains constant.
     - `i` remains 4 throughout the loop.
   - **Updated Variables**:
     - `max_products[4]` is updated based on the condition `arr[j] < arr[i]`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates 4 times (from `j = 0` to `j = 3`).
   - For each iteration, the condition `arr[j] < arr[4]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `max_products[4]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[4]`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the first iteration (`j = 0`):
     - If `arr[0] < arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to `max(max_products[4], max_products[0] * arr[4])`.
   - After the second iteration (`j = 1`):
     - If `arr[1] < arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to `max(max_products[4], max_products[1] * arr[4])`.
   - After the third iteration (`j = 2`):
     - If `arr[2] < arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to `max(max_products[4], max_products[2] * arr[4])`.
   - After the fourth iteration (`j = 3`):
     - If `arr[3] < arr[4]`, then `max_products[4]` is updated to `max(max_products[4], max_products[3] * arr[4])`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:

- `arr` remains a list of positive integers.
- `n` remains greater than 4.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` with the following properties:
  - The first four elements are initialized as specified in the initial state.
  - The fifth element, `max_products[4]`, is updated to the maximum value among its initial value and the products `max_products[j] * arr[4]` for all `j` where `arr[j] < arr[4]`.
- `i` remains 4.
- `j` is 4 (since the loop has completed).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 4. `max_products[4]` is updated to the maximum of its initial value and `max_products[j] * arr[4]` for all `j` where `arr[j] < arr[4]`.**
