The value of `max_products[i]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, let's evaluate the expression:

- `max_products[1]` is initially `arr[1]`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `arr[j]` (which is `arr[0]`) is less than `arr[i]` (which is `arr[1]`).

So, `max_products[1]` is updated to the maximum of `arr[1]` and `arr[0] * arr[1]`.

Since `arr[0] * arr[1]` is greater than `arr[1]` (because `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are positive integers and `arr[0] < arr[1]`), `max_products[1]` will be set to `arr[0] * arr[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `arr[j]` is less than the current value of `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `arr[j]` is less than the current value of `arr[i]`.**
