Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 0. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, `max_products[4]` is updated to `max(max_products[4], max_products[0] * arr[4])`. Otherwise, `max_products[4]` remains unchanged.***
