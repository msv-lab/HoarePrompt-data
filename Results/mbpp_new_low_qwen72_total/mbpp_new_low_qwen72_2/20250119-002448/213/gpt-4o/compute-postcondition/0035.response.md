The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `j` is 3, and `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, the value of `max_products[4]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[3]` and `arr[4]`.

Since `arr[j]` (which is `arr[3]`) is less than `arr[i]` (which is `arr[4]`), the product `max_products[3] * arr[4]` could potentially be larger than the current value of `max_products[4]`, depending on the values of `max_products[3]` and `arr[4]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `max_products[4]` is now the maximum of its original value and `max_products[3] * arr[4]`, and the current value of `arr[3]` is less than the current value of `arr[4]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `max_products[4]` is the maximum of its original value and `max_products[3] * arr[4]`, and the current value of `arr[3]` is less than the current value of `arr[4]`**
