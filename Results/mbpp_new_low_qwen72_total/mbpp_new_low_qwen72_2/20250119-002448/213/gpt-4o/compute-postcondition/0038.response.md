The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` to the maximum between its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 4.

The specific impact of the code is:

- `max_products[4]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[4]` and `arr[4]`.

Since the exact values of `max_products[4]` and `arr[4]` are not specified, we can only express the update in terms of these variables. The output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 4, `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, `max_products[4]` is the maximum of its original value and `max_products[4] * arr[4]`.**
