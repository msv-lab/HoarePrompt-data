The value of `max_products[i]` is updated to `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `max_products[3]` is set to `arr[3]`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the third element is `arr[0] * arr[2]` if `arr[0] < arr[2]` and `arr[1] * arr[2]` if `arr[1] < arr[2]`, the fourth element is `arr[3]`, and all other elements are 0. `i` is 3, `j` is 1**
