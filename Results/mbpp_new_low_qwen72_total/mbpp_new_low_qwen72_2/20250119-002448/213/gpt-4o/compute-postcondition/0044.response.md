Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `arr` remains a list of positive integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where each element `max_products[i]` (for `i > 0`) is the maximum product of `arr[i]` with any subsequence of previous elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]`. If no such subsequence exists, `max_products[i]` is simply `arr[i]`. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 1. After the loop, `i` is `n` and `j` is `n-1`.**
