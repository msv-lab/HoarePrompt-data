The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `i`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be reset to 0, and `i` should be incremented by 1 to ensure the loop runs for the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 0

The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `max_products`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`. All other elements are 0. `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `arr[j]` is not less than `arr[i]`, the state remains unchanged.**
