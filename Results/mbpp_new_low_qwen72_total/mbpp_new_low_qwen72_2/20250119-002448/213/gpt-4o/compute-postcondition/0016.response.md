Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the second element is `arr[0] * arr[1]`. If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, the third element of `max_products` is `arr[0] * arr[2]`, and `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `arr[j]` is not less than `arr[i]`, the state of `max_products` remains unchanged, with all other elements being 0, and `i` is 2, `j` is 0.***
