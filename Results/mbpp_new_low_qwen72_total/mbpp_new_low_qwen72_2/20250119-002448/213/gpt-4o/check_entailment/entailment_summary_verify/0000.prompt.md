You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of that array.

- Program:
assert func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000
assert func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600
assert func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    max_products = [0] * n
    max_products[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_products[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
    return max(max_products)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. However, there is a logical issue in the implementation. Specifically, the function initializes `max_products` with zeros and updates it with the current element or the product of the current element and the maximum product of a previous smaller element. This approach works for most cases, but it fails when the array contains negative numbers and zeros, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `[1, -2, -3, 4]`. The correct result should be `24` (from the increasing subsequence `[1, -2, -3, 4]`), but the function will return `4` because it does not handle negative numbers correctly.

To fix this, the function needs to account for the possibility of negative numbers and zeros more carefully, possibly by maintaining separate lists for positive and negative products.
