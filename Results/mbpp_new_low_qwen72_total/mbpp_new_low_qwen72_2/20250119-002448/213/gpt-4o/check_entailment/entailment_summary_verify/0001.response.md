Reasoning: 

The original assessment provides a detailed and accurate description of the function `func_1`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function initializes an array `max_products` of the same length as the input array `arr`, with all elements set to 0.
   - If the input array `arr` is empty, the function returns 0, which is a correct edge case handling.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr`, as the maximum product of a single-element sublist is the element itself.
   - This initialization ensures that the base case is correctly handled.

3. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   - The function iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element at index `i`, it checks all previous elements (from index 0 to `i-1`).
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than the previous element `arr[j]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - After filling the `max_products` array, the function returns the maximum value from this array, which represents the maximum product of any increasing sublist.

**Test Cases:**
- `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])` should return `3000` (sublist `[3, 100, 150]`).
  - The maximum product of an increasing sublist is indeed `3 * 100 * 150 = 3000`.
- `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80])` should return `50265600` (sublist `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]`).
  - The maximum product of an increasing sublist is indeed `4 * 42 * 55 * 68 * 80 = 50265600`.
- `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60])` should return `2460` (sublist `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]`).
  - The maximum product of an increasing sublist is indeed `10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 2460`.

The function logic and the test cases provided are consistent with the problem description. The function correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the maximum product of an increasing sublist.

Final: **True**
