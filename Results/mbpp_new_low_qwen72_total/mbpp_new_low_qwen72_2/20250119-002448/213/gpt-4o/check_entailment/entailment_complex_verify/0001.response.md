Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the input array. The function employs dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Here's a detailed breakdown of the function's behavior and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes an array `max_products` of the same length as the input array `arr`. Each element in `max_products` will store the maximum product ending at that index.
   - The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr`, as the product of a single-element sublist is the element itself.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The function iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element at index `i`, it checks all previous elements (from index `0` to `i-1`).
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than the previous element `arr[j]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. This ensures that `max_products[i]` stores the maximum product of any increasing sublist ending at `arr[i]`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` array. This value represents the maximum product of any increasing sublist in the input array.

**Validation of Test Cases**:
- `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])` should return `3000` (sublist `[3, 100, 150]`).
  - `max_products` will be `[3, 300, 4, 5, 150, 6]`.
  - The maximum value is `3000`.
- `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80])` should return `50265600` (sublist `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]`).
  - `max_products` will be `[4, 168, 858, 5796, 50265600]`.
  - The maximum value is `50265600`.
- `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60])` should return `2460` (sublist `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]`).
  - `max_products` will be `[10, 220, 9, 330, 21, 1100, 41, 2460]`.
  - The maximum value is `2460`.

**Conclusion**:
The function correctly handles the provided test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the function efficiently computes the maximum product of an increasing sublist.

Final: **True**
