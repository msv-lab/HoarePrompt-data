Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle negative numbers and zeros properly, leading to incorrect results. However, the problem description explicitly assumes valid inputs, which are defined as lists of positive integers. Therefore, the scenario involving negative numbers and zeros is outside the scope of the problem.

Given the constraints and assumptions provided:
1. The input list `arr` contains only positive integers.
2. The function is designed to find the maximum product of an increasing sublist of the array.

Let's break down the logic of the function:
- It initializes `max_products` with zeros and sets the first element of `max_products` to the first element of `arr`.
- For each element in the array starting from the second, it updates `max_products[i]` to the current element or the maximum product of the current element and the maximum product of a previous smaller element.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list.

This approach ensures that:
- Each element in `max_products` is either the element itself or the maximum product of the element with any previous subsequence of smaller elements.
- The function correctly identifies the maximum product of an increasing sublist.

Given the problem constraints and the annotated code, the function behaves as expected and correctly handles the valid inputs (lists of positive integers).

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because it considers a scenario (negative numbers and zeros) that is not part of the problem's valid input constraints.

Final: **True**
