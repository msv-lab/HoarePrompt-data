Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of that array.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000
assert func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600
assert func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of positive integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, and `n` is greater than 0
    max_products = [0] * n

max_products[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_products[i] = arr[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, `arr` remains a list of positive integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where each element `max_products[i]` (for `i > 0`) is the maximum product of `arr[i]` with any subsequence of previous elements in `arr` that are less than `arr[i]`. If no such subsequence exists, `max_products[i]` is simply `arr[i]`. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 1. After the loop, `i` is `n` and `j` is `n-1`.
    return max(max_products)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`, which contains the maximum products of each element in `arr` with any subsequence of previous elements in `arr` that are less than the current element, or the element itself if no such subsequence exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:-
