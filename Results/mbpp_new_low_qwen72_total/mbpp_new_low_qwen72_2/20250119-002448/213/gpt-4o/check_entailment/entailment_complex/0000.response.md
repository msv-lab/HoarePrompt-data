Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence within the given list `arr`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function first checks if the input list `arr` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. This is a valid base case.
   - It initializes a list `max_products` of the same length as `arr`, filled with zeros. This list will store the maximum product for each element in `arr`.

2. **Setting Initial Product**:
   - The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr`. This is because the first element itself is the only possible product at that point.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element in `arr` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it initializes `max_products[i]` to `arr[i]`.
   - The inner loop iterates through all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. This ensures that `max_products[i]` contains the maximum product of `arr[i]` with any increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

4. **Return the Maximum Product**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in `arr`.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence. The test cases provided also pass, indicating that the function works as expected.
