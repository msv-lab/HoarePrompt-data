Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. However, there is a logical issue in the implementation. Specifically, the function initializes `max_products` with zeros and updates it with the current element or the product of the current element and the maximum product of a previous smaller element. This approach works for most cases, but it fails when the array contains negative numbers and zeros, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `[1, -2, -3, 4]`. The correct result should be `24` (from the increasing subsequence `[1, -2, -3, 4]`), but the function will return `4` because it does not handle negative numbers correctly.

To fix this, the function needs to account for the possibility of negative numbers and zeros more carefully, possibly by maintaining separate lists for positive and negative products.
