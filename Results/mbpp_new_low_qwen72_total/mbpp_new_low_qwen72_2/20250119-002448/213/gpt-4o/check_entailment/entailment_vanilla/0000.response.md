Reasoning:  
The given function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the input array. The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this:

1. It initializes an array `max_products` where each element at index `i` will store the maximum product ending at that index.
2. It sets the first element of `max_products` to be the first element of the input array, as the product of a single-element sublist is the element itself.
3. It iterates through the array starting from the second element. For each element at index `i`, it checks all previous elements (from index `0` to `i-1`). If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than the previous element `arr[j]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.
4. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `max_products` array, which represents the maximum product of any increasing sublist.

The test cases provided are:
- `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])` should return `3000` (sublist `[3, 100, 150]`).
- `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80])` should return `50265600` (sublist `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]`).
- `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60])` should return `2460` (sublist `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]`).

These test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the logic of the function aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
