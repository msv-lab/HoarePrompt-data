### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Function Purpose**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. An increasing sublist is a sequence of elements where each element is greater than the previous one.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `max_products` as a list of zeros with the same length as `arr`.
   - It sets `max_products[0]` to `arr[0]` because the first element is always part of the increasing sublist.
   - For each element `arr[i]` starting from the second element, it checks all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The initialization of `max_products` and the nested loops are correctly described.
   - The final state of the program is accurately described: `max_products` contains the maximum products of each element in `arr` with any subsequence of previous elements in `arr` that are less than the current element, or the element itself if no such subsequence exists.

4. **Original Assessment Challenge**:
   - The original assessment states that the function fails when the array contains negative numbers and zeros. However, the problem description explicitly assumes valid inputs, which typically implies positive integers.
   - The provided test cases only include positive integers, and the function works correctly for these cases.
   - The function does not handle negative numbers and zeros, but this is outside the scope of the given problem description.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the problem description and the assumption of valid inputs (positive integers), the function `func_1` is correct and produces the expected results for the provided test cases.
   - The original assessment is incorrect because it considers a scenario (negative numbers and zeros) that is not part of the problem's constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
