Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_products` as a list of zeros with the same length as `arr`. This is appropriate because we need to store the maximum product for each element in `arr`.

2. **Base Case**: The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr` (`max_products[0] = arr[0]`). This is correct because the maximum product for the first element, when considering only itself, is the element itself.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element in `arr` starting from the second element.
   - The inner loop checks all previous elements to see if they form an increasing subsequence with the current element (`arr[j] < arr[i]`).
   - If an increasing subsequence is found, the function updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Final Return**: The function returns the maximum value from `max_products`, which correctly gives the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in `arr`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `arr` is empty, the function correctly returns 0.
   - For non-empty lists, the function correctly handles the computation of the maximum product of increasing subsequences.

Given the problem description and the state of the program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum product of an increasing sublist.

Correctness: **True**
