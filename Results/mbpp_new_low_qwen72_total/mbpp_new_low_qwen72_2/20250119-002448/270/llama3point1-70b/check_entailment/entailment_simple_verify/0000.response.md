Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`. The problem description requires computing the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuple list, which means that the result should be a list where each element is the sum of all elements up to that point in the list of tuples. However, the provided function `func_1` simply computes the total sum of all elements across all tuples, which is not the same as a cumulative sum.

For example, given the input `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`:
- The total sum of all elements is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`.
- The cumulative sum would be `[3, 10, 21]` because:
  - The sum of the first tuple `(1, 2)` is `3`.
  - The sum of the first two tuples `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` is `3 + 7 = 10`.
  - The sum of all three tuples `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(5, 6)` is `3 + 7 + 11 = 21`.

The annotated code confirms that the function returns the total sum of all integers contained in all tuples, which aligns with the original assessment's explanation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
