You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

- Program: 
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list 'tuples'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` computes the sum of all elements in the tuple list, but it does not compute the cumulative sum as required by the problem description. For example, if the input is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`, the function returns `21` (which is the total sum of all elements), but the cumulative sum should be `[3, 10, 21]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

End of Original Assessment
