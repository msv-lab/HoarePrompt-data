Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cumulative sum of all values in a list of tuples. The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose of the function and the method used to achieve it. The generator expression inside the `sum` function iterates over each tuple in the list, sums the elements of each tuple, and then sums these intermediate results to produce the final cumulative sum.

The annotations confirm that:
1. The input `tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
2. The function returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list `tuples`.

The original assessment correctly states that the function will work as expected given valid inputs. Since the problem description assumes valid inputs (i.e., a list of tuples containing numeric values), the function does not need additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality and will produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Final: **True**
