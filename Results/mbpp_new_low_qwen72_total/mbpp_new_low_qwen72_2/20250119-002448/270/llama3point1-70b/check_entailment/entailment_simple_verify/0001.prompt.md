You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

- Program: 
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list 'tuples'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and returns the cumulative sum of all the values in these tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum its elements. This approach is efficient and correctly calculates the total sum of all elements across all tuples.

However, it's important to ensure that the input is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats). The problem statement assumes valid inputs, so we can assume that the input will always be a list of tuples with numeric values.

Given this, the function appears to be correct and will work as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

End of Original Assessment
