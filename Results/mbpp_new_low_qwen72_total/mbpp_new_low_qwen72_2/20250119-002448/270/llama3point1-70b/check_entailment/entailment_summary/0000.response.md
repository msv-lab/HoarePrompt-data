Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cumulative sum of all integers present in a list of tuples. Based on the provided execution summary:

1. The function correctly uses a generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` to iterate over each tuple in the list and compute the sum of the integers within each tuple.
2. The outer `sum()` function then sums these intermediate results to produce the final cumulative sum.
3. The function handles edge cases correctly:
   - If the input list `tuples` is empty, the generator expression will yield no values, and `sum()` will return 0.
   - If any of the tuples within the list are empty, the inner `sum(t)` will return 0 for those tuples, contributing 0 to the final sum.

Given that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
