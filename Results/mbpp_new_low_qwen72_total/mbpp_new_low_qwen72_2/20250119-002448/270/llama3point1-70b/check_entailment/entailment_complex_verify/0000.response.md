Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the function's behavior and the problem description. The problem description asks for the "cumulative sum" of all values in the tuple list, which implies maintaining a running total of the sums of the elements in each tuple as you progress through the list. However, the provided function `func_1` simply calculates the total sum of all elements across all tuples, which is not the same as the cumulative sum.

For example, given the input `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`, the cumulative sum would be calculated as follows:
- The sum of the first tuple `(1, 2)` is `3`.
- The sum of the first two tuples `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` is `3 + 7 = 10`.
- The sum of all three tuples `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(5, 6)` is `3 + 7 + 11 = 21`.

Thus, the cumulative sum should be `[3, 10, 21]`, but the function returns `21`, which is the total sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
