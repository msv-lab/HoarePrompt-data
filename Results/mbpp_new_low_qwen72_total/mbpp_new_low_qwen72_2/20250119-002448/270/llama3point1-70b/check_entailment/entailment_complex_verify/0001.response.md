Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers in a list of tuples. The provided implementation uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to achieve this. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input `tuples` is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains integers. The problem description and the original assessment both state that we can assume valid inputs. Therefore, we do not need to handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values or nested structures.

2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples` and computes the sum of the elements in each tuple. This is a correct and efficient way to sum the elements of each tuple.

3. **Summing the Results**: The outer `sum` function then sums the results of the generator expression, effectively computing the cumulative sum of all integers across all tuples.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If `tuples` is an empty list, the generator expression will not produce any values, and the `sum` function will return 0, which is the correct behavior.
   - **Empty Tuples**: If any tuple within `tuples` is empty, `sum(t)` for that tuple will be 0, and it will contribute 0 to the overall sum, which is also correct.

5. **Annotated Code**: The annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended. They clarify that the function returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list `tuples`, and they handle edge cases appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and works as expected under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
