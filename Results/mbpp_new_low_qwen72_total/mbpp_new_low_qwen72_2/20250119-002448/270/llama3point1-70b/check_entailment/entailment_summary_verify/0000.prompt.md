You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

- Program:
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing integers. It returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list `tuples`. If the input list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0. If any of the tuples within the list are empty, those tuples contribute 0 to the sum. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are integers and does not handle other data types or nested structures.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` computes the sum of all elements in the tuple list, but it does not compute the cumulative sum as required by the problem description. For example, if the input is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`, the function returns `21` (which is the total sum of all elements), but the cumulative sum should be `[3, 10, 21]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
