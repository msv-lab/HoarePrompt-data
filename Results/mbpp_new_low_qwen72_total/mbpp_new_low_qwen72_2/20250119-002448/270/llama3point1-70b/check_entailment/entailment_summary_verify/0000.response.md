Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires finding the **cumulative sum** of all the values that are present in the given tuple list. However, the provided function `func_1` only computes the **total sum** of all elements in the tuple list, not the cumulative sum.

To clarify, the cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers is a new sequence where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the sequence up to and including the element at index `i`.

For example, given the input `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`:
- The total sum of all elements is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`.
- The cumulative sum would be `[3, 10, 21]`, where:
  - The first element `3` is the sum of the first tuple `(1, 2)`.
  - The second element `10` is the sum of the first two tuples `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`.
  - The third element `21` is the sum of all three tuples `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(5, 6)`.

The function `func_1` returns `21`, which is the total sum, not the cumulative sum. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
