Reasoning: 
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers contained within the tuples in the provided list. The use of a generator expression within the `sum` function is both efficient and concise, ensuring that the function can handle lists of tuples of varying lengths and contents, including empty tuples and an empty list.

The function summary provides a clear and accurate description of the function's behavior, including how it handles empty lists and tuples. The summary also confirms that the function assumes valid inputs, which aligns with the problem statement's assumption.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation that would cause it to fail under the conditions specified (valid inputs).

Final: **True**
