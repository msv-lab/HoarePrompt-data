Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and returns the cumulative sum of all the values in these tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum its elements. This approach is efficient and correctly calculates the total sum of all elements across all tuples.

However, it's important to ensure that the input is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats). The problem statement assumes valid inputs, so we can assume that the input will always be a list of tuples with numeric values.

Given this, the function appears to be correct and will work as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
