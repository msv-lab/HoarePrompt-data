Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers present in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function, which iterates over each tuple in the list and computes the sum of its elements. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the specified cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list `tuples` is empty, the generator expression will not yield any values, and `sum` will return 0.
2. **Empty Tuples**: If any of the tuples in the list are empty, the inner `sum(t)` will return 0 for those tuples, contributing 0 to the overall sum.
3. **Valid Integers**: The function assumes that all elements in the tuples are integers, which aligns with the problem description.

Given these points, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem description and should work correctly for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
