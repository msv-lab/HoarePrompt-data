Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers contained in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple. This approach is correct and will yield the total sum of all integers across all tuples in the list. The comment within the function correctly describes the behavior of the function.

Correctness: **True**
