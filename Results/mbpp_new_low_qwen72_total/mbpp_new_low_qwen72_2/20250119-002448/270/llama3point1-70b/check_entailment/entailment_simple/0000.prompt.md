Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list 'tuples'.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
