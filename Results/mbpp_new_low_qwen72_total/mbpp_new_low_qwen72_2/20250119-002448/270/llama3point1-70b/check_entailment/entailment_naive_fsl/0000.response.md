Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` computes the sum of all elements in the tuple list, but it does not compute the cumulative sum as required by the problem description. For example, if the input is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`, the function returns `21` (which is the total sum of all elements), but the cumulative sum should be `[3, 10, 21]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
