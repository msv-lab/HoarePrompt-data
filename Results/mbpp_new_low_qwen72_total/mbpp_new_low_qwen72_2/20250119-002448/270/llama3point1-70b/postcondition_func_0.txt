The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing integers. It returns the sum of all integers contained in all tuples within the list `tuples`. If the input list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0. If any of the tuples within the list are empty, those tuples contribute 0 to the sum. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are integers and does not handle other data types or nested structures.
