You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Annotated Code: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple (r, θ), where r is the magnitude of the complex number `num` and θ is the phase angle of the complex number `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number `num` and `θ` is the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method to compute these values. If `num` is zero, the magnitude `r` will be 0 and the phase angle `θ` will be 0. If `num` is a non-zero complex number, the function will correctly compute and return the magnitude and phase angle.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single argument `num` and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method, which correctly converts a complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple `(r, phi)` where `r` is the magnitude and `phi` is the phase angle.

However, the assertions in the program are testing the function with real numbers only (1, 4, and 5). For these specific cases, the phase angle should indeed be 0.0, and the magnitude should be equal to the input number itself. Therefore, the assertions will pass for these inputs.

Despite the limited test cases, the function `func_1` is correct for the general case of converting any complex number to polar coordinates.

Correctness: **True**
