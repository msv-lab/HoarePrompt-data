### Reasoning:

1. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `num`.
   - It converts `num` to a complex number using `complex(num)`.
   - It then uses `cmath.polar` to convert the complex number to its polar form, which returns a tuple `(r, θ)` where `r` is the magnitude and `θ` is the phase angle.

2. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations confirm that `num` is treated as a complex number, even if it is a real number (which is a subset of complex numbers).
   - The function correctly returns the polar coordinates of the complex number.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function is incorrect because the tests only cover real numbers, which always have a phase angle of 0.0.
   - The assessment suggests that the function should be tested with complex numbers that have non-zero imaginary parts to ensure its correctness.

4. **Evaluating the Tests**:
   - The current tests only check the function with real numbers (1, 4, 5).
   - These tests are insufficient to fully validate the function, as they do not cover the general case of complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

5. **Additional Tests**:
   - To properly evaluate the function, we should include tests with complex numbers like `1 + 1j` and `-1 - 1j`.
   - For example:
     - `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.
     - `func_1(-1 - 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function itself is implemented correctly and will work for any complex number.
   - However, the provided tests are inadequate to fully verify the function's correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final**: **False**

The function `func_1` is implemented correctly, but the provided tests are insufficient to fully validate its behavior with complex numbers. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect due to the lack of comprehensive testing.
