Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` method. The provided test cases check the function with real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which are valid complex numbers with an imaginary part of 0. The `cmath.polar` method correctly computes the magnitude (which is the absolute value of the real number) and the phase angle (which is 0 for positive real numbers). The function's behavior matches the expected output for these test cases.

However, the function should also handle other types of complex numbers, including those with non-zero imaginary parts. The execution summary confirms that the function correctly computes the magnitude and phase angle for any complex number, including zero.

Given that the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the general behavior described in the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
