Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

# Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number `num` and `θ` is the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method to compute these values. If `num` is zero, the magnitude `r` will be 0 and the phase angle `θ` will be 0. If `num` is a non-zero complex number, the function will correctly compute and return the magnitude and phase angle.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
