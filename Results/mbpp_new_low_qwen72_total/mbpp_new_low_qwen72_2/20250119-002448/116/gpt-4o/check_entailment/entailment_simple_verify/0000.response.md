### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` uses the `cmath.polar` method to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates. This method returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the magnitude and `θ` is the phase angle.

2. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single argument `num`. If `num` is a real number, it is converted to a complex number with an imaginary part of 0. This is handled correctly by the `complex` constructor.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program only test the function with real numbers, which always have a phase (angle) of 0.0. This does not fully test the function's ability to handle complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function should be tested with complex numbers that have both real and imaginary components. For example:
   - `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.
   - `func_1(-1 - 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)`.

5. **Conclusion**: While the function itself is technically correct in terms of its implementation, the lack of comprehensive testing with complex numbers means that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
