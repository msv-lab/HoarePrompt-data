Reasoning:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single argument `num` and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method, which correctly converts a complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple `(r, phi)` where `r` is the magnitude and `phi` is the phase angle.

The annotations indicate that the function expects `num` to be a complex number, but it can also handle real numbers since a real number can be considered a complex number with an imaginary part of 0. The `complex(num)` conversion ensures that even if `num` is a real number, it is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part of 0.

The assertions in the program are testing the function with real numbers only (1, 4, and 5). For these specific cases, the phase angle should indeed be 0.0, and the magnitude should be equal to the input number itself. Therefore, the assertions will pass for these inputs.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is correct for the general case of converting any complex number to polar coordinates. The limited test cases do not affect the correctness of the function; they merely test a subset of possible inputs.

Final: **True**
