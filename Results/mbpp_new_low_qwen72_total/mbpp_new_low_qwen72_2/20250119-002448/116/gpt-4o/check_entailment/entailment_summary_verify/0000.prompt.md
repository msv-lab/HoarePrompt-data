You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number `num` and `θ` is the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method to compute these values. If `num` is zero, the magnitude `r` will be 0 and the phase angle `θ` will be 0. If `num` is a non-zero complex number, the function will correctly compute and return the magnitude and phase angle.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` converts a real number to a complex number and then to its polar form. However, the assertions provided in the program only test the function with real numbers, which always have a phase (angle) of 0.0. This does not fully test the function's ability to handle complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

A more comprehensive test would include complex numbers with both real and imaginary components, such as `1 + 1j`, to ensure the function works correctly for all types of complex numbers.

For example:
- `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.
- `func_1(-1 - 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)`.

Since the current implementation and tests do not cover these cases, the program is considered incorrect.
