### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant limitation in the provided program: the assertions only test the function with real numbers, which always have a phase angle of 0.0. This does not fully test the function's ability to handle complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a number `num` and converts it to a complex number using `complex(num)`.
   - It then uses `cmath.polar` to convert this complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple `(r, θ)` where `r` is the magnitude and `θ` is the phase angle.

2. **Current Assertions**:
   - The assertions `assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)`, `assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)`, and `assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)` only test the function with real numbers.
   - For real numbers, the phase angle is always 0.0, which does not test the function's ability to handle complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

3. **Missing Test Cases**:
   - To fully test the function, additional test cases should include complex numbers with both real and imaginary components.
   - For example:
     - `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.
     - `func_1(-1 - 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)`.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function returns a tuple `(r, θ)` where `r` is the magnitude and `θ` is the phase angle.
   - The summary also mentions that the function handles zero and non-zero complex numbers correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incomplete because it lacks test cases that cover complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts. Therefore, the program cannot be considered fully correct without these additional test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
