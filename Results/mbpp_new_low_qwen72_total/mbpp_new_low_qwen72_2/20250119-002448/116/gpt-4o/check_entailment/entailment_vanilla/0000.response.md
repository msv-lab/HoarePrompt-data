Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single argument `num` and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method, which correctly converts a complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple `(r, phi)` where `r` is the magnitude and `phi` is the phase angle.

However, the assertions in the program are testing the function with real numbers only (1, 4, and 5). For these specific cases, the phase angle should indeed be 0.0, and the magnitude should be equal to the input number itself. Therefore, the assertions will pass for these inputs.

Despite the limited test cases, the function `func_1` is correct for the general case of converting any complex number to polar coordinates.

Correctness: **True**
