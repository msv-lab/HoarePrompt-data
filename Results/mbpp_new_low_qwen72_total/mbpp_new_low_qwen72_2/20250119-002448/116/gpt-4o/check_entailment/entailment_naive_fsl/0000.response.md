Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` converts a real number to a complex number and then to its polar form. However, the assertions provided in the program only test the function with real numbers, which always have a phase (angle) of 0.0. This does not fully test the function's ability to handle complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

A more comprehensive test would include complex numbers with both real and imaginary components, such as `1 + 1j`, to ensure the function works correctly for all types of complex numbers.

For example:
- `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.
- `func_1(-1 - 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)`.

Since the current implementation and tests do not cover these cases, the program is considered incorrect.
