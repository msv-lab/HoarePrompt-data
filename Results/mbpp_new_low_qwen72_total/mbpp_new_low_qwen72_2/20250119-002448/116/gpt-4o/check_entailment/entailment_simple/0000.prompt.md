Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

# Annotated Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple (r, θ), where r is the magnitude of the complex number `num` and θ is the phase angle of the complex number `num`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
