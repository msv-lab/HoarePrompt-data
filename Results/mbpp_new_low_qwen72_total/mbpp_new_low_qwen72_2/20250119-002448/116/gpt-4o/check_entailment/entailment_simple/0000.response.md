Reasoning:  
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single argument `num`. It converts this number into a complex number using the `complex()` function, and then uses `cmath.polar()` to convert it into polar coordinates, which are returned as a tuple `(r, Î¸)`.

However, the test cases provided in the assertions are only testing the function with real numbers (1, 4, 5). While these tests will pass because the magnitude of a real number is the number itself and the phase angle is 0, the function is designed to handle complex numbers. To fully validate the correctness of the function, we should include at least one test case with a complex number, such as `func_1(1 + 1j)`, to ensure it handles both the real and imaginary parts correctly.

Given that the function is designed to work with complex numbers and the provided test cases only cover real numbers, the current test cases do not fully validate the function's correctness. However, based on the provided information and the function's implementation, the function itself appears to be correct for handling complex numbers.

Correctness: **True** (but with a note that additional test cases are recommended to fully validate the function's correctness with complex numbers).
