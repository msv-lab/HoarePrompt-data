Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The `cmath.polar` function takes a complex number and returns a tuple containing the magnitude (r) and the phase angle (Î¸).

However, the test cases provided in the annotated program only test the function with real numbers (1, 4, and 5). These are not complex numbers, and they do not cover the full range of possible inputs that the function should handle, such as complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

Despite this, the function itself is correct because it correctly uses `cmath.polar` to convert any complex number (including real numbers, which are a subset of complex numbers) to its polar coordinates.

The test cases should ideally include complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts to fully validate the function's correctness. For example, `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.

Given that the function works as intended for the inputs provided and the general logic is correct, we can consider the function to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
