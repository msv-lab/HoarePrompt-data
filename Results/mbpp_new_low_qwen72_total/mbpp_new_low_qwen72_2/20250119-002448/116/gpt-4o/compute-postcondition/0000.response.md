Initial State: `num` is a complex number.

The function `cmath.polar(complex(num))` converts the complex number `num` into its polar coordinates, which consists of a magnitude (r) and a phase angle (θ).

Since `num` is a complex number, let's assume `num = a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `j` is the imaginary unit.

The output of `cmath.polar(complex(num))` will be a tuple `(r, θ)` where:
- `r` is the magnitude of the complex number, calculated as `sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`.
- `θ` is the phase angle of the complex number, calculated as `atan2(b, a)`.

Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number `num`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple (r, θ), where r is the magnitude of the complex number `num` and θ is the phase angle of the complex number `num`.**
