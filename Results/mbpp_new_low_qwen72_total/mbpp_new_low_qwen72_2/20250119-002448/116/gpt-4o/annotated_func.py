#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple (r, θ), where r is the magnitude of the complex number `num` and θ is the phase angle of the complex number `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number `num` and `θ` is the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number `num`. The function uses the `cmath.polar` method to compute these values. If `num` is zero, the magnitude `r` will be 0 and the phase angle `θ` will be 0. If `num` is a non-zero complex number, the function will correctly compute and return the magnitude and phase angle.
