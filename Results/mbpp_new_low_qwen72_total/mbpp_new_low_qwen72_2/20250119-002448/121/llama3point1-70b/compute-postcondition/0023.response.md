The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `count` is 1.
- `num` is 9.
- If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`.
- If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8.
- Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `9 % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.

After executing `count += 1`:

- `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 2.
- `n` remains a positive integer and is not equal to 1.
- `num` remains 9.
- The condition `if func_1(9) evaluates to True and 9 % 6 is 1 or 5` is assumed to be true, so `count` was already 2 before this increment, but now it is confirmed to be 2.
- Since `count` is now 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`, the program does not return 8.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 9, `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is not equal to `n`, the program does not return 8.**
