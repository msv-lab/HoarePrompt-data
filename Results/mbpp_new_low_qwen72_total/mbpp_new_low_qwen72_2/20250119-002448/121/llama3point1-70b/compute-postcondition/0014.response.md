The code snippet provided is:

```python
num += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `count` is 1.
   - `num` is 7.
   - If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1.
   - The initial value of `num` is 7, so after incrementing, `num` becomes 8.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `num` is now 8.
   - All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
