Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9. If `num % 6` is 1 or 5 and `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True`, `count` is updated to 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5 or `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False`, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.***
