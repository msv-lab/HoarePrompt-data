For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **n is a positive integer and n is not equal to 1, count is 1, num is 7**
