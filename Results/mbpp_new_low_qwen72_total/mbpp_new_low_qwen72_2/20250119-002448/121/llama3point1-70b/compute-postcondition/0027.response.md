Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is initially 1, and `num` is 9. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.***
