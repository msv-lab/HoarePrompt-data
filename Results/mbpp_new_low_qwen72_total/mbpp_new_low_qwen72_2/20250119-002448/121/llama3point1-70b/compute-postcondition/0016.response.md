The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `count` is 1, so after incrementing, `count` becomes 2. The conditions about `func_1(num)` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 are not relevant to the current code snippet, as the code only increments `count`. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged. The condition that `count` is not equal to `n` remains valid since `count` is now 2 and `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1 (and thus not equal to 2).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, `count` is not equal to `n`.**
