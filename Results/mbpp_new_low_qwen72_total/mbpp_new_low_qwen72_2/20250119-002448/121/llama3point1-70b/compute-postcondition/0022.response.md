Since the loop is a `while True:` loop, it does not depend on any specific condition involving the variables. This means that the loop will always execute one more time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `9 % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
