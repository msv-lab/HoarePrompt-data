The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` starts as 8, so after the increment, `num` becomes 9.

The conditions in the initial state about `func_1(num)`, `num % 6`, and `count` are not affected by this operation, and since no new conditions are evaluated or modified, these conditions remain as they were stated initially. The value of `count` remains 1, and `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1. The condition that `count` is not equal to `n` also remains true.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `9 % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
