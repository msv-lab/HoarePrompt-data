Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 9, `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is not equal to `n`. If `count` is equal to `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
