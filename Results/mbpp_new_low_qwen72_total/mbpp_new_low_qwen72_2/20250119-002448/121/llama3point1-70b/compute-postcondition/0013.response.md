Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.***
