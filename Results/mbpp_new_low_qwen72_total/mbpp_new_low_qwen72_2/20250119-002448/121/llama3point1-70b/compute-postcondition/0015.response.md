Given the `while True:` loop, there is no condition in the loop head that needs to be checked or adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. The loop is designed to run indefinitely until a break statement is encountered inside the loop body. Since the loop head does not depend on any specific conditions involving `n`, `count`, `num`, or the result of `func_1(num)`, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
