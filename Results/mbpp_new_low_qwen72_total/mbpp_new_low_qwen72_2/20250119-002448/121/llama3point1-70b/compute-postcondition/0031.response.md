Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. 

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- For `n` greater than 1, the function searches for the `n`-th NSW prime number by incrementing a variable `num` starting from 7. It checks if `num` satisfies two conditions:
  1. `func_1(num)` returns `True`.
  2. `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
- If both conditions are met, a counter `count` is incremented. When `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the current value of `num`.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to search for the `n`-th NSW prime number, ensuring that the returned value meets the specified conditions. However, if `func_1` never returns `True` for any `num` that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, the function will run indefinitely.**

Final State:
- The function returns a positive integer `num` that is the `n`-th NSW prime number.
- The variable `count` will be equal to `n` upon successful termination.
- The variable `num` will be the smallest integer such that `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.
