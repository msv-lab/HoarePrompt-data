The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` starts at 9 and is incremented by 1, making `num` equal to 10. The values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged, and no return takes place.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
