The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function has multiple return points:

- Case_1: The function returns 7.
- Case_2: The function returns 7, which is the value of `num`. `num` is 7, a positive integer, and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5.
- Case_3: The function returns 8.
- Case_4: The function returns 9, which is the value of `num`. `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is not equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return different values based on specific conditions related to the value of `n` and other internal checks.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 7, 8, or 9 based on specific conditions.**
