To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the code. Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `count` is 1.
- `num` is 7.

### Code Analysis
The loop continues indefinitely until a specific condition is met:
```python
while True:
    if func_1(num):
        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
    num += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `num` is 7.
   - `func_1(7)` is evaluated.
   - If `func_1(7)` is `True` and `7 % 6` (which is 1) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
     - `count` is incremented to 2.
     - If `count` (now 2) equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 7).
   - If `func_1(7)` is `False` or `7 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 8.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `num` is 8.
   - `func_1(8)` is evaluated.
   - If `func_1(8)` is `True` and `8 % 6` (which is 2) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 8).
   - If `func_1(8)` is `False` or `8 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 9.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `num` is 9.
   - `func_1(9)` is evaluated.
   - If `func_1(9)` is `True` and `9 % 6` (which is 3) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 9).
   - If `func_1(9)` is `False` or `9 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 10.

### General Behavior
- The loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration.
- `count` is incremented only if `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
- The loop will continue until `count` equals `n`, at which point it returns the current value of `num`.

### Invariant Variables
- `n` remains a positive integer and is not equal to 1 throughout the loop.

### Final Output State
- The loop will terminate when `count` equals `n`.
- The final value of `num` will be the value that satisfies the conditions `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.

### Conclusion
Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state is:
**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is `n`, `num` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.**
