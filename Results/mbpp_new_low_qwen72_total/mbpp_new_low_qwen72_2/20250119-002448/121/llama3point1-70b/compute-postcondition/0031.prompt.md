You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1

num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the code. Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
    #- `count` is 1.
    #- `num` is 7.
    #
    #### Code Analysis
    #The loop continues indefinitely until a specific condition is met:
    #```python
    #while True:
    #    if func_1(num):
    #        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
    #            count += 1
    #            if count == n:
    #                return num
    #    num += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Execution
    #1. **First Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 7.
    #   - `func_1(7)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(7)` is `True` and `7 % 6` (which is 1) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2.
    #     - If `count` (now 2) equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 7).
    #   - If `func_1(7)` is `False` or `7 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 8.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 8.
    #   - `func_1(8)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(8)` is `True` and `8 % 6` (which is 2) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
    #     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 8).
    #   - If `func_1(8)` is `False` or `8 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 9.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 9.
    #   - `func_1(9)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(9)` is `True` and `9 % 6` (which is 3) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
    #     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 9).
    #   - If `func_1(9)` is `False` or `9 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 10.
    #
    #### General Behavior
    #- The loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration.
    #- `count` is incremented only if `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
    #- The loop will continue until `count` equals `n`, at which point it returns the current value of `num`.
    #
    #### Invariant Variables
    #- `n` remains a positive integer and is not equal to 1 throughout the loop.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #- The loop will terminate when `count` equals `n`.
    #- The final value of `num` will be the value that satisfies the conditions `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state is:
    #**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is `n`, `num` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.**
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 7, 8, or 9 based on specific conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 7

Case_2: The program returns 7, which is the value of `num`. `num` is 7, a positive integer, and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5.

Case_3: The program returns 8

Case_4: The program returns 9, which is the value of `num`. `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is not equal to `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
