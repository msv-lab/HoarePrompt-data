Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.***
