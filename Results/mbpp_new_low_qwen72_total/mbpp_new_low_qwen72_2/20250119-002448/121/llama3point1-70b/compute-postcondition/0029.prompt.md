Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer and n is not equal to 1, count is 1, num is 7
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if func_1(num):
        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
    num += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` starts as 8, so after the increment, `num` becomes 9.

The conditions in the initial state about `func_1(num)`, `num % 6`, and `count` are not affected by this operation, and since no new conditions are evaluated or modified, these conditions remain as they were stated initially. The value of `count` remains 1, and `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1. The condition that `count` is not equal to `n` also remains true.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `9 % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `9 % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.**
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, the program does not return 8 and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `func_1(9)` evaluates to `False` or `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the values of `count`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)` remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
