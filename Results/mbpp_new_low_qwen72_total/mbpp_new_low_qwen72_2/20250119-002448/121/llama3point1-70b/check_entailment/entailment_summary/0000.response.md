### Reasoning:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given number `n` is prime.
   - It handles edge cases such as `n < 2` and correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
   - The function is robust and works as expected for the purpose of identifying prime numbers.

2. **Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime Finder (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 7, which is the first NSW prime.
   - For `n > 1`, it starts from 7 and increments a number `num` to find subsequent NSW primes.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to check if `num` is prime.
   - It also ensures that the prime number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a property of NSW primes.
   - The function increments a counter `count` each time a valid NSW prime is found and returns the number when `count` reaches `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_2` does not have a termination condition if no more NSW primes are found, but this is not a practical issue because there are infinitely many NSW primes.
- The function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to correctly find the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The prime check function is accurate, and the NSW prime finder function correctly implements the logic to find the desired prime number.

### Correctness:
**True**
