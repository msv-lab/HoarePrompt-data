 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. 

- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- For `n` greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.

Edge Cases:
- For `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `False` because these numbers are not prime.
- For `n = 2`, the function correctly returns `True` because 2 is the smallest prime number.
- For negative integers, the function also returns `False` because negative numbers are not considered prime.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. 

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- For `n` greater than 1, the function searches for the `n`-th NSW prime number by incrementing a variable `num` starting from 7. It checks if `num` satisfies two conditions:
  1. `func_1(num)` returns `True`.
  2. `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
- If both conditions are met, a counter `count` is incremented. When `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the current value of `num`.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to search for the `n`-th NSW prime number, ensuring that the returned value meets the specified conditions. However, if `func_1` never returns `True` for any `num` that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, the function will run indefinitely.
