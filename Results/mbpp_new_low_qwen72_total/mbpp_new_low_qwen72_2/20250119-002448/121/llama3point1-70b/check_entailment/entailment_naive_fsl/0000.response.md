Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. However, the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly generate NSW primes. The NSW primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers that are related to the solutions of the Pell equation \(x^2 - 2y^2 = -1\). The sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 1, \]
\[ S_1 = 1, \]
\[ S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}. \]

A number \(S_n\) in this sequence is a NSW prime if it is also a prime number. The program provided, however, simply increments a number starting from 7 and checks if it is prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which does not follow the definition of NSW primes.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, etc. The provided program will incorrectly identify many other numbers as NSW primes that do not satisfy the recurrence relation and the definition of NSW primes.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for generating the nth NSW prime number.
