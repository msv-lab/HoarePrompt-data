You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. 

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- For `n` greater than 1, the function searches for the `n`-th NSW prime number by incrementing a variable `num` starting from 7. It checks if `num` satisfies two conditions:
  1. `func_1(num)` returns `True`.
  2. `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
- If both conditions are met, a counter `count` is incremented. When `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the current value of `num`.

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to search for the `n`-th NSW prime number, ensuring that the returned value meets the specified conditions. However, if `func_1` never returns `True` for any `num` that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, the function will run indefinitely.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Definition of NSW Primes**: The NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation, not by checking all numbers for primality and then filtering by a modulus condition. The correct definition of NSW primes is:
   - \( S_0 = 1 \)
   - \( S_1 = 1 \)
   - \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \)
   - A NSW prime is a prime number of the form \( S_n \).

2. **Prime Check**: The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime.

3. **NSW Prime Generation**: The `func_2` function incorrectly tries to find NSW primes by incrementing a number and checking if it is prime and meets a certain modulus condition. This approach does not generate NSW primes as defined.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth NSW prime number. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
