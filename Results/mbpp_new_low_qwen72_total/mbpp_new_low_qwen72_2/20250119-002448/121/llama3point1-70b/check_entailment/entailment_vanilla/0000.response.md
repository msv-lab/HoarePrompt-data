Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Definition of NSW Primes**: The NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation, not by checking all numbers for primality and then filtering by a modulus condition. The correct definition of NSW primes is:
   - \( S_0 = 1 \)
   - \( S_1 = 1 \)
   - \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \)
   - A NSW prime is a prime number of the form \( S_n \).

2. **Prime Check**: The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime.

3. **NSW Prime Generation**: The `func_2` function incorrectly tries to find NSW primes by incrementing a number and checking if it is prime and meets a certain modulus condition. This approach does not generate NSW primes as defined.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth NSW prime number. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
