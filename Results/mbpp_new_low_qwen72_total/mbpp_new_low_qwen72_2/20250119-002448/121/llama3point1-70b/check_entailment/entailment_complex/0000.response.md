Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It correctly handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2.
   - It uses a loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient way to determine primality.
   - The function returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - It correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1 by returning 7, which is the first NSW prime.
   - For `n` greater than 1, it initializes `count` to 1 and starts with `num` set to 7.
   - The function enters a loop that increments `num` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is prime using `func_1(num)`.
   - If `num` is prime and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, it increments the `count`.
   - When `count` reaches `n`, it returns the current value of `num`.
   - This logic ensures that the function finds the `n`-th NSW prime number correctly.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the `n`-th NSW prime number. The functions work together to achieve the desired result, and there are no apparent logical errors or issues in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
