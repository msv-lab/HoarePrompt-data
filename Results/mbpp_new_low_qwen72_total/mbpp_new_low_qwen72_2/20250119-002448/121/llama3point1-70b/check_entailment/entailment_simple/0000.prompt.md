Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Annotated Program:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1

num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the code. Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
    #- `count` is 1.
    #- `num` is 7.
    #
    #### Code Analysis
    #The loop continues indefinitely until a specific condition is met:
    #```python
    #while True:
    #    if func_1(num):
    #        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
    #            count += 1
    #            if count == n:
    #                return num
    #    num += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Execution
    #1. **First Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 7.
    #   - `func_1(7)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(7)` is `True` and `7 % 6` (which is 1) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2.
    #     - If `count` (now 2) equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 7).
    #   - If `func_1(7)` is `False` or `7 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 8.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 8.
    #   - `func_1(8)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(8)` is `True` and `8 % 6` (which is 2) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
    #     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 8).
    #   - If `func_1(8)` is `False` or `8 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 9.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - `num` is 9.
    #   - `func_1(9)` is evaluated.
    #   - If `func_1(9)` is `True` and `9 % 6` (which is 3) is in `[1, 5]`, then:
    #     - `count` is incremented to 2 (if `count` was 1) or 3 (if `count` was 2).
    #     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 9).
    #   - If `func_1(9)` is `False` or `9 % 6` is not in `[1, 5]`, `num` is incremented to 10.
    #
    #### General Behavior
    #- The loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration.
    #- `count` is incremented only if `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
    #- The loop will continue until `count` equals `n`, at which point it returns the current value of `num`.
    #
    #### Invariant Variables
    #- `n` remains a positive integer and is not equal to 1 throughout the loop.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #- The loop will terminate when `count` equals `n`.
    #- The final value of `num` will be the value that satisfies the conditions `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state is:
    #**`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is `n`, `num` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` equals `n`.**
