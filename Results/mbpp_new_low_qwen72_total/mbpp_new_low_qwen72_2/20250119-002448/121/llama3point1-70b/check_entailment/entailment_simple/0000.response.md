Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. The NSW primes are a sequence of prime numbers that satisfy certain properties. The program consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(n)**: This function checks if a number `n` is prime. It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for factors. If no factors are found, it returns `True`.

2. **func_2(n)**: This function finds the nth NSW prime number. It starts with `num = 7` (the first NSW prime) and `count = 1` (since the first NSW prime is already known). It then enters an infinite loop where it increments `num` by 1 in each iteration. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is prime using `func_1(num)`. If `num` is prime and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, it increments `count`. When `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`.

The logic in `func_2` is correct because:
- It correctly identifies the first NSW prime (7) and handles the case when `n == 1`.
- It correctly increments `num` and checks if it is a prime and satisfies the NSW prime condition (`num % 6` is either 1 or 5).
- It correctly increments `count` and returns `num` when `count` equals `n`.

Therefore, the program is logically sound and will correctly find the nth NSW prime number for any positive integer `n`.

Correctness: **True**
