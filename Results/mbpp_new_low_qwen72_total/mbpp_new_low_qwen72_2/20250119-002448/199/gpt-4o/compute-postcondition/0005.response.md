The code snippet `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` appends a new value to the list `perrin`. This value is calculated as the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3` of the list `perrin`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 3
- `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`

Let's calculate the new value to append:
- `perrin[i - 2]` is `perrin[3 - 2]` which is `perrin[1]` and equals 0.
- `perrin[i - 3]` is `perrin[3 - 3]` which is `perrin[0]` and equals 3.

Therefore, the new value to append is `0 + 3` which is 3. After appending, the list `perrin` becomes `[3, 0, 2, 3]`.

The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`**
