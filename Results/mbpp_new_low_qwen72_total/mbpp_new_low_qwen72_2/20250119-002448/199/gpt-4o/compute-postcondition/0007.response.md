The code appends the sum of the elements at indices `i - 2` and `i - 3` of the list `perrin` to the end of the list. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 4
- `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`

Calculating the new element to append:
- `perrin[i - 2]` is `perrin[2]`, which is 2
- `perrin[i - 3]` is `perrin[1]`, which is 0

So, the new element to append is `2 + 0 = 2`.

Therefore, the updated list `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`**
