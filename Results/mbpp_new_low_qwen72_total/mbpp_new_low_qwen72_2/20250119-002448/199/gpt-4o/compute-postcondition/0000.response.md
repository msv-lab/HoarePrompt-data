Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `n` is less than 0*** 

However, there is a contradiction in the postcondition because a non-negative integer cannot be less than 0. Given the precondition, the if condition `(n < 0)` would never be true, and thus the program would never enter the if block. Therefore, the correct postcondition should reflect that the if condition cannot be satisfied:
