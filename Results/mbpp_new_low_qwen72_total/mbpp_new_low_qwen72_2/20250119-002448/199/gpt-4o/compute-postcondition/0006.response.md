The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`**
