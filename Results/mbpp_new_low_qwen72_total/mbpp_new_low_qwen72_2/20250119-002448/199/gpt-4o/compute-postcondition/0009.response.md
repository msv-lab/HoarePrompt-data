The code snippet appends a new element to the list `perrin`. This new element is the sum of the elements at indices `i - 2` and `i - 3` of the list `perrin`. Given that `i` is 5, the indices used are `5 - 2 = 3` and `5 - 3 = 2`. The elements at these indices in `perrin` are `3` and `2` respectively. Therefore, the new element appended is `3 + 2 = 5`.

The updated `perrin` list is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`**
