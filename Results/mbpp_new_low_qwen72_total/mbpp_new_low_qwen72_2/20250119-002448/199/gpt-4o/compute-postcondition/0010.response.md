To determine the final output state after the loop has completed its execution, let's follow the outlined steps:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: `n` is a non-negative integer (≥ 0), and `perrin` is initialized as `[3, 0, 2]`.
- **Loop Code**: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, inclusive. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3` of the `perrin` list to the end of the list.

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **`n`**: Remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`perrin`**: Initially `[3, 0, 2]`. Each iteration appends a new element calculated as `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`.
- **`i`**: Increments from 3 to `n`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `n < 3`, the loop will not execute, and `perrin` will remain `[3, 0, 2]`.
- For each iteration, the new element appended to `perrin` is the sum of the two preceding elements in the list.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- After the loop executes, the length of `perrin` will be `n + 1` because the loop starts at index 3 and runs up to `n`, adding `n - 2` new elements to the initial 3 elements.
- The final value of `i` will be `n + 1` (since the loop increments `i` from 3 to `n`).

### Final Output State Calculation
- If `n < 3`, the loop does not execute, and `perrin` remains `[3, 0, 2]`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, the loop will run `n - 2` times, appending `n - 2` new elements to the initial list.

Let's calculate the final state for `n ≥ 3`:
- After the loop, `perrin` will have `n + 1` elements.
- The last element appended will be `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`.

### Example Calculation
For `n = 5`:
- Initial `perrin`: `[3, 0, 2]`
- Iteration 1 (`i = 3`): `perrin[3] = perrin[1] + perrin[0] = 0 + 3 = 3` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3]`
- Iteration 2 (`i = 4`): `perrin[4] = perrin[2] + perrin[1] = 2 + 0 = 2` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`
- Iteration 3 (`i = 5`): `perrin[5] = perrin[3] + perrin[2] = 3 + 2 = 5` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`

### General Final Output State
- If `n < 3`, `perrin` remains `[3, 0, 2]`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` will be `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, ...]` with `n + 1` elements.

### Final Output State
Output State: **If `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`. If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` is a list with `n + 1` elements where the last element is `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`.**
