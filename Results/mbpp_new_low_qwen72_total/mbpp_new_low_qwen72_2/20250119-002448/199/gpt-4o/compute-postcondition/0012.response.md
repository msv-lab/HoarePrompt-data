The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has two cases for its return value:

- **Case_1**: If a specific condition (not detailed in the provided constraints) is met, the function returns `0`.
- **Case_2**: If `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the elements in the list `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`. If `n ≥ 3`, the function returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` that contains `n + 1` elements, where each element after the first three is calculated as the sum of the element at position `n - 2` and the element at position `n - 3` from the list. The sum returned is the total of all elements in this extended list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns `0` in a specific case. If `n < 3`, it returns the sum `5`. If `n ≥ 3`, it returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` of length `n + 1`, where each element after the first three is the sum of the previous two elements before it, starting from `[3, 0, 2]`.**
