To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

State before the loop starts:
- `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`.

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(3, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 3 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element. This means that the starting value (3) must be less than the ending value (`n + 1`).
3. **Mathematical Condition**: For the loop to execute, the condition \(3 < n + 1\) must be true. Simplifying this, we get \(2 < n\), or equivalently, \(n > 2\).

### Initial State Adjustments:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer and `n >= 0`.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is initialized to 3 (the first value in the range).
- `perrin` remains `[3, 0, 2]`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute at least once, is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`**.
