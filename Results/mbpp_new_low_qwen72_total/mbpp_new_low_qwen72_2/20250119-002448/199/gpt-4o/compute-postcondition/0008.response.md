The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`**
