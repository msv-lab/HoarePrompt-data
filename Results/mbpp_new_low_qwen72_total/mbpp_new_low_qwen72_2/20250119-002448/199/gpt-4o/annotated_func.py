#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`. If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` is a list with `n + 1` elements where the last element is `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`.
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the elements in the list `perrin`. If `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]` and the sum is 5. If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` is a list with `n + 1` elements where the last element is `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`, and the sum is the total of all elements in this extended list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The function returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` that represents the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. Specifically:

- If `n < 0`, the function returns `0`.
- If `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, the function extends the Perrin sequence to `n + 1` elements, where each new element is the sum of the two elements preceding it (i.e., `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`), and returns the sum of all elements in this extended list.

Potential edge cases:
- When `n` is exactly `0`, `1`, or `2`, the function will return `5` because the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]` is used directly.
- When `n` is a large number, the function will compute the extended Perrin sequence and return the sum of all its elements, which could be a very large number.
