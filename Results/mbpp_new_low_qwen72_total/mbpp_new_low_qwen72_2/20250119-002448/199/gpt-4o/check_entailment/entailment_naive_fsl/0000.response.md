Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term. However, the initial values in the `perrin` list are incorrect. The correct initial values for the Perrin sequence are `[3, 0, 2]`, but the function already uses these values, which suggests the issue might lie elsewhere.

The main issue is that the function returns the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term, rather than the nth Perrin number itself. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to that point.

For example, for `n = 5`, the Perrin sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`. The 5th Perrin number is `5`, but the function would return the sum `3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should return `perrin[n]` instead of `sum(perrin)`.
