You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`. If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` is a list with `n + 1` elements where the last element is `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`.
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the elements in the list `perrin`. If `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]` and the sum is 5. If `n ≥ 3`, `perrin` is a list with `n + 1` elements where the last element is `perrin[n - 2] + perrin[n - 3]`, and the sum is the total of all elements in this extended list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term. However, the initial values in the `perrin` list are incorrect. The correct initial values for the Perrin sequence are `[3, 0, 2]`, but the function already uses these values, which suggests the issue might lie elsewhere.

The main issue is that the function returns the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term, rather than the nth Perrin number itself. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to that point.

For example, for `n = 5`, the Perrin sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`. The 5th Perrin number is `5`, but the function would return the sum `3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should return `perrin[n]` instead of `sum(perrin)`.
