### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Initial Check:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer.
   - The initial check `if (n < 0): return 0` ensures that the function returns 0 if `n` is negative. This is consistent with the problem description, which assumes valid inputs (non-negative integers).

2. **Initialization of Perrin Sequence:**
   - The Perrin sequence is initialized with the first three values `[3, 0, 2]`.
   - This initialization is correct as it matches the known starting values of the Perrin sequence.

3. **Generating the Perrin Sequence:**
   - The for loop `for i in range(3, n + 1):` generates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term.
   - The line `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` correctly computes each new term by summing the two terms at positions `i-2` and `i-3`.

4. **Returning the Sum:**
   - After generating the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list using `return sum(perrin)`.
   - This is consistent with the problem statement, which requires the sum of the Perrin numbers.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - The test cases `assert func_1(9) == 49`, `assert func_1(10) == 66`, and `assert func_1(11) == 88` are provided to verify the correctness of the function.
   - These test cases are consistent with the expected results for the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the specified indices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate the Perrin sequence and return the sum of its elements up to the `n`-th term. The test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as intended.

### Correctness:
**True**
