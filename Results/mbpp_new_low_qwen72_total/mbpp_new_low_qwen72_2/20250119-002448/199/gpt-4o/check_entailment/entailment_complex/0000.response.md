Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than 0 by returning 0. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that `n` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Initial Perrin Sequence**: The function initializes the Perrin sequence with the correct starting values `[3, 0, 2]`.

3. **Perrin Sequence Generation**: The for loop correctly extends the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term by appending the sum of the two preceding terms. This is done using the correct indices `perrin[i - 2]` and `perrin[i - 3]`.

4. **Sum Calculation**: After generating the Perrin sequence, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `perrin`. This is consistent with the problem description, which requires calculating the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the `n`-th term.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases `func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, and `func_1(11) == 88` are correct. These values match the expected sums of the Perrin sequence up to the respective terms.

6. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is 5. This is correct.
   - For `n â‰¥ 3`, the function correctly extends the sequence and returns the sum of all elements.

Given the above points, the function appears to be implemented correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
