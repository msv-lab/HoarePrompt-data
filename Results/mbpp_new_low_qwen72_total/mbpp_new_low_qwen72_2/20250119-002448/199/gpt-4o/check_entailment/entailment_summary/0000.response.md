Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the sum of the first `n+1` terms of the Perrin sequence. The Perrin sequence starts with the values `[3, 0, 2]`, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms, but skipping one (i.e., `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`).

The function correctly handles the following cases:
- For `n < 0`, it returns `0`, which is a reasonable default value since negative indices don't make sense in the context of the Perrin sequence.
- For `n < 3`, the function uses the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]` and returns the sum of these elements, which is `5`. This is correct because the first three terms of the sequence are `[3, 0, 2]`.
- For `n â‰¥ 3`, the function correctly extends the Perrin sequence to `n + 1` elements and sums all elements in the sequence. The extension logic is correct: each new term is the sum of the two terms preceding it, but skipping one.

The provided test cases `func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, and `func_1(11) == 88` are also correct according to the definition of the Perrin sequence and the sum of its terms.

Therefore, the function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
