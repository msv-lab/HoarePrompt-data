Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The function returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` that represents the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. Specifically:

- If `n < 0`, the function returns `0`.
- If `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, the function extends the Perrin sequence to `n + 1` elements, where each new element is the sum of the two elements preceding it (i.e., `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`), and returns the sum of all elements in this extended list.

Potential edge cases:
- When `n` is exactly `0`, `1`, or `2`, the function will return `5` because the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]` is used directly.
- When `n` is a large number, the function will compute the extended Perrin sequence and return the sum of all its elements, which could be a very large number.
