You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The function returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` that represents the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. Specifically:

- If `n < 0`, the function returns `0`.
- If `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, the function extends the Perrin sequence to `n + 1` elements, where each new element is the sum of the two elements preceding it (i.e., `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`), and returns the sum of all elements in this extended list.

Potential edge cases:
- When `n` is exactly `0`, `1`, or `2`, the function will return `5` because the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]` is used directly.
- When `n` is a large number, the function will compute the extended Perrin sequence and return the sum of all its elements, which could be a very large number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to a given index `n`. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
- \( P(0) = 3 \)
- \( P(1) = 0 \)
- \( P(2) = 2 \)
- For \( n > 2 \), \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \)

The function starts by checking if `n` is less than 0 and returns 0 if true. This is a reasonable base case for negative indices, although it's not typically part of the standard definition of the Perrin sequence.

Next, the function initializes a list `perrin` with the first three Perrin numbers `[3, 0, 2]`. It then uses a loop to generate the Perrin numbers up to the given index `n` by appending the sum of the two preceding numbers and the one before that.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list.

The test cases provided are:
- `assert func_1(9) == 49`
- `assert func_1(10) == 66`
- `assert func_1(11) == 88`

Let's verify these test cases:

1. For `n = 9`:
   - The Perrin sequence up to index 9 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]`.
   - The sum of this sequence is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49 \).

2. For `n = 10`:
   - The Perrin sequence up to index 10 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]`.
   - The sum of this sequence is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 66 \).

3. For `n = 11`:
   - The Perrin sequence up to index 11 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]`.
   - The sum of this sequence is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 17 = 88 \).

All test cases match the expected results, indicating that the function is correctly implemented.
