You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The function returns the sum of the elements in a list `perrin` that represents the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. Specifically:

- If `n < 0`, the function returns `0`.
- If `n < 3`, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`.
- If `n ≥ 3`, the function extends the Perrin sequence to `n + 1` elements, where each new element is the sum of the two elements preceding it (i.e., `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`), and returns the sum of all elements in this extended list.

Potential edge cases:
- When `n` is exactly `0`, `1`, or `2`, the function will return `5` because the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]` is used directly.
- When `n` is a large number, the function will compute the extended Perrin sequence and return the sum of all its elements, which could be a very large number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term. However, the initial values in the `perrin` list are incorrect. The correct initial values for the Perrin sequence are `[3, 0, 2]`, but the function already uses these values, which suggests the issue might lie elsewhere.

The main issue is that the function returns the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term, rather than the nth Perrin number itself. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to that point.

For example, for `n = 5`, the Perrin sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`. The 5th Perrin number is `5`, but the function would return the sum `3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should return `perrin[n]` instead of `sum(perrin)`.
