Reasoning:

The original assessment is mostly accurate, but there are a few points to clarify and correct:

1. **Initialization and Base Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case for negative `n` by returning `0`. This is a reasonable choice, even though it is not part of the standard Perrin sequence definition.
   - The initial Perrin sequence is correctly initialized as `[3, 0, 2]`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The loop correctly generates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term by appending the sum of the two preceding terms and the one before that. The formula used is correct: `perrin[i] = perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list, which is the correct approach for calculating the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided are correct:
     - For `n = 9`, the sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]` and the sum is indeed `49`.
     - For `n = 10`, the sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]` and the sum is `66`.
     - For `n = 11`, the sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]` and the sum is `88`.

However, there is a minor issue in the original assessment regarding the sum when `n < 3`:
- The original assessment states that the function returns `5` for `n = 0`, `1`, or `2`. This is incorrect. The function will return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence `[3, 0, 2]`, which is `5`, only when `n >= 3`. For `n = 0`, `1`, or `2`, the function will return the sum of the elements up to that index, which are:
  - `n = 0`: `3`
  - `n = 1`: `3 + 0 = 3`
  - `n = 2`: `3 + 0 + 2 = 5`

Despite this minor discrepancy, the overall implementation and the test cases provided are correct.

Final: **True**
