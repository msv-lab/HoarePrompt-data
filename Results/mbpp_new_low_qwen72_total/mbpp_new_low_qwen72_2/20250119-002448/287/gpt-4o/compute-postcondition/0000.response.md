The variable `wind_chill_index` is calculated using the formula provided, which involves the current values of `velocity` and `temperature`. The calculation does not change the values of `velocity` or `temperature`.

Output State: **velocity is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, temperature is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius, wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16**
