Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula: \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \). The function then returns the rounded value of the wind chill index. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the wind chill index has been calculated and returned as a rounded integer. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `velocity` is zero or negative, the function will still execute the calculation, but the physical interpretation of wind chill at zero or negative wind speed is undefined or incorrect. The function should ideally handle such edge cases by raising an error or returning a specific value.
- If `temperature` is outside the typical range for which the wind chill formula is valid (e.g., very high temperatures), the result may not be meaningful. However, the function does not check for this and will return a value regardless.
- The function assumes that `velocity` and `temperature` are numeric types. If non-numeric types are passed, a `TypeError` will be raised during the calculation. The function could be made more robust by adding type checks or handling such errors gracefully.
