The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` and `temperature`. `velocity` is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, and `temperature` is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius. The function returns the rounded value of the wind chill index, which is calculated using the formula 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity.
