Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

#State of the program right berfore the function call: velocity is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, and temperature is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius.
def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = (13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 +
    0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16)
    return round(wind_chill_index)
    #The program returns the rounded value of the wind chill index, which is calculated as 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity, where `velocity` is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, and `temperature` is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
