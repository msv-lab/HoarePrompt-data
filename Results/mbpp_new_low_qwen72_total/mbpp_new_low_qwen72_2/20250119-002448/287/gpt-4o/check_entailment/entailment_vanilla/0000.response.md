Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` calculates the wind chill index using the formula:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

This formula is correct for calculating the wind chill index. The function then rounds the result to the nearest integer using the `round` function, which is appropriate for the problem description that requires rounding to the next integer.

However, the problem specifically states "rounded to the next integer," which implies rounding up, not to the nearest integer. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which can be different from always rounding up. To always round up, we should use the `math.ceil` function instead of `round`.

Given this discrepancy, the function does not fully meet the requirement of rounding to the next integer.

Correctness: **False**
