Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

# Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return round(wind_chill_index)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula: \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \). The function then returns the rounded value of the wind chill index. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the wind chill index has been calculated and returned as a rounded integer.
