Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the wind chill index using the formula:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

However, the problem description specifies that the wind chill index should be rounded to the next integer. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which means it will round down for values like 0.5. To round to the next integer, we should use the `math.ceil` function instead.

For example, consider the input `velocity = 10` and `temperature = 8`. The calculated wind chill index is approximately 5.99, which `round` will round to 6. However, according to the problem description, it should be rounded up to 6. This specific case works correctly, but the issue arises when the wind chill index is just below an integer value, such as 5.999, which should be rounded up to 6 but would be rounded to 6 by `round`.

To fix this, the function should use `math.ceil`:

```python
import math

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return math.ceil(wind_chill_index)
```
