You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

- Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return round(wind_chill_index)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula: \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \). The function then returns the rounded value of the wind chill index. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the wind chill index has been calculated and returned as a rounded integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` calculates the wind chill index using the formula:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

This formula is correct for calculating the wind chill index. The function then rounds the result to the nearest integer using the `round` function, which is appropriate for the problem description that requires rounding to the next integer.

However, the problem specifically states "rounded to the next integer," which implies rounding up, not to the nearest integer. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which can be different from always rounding up. To always round up, we should use the `math.ceil` function instead of `round`.

Given this discrepancy, the function does not fully meet the requirement of rounding to the next integer.

Correctness: **False**
