Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the `round` function does not always round to the next integer as required by the problem description. Instead, it rounds to the nearest integer. For the function to meet the requirement of rounding to the next integer, it should indeed use the `math.ceil` function.

However, the test cases provided in the original assessment (`func_1(120, 35) == 40`, `func_1(40, 20) == 19`, `func_1(10, 8) == 6`) all pass with the current implementation using `round`. This suggests that for these specific inputs, the `round` function happens to produce the correct result. But the general issue remains: the function does not guarantee rounding to the next integer for all possible inputs.

To properly address the problem, the function should use `math.ceil` to ensure that the wind chill index is always rounded up to the next integer. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return math.ceil(wind_chill_index)
```

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the need to use `math.ceil` for correct rounding behavior.

Final: **False**
