Reasoning: 

The original assessment identifies a potential issue with the rounding method used in the function. Specifically, the problem description requires the wind chill index to be rounded to the next integer, which implies rounding up. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which can lead to incorrect results when the calculated wind chill index is just below an integer value (e.g., 5.999 should round up to 6, but `round` would round it to 6).

However, upon closer inspection of the test cases provided:
- `func_1(120, 35)` returns 40, which is correct.
- `func_1(40, 20)` returns 19, which is correct.
- `func_1(10, 8)` returns 6, which is also correct.

These test cases do not demonstrate any issues with the current rounding method. The `round` function appears to work correctly for these specific inputs. However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the `round` function might not always behave as required for rounding to the next integer.

To ensure the program meets the requirement of rounding to the next integer, the `math.ceil` function should be used instead of `round`. This will guarantee that any non-integer result is rounded up to the next integer, as specified in the problem description.

Given the original assessment's correctness in identifying the need for `math.ceil`, the final evaluation should reflect this:

Final: **False**
