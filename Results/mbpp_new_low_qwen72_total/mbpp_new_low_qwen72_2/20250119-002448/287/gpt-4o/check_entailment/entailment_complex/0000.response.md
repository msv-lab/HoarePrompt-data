Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the wind chill index formula as described in the problem statement. The formula used in the function is:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

This matches the standard formula for calculating the wind chill index. The function also correctly rounds the result to the nearest integer using the `round` function, which aligns with the requirement to round to the next integer. The test cases provided in the assertions also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
