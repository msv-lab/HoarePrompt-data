#State of the program right berfore the function call: velocity is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, and temperature is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius.
def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = (13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 +
    0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16)
    return round(wind_chill_index)
    #The program returns the rounded value of the wind chill index, which is calculated as 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity, where `velocity` is a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h, and `temperature` is a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a positive float or integer representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a float or integer representing the temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula: \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \). The function then returns the rounded value of the wind chill index. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the wind chill index has been calculated and returned as a rounded integer.
