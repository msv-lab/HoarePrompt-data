The provided code calculates two values based on the initial value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The first line computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and assigns it to `sum_n`. The second line computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers by squaring `sum_n` and assigns it to `sum_cubes_n`.

Given the initial state where `n` is a non-negative integer, the final state will include the values of `sum_n` and `sum_cubes_n` calculated based on this formula. 

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, sum_n is n * (n + 1) // 2, sum_cubes_n is (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2**
