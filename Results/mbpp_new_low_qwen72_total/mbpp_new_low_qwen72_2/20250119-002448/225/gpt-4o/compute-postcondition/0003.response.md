Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0`. It calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, squares this sum, and then subtracts the original sum from the squared sum. However, due to the specific calculation, the result is always `0` regardless of the input value of `n`. The final state of the program is that the function has returned `0`. **

### Explanation:
- **Input**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- **Output**: The function returns `0`.
- **Calculation**:
  - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is calculated as `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
  - This sum is then squared to get `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2`.
  - Finally, the function returns `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, which simplifies to `0` because `sum_n` is subtracted from its square.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - For `n = 0`, the sum is `0`, and the squared sum is also `0`, resulting in `0 - 0 = 0`.
  - For `n > 0`, the same logic applies, and the result is always `0`.
- **Final State**: The function always returns `0`, and the state of the program after the function call is that the return value is `0`.
