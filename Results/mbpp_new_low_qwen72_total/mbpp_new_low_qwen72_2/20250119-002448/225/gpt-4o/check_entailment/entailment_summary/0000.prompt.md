Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0`. It calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, squares this sum, and then subtracts the original sum from the squared sum. However, due to the specific calculation, the result is always `0` regardless of the input value of `n`. The final state of the program is that the function has returned `0`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
