Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to calculate the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the function `func_1` is implemented incorrectly. It calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`sum_n`), then squares this sum to get `sum_cubes_n`, and finally returns the difference `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`.

However, the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is:
\[ \text{sum\_n} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is:
\[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \]

Thus, the difference should be:
\[ \text{difference} = \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, the function as implemented does not correctly compute the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Instead, it computes the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and subtracts the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is not the intended operation.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(3)` should return \( (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3) - (1 + 2 + 3) = 36 - 6 = 30 \)
- `func_1(5)` should return \( (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 225 - 15 = 210 \)
- `func_1(2)` should return \( (1^3 + 2^3) - (1 + 2) = 9 - 3 = 6 \)

The function `func_1` does not produce these results. Instead, it produces a different result due to the incorrect implementation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
