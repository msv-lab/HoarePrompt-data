Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the formulas for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. It also correctly applies these formulas in the function `func_1` and verifies the test cases.

However, there is a discrepancy in the annotated code that needs to be addressed. The annotation incorrectly states:
```
#The program returns (n * (n + 1) // 2) - (n * (n + 1) // 2), which simplifies to 0
```

This statement is incorrect because the program does not return `(n * (n + 1) // 2) - (n * (n + 1) // 2)`. Instead, it returns the difference between the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is:
\[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} - \text{sum\_n} = \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

The original assessment correctly verifies the test cases and the logic of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
