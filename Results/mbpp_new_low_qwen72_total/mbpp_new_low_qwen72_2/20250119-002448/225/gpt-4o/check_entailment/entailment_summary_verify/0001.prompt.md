You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0`. It calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, squares this sum, and then subtracts the original sum from the squared sum. However, due to the specific calculation, the result is always `0` regardless of the input value of `n`. The final state of the program is that the function has returned `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To solve the problem, we need to compute two things:
1. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is:
\[ \text{sum\_n} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

The formula for the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is:
\[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \]

The function `func_1` correctly calculates these values and returns the difference between the sum of the cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Let's verify the test cases:
- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[ \text{sum\_n} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6 \]
  \[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 6^2 = 36 \]
  \[ \text{result} = 36 - 6 = 30 \]
  This matches the expected output.

- For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ \text{sum\_n} = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15 \]
  \[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 15^2 = 225 \]
  \[ \text{result} = 225 - 15 = 210 \]
  This matches the expected output.

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[ \text{sum\_n} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3 \]
  \[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 3^2 = 9 \]
  \[ \text{result} = 9 - 3 = 6 \]
  This matches the expected output.

Since all the test cases are correct and the logic of the function is sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
