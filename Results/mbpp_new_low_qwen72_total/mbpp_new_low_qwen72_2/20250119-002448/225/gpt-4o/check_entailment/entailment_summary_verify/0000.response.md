Reasoning:

The original assessment contains a critical misunderstanding of the mathematical relationship between the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of their cubes. The key issue lies in the interpretation of the problem statement and the application of the mathematical formulas.

1. **Problem Statement**: The task is to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is indeed given by \( \text{sum}_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n = \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \).

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers as `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers as `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2`.
   - Finally, it returns the difference `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`.

3. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - Let's verify the calculations for a few values of `n`:
     - For `n = 3`:
       - `sum_n = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 6 ** 2 = 36`
       - `difference = 36 - 6 = 30`
     - For `n = 5`:
       - `sum_n = 5 * (5 + 1) // 2 = 15`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 15 ** 2 = 225`
       - `difference = 225 - 15 = 210`
     - For `n = 2`:
       - `sum_n = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 3 ** 2 = 9`
       - `difference = 9 - 3 = 6`

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases (`func_1(3) == 30`, `func_1(5) == 210`, `func_1(2) == 6`) are correct and match the expected results based on the mathematical formulas.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary is incorrect. The function does not always return `0`. Instead, it correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` accurately implements the required logic and passes the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
