Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The formula used in the function is mathematically correct:
- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `sum_cubes_n = (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2`.

The function then returns the difference `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The test cases provided also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
