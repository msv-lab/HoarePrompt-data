Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect. The problem description asks for the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the function `func_1` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`sum_n`), squares this sum to get `sum_cubes_n`, and then returns the difference `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`. This is not the same as the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

To clarify:
- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is indeed `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula \((\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2\), which is correctly calculated as `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2`.

However, the problem description requires the difference between the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{Result} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) \]

But the function `func_1` returns:

\[ \text{Result} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) \]

This is mathematically correct, but it does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for the difference between the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is:

\[ \text{Result} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3\right) - \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right) \]

The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is \(\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\), and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
```

However, the test cases provided in the original code are incorrect. For example, the correct results for the test cases should be:
- `func_1(3)` should return \(36 - 6 = 30\)
- `func_1(5)` should return \(225 - 15 = 210\)
- `func_1(2)` should return \(9 - 3 = 6\)

These test cases are correct, but the function itself is not matching the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the function does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
