The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0`. It calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, squares this sum, and then subtracts the original sum from the squared sum. However, due to the specific calculation, the result is always `0` regardless of the input value of `n`. The final state of the program is that the function has returned `0`.
