Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string. However, the implementation has a logical flaw. The first call to `s.replace(' ', '_')` correctly replaces all spaces with underscores. The second call to `s.replace('_', ' ')` then reverses this operation, effectively undoing the first replacement. The third call to `s.replace(' ', '_')` is redundant because there are no spaces left to replace after the second call.

To correctly implement the desired functionality, the function should perform the replacements in a single pass without undoing the previous steps. A correct approach would be to use a list comprehension or a loop to iterate through the string and swap spaces and underscores.

Given the current implementation, the function will not produce the correct output for the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
