Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation will not work correctly in all cases. Specifically, the function replaces all spaces with underscores first, then replaces all underscores (including those that were originally spaces) with spaces, and finally replaces all spaces (which includes the original spaces that were just converted back) with underscores again. This results in all spaces being replaced with underscores, but underscores that were originally in the string are not handled correctly.

For example, consider the input string `"Hello World _"`:
1. After the first `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World__"`.
2. After the second `replace('_', ' ')`, the string becomes `"Hello World "` (the original space is restored, and the underscore is removed).
3. After the third `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World_"`.

The original underscore in the string is lost, and the final result is incorrect. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input.
