Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed does not correctly handle the replacement of whitespaces with underscores and vice versa as described in the problem statement. The sequence of replacements leads to the following issues:

1. The first `replace(' ', '_')` converts all spaces to underscores.
2. The second `replace('_', ' ')` converts all underscores (including those that were originally spaces) back to spaces.
3. The third `replace(' ', '_')` converts all spaces (including those that were originally underscores) back to underscores.

This means that any underscores that were originally in the string are converted to spaces and then back to underscores, effectively losing the original underscores. This results in incorrect behavior for strings containing underscores.

For example, with the input `"Hello World _"`:
- After the first `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World__"`.
- After the second `replace('_', ' ')`, the string becomes `"Hello World "` (the original space is restored, and the original underscore is removed).
- After the third `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World_"`.

The original underscore is lost, and the final result is incorrect. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input.

Final: **False**
