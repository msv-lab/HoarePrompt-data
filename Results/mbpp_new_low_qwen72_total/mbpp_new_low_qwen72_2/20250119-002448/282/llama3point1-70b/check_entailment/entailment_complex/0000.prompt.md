Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    s = s.replace(' ', '_')

s = s.replace('_', ' ')

s = s.replace(' ', '_')
    return s
    #The program returns string 's' with all spaces replaced by underscores ('_')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces replaced by underscores ('_'). However, due to the repeated and incorrect string replacements within the function, the final state of the string `s` is not consistently transformed. Specifically, the function replaces spaces with underscores, then replaces underscores back to spaces, and finally replaces spaces with underscores again. This means that the function effectively only performs the last replacement, resulting in all spaces being replaced by underscores. Edge cases include strings with no spaces, which will remain unchanged, and strings with existing underscores, which will be temporarily affected but ultimately restored to their original form.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
