Reasoning: The function as written does not correctly implement the intended behavior described in the problem statement. The problem requires replacing whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the function only performs the operation to replace spaces with underscores and does not handle the reverse (replacing underscores with spaces). The current implementation results in all spaces being replaced by underscores, but it does not address existing underscores in the input string, which should be replaced with spaces according to the problem statement. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
