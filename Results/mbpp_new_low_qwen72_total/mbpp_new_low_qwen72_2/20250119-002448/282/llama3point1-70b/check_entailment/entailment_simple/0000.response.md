Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the logic in the function does not correctly implement this behavior. The function first replaces all spaces with underscores, which is correct for the first part of the task. Then, it replaces all underscores (which were originally spaces) with spaces again, effectively undoing the first replacement. Finally, it attempts to replace spaces with underscores one more time, but this will only affect any original underscores that were not spaces, which doesn't align with the problem's requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should perform two separate replacements:
1. Replace all spaces with underscores.
2. Replace all underscores with spaces.

However, the current implementation only achieves the first step and then undoes it, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
