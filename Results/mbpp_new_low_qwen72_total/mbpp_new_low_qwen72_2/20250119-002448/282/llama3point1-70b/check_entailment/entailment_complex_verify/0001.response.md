Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` as written does not achieve the intended goal of swapping spaces and underscores. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **First Replacement (`s.replace(' ', '_')`)**:
   - This step correctly replaces all spaces in the string with underscores.
   - For example, if `s = "a b c"`, after this step, `s` becomes `"a_b_c"`.

2. **Second Replacement (`s.replace('_', ' ')`)**:
   - This step replaces all underscores with spaces, effectively undoing the first replacement.
   - Continuing the example, `"a_b_c"` becomes `"a b c"`.

3. **Third Replacement (`s.replace(' ', '_')`)**:
   - This step replaces all spaces with underscores again.
   - Finally, `"a b c"` becomes `"a_b_c"`.

Thus, the net effect of the function is to replace all spaces with underscores, which is not the desired behavior according to the problem description. The problem requires swapping spaces and underscores, meaning each space should become an underscore and each underscore should become a space.

To correctly implement the desired functionality, a different approach is needed, such as iterating through the string and swapping characters individually.

Final: **False**
