Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the intended behavior of replacing whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. Instead, it performs a series of replacements that ultimately result in all spaces being replaced by underscores, while any original underscores in the string are incorrectly removed. This is evident from the step-by-step transformation of the example string `"Hello World _"`:

1. After the first `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World__"`.
2. After the second `replace('_', ' ')`, the string becomes `"Hello World "`, where the original underscore is removed.
3. After the third `replace(' ', '_')`, the string becomes `"Hello_World_"`.

The final string `"Hello_World_"` is incorrect because the original underscore has been lost, and the spaces have been replaced by underscores. This does not meet the requirement of the problem description, which specifies that whitespaces should be replaced with underscores and vice versa.

Therefore, the function does not behave as intended, and the original assessment of **False** is correct.

Final: **False**
