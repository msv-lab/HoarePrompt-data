Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the implementation is flawed because it performs the following steps:

1. Replaces all spaces (' ') with underscores ('_').
2. Replaces all underscores ('_') with spaces (' ').
3. Replaces all spaces (' ') with underscores ('_') again.

This sequence of operations means that any underscores originally present in the string are first converted to spaces and then back to underscores, so they are effectively unchanged. The final result is that only the original spaces in the string are replaced with underscores, and the underscores (if any) are left as they were.

Given this, the function does not correctly implement the intended behavior of swapping spaces and underscores. It only replaces spaces with underscores, which is not the same as swapping them.

Correctness: **False**
