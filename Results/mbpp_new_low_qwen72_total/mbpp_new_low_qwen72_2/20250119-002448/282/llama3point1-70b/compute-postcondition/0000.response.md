The first line replaces all spaces in the string `s` with underscores ('_'). The second line then replaces all underscores ('_') in the updated string `s` back with spaces. The third line again replaces all spaces in the string `s` with underscores ('_'). Since the second line undoes the effect of the first line, the third line will result in all spaces being replaced with underscores, which is the same as the effect of the first line alone.

Output State: **s is a string with all spaces replaced by underscores ('_')**
