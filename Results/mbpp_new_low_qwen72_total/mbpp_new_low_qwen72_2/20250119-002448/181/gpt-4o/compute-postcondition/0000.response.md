The code initializes a range of natural numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, computes the cubes of these numbers, calculates the sum of these cubes, and then finds the average of these cubes. Here's the detailed impact:

- `natural_numbers` is a range object containing numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `cubes` is a list containing the cubes of each number in `natural_numbers`.
- `sum_of_cubes` is the sum of all elements in the `cubes` list.
- `average` is the result of dividing `sum_of_cubes` by `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, the final state will include:
- `natural_numbers` is a range from 1 to `n`.
- `cubes` is a list of cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `sum_of_cubes` is the sum of the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `average` is the average of the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, natural_numbers is range(1, n+1), cubes is [1**3, 2**3, ..., n**3], sum_of_cubes is the sum of cubes from 1 to n, average is sum_of_cubes / n**
