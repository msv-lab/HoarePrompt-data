Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers correctly. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers, computes their cubes, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to get the average. The assertions provided also pass, indicating that the function works correctly for the given test cases. There are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail for any valid input `n`.
