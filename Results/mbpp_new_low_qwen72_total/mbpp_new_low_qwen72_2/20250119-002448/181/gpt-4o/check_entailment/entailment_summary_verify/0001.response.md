Reasoning:
The original assessment is generally correct in its breakdown of the function's logic and the verification of the provided test cases. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Functionality and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates the first `n` natural numbers using `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - It correctly computes the cubes of these numbers using a list comprehension.
   - The sum of these cubes is calculated using `sum(cubes)`.
   - The average is then computed by dividing the sum of the cubes by `n`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided (`func_1(2) == 4.5`, `func_1(3) == 12`, and `func_1(1) == 1`) are correct and match the expected results:
     - For `n = 2`: \((1^3 + 2^3) / 2 = (1 + 8) / 2 = 4.5\)
     - For `n = 3`: \((1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3) / 3 = (1 + 8 + 27) / 3 = 12\)
     - For `n = 1`: \((1^3) / 1 = 1\)

3. **Edge Cases and Input Validation**:
   - The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to errors. However, the problem description assumes valid inputs (positive integers), so this is not a concern for the given context.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` is correct in terms of its logic and the provided test cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
