Reasoning: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function correctly generates the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to compute the average. The provided assertions `assert func_1(2) == 4.5`, `assert func_1(3) == 12`, and `assert func_1(1) == 1` all pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for these specific test cases.

However, the function summary points out that the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, which is true. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will either raise a `TypeError` or produce incorrect results. Despite this, the original assessment only considers valid inputs, and the function works correctly for those inputs.

Given that the problem description specifies "first n natural numbers," we can assume that `n` will always be a positive integer. Under this assumption, the function is correct for the specified domain of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
