Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Generating Natural Numbers**: The function uses `range(1, n + 1)` to generate the first `n` natural numbers.
2. **Cubing the Numbers**: It then creates a list of cubes using a list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]`.
3. **Summing the Cubes**: The sum of these cubes is calculated using `sum(cubes)`.
4. **Calculating the Average**: Finally, the average is computed by dividing the sum of the cubes by `n`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For `n = 2`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5
  - The function returns 4.5, which matches the expected result.

- For `n = 3`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36
  - Average: 36 / 3 = 12
  - The function returns 12, which matches the expected result.

- For `n = 1`:
  - Natural numbers: 1
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1
  - Sum of cubes: 1
  - Average: 1 / 1 = 1
  - The function returns 1, which matches the expected result.

Since all the test cases pass and the logic is correct, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
