Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
