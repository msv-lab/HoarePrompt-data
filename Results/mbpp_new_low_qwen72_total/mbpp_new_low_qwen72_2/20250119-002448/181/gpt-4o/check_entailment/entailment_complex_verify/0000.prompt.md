You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the value of `average`, which is calculated as the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`. Since `cubes` only contains the number 1, the sum of the cubes is 1, and thus `average` is 1/n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function correctly calculates the cubes of each number from 1 to `n`, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to compute the average. Contrary to the annotations, the list `cubes` contains the cubes of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not just the number 1. Therefore, the returned `average` is the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`, which is not necessarily `1/n`. For example, if `n` is 2, the function returns `(1^3 + 2^3) / 2 = 4.5`. The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, returning 1.0. However, the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, and such inputs would result in a `TypeError` or incorrect behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers correctly. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers, computes their cubes, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to get the average. The assertions provided also pass, indicating that the function works correctly for the given test cases. There are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail for any valid input `n`.
