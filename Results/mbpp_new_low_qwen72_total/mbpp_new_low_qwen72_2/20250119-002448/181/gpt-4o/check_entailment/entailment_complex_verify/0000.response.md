Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Let's break down the function step-by-step using the provided annotations and verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Range Generation**:
   ```python
   natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
   ```
   This line correctly generates a range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Cubing the Numbers**:
   ```python
   cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
   ```
   This list comprehension correctly computes the cube of each number in the range from 1 to `n`.

3. **Summing the Cubes**:
   ```python
   sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
   ```
   This line correctly sums the cubes of the numbers.

4. **Calculating the Average**:
   ```python
   average = sum_of_cubes / n
   ```
   This line correctly calculates the average by dividing the sum of the cubes by `n`.

5. **Return the Average**:
   ```python
   return average
   ```

The function logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. The assertions provided in the code also pass, which further confirms that the function works as intended for the given test cases.

The original assessment states that the function is correct and provides a clear explanation of why it works. The annotations in the annotated code also confirm that the function behaves as expected, with the exception of the incorrect statement about the list `cubes` containing only the number 1. This is a minor misstatement in the annotations and does not affect the correctness of the function itself.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the function `func_1` is correct.

Final: **True**
