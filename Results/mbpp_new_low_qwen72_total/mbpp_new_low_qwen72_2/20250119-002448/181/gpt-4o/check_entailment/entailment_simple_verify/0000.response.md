Reasoning: 

Let's break down the program and the annotations to evaluate the correctness:

1. **Function Definition and Initial Setup**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
   - `natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)` generates a range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Calculating Cubes**:
   - `cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]` computes the cube of each number in the range and stores it in a list.
   - This step is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Summing the Cubes**:
   - `sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)` calculates the sum of the cubes.
   - This is correct and follows the previous steps.

4. **Calculating the Average**:
   - `average = sum_of_cubes / n` computes the average of the cubes by dividing the sum of the cubes by `n`.
   - This is the correct formula for the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the computed average.
   - This is correct and matches the problem description.

6. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions `assert func_1(2) == 4.5`, `assert func_1(3) == 12`, and `assert func_1(1) == 1` are used to verify the correctness of the function.
   - Let's check these:
     - For `n = 2`: The cubes are \(1^3\) and \(2^3\), which are 1 and 8. The sum is 9, and the average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\). This is correct.
     - For `n = 3`: The cubes are \(1^3\), \(2^3\), and \(3^3\), which are 1, 8, and 27. The sum is 36, and the average is \(36 / 3 = 12\). This is correct.
     - For `n = 1`: The cube is \(1^3\), which is 1. The sum is 1, and the average is \(1 / 1 = 1\). This is correct.

The annotations in the annotated code are mostly correct but contain a minor mistake in the comment:
- The comment states: "Since `cubes` only contains the number 1, the sum of the cubes is 1, and thus `average` is 1/n."
- This is incorrect because `cubes` contains the cubes of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not just the number 1.

Despite this incorrect comment, the actual implementation of the function is correct and the assertions pass, confirming that the function works as intended.

Final: **True**. The given program is correct.
