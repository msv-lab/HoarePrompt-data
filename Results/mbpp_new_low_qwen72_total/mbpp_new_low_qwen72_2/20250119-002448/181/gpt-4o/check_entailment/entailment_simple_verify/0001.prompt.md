You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the value of `average`, which is calculated as the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`. Since `cubes` only contains the number 1, the sum of the cubes is 1, and thus `average` is 1/n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Generating Natural Numbers**: The function uses `range(1, n + 1)` to generate the first `n` natural numbers.
2. **Cubing the Numbers**: It then creates a list of cubes using a list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]`.
3. **Summing the Cubes**: The sum of these cubes is calculated using `sum(cubes)`.
4. **Calculating the Average**: Finally, the average is computed by dividing the sum of the cubes by `n`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For `n = 2`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5
  - The function returns 4.5, which matches the expected result.

- For `n = 3`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36
  - Average: 36 / 3 = 12
  - The function returns 12, which matches the expected result.

- For `n = 1`:
  - Natural numbers: 1
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1
  - Sum of cubes: 1
  - Average: 1 / 1 = 1
  - The function returns 1, which matches the expected result.

Since all the test cases pass and the logic is correct, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
