Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Based on the provided execution summary:

1. The function correctly generates a list of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It then computes the cubes of these numbers and stores them in a list called `cubes`.
3. The sum of these cubes is calculated and stored in `sum_of_cubes`.
4. Finally, the average is computed by dividing `sum_of_cubes` by `n`.

The function works as intended for positive integer values of `n`. However, the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, which would indeed result in a `TypeError` or incorrect behavior. Despite this limitation, the problem description assumes valid inputs (i.e., positive integers), and the function meets the requirements under this assumption.

Given that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs as specified in the problem description, we can conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
