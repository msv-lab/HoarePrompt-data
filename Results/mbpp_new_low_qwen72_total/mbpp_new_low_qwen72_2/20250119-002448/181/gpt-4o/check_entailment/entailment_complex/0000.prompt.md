Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the value of `average`, which is calculated as the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`. Since `cubes` only contains the number 1, the sum of the cubes is 1, and thus `average` is 1/n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function correctly calculates the cubes of each number from 1 to `n`, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to compute the average. Contrary to the annotations, the list `cubes` contains the cubes of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not just the number 1. Therefore, the returned `average` is the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`, which is not necessarily `1/n`. For example, if `n` is 2, the function returns `(1^3 + 2^3) / 2 = 4.5`. The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, returning 1.0. However, the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, and such inputs would result in a `TypeError` or incorrect behavior.
