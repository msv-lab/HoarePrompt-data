Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The logic within the function is correct and follows the expected steps:

1. It generates a range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
2. It computes the cube of each number in this range and stores the results in a list called `cubes`.
3. It calculates the sum of the elements in the `cubes` list.
4. It divides the sum by `n` to get the average and returns this value.

The function correctly handles the cases provided in the assertions:
- `func_1(2)` should return `(1^3 + 2^3) / 2 = (1 + 8) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5`.
- `func_1(3)` should return `(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3) / 3 = (1 + 8 + 27) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12`.
- `func_1(1)` should return `1^3 / 1 = 1`.

The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, but the problem statement assumes valid inputs (positive integers), so this is not a requirement for correctness.

Given the above reasoning, the function is correct based on the problem description and the provided assertions.

Correctness: **True**
