The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function correctly calculates the cubes of each number from 1 to `n`, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to compute the average. Contrary to the annotations, the list `cubes` contains the cubes of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not just the number 1. Therefore, the returned `average` is the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers divided by `n`, which is not necessarily `1/n`. For example, if `n` is 2, the function returns `(1^3 + 2^3) / 2 = 4.5`. The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, returning 1.0. However, the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, and such inputs would result in a `TypeError` or incorrect behavior.
