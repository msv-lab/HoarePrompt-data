The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, or a list with no numbers (all edge cases result in the function returning `None`). After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.
