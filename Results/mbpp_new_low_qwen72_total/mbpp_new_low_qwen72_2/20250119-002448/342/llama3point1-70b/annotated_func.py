#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)

odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd
    #The program returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list 'nums', or None if either an even or odd number does not exist in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, or a list with no numbers (all edge cases result in the function returning `None`). After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.
