Reasoning:
The function `func_1(nums)` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in the list `nums`. The function uses generator expressions with `next()` to efficiently locate the first even and odd numbers. If either an even or odd number is not found, `next()` returns `None`. According to the function summary, the function is expected to handle edge cases where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number by returning `None`.

However, the original assessment mentions that multiplying `None` by any number will raise a `TypeError`. This is a valid concern, but it is mitigated by the fact that the multiplication operation `even * odd` will only be attempted if both `even` and `odd` are not `None`. If either `even` or `odd` is `None`, the multiplication will not occur, and the function will return `None` without raising an error.

Given the problem description, which assumes valid inputs (i.e., the list always contains at least one even and one odd number), the function will indeed correctly find the first even and odd numbers and return their product. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
