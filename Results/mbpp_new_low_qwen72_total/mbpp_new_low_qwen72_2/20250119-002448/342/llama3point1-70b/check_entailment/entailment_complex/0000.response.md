Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The implementation uses generator expressions to find the first even and the first odd number in the list using the `next` function with a default value of `None` if no such number is found. This approach is efficient and concise.

The function correctly handles the following scenarios:
- If the list contains at least one even and one odd number, it returns their product.
- If the list contains only even numbers, only odd numbers, or is empty, it returns `None`.

The comments accurately describe the behavior of the function, including its handling of edge cases.

Given this analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided comments.

Correctness: **True**
