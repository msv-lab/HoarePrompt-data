Reasoning:  
The function `func_1(nums)` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in the list `nums`. The approach used in the function is to use generator expressions with `next()` to find the first even and odd numbers in the list. If no such number is found, `None` is returned by `next()`, which can lead to an issue when multiplying `even` and `odd` because multiplying any number by `None` will raise a TypeError. However, since the problem assumes valid inputs (i.e., the list always contains at least one even and one odd number), this should not be an issue. Given this assumption, the function will correctly find the first even and odd numbers and return their product.

Correctness: **True**
