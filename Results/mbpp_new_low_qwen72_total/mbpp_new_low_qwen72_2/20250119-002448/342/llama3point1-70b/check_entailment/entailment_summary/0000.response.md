Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The function uses generator expressions to find the first even and odd numbers in the list. If either an even or an odd number is not found, the `next` function returns `None` for that particular number. When the product of these two numbers is calculated, if one of them is `None`, the result will also be `None` (since `None * any_number = None`). This behavior aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to handle cases where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected in various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, or a list with no numbers. In all these cases, the function correctly returns `None`.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
