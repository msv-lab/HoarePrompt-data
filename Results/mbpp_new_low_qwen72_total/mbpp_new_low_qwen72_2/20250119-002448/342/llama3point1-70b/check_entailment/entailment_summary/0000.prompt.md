Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Program:
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, or a list with no numbers (all edge cases result in the function returning `None`). After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
