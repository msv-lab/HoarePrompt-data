The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second integer. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` had at least 1 integer, and `num` was the first integer in `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` should now be the second integer in `lst`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`**
