The value of `first_odd` is updated to be equal to `num`. Given that `num` is the first integer in `lst` and is specified to be an odd number, `first_odd` now holds the value of this odd number. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst` and is an odd number, `first_odd` is the first integer in `lst` and is an odd number, `first_even` is the first even number in `lst` (or None if no even number exists).**
