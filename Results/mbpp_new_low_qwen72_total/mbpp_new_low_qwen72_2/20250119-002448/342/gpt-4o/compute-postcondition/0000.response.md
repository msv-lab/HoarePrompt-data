Initial State: lst is a list of integers.
```
first_odd = None
first_even = None

for num in lst:
    if num % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:
        first_even = num
    elif num % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:
        first_odd = num
```

The code initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`. It then iterates over each element in the list `lst`. For each number, it checks if the number is even and if `first_even` is still `None`. If both conditions are true, it assigns the number to `first_even`. Similarly, it checks if the number is odd and if `first_odd` is still `None`. If both conditions are true, it assigns the number to `first_odd`.

After executing the code, `first_odd` will hold the first odd number found in `lst`, and `first_even` will hold the first even number found in `lst`. If no odd or even numbers are found, the respective variables will remain `None`.

Output State: **lst is a list of integers, first_odd is the first odd number in lst (or None if no odd number exists), first_even is the first even number in lst (or None if no even number exists)**
