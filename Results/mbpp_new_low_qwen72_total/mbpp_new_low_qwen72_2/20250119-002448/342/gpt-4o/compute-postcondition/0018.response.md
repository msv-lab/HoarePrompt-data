The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`. In all other cases, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged.**
