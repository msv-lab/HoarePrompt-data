Output State: **The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. `first_odd` is the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers), and `first_even` is the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is None, the program will return None.**
