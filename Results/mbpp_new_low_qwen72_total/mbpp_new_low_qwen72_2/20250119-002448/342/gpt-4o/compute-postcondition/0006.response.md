The code assigns the value of `num` to `first_even`. Given the initial state, `num` is even and `first_even` is currently `None`. After executing the code, `first_even` is updated to the value of `num`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`, `first_odd` retains its original value, `first_even` is `num` (the first even integer in `lst`).**
