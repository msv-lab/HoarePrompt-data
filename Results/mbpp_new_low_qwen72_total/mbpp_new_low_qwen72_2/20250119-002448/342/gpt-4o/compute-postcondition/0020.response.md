Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is None and `num` is odd, then `first_odd` is set to `num` and `first_even` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`. In all other cases, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged.***
