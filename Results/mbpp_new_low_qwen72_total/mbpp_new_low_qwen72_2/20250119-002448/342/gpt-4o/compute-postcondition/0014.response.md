The code snippet assigns the value of `num` (the second integer in `lst`) to `first_even`. The variable `first_odd` is only modified under specific conditions mentioned in the initial state. Since this condition does not involve the assignment to `first_even`, `first_odd` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`, `first_odd` remains unchanged, `first_even` is equal to `num`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`, `first_odd` remains unchanged, `first_even` is equal to `num`.**
