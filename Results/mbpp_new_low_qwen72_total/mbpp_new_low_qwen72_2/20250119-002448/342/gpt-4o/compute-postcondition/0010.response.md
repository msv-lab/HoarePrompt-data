Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is an even number, then `first_even` is updated to `num` (the first even integer in `lst`). If neither of these conditions are met, `first_even` and `first_odd` retain their original values.***
