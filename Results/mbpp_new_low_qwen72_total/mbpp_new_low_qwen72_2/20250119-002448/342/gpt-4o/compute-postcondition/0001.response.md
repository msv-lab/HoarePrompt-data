The objects in the loop head are `num` and `lst`, so these are the only ones that can control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variables `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized based on the contents of `lst`, but they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

For the loop to execute the first time, `lst` must have at least one integer, and `num` will be set to the first integer in `lst`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`, `first_odd` is the first odd number in `lst` (or None if no odd number exists), `first_even` is the first even number in `lst` (or None if no even number exists)**
