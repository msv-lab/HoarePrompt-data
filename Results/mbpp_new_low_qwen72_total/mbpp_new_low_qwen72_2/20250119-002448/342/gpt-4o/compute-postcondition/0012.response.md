`first_odd` is assigned the value of `num`, which is the second integer in `lst`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`, `first_odd` is the second integer in `lst`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`, `first_odd` is the second integer in `lst`**
