Output State: **After the loop finishes, `lst` is a list of integers. `first_odd` will be the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers). `first_even` will be the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). The loop will stop as soon as it finds both a first odd and a first even number, or it will iterate through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Variables that remain constant throughout the loop are `lst` (it is not modified within the loop).**
