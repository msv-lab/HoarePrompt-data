The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. Here, `first_odd` is the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers), and `first_even` is the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is None, the function returns None.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number found in `lst`. If either the first odd number or the first even number is not found, it returns None.**
