The code snippet `first_odd = num` assigns the value of `num` (which is the third integer in `lst`) to `first_odd`. The conditions regarding `first_odd` and `first_even` being None or not None, and the checks for evenness of `num`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is that `first_odd` now holds the value of the third integer in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_odd` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_even` remains unchanged, and if `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`.**
