The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional structure it is within. The variables `lst`, `num`, `first_even`, and `first_odd` are not directly modified by the `break` statement. However, the conditions under which the `break` occurs might imply certain states of these variables, but since the `break` itself does not change their values, we only note the action of breaking.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_even` is None or the first even number encountered, `first_odd` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
