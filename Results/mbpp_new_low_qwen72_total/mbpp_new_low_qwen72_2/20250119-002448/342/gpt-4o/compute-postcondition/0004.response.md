Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is None and `num` is an odd number, then `first_odd` is updated to `num` (the first integer in `lst`), and `first_even` remains the first even number in `lst` (or None if no even number exists). Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` retain their original values.***
