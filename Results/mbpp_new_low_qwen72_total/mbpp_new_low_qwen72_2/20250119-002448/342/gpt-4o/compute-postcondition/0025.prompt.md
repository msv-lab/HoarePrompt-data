Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: lst is a list of integers, first_odd is the first odd number in lst (or None if no odd number exists), first_even is the first even number in lst (or None if no even number exists)
Code of the loop:
for num in lst:
    if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
        first_odd = num
    if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
        first_even = num
    if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
        break


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is an even number, then `first_even` is updated to `num` (the first even integer in `lst`). If neither of these conditions are met, `first_even` and `first_odd` retain their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`. In all other cases, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`, and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
