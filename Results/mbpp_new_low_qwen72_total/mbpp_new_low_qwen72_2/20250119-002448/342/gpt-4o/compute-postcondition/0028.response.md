Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number found in `lst`. If either the first odd number or the first even number is not found in the list, the function returns `None`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even number, or it iterates through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Edge cases include lists with no odd numbers, no even numbers, or lists that are empty. In all such cases, the function returns `None`. **
