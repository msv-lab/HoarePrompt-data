The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. Since no changes are made to any variables within this statement, the initial state remains unchanged except for the control flow effect of breaking out.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`. If `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`. Otherwise, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
