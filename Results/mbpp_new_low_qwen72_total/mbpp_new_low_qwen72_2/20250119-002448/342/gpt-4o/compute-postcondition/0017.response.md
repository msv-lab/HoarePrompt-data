Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `lst`. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, then `first_even` is set to `num`. In all other cases, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` remains unchanged.***
