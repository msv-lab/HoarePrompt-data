The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which only affects control flow within loops or conditional statements. Since there is no loop or conditional statement context provided, the `break` statement would cause an error if executed, but for the purpose of this task, we will consider the impact of the `break` statement as described in the example format.

The `break` statement does not alter the values of the variables `lst`, `num`, `first_even`, or `first_odd`. It only indicates an exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block, but since no such context is provided, we assume it simply causes an immediate stop without changing the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains as it was initially described, with the addition of the effect of the `break` statement:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`, `first_even` is not None, `first_odd` is not None, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
