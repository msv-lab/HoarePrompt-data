`first_even` is set to `num`. Since `num` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_even` now holds the value of the third integer in `lst`. The other conditions and states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_even` is the third integer in `lst`, `first_odd` remains unchanged, and if `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
