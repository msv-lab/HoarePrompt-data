Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `lst`. If `first_even` is None and `num` is an even number, then `first_even` is updated to `num` (the first even integer in `lst`). Otherwise, `first_even` retains its original value, and `first_odd` remains unchanged.***
