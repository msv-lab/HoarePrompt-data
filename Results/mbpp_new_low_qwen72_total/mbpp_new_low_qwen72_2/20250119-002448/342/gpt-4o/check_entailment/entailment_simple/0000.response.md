Reasoning:  
- The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list.
- The function initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`.
- It iterates through the list, setting `first_odd` to the first odd number and `first_even` to the first even number it encounters.
- If both an odd and an even number are found, the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary iterations.
- The function then returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.
- If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is `None` (i.e., if the list does not contain both an odd and an even number), the function will return `None`.

However, there is a potential issue with the implementation:
- If the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, the product will be `None * some_number`, which results in `None`. This behavior is consistent with the problem statement, but it might not be what the user expects. 

Given the problem statement and the test cases provided, the function behaves correctly according to the specification. The test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as intended for the given scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
