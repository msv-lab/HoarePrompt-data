Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, `lst` is a list of integers. `first_odd` will be the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers). `first_even` will be the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). The loop will stop as soon as it finds both a first odd and a first even number, or it will iterate through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Variables that remain constant throughout the loop are `lst` (it is not modified within the loop).
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. `first_odd` is the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers), and `first_even` is the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is None, the program will return None.
