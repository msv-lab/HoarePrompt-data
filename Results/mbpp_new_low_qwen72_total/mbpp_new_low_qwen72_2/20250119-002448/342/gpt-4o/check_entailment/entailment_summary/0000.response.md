Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the first even and the first odd numbers in the given list and returns their product. The function uses two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to keep track of the first odd and even numbers encountered during the iteration over the list. It breaks out of the loop as soon as both an odd and an even number have been found, which optimizes the function by avoiding unnecessary iterations. The function returns `None` if either an odd or an even number is not found, which is consistent with the expected behavior for edge cases (e.g., lists containing only odd or only even numbers, or empty lists). The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
