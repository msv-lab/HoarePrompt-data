Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. For example, if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, the program will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will raise a `TypeError`. Here is a specific example:

```python
func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])
```

In this case, `first_odd` remains `None`, and the multiplication `first_odd * first_even` will result in a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
