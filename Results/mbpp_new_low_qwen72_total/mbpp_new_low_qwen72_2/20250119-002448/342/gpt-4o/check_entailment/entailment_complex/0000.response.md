Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The function correctly initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`, and iterates through the list to find the first occurrences of an odd and an even number. Once both are found, the loop breaks, and the function returns their product. If either the first odd or the first even number is not found, the function will return `None` due to the multiplication of `None` with any integer resulting in `None`.

However, there is a potential issue with the function's behavior when the list contains only even or only odd numbers, or is empty. In these cases, the function should return `None`, but the current implementation does not explicitly handle these edge cases. However, the provided test cases and the function logic suggest that the function will indeed return `None` in these scenarios because multiplying `None` with any integer results in `None`.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function appears to work correctly and meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
