Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list. The logic in the function iterates through the list and identifies the first occurrence of an odd and an even number, storing them in `first_odd` and `first_even`, respectively. Once both values are found, the loop breaks to avoid unnecessary iterations. Finally, the function returns the product of these two numbers.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 4
   - Product: 1 * 4 = 4
   - Expected output: 4 (matches the assert statement)

2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 2
   - Product: 1 * 2 = 2
   - Expected output: 2 (matches the assert statement)

3. `func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 10
   - Product: 1 * 10 = 10
   - Expected output: 10 (matches the assert statement)

All test cases produce the expected results, confirming that the function behaves as intended.

Correctness: **True**
