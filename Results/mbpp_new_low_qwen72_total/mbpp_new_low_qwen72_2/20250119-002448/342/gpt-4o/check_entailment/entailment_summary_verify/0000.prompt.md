You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number found in `lst`. If either the first odd number or the first even number is not found in the list, the function returns `None`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even number, or it iterates through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Edge cases include lists with no odd numbers, no even numbers, or lists that are empty. In all such cases, the function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. For example, if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, the program will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will raise a `TypeError`. Here is a specific example:

```python
func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])
```

In this case, `first_odd` remains `None`, and the multiplication `first_odd * first_even` will result in a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
