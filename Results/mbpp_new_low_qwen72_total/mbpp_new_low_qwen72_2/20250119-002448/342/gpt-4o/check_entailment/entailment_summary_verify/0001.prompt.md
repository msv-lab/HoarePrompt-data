You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number found in `lst`. If either the first odd number or the first even number is not found in the list, the function returns `None`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even number, or it iterates through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Edge cases include lists with no odd numbers, no even numbers, or lists that are empty. In all such cases, the function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list. The logic in the function iterates through the list and identifies the first occurrence of an odd and an even number, storing them in `first_odd` and `first_even`, respectively. Once both values are found, the loop breaks to avoid unnecessary iterations. Finally, the function returns the product of these two numbers.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 4
   - Product: 1 * 4 = 4
   - Expected output: 4 (matches the assert statement)

2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 2
   - Product: 1 * 2 = 2
   - Expected output: 2 (matches the assert statement)

3. `func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10])`:
   - First odd: 1
   - First even: 10
   - Product: 1 * 10 = 10
   - Expected output: 10 (matches the assert statement)

All test cases produce the expected results, confirming that the function behaves as intended.

Correctness: **True**
