Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The function `func_1` indeed attempts to multiply `None` by a number when the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. This leads to a `TypeError` because multiplying `None` by any number is not defined in Python. The function summary also confirms that the function should return `None` if either the first odd number or the first even number is not found in the list. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly and will raise an error instead of returning `None`.

To fix this issue, the function should check if both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None` before attempting to multiply them. If either is `None`, the function should return `None`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
        return first_odd * first_even
    else:
        return None
```

However, since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the given program, and the given program does not handle the edge case correctly, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
