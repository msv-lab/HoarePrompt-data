Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list. Let's break down the function's logic and the provided test cases to ensure its correctness:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`.
   - It iterates through the list `lst`:
     - For each number `num`, it checks if `first_odd` is `None` and `num` is odd. If so, it sets `first_odd` to `num`.
     - Similarly, it checks if `first_even` is `None` and `num` is even. If so, it sets `first_even` to `num`.
     - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` are found, the loop breaks to stop further unnecessary iterations.
   - Finally, it returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8])`:
     - First odd: 1
     - First even: 4
     - Product: 1 * 4 = 4
     - Expected output: 4 (matches the assert statement)
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`:
     - First odd: 1
     - First even: 2
     - Product: 1 * 2 = 2
     - Expected output: 2 (matches the assert statement)
   - `func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10])`:
     - First odd: 1
     - First even: 10
     - Product: 1 * 10 = 10
     - Expected output: 10 (matches the assert statement)

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle edge cases where the list might not contain both an odd and an even number. According to the function summary, the function should return `None` in such cases. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` remains `None` after the loop, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to multiply `None` with an integer.

To address this, we need to modify the function to handle cases where one or both of the required numbers are not found:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    if first_odd is None or first_even is None:
        return None
    return first_odd * first_even
```

With this modification, the function correctly handles edge cases and returns `None` when necessary.

Given the original assessment did not consider edge cases and the function as written would fail in those scenarios, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

Final: **False**
