#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, `lst` is a list of integers. `first_odd` will be the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers). `first_even` will be the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). The loop will stop as soon as it finds both a first odd and a first even number, or it will iterate through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Variables that remain constant throughout the loop are `lst` (it is not modified within the loop).
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. `first_odd` is the first odd number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no odd numbers), and `first_even` is the first even number encountered in `lst` (or None if there are no even numbers). If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is None, the program will return None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number found in `lst`. If either the first odd number or the first even number is not found in the list, the function returns `None`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even number, or it iterates through the entire list if one or both of these numbers do not exist. Edge cases include lists with no odd numbers, no even numbers, or lists that are empty. In all such cases, the function returns `None`.
