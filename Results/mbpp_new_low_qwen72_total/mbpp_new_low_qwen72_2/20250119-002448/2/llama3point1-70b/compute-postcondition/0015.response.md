The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer greater than 1. The function returns `True` in most cases (Cases 1-4), and it returns `False` in one specific case (Case 5). However, without additional context on the conditions leading to each case, we can only generalize based on the provided outputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 1. It returns `True` in most cases and `False` in one specific case.**
