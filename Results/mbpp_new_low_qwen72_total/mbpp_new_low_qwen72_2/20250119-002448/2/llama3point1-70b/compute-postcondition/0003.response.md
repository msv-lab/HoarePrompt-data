To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if there is at least one value for `i` in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `n` is not equal to 1 (this is redundant since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1).

Let's analyze the condition for the loop to execute:
- The loop will execute if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 2.
- This simplifies to `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 1`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `math.sqrt(n)` will always be greater than 1, and thus `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 1. Therefore, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will always be at least 2.

So, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `n` is greater than 1.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2 (the starting value of the range).
- The loop will execute because `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2**
