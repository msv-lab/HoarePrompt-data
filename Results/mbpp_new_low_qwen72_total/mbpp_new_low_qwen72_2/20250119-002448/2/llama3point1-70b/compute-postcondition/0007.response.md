To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `n % i` is not equal to 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The loop condition requires that `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3, meaning `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 3`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3**.
