To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
  - `i` is 3.
  - `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3.
  - If `n % i == 0`, the program returns True.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3, which means `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 3`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - `i` is incremented to 4.
   - `int(math.sqrt(n))` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted in the loop head is `i`.
- The condition `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 3` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3.**
