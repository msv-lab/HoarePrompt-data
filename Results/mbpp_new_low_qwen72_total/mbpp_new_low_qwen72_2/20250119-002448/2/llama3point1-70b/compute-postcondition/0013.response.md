To determine the final output state after the loop has completed its execution, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over integers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns `True`. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning.

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Changing Variables**: `i` increments from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i`, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding any divisor, the function implicitly returns `False` (since no return statement is executed within the loop).

### 4. Verify Relationships
- The loop will execute at least once if `n > 1` and `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 2`.
- The loop will execute multiple times if `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 3`.

### Final Output State Calculation
- **Final Values of Variables**:
  - `n` remains the same as the initial value.
  - `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` if the loop completes without returning.
- **Conditions for Execution**:
  - The loop will execute if `n > 1` and `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 2`.
  - The loop will not execute if `n == 1` or `int(math.sqrt(n)) < 2`.

### Final Output State
If the loop completes without returning `True`, the function implicitly returns `False`. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `False` if no divisor is found.**
