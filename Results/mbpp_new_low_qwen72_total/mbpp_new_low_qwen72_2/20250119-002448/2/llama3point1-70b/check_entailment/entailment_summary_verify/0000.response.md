### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided function `func_1` and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers. Non-prime numbers are those that are not prime, which means they have divisors other than 1 and themselves. The function should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns `True`.
- For `n > 1`, the function checks if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`.
- If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \)**
   - According to the function summary, the function returns `True` for \( n = 1 \).
   - This is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
   
2. **Prime Numbers:**
   - For prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.), the function should return `False`.
   - The function correctly iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks for divisors.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, which is correct.

3. **Non-Prime Numbers:**
   - For non-prime numbers (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.), the function should return `True`.
   - The function correctly identifies these numbers by finding a divisor within the specified range.
   - If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Case: \( n < 1 \)**
   - The function does not explicitly handle cases where \( n \leq 1 \).
   - However, the problem description and function summary do not specify how to handle such cases, so we assume valid inputs (i.e., \( n > 1 \)).

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the function is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
- It mentions that the function handles the edge case of \( n = 1 \) correctly by returning `True`.

#### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the problem description.
- It handles the edge case of \( n = 1 \) correctly.
- The function efficiently checks for divisors up to the square root of `n`, ensuring it works correctly for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function `func_1` is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
