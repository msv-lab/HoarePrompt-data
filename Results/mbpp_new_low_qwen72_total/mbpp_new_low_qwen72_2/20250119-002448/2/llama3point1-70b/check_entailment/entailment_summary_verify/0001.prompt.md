You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `n` is expected to be greater than 1. The function checks if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is not a prime number (i.e., it has any divisors other than 1 and itself), the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. Note that the function incorrectly returns `True` when `n` is 1, even though 1 is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 more gracefully, either by raising an error or returning a consistent value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the definition, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Conversely, a non-prime number (or composite number) has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.

- The function first checks if `n` is 1. Since 1 is not a prime number, it returns `True`.
- For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors because if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor less than or equal to its square root.
- If any number `i` in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
- If no such factor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical issue with the function. It should return `False` for prime numbers and `True` for non-prime numbers. The current implementation does the opposite. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
