Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the function `func_1`. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Handling of `n = 1`**:
   - The function returns `True` for `n = 1`. This is technically correct according to the problem description, which asks to identify non-prime numbers. Since 1 is not a prime number, returning `True` is appropriate.

2. **Checking for Non-Prime Numbers**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors. This is an efficient method to determine if a number is composite (non-prime).
   - If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Logical Issue**:
   - The function is designed to return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. However, the current implementation does the opposite. It returns `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers.
   - This is a critical logical error that contradicts the intended behavior of the function.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly points out that the function incorrectly returns `True` for `n = 1` and that it should handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1 more gracefully. However, the primary issue is the reversed logic in the return values.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical issue with the function. The function does indeed return the opposite of what is required, making it incorrect.

Final: **False**
