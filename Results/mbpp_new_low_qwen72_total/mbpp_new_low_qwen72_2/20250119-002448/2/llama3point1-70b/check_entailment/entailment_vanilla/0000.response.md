Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the definition, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Conversely, a non-prime number (or composite number) has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.

- The function first checks if `n` is 1. Since 1 is not a prime number, it returns `True`.
- For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors because if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor less than or equal to its square root.
- If any number `i` in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
- If no such factor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical issue with the function. It should return `False` for prime numbers and `True` for non-prime numbers. The current implementation does the opposite. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
