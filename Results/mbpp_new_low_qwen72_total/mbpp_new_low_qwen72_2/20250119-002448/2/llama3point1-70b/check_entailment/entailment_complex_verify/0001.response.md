Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. Let's break down the behavior of the function step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment:

1. **Initial Check for 1**:
   - The function starts by checking if `n` is 1. Since 1 is not a prime number, the function returns `True`.
   - This part of the function is correct according to the problem description, which states that 1 should be identified as a non-prime number.

2. **Loop to Check for Divisors**:
   - For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors because if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor less than or equal to its square root.
   - If any number `i` in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Return Statement After Loop**:
   - If no such factor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function should return `False` for prime numbers and `True` for non-prime numbers. However, the current implementation does the opposite. Therefore, the function is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The function `func_1` is incorrect because it returns `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers, which is the opposite of what is required by the problem description.
