Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n == 1`**: The function returns `True` when `n` is 1, which is incorrect because 1 is neither prime nor composite. The function should ideally return `False` or handle this case more gracefully.

2. **Return Value for Non-Prime Numbers**: The function correctly returns `True` if `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.

3. **Return Value for Prime Numbers**: The function correctly returns `False` if no divisors are found, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

4. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that `n` is an integer greater than 1, but it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1. While the problem description assumes valid inputs, it would be better to include input validation for robustness.

Given these points, the function is mostly correct in identifying non-prime numbers, but it has a critical issue with the handling of `n == 1`.

Correctness: **False**
