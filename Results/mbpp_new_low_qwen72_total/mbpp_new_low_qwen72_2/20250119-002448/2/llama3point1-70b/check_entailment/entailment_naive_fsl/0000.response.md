Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers that are not prime (i.e., numbers less than 2, and numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves). The function uses a loop that checks for divisors up to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The edge case of `n = 1` is also handled correctly by returning `True` since 1 is not a prime number. No counterexample can be found where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.
