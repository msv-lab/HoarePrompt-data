Reasoning: 

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment with the help of the annotations.

1. **Initial State**: The function `func_1(n)` is called with an integer `n` that is greater than 1 (as per the annotation).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function first checks if `n == 1`. If true, it returns `True`. This is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
   - After this check, the program continues only if `n > 1`.

3. **Loop for Divisor Check**:
   - The function then iterates over the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This is an efficient way to check for divisors because if `n` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding divisor less than or equal to its square root.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `n % i == 0`. If true, it means `n` is divisible by `i`, and thus `n` is not a prime number. The function returns `True` in this case.

4. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

5. **Annotated States**:
   - After the initial `if` block, the program state is that `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - After the `for` loop, if no divisors are found, the program state is that `n` is an integer greater than 1, and the function returns `False`.

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.
   - It handles the edge case of `n = 1` correctly.
   - It efficiently checks for divisors up to the square root of `n`.
   - No counterexamples are mentioned where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(n)` does indeed correctly identify non-prime numbers as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
