Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a logical issue with the function `func_1`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number (composite number) is a natural number greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.

2. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `n` is 1. Since 1 is not a prime number, returning `True` is correct in this case.

3. **Loop for Divisors**: For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors because if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding factor less than or equal to its square root.

4. **Divisibility Check**: If any number `i` in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

5. **No Divisors Found**: If no such factor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The issue identified in the original assessment is accurate: the function should return `False` for prime numbers and `True` for non-prime numbers. However, the current implementation does the opposite. Specifically:
- The function returns `True` when it should return `False` for prime numbers.
- The function returns `False` when it should return `True` for non-prime numbers.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct in identifying the logical issue.

Final: **False**
