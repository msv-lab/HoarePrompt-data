Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number is any number that has divisors other than 1 and itself. The function returns `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if it is prime.

1. **Initial Check for 1**: The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime number by returning `True`. This is consistent with the mathematical definition of prime numbers, which excludes 1.
2. **Loop to Check Divisibility**: The function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check for divisors. If any divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is non-prime.
3. **Return False if No Divisor Found**: If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is prime.

However, there is a logical issue in the function:
- The function returns `True` when `n` is 1, which is correct.
- The function also returns `True` if a divisor is found, which is correct.
- But, the function should return `False` if no divisors are found, which it does correctly.

The function is logically consistent with the problem description, but the name `func_1` and the return values might be confusing. Typically, a function to identify non-prime numbers would return `True` for non-prime and `False` for prime, which this function does correctly.

Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
