Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `n` is expected to be greater than 1. The function checks if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is not a prime number (i.e., it has any divisors other than 1 and itself), the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. Note that the function incorrectly returns `True` when `n` is 1, even though 1 is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 more gracefully, either by raising an error or returning a consistent value.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
