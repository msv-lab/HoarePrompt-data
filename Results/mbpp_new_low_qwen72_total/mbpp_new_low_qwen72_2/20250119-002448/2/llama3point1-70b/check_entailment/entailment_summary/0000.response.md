Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Handling of `n = 1`**: The function returns `True` for `n = 1`, which is correct according to the function's current logic, but it is not ideal because 1 is neither prime nor composite. It would be better to handle this case explicitly.
2. **Handling of `n <= 1`**: The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1. According to the problem description, the function should be designed to handle valid inputs greater than 1, but it would be more robust to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
3. **Logic for identifying non-prime numbers**: The function correctly identifies non-prime numbers by checking for divisors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Given these points, the function is mostly correct for the problem it is trying to solve, but it could be improved for better clarity and robustness.

Correctness: **False**

The function is not fully correct because it does not handle the edge case of `n = 1` and does not handle invalid inputs (`n <= 1`) gracefully. These improvements would make the function more robust and align better with the problem description.
