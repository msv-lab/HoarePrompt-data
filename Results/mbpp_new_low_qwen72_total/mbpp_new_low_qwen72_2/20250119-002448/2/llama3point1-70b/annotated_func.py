#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is not equal to 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `False` if no divisor is found.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `n` is expected to be greater than 1. The function checks if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is not a prime number (i.e., it has any divisors other than 1 and itself), the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. Note that the function incorrectly returns `True` when `n` is 1, even though 1 is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 more gracefully, either by raising an error or returning a consistent value.
