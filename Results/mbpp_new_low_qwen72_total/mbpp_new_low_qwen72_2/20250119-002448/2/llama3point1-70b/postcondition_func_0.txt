The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `n` is expected to be greater than 1. The function checks if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is not a prime number (i.e., it has any divisors other than 1 and itself), the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. Note that the function incorrectly returns `True` when `n` is 1, even though 1 is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 more gracefully, either by raising an error or returning a consistent value.
