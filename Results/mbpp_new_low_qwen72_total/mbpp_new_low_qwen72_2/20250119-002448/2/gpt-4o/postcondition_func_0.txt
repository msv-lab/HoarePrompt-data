The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `True`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is a non-prime or prime number, respectively.
