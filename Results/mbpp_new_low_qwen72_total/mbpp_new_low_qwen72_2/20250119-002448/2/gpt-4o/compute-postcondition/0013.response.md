To solve this, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is that `n` is an integer greater than 1. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. During each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function returns `True`.

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **`n`**: This variable remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable increments from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- **`n % i`**: This value changes with each iteration based on the current value of `i`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i`, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning `True`.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- The loop will not execute if `n` is 2 or 3, because `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will be 2, and the loop starts at `i = 2`.
- For `n >= 4`, the loop will execute at least once.

### Final Output State Calculation
- If `n` is a prime number, the loop will complete without finding any divisor other than 1 and `n` itself, and the function will implicitly return `None` (or the function will end without an explicit return statement).
- If `n` is not a prime number, the function will return `True` as soon as it finds a divisor.

### Final Output State
- **`n`**: Remains constant and is an integer greater than 1.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `None`.**
