The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer greater than 1. Based on the given output cases, the function returns `True` in four out of five scenarios and `False` in one scenario. However, without specific conditions for each case, it's only clear that there is at least one condition under which the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` greater than 1, and it returns `True` in most cases. There is one specific condition (not detailed here) under which it returns `False`.
