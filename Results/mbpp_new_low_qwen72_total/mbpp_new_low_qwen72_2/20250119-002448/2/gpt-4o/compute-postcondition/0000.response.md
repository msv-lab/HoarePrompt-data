Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, but the current value of n is less than or equal to 1*** 

However, there's a logical inconsistency here because the precondition states that `n` is an integer greater than 1, which contradicts the if condition `n <= 1`. Given this, the if condition would never be true under the given precondition, so the program would never enter the if block. Therefore, the postcondition should reflect that the if condition cannot be satisfied:

Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, and the if condition (n <= 1) is false***
