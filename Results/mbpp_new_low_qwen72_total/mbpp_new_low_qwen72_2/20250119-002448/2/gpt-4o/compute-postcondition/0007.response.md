The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `n % i` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still be such that `i` (now 3) is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 3.

Simplifying the condition for `n`:
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1 >= 3`
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 2`
- `math.sqrt(n) >= 2`
- `n >= 4`

So, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `n % i` is not equal to 0**
