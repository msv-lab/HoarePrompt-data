The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold, `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 4. If `n % i == 0`, the program returns True. Otherwise, `n % i` is not equal to 0 and the program does not return anything explicitly.**
