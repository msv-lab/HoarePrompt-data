To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if there is at least one value in the range `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The lower bound of the range is `2`.
   - The upper bound of the range is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the upper bound must be greater than or equal to the lower bound.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to `2`.
- Simplifying this condition:
  - `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1 >= 2`
  - `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 1`
  - Since `int(math.sqrt(n))` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, this means `math.sqrt(n) >= 1`.
  - Squaring both sides, we get `n >= 1`.

However, since the initial state already specifies that `n` is greater than 1, this condition is always satisfied.

### Initial State Adjustments:
- `i` must start at `2` for the loop to execute the first time.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already given).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2**
