Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `True`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is a non-prime or prime number, respectively. **

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `True`, which is an edge case not covered by the annotations but is handled by the code.
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a prime number by returning `False`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where `n` is a non-prime number by returning `True`.
