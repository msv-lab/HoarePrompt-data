### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. It should return `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if the number is prime.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1` because 1 and any number less than 1 are not prime.
   - This is consistent with the problem statement and the provided assertions.

3. **Prime Check**:
   - The function uses a loop from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` to check if `n` is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
   - If `n % i == 0` for any `i` in this range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - This is a correct approach for identifying non-prime numbers.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
   - This is also correct.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions test various cases:
     - `func_1(1)` should return `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(2)` should return `False` (correct).
     - `func_1(10)` should return `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(35)` should return `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(37)` should return `False` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the provided problem description and the execution states. All assertions pass, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
