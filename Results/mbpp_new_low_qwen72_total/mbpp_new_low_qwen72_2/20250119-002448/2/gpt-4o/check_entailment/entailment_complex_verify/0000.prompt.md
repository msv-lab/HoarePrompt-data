You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Annotated Code: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `True`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is a non-prime or prime number, respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is prime or not. The function returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, indicating that the number is non-prime. The test cases provided also pass, confirming the function's correctness for the tested inputs. No edge cases or logical errors are evident that would cause the function to fail.
