### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program, the annotations, and the original assessment to determine if the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers.

1. **Function Definition and Initial Checks:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `True`. This is correct because numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
   - The annotation correctly states that after the `if` block, `n` is an integer greater than 1.

2. **Loop to Check Divisibility:**
   - The function iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` in this range, the function returns `True`. This indicates that `n` is not a prime number.
   - The annotation correctly describes the state of the program after the loop: if no divisors are found, the function proceeds to the next step.

3. **Final Return Statement:**
   - If no divisors are found in the loop, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
   - The annotation correctly states that the function returns `False` if `n` is a prime number.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are:
     - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not prime).
     - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is prime).
     - `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not prime).
     - `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not prime).
     - `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is prime).

5. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.
   - The assessment mentions that the function returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which is correct.
   - The assessment also confirms that the function checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient method.
   - The test cases provided support the correctness of the function.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. The annotations and the original assessment are accurate. The function handles all edge cases and logical checks correctly, and the test cases confirm its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
