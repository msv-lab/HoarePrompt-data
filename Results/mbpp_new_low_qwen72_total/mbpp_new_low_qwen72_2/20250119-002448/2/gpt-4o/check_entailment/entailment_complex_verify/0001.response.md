Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers, where non-prime numbers should return `True` and prime numbers should return `False`.

### Analysis of the Program and Annotations:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n <= 1` by returning `True`. This is correct because 1 and any negative number are not prime.
   - The annotations correctly state that if `n <= 1`, the function returns `True`.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. This is a standard and efficient method to determine if a number is prime.
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program after the if block: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. If `n % i == 0` for any `i` in this range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are consistent with the expected behavior:
     - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
     - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
     - `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
     - `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
     - `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose of the function and the logic used to determine if a number is non-prime.
- The test cases provided in the original assessment are accurate and cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases and typical non-prime and prime numbers.
- The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at key points, supporting the correctness of the function.

### Final Decision:
Based on the analysis of the problem description, the program code, the annotations, and the test cases, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers as required.

Final: **True**
