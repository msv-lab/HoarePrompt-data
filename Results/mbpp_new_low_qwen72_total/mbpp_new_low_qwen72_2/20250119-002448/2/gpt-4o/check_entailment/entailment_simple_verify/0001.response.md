Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers, where a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`.

Let's break down the function and its behavior step by step:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Prime Numbers (n <= 1):**
   ```python
   if n <= 1:
       return True
   ```
   - This correctly identifies that any number less than or equal to 1 is not a prime number. Therefore, it returns `True` for these cases.

2. **Loop to Check Divisibility:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
       if n % i == 0:
           return True
   ```
   - This loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Final Return for Prime Numbers:**
   ```python
   return False
   ```
   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it means `n` is a prime number, and the function returns `False`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:** `n` is an integer.
- **State of the program after the if block has been executed:** If `n <= 1`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1.
- **State of the program after the for loop has been executed:** If `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`, the function returns `True`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided test cases. It correctly identifies non-prime numbers and returns `True` for them, while returning `False` for prime numbers.

Final: **True**
