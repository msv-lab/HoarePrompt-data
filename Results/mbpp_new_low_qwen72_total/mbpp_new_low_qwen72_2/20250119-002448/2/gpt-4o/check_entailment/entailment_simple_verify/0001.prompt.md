You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Annotated Code: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem description, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`.

- The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`, which are not prime numbers.
- For `n > 1`, the function checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it finds such a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The provided test cases also align with this logic:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

Given the reasoning and the test cases, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
