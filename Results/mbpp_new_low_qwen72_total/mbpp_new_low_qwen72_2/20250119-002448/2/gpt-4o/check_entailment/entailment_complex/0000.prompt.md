Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Annotated Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `True`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is a non-prime or prime number, respectively.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
