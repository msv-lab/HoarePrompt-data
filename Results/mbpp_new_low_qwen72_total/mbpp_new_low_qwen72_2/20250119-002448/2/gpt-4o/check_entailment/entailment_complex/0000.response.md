Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to determine if a given integer `n` is a non-prime number. It should return `True` if `n` is not a prime number and `False` if `n` is a prime number.

2. **Initial Check**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 by returning `True` immediately. This is correct because 1 and all negative numbers are not considered prime numbers.

3. **Prime Check**: For `n` greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors of `n`. If any number in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

4. **Final Return**: If no factors are found in the loop, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases (`1`, `2`, `10`, `35`, `37`) are consistent with the expected behavior of the function:
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, as 1 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, as 2 is a prime).
   - `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, as 10 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, as 35 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, as 37 is a prime).

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as `1` and the smallest prime number `2`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct in its implementation and behavior.

Correctness: **True**
