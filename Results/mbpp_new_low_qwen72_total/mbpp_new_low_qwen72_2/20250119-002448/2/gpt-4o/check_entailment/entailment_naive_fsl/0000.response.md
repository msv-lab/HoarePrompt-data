Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is prime or not. The function returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, indicating that the number is non-prime. The test cases provided also pass, confirming the function's correctness for the tested inputs. No edge cases or logical errors are evident that would cause the function to fail.
