Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem description, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`.

- The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`, which are not prime numbers.
- For `n > 1`, the function checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it finds such a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The provided test cases also align with this logic:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

Given the reasoning and the test cases, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
