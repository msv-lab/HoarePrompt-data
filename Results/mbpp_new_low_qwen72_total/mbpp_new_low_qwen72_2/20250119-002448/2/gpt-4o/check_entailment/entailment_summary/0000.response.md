Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, the function should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 1. Since 1 is not a prime number, returning `True` is correct.
2. **Prime Check**: For numbers greater than 1, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any number in this range divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
3. **Return Value**: If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The provided assertions test various cases:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

All these assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
