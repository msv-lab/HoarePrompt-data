Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `True`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is a non-prime or prime number, respectively.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
