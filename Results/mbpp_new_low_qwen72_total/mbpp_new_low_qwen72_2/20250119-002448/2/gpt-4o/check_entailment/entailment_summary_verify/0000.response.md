Reasoning: 

Let's break down the function and the provided assessment step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition and Initial Check:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `True`. This is correct because 1 is not considered a prime number, and any number less than 1 is not a valid candidate for primality (though typically, the domain of prime numbers is restricted to positive integers greater than 1).

2. **Prime Check Logic:**
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - During this iteration, if `n` is divisible by any number `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True`: Correct, as 1 is not a prime number.
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False`: Correct, as 2 is a prime number.
   - `func_1(10)` returns `True`: Correct, as 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5).
   - `func_1(35)` returns `True`: Correct, as 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7).
   - `func_1(37)` returns `False`: Correct, as 37 is a prime number.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers, with special handling for numbers less than or equal to 1.

5. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The function logic is sound, and the test cases provided confirm its correctness for the tested inputs. The function efficiently checks for non-prime numbers by only iterating up to the square root of `n`.

Final: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description and the provided test cases. The original assessment is accurate.
