Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is intended to identify non-prime numbers. Let's break down the function and the provided test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Function Behavior for `n <= 1`:**
   - The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`. This is correct because 1 is not considered a prime number, and any number less than 1 is not a valid input for prime checking but can be treated as non-prime for simplicity.

2. **Function Behavior for `n > 1`:**
   - The function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check for divisors.
   - If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, 1 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, 2 is a prime).
   - `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, 10 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, 35 is not a prime).
   - `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, 37 is a prime).

All the test cases provided align with the expected behavior of the function. The function correctly identifies non-prime and prime numbers based on the given logic.

4. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1` returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number and `False` if `n` is a prime number. This aligns with the implementation and the test cases.

Given the reasoning and the test cases, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
