Reasoning:
The function `func_1` effectively converts a list of string representations of numbers into integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list. The provided function summary confirms that the function correctly handles the conversion and sorting process. The key point of consideration is the output type. The original assessment correctly notes that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings. Therefore, returning a list of integers can be considered a valid solution.

The original assessment's conclusion that the function is correct under the assumption that the output type (list of integers) is acceptable is well-reasoned. Given the lack of specification in the problem description regarding the output type, the function meets the requirements of sorting the list of strings numerically.

Final: **True**
