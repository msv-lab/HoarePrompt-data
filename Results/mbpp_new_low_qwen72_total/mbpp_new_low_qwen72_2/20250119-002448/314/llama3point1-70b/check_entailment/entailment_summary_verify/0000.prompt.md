You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input, where each string represents a valid integer. It converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order, and returns this sorted list. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function assumes that all strings in the input list are valid representations of integers and does not handle invalid inputs or non-integer strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts the list of strings by converting each string to an integer and then sorting. However, it returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as required by the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, but the output should still be a list of strings. For example, for the input `['3', '12', '2']`, the function should return `['2', '3', '12']`, but it returns `[2, 3, 12]` instead.

End of Original Assessment
