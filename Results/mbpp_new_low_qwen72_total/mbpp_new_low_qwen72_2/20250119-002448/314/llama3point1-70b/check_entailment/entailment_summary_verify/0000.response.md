Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the expected output format and the actual output format of the function `func_1`. According to the problem description, the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, and the output should remain a list of strings. The function `func_1` converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and returns a list of integers, which does not meet the requirement of returning a list of strings.

To verify this, let's consider the function summary:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input.
- It converts each string to an integer.
- It sorts the resulting list of integers.
- It returns the sorted list of integers.

Given this, the function does not convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them. Therefore, the output format is incorrect.

For example, with the input `['3', '12', '2']`:
- The function converts the strings to integers: `[3, 12, 2]`.
- It sorts the integers: `[2, 3, 12]`.
- It returns the sorted list of integers: `[2, 3, 12]`.

The correct output should be `['2', '3', '12']`.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the output format.

Final: **False**
