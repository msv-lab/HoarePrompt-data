Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts the list of strings by converting each string to an integer and then sorting. However, it returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as required by the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, but the output should still be a list of strings. For example, for the input `['3', '12', '2']`, the function should return `['2', '3', '12']`, but it returns `[2, 3, 12]` instead.
