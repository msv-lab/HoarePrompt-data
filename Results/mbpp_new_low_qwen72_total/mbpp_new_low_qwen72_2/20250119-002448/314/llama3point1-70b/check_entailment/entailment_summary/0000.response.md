Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer, and sort these integers numerically. The function uses a list comprehension to convert each string to an integer and then applies the `sorted` function to sort the integers. This approach is correct and aligns with the problem description, which requires sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically. The function also correctly handles an empty input list by returning an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as intended, converting strings to integers and sorting them correctly.

However, the function does not handle invalid inputs or non-integer strings, but this is noted in the execution summary and is not a requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the specified requirements and behaves correctly within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
