You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program: 
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers converted from the strings in `num_strings`. Each string in `num_strings` represents a valid integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts the list of strings by converting each string to an integer and then sorting. However, it returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as required by the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, but the output should still be a list of strings. For example, for the input `['3', '12', '2']`, the function should return `['2', '3', '12']`, but it returns `[2, 3, 12]` instead.

End of Original Assessment
