Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the expected output format (a list of strings) and the actual output format (a list of integers). The function `func_1` indeed converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list of integers. However, the problem description specifically states that the function should return a list of strings sorted numerically. Therefore, the function as written does not meet the requirements of the problem because it returns integers instead of strings.

To align with the problem description, the function should convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them. This would ensure that the output is a list of strings, even though they are sorted numerically.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
