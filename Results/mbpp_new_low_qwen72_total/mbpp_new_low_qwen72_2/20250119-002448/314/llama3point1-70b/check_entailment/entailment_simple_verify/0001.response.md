Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` correctly converts each string in the input list `num_strings` to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns the sorted list. The annotated code confirms that the function operates as intended, with each step being correctly executed.

The original assessment accurately notes that the function returns a list of integers, which might not match the expected output format if the problem specifically requires a list of strings. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings, it is reasonable to assume that a list of integers is acceptable.

The original assessment is therefore accurate in its reasoning and conclusion. The function correctly sorts the list of strings numerically, and the output format (list of integers) is not specified as a requirement in the problem description.

Final: **True**
