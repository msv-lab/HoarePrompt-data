Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings that represent numbers (`num_strings`) and converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension. It then sorts the resulting list of integers using the `sorted` function. The sorted list of integers is returned.

This approach correctly handles the conversion and sorting of the numeric strings. However, the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings, which might not match the expected output format if the problem requires the sorted numbers to be in string form.

If the requirement is strictly to sort the list of strings numerically (regardless of the output type), the function is correct. If the output must be a list of strings, the function would need to convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them.

Given the problem statement does not specify the required output type, we assume that returning a list of integers is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
