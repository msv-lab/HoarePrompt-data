Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function. The problem description requires the function to return a list of strings sorted numerically, but the provided function `func_1` returns a list of integers. This means that while the function correctly sorts the numbers numerically, it does not adhere to the requirement of returning a list of strings. Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the problem specification.

Final: **False**
