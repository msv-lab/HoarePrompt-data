Reasoning:
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer, and converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension. It then sorts the resulting list of integers using the `sorted` function and returns this sorted list.

Based on the annotated code and the problem description, the function correctly converts the strings to integers and sorts them numerically. The function assumes valid inputs and does not handle invalid cases, which is reasonable given the problem statement does not specify how to handle such cases.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings. Given this ambiguity, the function is considered correct as it meets the primary requirement of sorting the numeric strings numerically.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in concluding that the function is correct under the assumption that returning a list of integers is acceptable.

Final: **True**
