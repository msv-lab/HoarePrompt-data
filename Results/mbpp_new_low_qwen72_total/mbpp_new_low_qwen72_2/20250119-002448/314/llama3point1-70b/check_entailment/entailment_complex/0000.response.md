Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly performs the task as described in the problem statement. It takes a list of strings, where each string is a valid representation of an integer, converts these strings to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, which is the expected behavior. The comments also confirm that the function works as intended and does not need to handle invalid inputs, which aligns with the problem's assumptions.

Correctness: **True**
