Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`), where each string represents a valid integer. It converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers. The function correctly performs the task of sorting the list of strings numerically by converting them to integers before sorting.

The comments indicate that the input is a list of strings where each string represents a valid integer, and the output is a sorted list of integers. This matches the problem description, which asks to sort a list of strings of numbers numerically.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided comments.

Correctness: **True**
