Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string. The logic is broken down into several cases:

1. **Character Not Found**: If the character `char` is not found in the string `s` (i.e., `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1), the function correctly returns the original string `s`.

2. **Single Occurrence**: If `char` appears only once in `s`, the function correctly identifies this and removes it by using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is appropriate because there is only one occurrence to remove.

3. **Multiple Occurrences**: If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function correctly identifies the first and last occurrences and constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of `s` that exclude these occurrences.

However, there is a potential issue with the code formatting and syntax in the provided program. Specifically, the line:

```python
return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
```

is missing a closing parenthesis at the end. This is a syntax error that would prevent the function from running correctly.

Additionally, the function should handle the case where `char` is an empty string, but the problem description assumes valid inputs, so we can assume `char` will always be a single character.

Given the above points, the function logic is correct, but the syntax error must be fixed for the function to work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (due to the syntax error)
