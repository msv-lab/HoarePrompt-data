Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence. These methods return `-1` if the character is not found.
2. **Checking for Occurrences**: If both the first and last occurrences are found (i.e., they are not `-1`), the function proceeds to handle the removal.
3. **Single Occurrence**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
4. **Multiple Occurrences**: If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude the first and last occurrences.
5. **No Occurrence**: If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string unchanged.

This logic correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
