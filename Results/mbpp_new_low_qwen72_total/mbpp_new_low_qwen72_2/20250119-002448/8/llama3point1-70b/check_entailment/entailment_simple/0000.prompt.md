Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)

last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. Since `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, only one instance of `char` exists in `s`, and this instance is removed.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string constructed by removing the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. The part of `s` before the first occurrence of `char` is concatenated with the part of `s` between the first and last occurrences of `char` (excluding the first occurrence), and then concatenated with the part of `s` after the last occurrence of `char`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's', which is a string where either the first occurrence or the last occurrence of the character 'char' is not found, indicated by `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` being -1.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
