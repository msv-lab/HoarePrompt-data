Reasoning:

The function `func_1` aims to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character `char` is not present in the string `s`. In this case, the function correctly returns the original string `s`.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it means there is only one occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. The function correctly removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are different, it means there are multiple occurrences of `char` in the string `s`. The function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring before the first occurrence.
     - Concatenating it with the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding the first occurrence).
     - Concatenating it with the substring after the last occurrence.

The logic and implementation appear to be correct based on the problem description and the provided comments.

Correctness: **True**
