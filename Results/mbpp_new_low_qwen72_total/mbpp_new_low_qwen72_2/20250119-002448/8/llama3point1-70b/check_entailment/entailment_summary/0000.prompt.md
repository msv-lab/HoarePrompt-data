Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

# Program:
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string based on the following conditions:
1. If `char` does not exist in `s` or exists only once, the function returns `s` unchanged.
2. If `char` exists exactly once in `s`, the function removes this single occurrence of `char` and returns the modified string.
3. If `char` exists more than once in `s`, the function removes both the first and the last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `s.find('')` and `s.rfind('')` will not behave as expected (they would find the empty string at every position).
- If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` and the first and last occurrences are adjacent, the function will still remove both occurrences and return the correct result.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
