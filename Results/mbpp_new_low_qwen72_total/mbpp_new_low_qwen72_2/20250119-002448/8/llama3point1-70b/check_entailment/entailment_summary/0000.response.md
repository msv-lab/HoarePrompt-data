Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly handles the removal of the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to locate the last occurrence of `char`.
2. **Handling Non-Existent or Single Occurrence**:
   - If `char` does not exist in `s`, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be `-1`, and the function returns `s` unchanged.
   - If `char` exists exactly once, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be the same index. In this case, the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
3. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If `char` exists more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of `s` before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string.
   - If `char` is an empty string, the function returns `s` unchanged, which is the expected behavior since `s.find('')` and `s.rfind('')` are not meaningful.
   - If the first and last occurrences of `char` are adjacent, the function still correctly removes both occurrences.

Given these points, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
