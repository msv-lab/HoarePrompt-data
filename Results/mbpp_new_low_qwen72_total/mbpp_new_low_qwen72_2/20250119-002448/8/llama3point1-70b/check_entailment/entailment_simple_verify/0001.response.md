Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's analyze the function step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.
   - Both methods return `-1` if the character is not found.

2. **Checking for Occurrences**:
   - The condition `if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:` ensures that the character is present in the string at least once.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`, it means the character appears only once in the string.
   - The function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove this single occurrence. This is correct because `replace` with a count of 1 will remove only the first (and only) occurrence.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by:
     - Slicing the string up to but not including the first occurrence: `s[:first_occurrence]`.
     - Slicing the string from just after the first occurrence to just before the last occurrence: `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`.
     - Slicing the string from just after the last occurrence to the end: `s[last_occurrence + 1:]`.
   - These slices are concatenated to form the final string without the first and last occurrences of `char`.

5. **No Occurrence**:
   - If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.

The function correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. The annotations also confirm that the program behaves as expected in each scenario.

Final: **True**
