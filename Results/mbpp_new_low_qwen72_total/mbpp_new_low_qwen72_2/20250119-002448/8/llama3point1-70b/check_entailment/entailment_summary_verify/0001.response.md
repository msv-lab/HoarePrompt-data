Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence. Both methods return `-1` if the character is not found.
   - This part of the function is correct and handles the case where the character does not exist in the string.

2. **Checking for Occurrences**:
   - The condition `if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:` ensures that the character is present in the string at least once.
   - This check is necessary to avoid unnecessary operations when the character is not found.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove this single occurrence.
   - This approach is correct and efficient for removing a single occurrence.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude the first and last occurrences.
   - The slicing operation `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

5. **No Occurrence**:
   - If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string unchanged.
   - This is the correct behavior as specified in the problem description.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string, which is correct.
- **Empty Character**: If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `s.find('')` and `s.rfind('')` will not behave as expected. However, the problem description assumes valid inputs, so this edge case is not relevant.
- **Adjacent Occurrences**: If the first and last occurrences of `char` are adjacent, the function will still remove both occurrences and return the correct result.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior and handles all specified cases and edge cases.

Final: **True**
