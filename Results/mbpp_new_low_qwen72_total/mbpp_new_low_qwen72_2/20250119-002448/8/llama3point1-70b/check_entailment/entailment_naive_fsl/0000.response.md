Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same, but there are multiple occurrences of the character in the string. In such a case, the `s.replace(char, '', 1)` only removes the first occurrence, but the last occurrence remains. For example, if the input is `s = "aaba"` and `char = 'a'`, the expected output should be `"ab"`, but the function returns `"aba"`. This violates the requirement to remove both the first and last occurrences of the character.
