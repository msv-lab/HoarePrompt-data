#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)

last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. Since `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, only one instance of `char` exists in `s`, and this instance is removed.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string constructed by removing the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. The part of `s` before the first occurrence of `char` is concatenated with the part of `s` between the first and last occurrences of `char` (excluding the first occurrence), and then concatenated with the part of `s` after the last occurrence of `char`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's', which is a string where either the first occurrence or the last occurrence of the character 'char' is not found, indicated by `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` being -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string based on the following conditions:
1. If `char` does not exist in `s` or exists only once, the function returns `s` unchanged.
2. If `char` exists exactly once in `s`, the function removes this single occurrence of `char` and returns the modified string.
3. If `char` exists more than once in `s`, the function removes both the first and the last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `s.find('')` and `s.rfind('')` will not behave as expected (they would find the empty string at every position).
- If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` and the first and last occurrences are adjacent, the function will still remove both occurrences and return the correct result.
