The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. The function processes the string `s` based on the occurrences of `char` within `s`:

- **Case_1:** If there is exactly one occurrence of `char` in `s`, the function returns `s` with this single occurrence of `char` removed.
- **Case_2:** If there are at least two occurrences of `char` in `s`, the function returns a new string constructed by removing the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. This new string is formed by concatenating the parts of `s` before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the first occurrence), and after the last occurrence of `char`.
- **Case_3:** If `char` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once but the first or last occurrence cannot be determined (indicated by `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` being -1), the function returns the original string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string with the first occurrence of `char` removed if there is only one occurrence. If there are multiple occurrences, it returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. If `char` does not occur or occurs only once, it returns the original string `s`.**
