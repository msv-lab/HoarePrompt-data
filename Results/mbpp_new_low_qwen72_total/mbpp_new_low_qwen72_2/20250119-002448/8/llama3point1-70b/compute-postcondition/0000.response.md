The provided code snippet finds the first and last occurrence of a character `char` within the string `s` using the `find` and `rfind` methods, respectively. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. Similarly, the `rfind` method returns the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. These indices are stored in `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`.

Output State: **s is a string, char is a single character string, first_occurrence is the index of the first occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found), last_occurrence is the index of the last occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found)**
