Output State: **The program returns a new string constructed by removing the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. The part of `s` before the first occurrence of `char` is concatenated with the part of `s` between the first and last occurrences of `char` (excluding the first occurrence), and then concatenated with the part of `s` after the last occurrence of `char`.**
