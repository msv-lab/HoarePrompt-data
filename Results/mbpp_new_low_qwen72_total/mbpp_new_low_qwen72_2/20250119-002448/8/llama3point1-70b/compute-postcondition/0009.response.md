Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string based on the following conditions:
1. If `char` does not exist in `s` or exists only once, the function returns `s` unchanged.
2. If `char` exists exactly once in `s`, the function removes this single occurrence of `char` and returns the modified string.
3. If `char` exists more than once in `s`, the function removes both the first and the last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `s.find('')` and `s.rfind('')` will not behave as expected (they would find the empty string at every position).
- If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` and the first and last occurrences are adjacent, the function will still remove both occurrences and return the correct result. **
