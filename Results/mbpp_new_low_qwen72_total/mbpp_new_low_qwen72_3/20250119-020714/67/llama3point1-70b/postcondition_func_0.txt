The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). A proper divisor of `n` is any number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder, excluding `n` itself. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only added once to the sum. If `n` is 1, the function returns 0, as 1 has no proper divisors.
