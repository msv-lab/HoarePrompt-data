To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the state and the loop conditions:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `amicable_sum` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions.
- `num` is 2.
- If `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` while `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is 3. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0 or 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The loop variable `num` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop condition is that `num` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `num` should be incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because it defines the upper limit of the loop.
- `amicable_sum` does not change as it is not part of the loop head and is not affected by the loop iteration.

### New State:
- `num` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be 3.
- `n` remains a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.
- `amicable_sum` remains 0, 1, or 3 based on the initial conditions and the logic within the loop body (which is omitted).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0, 1, or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
