To determine the final output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior, track variable changes, and summarize its effects. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: `n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0.
- **Loop**: Iterates over `num` from 1 to `n`.
- **Conditions**:
  - `func_1(num) < n`
  - `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`
  - `num != func_1(num)`
- **Action**: If all conditions are met, `amicable_sum` is incremented by `num`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Variables that Change**:
  - `num` increments from 1 to `n`.
  - `amicable_sum` increases based on the conditions being met.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates from `num = 1` to `num = n`.
- For each `num`, the loop checks if `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
- If all conditions are true, `amicable_sum` is incremented by `num`.

### Verify Relationships
- The loop will execute `n` times, once for each value of `num` from 1 to `n`.
- `amicable_sum` will only increase if the conditions are met for any `num`.

### Final Output State
- After the loop finishes, `num` will have iterated from 1 to `n`.
- `amicable_sum` will be the sum of all `num` values that satisfy the conditions.

### Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes or Does Not Execute
- The loop will always execute `n` times because it iterates over a fixed range from 1 to `n`.
- `amicable_sum` will be 0 if no `num` satisfies the conditions.
- `amicable_sum` will be the sum of all `num` values that satisfy the conditions.

### Final Output State
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer.
- **`amicable_sum`**: The sum of all `num` values that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.**
