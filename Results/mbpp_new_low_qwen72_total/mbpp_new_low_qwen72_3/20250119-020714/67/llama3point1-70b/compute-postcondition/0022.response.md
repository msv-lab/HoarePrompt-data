Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). A proper divisor of `n` is any number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder, excluding `n` itself. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only added once to the sum. If `n` is 1, the function returns 0, as 1 has no proper divisors. **

Explanation:
- The function iterates over possible divisors from 1 to the square root of `n`.
- For each divisor `i`, if `i` divides `n` exactly (i.e., `n % i == 0`), it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors_sum`, unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
- Finally, the function returns `divisors_sum - n`, which is the sum of all proper divisors of `n`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 0, as 1 has no proper divisors.
- If `n` is a prime number, the function returns 1, since the only proper divisor of a prime number is 1.
- If `n` is a perfect square, the function ensures that the square root is only counted once in the sum.
