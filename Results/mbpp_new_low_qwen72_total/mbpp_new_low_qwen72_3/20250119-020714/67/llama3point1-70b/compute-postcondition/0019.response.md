Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` has iterated from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5)`, and `divisors_sum` is the sum of all unique divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) added together. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than 1. If `n` is 1, `divisors_sum` remains 0. For other values of `n`, `divisors_sum` accumulates the sum of pairs of divisors `(i, n // i)` for each `i` that divides `n` without a remainder, adding `i` only once if it is a perfect square divisor.**
