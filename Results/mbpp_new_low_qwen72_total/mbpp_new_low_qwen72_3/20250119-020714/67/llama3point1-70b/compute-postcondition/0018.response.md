Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such numbers exist within the range, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input `n` and only computes and returns the sum based on the specified conditions. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case 1:** If `n` is 1, the function will return 0 because there are no numbers between 1 and 1 (inclusive) that can satisfy the conditions.
- **Edge Case 2:** If `func_1` is not defined or does not behave as expected, the function may produce incorrect results or raise exceptions. The behavior of `func_1` is crucial for the correctness of `func_2`.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will not execute the loop and will return 0. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
