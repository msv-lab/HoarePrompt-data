The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1, and `num` should start at 1.

Given that `n` is already stated as a positive integer, it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. The initial state of `num` is 1 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0, `num` is 1**
