The code `amicable_sum += num` increments the value of `amicable_sum` by the current value of `num`. Given the initial state, `num` is 1, so `amicable_sum` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `amicable_sum` is now 1 (since it was initially 0 and has been incremented by `num`, which is 1)
- `num` is 1
- The result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`
- `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num`
- `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 1, `num` is 1, the result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`, `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num`, and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`**
