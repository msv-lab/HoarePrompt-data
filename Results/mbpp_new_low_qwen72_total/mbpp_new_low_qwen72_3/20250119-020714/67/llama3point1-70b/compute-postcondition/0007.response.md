The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `num` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 0 or 1 (depending on the conditions specified), and `num` is 2. If `func_1(num)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` while `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.**
