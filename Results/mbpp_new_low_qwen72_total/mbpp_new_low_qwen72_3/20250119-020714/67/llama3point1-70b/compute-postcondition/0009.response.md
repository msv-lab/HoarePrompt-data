Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is either 0, 2, or 3 depending on the initial conditions and the evaluation of the if condition. `num` is 2. If `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is 3. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` is 0 or 2.***
