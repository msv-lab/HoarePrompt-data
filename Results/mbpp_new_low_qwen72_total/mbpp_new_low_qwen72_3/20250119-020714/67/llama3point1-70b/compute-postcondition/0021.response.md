The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function calculates the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that were found during the iteration from 1 to `n`, and then returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, and returns the value of the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) minus `n`.**
