The value of `amicable_sum` is incremented by the value of `num`. Given that `num` is 3, `amicable_sum` will be updated accordingly. The initial value of `amicable_sum` can be 0, 1, or 3, so after adding `num`, the new value of `amicable_sum` will be 3, 4, or 6, respectively. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 3, 4, or 6 depending on the initial conditions, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
