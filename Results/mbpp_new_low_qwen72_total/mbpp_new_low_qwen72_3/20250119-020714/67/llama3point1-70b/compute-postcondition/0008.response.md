The value of `amicable_sum` is incremented by the value of `num`. Given that `num` is 2, `amicable_sum` is increased by 2. The other conditions regarding `n`, `func_1(num)`, and the initial value of `amicable_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is 2 or 3 (depending on the initial conditions), `num` is 2. If `func_1(num)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` while `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is 3. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` is 2.**
