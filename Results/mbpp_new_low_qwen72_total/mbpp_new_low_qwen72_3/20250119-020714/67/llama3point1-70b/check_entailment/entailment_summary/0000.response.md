Reasoning:  
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles the edge case where `n` is a perfect square by adding the square root only once. The function works as expected and provides the necessary functionality to identify amicable pairs.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function aims to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a given limit `n`. It iterates through each number from 1 to `n` and checks if it forms an amicable pair with another number. Specifically, it checks if the sum of proper divisors of `num` (calculated by `func_1(num)`) is less than `n`, and if the sum of proper divisors of this result equals `num` (i.e., they form an amicable pair), and finally ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors. If these conditions are met, `num` is added to the sum of amicable numbers. The function correctly implements the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the problem description of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

Correctness: **True**
