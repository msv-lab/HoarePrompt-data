Reasoning: 

Let's break down the analysis of the provided program and the original assessment step by step:

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
1. **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n`.
2. **Logic**:
   - The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
   - For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors_sum` if `i * i != n` (to avoid double-counting the square root if `n` is a perfect square).
   - Finally, it subtracts `n` itself from `divisors_sum` to exclude `n` from the sum of its proper divisors.

This logic is correct and efficiently calculates the sum of proper divisors.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
1. **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Logic**:
   - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - For each number `num`, it first checks if `func_1(num) < n` (ensuring the sum of proper divisors is within the range).
   - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` to ensure `num` and `func_1(num)` are an amicable pair.
   - If both conditions are met, `num` is added to `amicable_sum`.

This logic correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers up to `n`.

### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is correct and explains the logic behind both functions.
- The assessment notes that the program handles the necessary calculations and edge cases correctly.

### Evaluation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors. The loop iterates up to the square root of `n` and correctly accounts for pairs of divisors, ensuring efficiency and correctness.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function correctly identifies amicable numbers by checking the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. It sums these numbers accurately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions work as intended, and the program correctly sums all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified number `n`.

Final: **True**
