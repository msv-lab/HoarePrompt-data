Reasoning:

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Loop Analysis**:
  - The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is efficient for finding divisors.
  - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
  - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum of divisors, unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.
- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors.
  - However, there is a potential issue with the subtraction of `n` at the end. Since `n` is not included in the sum of divisors, subtracting `n` again would incorrectly reduce the sum. This is a minor logical error.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Loop Analysis**:
  - It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - For each number `num`, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors using `func_1(num)`.
  - It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors of this result (i.e., `func_1(func_1(num))`) equals the original number `num`, and also ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors.
  - If both conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to the sum of amicable numbers.
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers within the given range.
  - However, the issue in `func_1` could affect the results if `func_1(num)` is calculated incorrectly due to the extra subtraction of `n`.

### Verification:
- **Function 1**:
  - The subtraction of `n` at the end of `func_1` is incorrect. The correct implementation should not subtract `n` from the sum of divisors.
- **Function 2**:
  - The logic in `func_2` is correct, but it relies on the correct output from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is a minor error in `func_1` that needs to be fixed. Without fixing this, the program may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Final: **False**
