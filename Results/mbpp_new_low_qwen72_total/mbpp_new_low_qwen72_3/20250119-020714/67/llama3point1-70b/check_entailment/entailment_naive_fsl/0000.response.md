Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number, and `func_2` uses this to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. The logic in both functions appears to handle the necessary calculations correctly:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` by iterating only up to the square root of `n` and accounting for both divisors in a pair. It subtracts `n` itself from the sum to ensure only proper divisors are considered.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks if each number has an amicable pair within the range, and sums these numbers if they are amicable. The condition `if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num)` ensures that the numbers are indeed amicable and not the same.

The program seems to handle all edge cases and works as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
