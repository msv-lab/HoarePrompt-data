Reasoning:

1. **`func_1(n)`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each divisor `i` found, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that all proper divisors are accounted for.
   - The special case where `i * i == n` (i.e., `n` is a perfect square) is handled correctly by adding `i` only once to avoid double-counting.
   - The function returns `divisors_sum - n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum of divisors, which is the definition of a proper divisor sum.

2. **`func_2(n)`**:
   - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number `num` has an amicable pair.
   - The condition `if func_1(num) < n` ensures that the potential amicable pair is within the range of interest.
   - The condition `if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num)` correctly identifies amicable pairs. This ensures that `num` and `func_1(num)` are distinct and that the sum of proper divisors of `func_1(num)` equals `num`.
   - The function sums all such `num` values that satisfy the amicable pair conditions.

Based on the above reasoning, both functions appear to correctly implement the required logic and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
