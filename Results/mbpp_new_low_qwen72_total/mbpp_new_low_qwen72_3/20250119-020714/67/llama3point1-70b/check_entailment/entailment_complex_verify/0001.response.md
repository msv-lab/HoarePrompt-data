Reasoning:

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Correctness**: The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Efficiency**: The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient way to find divisors.
- **Handling Perfect Squares**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only added once to the sum.
- **Subtraction of `n`**: After summing the divisors, the function subtracts `n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Iterating Through Range**: The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Checking Amicable Numbers**: For each number `num`, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors using `func_1(num)`.
- **Conditions for Amicable Numbers**:
  - `func_1(num) < n`: This condition ensures that the sum of proper divisors of `num` is less than `n`.
  - `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`: This condition checks if the sum of proper divisors of the sum of proper divisors of `num` equals `num`.
  - `num != func_1(num)`: This condition ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors, which is necessary for `num` to be an amicable number.
- **Summing Amicable Numbers**: If all conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to the sum of amicable numbers.

### Verification:
- **Logical Correctness**: Both functions logically follow the steps required to identify and sum amicable numbers.
- **Edge Cases**: The functions handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 (which has no proper divisors, so `func_1(1)` returns 0).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It accurately identifies and sums all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number `n`.

Final: **True**
