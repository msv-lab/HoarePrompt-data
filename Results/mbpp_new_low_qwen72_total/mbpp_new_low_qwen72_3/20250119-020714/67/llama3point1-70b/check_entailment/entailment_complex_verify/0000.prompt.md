You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` has iterated from 1 to `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that were found during the iteration from 1 to `int(n)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). A proper divisor of `n` is any number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder, excluding `n` itself. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only added once to the sum. If `n` is 1, the function returns 0, as 1 has no proper divisors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, and `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such numbers exist within the range, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input `n` and only computes and returns the sum based on the specified conditions.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number, and `func_2` uses this to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. The logic in both functions appears to handle the necessary calculations correctly:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` by iterating only up to the square root of `n` and accounting for both divisors in a pair. It subtracts `n` itself from the sum to ensure only proper divisors are considered.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks if each number has an amicable pair within the range, and sums these numbers if they are amicable. The condition `if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num)` ensures that the numbers are indeed amicable and not the same.

The program seems to handle all edge cases and works as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
