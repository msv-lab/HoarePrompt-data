Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement: summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is efficient for finding divisors.
- For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`. If it is, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum of divisors, unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
- Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- This function sums all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- For each number `num`, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors using `func_1(num)`.
- It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors of this result (i.e., `func_1(func_1(num))`) equals the original number `num`, and also ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors.
- If both conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to the sum of amicable numbers.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers within the given range.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
