Reasoning: 

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by adding the square root only once.
   - The function returns the sum of all proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), which is accurate based on the problem's requirements.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a given number `n`.
   - An amicable pair consists of two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.
   - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number `num` forms an amicable pair with another number.
   - The conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)` ensure that:
     - `num` and `func_1(num)` are both less than or equal to `n`.
     - `func_1(num)` and `func_1(func_1(num))` form an amicable pair.
     - `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)` to avoid counting the same number twice.
   - The function correctly sums all such `num` values and returns the result.

Given the above analysis, both functions appear to be implemented correctly and meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
