You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such numbers exist within the range, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input `n` and only computes and returns the sum based on the specified conditions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement: summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is efficient for finding divisors.
- For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`. If it is, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum of divisors, unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
- Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- This function sums all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- For each number `num`, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors using `func_1(num)`.
- It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors of this result (i.e., `func_1(func_1(num))`) equals the original number `num`, and also ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors.
- If both conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to the sum of amicable numbers.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers within the given range.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
