Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the functions and their interactions step by step.

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Logic**:
  - The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is efficient for finding divisors.
  - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
  - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum of divisors, unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to exclude `n` itself.

#### Potential Issues:
- The subtraction of `n` at the end is unnecessary because `n` is never added to `divisors_sum` in the first place. This means the function is actually returning the sum of all divisors including `n` itself, which is incorrect for the purpose of finding proper divisors.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Logic**:
  - It iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - For each number `num`, it calculates the sum of its proper divisors using `func_1(num)`.
  - It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors of this result (i.e., `func_1(func_1(num))`) equals the original number `num`, and also ensures that `num` is not equal to its own sum of proper divisors.
  - If both conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to the sum of amicable numbers.

#### Potential Issues:
- Since `func_1` is incorrectly calculating the sum of proper divisors (it includes `n` itself), `func_2` will not correctly identify amicable numbers.

### Corrected Function 1:
To fix the issue in `func_1`, we should remove the subtraction of `n` at the end and ensure that `n` itself is not included in the sum of divisors.

```python
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n
```

However, the correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 1  # Start with 1, as it is always a proper divisor
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors_sum += i
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += n // i
    return divisors_sum
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issue in `func_1`, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program as written will not correctly identify amicable numbers because `func_1` is not correctly calculating the sum of proper divisors.

Final: **False**
