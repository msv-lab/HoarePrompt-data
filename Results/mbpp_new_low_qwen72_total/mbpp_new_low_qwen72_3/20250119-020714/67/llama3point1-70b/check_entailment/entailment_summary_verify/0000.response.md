### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n`.
- **Implementation**:
  - The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
  - For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the sum, ensuring that if `i` is a perfect square, it is only added once.
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` itself from the sum to exclude `n` as a proper divisor.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Implementation**:
  - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` (ensuring the sum of proper divisors is within the range).
  - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` to confirm that `num` and its corresponding sum of proper divisors form an amicable pair.
  - If the conditions are met, `num` is added to the `amicable_sum`.

#### Function Summary for `func_2`:
- The summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2`. It confirms that the function returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions:
  - `func_1(num) < n`
  - `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`
  - `num != func_1(num)`

### Evaluation:
1. **`func_1(n)`**:
   - The implementation correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors.
   - It handles the edge case where `i` is a perfect square by adding it only once.
   - The subtraction of `n` ensures that only proper divisors are considered.

2. **`func_2(n)`**:
   - The function correctly iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It applies the conditions to identify amicable pairs and sums them.
   - The conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)` are correctly implemented to ensure the numbers are amicable.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and handle the problem as described. The conditions for identifying amicable numbers are correctly applied, and the program works as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
