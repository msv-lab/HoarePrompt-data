You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the following conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such numbers exist within the range, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input `n` and only computes and returns the sum based on the specified conditions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number, and `func_2` uses this to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. The logic in both functions appears to handle the necessary calculations correctly:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` by iterating only up to the square root of `n` and accounting for both divisors in a pair. It subtracts `n` itself from the sum to ensure only proper divisors are considered.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks if each number has an amicable pair within the range, and sums these numbers if they are amicable. The condition `if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num)` ensures that the numbers are indeed amicable and not the same.

The program seems to handle all edge cases and works as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
