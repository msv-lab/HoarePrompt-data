Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`. If so, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum` unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only adds `i` once.
   - Finally, it returns `divisors_sum - n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum of divisors.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of all amicable numbers up to `n`.
   - It iterates over each number from 1 to `n`.
   - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` and if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
   - If these conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to `amicable_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns `amicable_sum`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for finding divisors in `func_1` is correct. It correctly sums the proper divisors of `n`.
   - The logic for identifying amicable numbers in `func_2` is also correct. It correctly checks the conditions for amicability and sums the amicable numbers.
   - The state comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, ensuring that the functions are used correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
