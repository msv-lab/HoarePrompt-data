Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. It initializes an array `max_products` to store the maximum product ending at each index. For each element in the array, it checks all previous elements to see if they form an increasing sequence. If they do, it updates the maximum product for the current index by multiplying the current element with the maximum product of the previous element. This ensures that the function correctly handles all cases, including arrays with negative numbers, zeros, and single-element arrays. The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs.
