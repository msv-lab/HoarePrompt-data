Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of that array.

# Program:
assert func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000
assert func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600
assert func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    max_products = [0] * n
    max_products[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_products[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
    return max(max_products)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum product of a subsequence of `arr` where the subsequence is strictly increasing. If `arr` is empty, the function returns 0. For non-empty lists, the function calculates the maximum product for each element in `arr` by considering all previous elements that are smaller than the current element and multiplying their maximum products by the current element. The final result is the maximum value from these calculated products. If no valid subsequence exists for an element, the element itself is considered as the maximum product. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
