Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the given array. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `max_products` where each element at index `i` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

2. **Base Case**: If the array is empty, the function returns 0, which is correct as there are no elements to form a product.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses a nested loop to iterate through the array. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`). If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, it means `arr[j]` can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`. The function then updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Final Result**: The function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.

The provided test cases also pass, confirming that the function works as expected for different scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
