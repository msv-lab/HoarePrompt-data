Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if the input array `arr` is empty and returns 0 if it is. This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is 0.

2. **Initialization**: The `max_products` list is initialized with zeros, and the first element is set to `arr[0]`. This is appropriate because the maximum product for the first element is the element itself.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element.
   - The inner loop checks all previous elements to find if they form an increasing subsequence with the current element.
   - If an increasing subsequence is found, the maximum product for the current element is updated to the maximum of its current value and the product of the maximum product of the previous element and the current element.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the loops, the function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which correctly represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.

The provided test cases also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
