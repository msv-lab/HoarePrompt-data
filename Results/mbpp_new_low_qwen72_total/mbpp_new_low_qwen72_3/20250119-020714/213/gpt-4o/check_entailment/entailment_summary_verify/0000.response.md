### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function and the provided function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `n` as the length of the input list `arr`.
   - It then initializes a list `max_products` of the same length as `arr`, with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr`.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The function iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it initializes `max_products[i]` to `arr[i]`.
   - It then iterates over all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

3. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list `arr` is empty by returning 0.
- For non-empty lists, the function calculates the maximum product for each element in `arr` by considering all previous elements that are smaller than the current element and multiplying their maximum products by the current element.
- The function ensures that the maximum product for each element is updated only if a valid increasing subsequence is found.
- The final result is the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the input list.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000`: The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[3, 100, 150]` with a product of `3 * 100 * 150 = 45000`. However, the test case provided is `3000`, which suggests a different subsequence `[3, 100, 150 / 5]`. This seems to be a mistake in the test case.
- `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600`: The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]` with a product of `4 * 42 * 55 * 68 * 80 = 50265600`. This test case is correct.
- `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460`: The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]` with a product of `10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 21780000`. This test case is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` is logically correct in terms of its implementation and the approach it uses to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence.
- However, the provided test cases contain errors. The first and third test cases do not match the expected results based on the function's logic.

### Final Evaluation:
- Despite the incorrect test cases, the function itself is implemented correctly according to the problem description and the function summary.
- Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
