Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence of the input list `arr`. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(arr)`: This correctly initializes the length of the input list.
   - `if (n == 0) : return 0`: This handles the edge case where the input list is empty, returning 0 as expected.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - `max_products = [0] * n`: This initializes a list to store the maximum product for each element in `arr`.
   - `max_products[0] = arr[0]`: This sets the first element of `max_products` to be the first element of `arr`, as there are no previous elements to consider for the first element.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - The inner loop iterates over all previous elements (`for j in range(i)`).
   - `if arr[j] < arr[i]`: This condition ensures that we only consider elements that form an increasing subsequence.
   - `max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])`: This updates the maximum product for the current element by considering the maximum product of the previous elements that are smaller than the current element.

4. **Final Result**:
   - `return max(max_products)`: This returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which contains the maximum product values for each element in `arr`.

Given the problem description and the state of the program, the function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence. The test cases provided also pass, further confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
