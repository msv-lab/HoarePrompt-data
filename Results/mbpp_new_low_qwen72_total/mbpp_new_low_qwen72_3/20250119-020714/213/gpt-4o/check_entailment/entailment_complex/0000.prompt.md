Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of that array.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000
assert func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600
assert func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, and `n` is greater than 0
    max_products = [0] * n

max_products[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_products[i] = arr[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, for each `i` from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or `arr[i]` if no such `j` exists. The loop executes `len(arr) - 1` times, assuming `len(arr) > 1`. If `len(arr) == 1`, the loop does not execute. Variables `arr` and `n` remain constant throughout the loop.
    return max(max_products)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`, which contains the maximum product values calculated for each element in `arr` based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum product of a subsequence of `arr` where the subsequence is strictly increasing. If `arr` is empty, the function returns 0. For non-empty lists, the function calculates the maximum product for each element in `arr` by considering all previous elements that are smaller than the current element and multiplying their maximum products by the current element. The final result is the maximum value from these calculated products. If no valid subsequence exists for an element, the element itself is considered as the maximum product. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
