### Reasoning:

#### Initialization:
- The initialization step sets `max_products[0]` to `arr[0]`, which is correct because the maximum product of a single element is the element itself.

#### Nested Loops:
- The outer loop iterates through each element of the array starting from the second element.
- The inner loop checks all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element.
- If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, it means `arr[j]` can be part of the increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.
- The product of the maximum product ending at `arr[j]` and `arr[i]` is compared with the current value of `max_products[i]` to update `max_products[i]` if necessary.

#### Final Result:
- The maximum value in the `max_products` list is returned, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.

### Test Cases Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000`
  - The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[3, 100, 150]` with a product of `3 * 100 * 150 = 3000`.
  - This test case passes, confirming the function's correctness for this input.

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600`
  - The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]` with a product of `4 * 42 * 55 * 68 * 80 = 50265600`.
  - This test case passes, confirming the function's correctness for this input.

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460`
  - The increasing subsequence with the maximum product is `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]` with a product of `10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 2460`.
  - However, this test case is incorrect. The correct maximum product should be `10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 21780000`.

### Conclusion:
The function is mostly correct, but there is an error in the third test case. The expected output for `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60])` should be `21780000`, not `2460`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
