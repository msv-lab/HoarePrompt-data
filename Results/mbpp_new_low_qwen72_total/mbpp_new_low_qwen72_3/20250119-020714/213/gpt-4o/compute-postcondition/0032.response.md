The code snippet `max_products[i] = arr[i]` updates the value of `max_products[i]` to `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is set to `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j` is set to `i - 1`, which is `len(arr)`.

However, since `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `i` is outside the bounds of the `arr` and `max_products` lists, which both have a length of `len(arr)`. Therefore, attempting to assign `arr[i]` to `max_products[i]` will result in an `IndexError`.

Given this, the code will raise an error before any changes can be made to the state. However, since the task requires listing the state after the code execution, and assuming the code does not raise an error (hypothetically), the only change would be to the value of `max_products[i]`.

Since `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, which is out of bounds, no actual assignment can take place, and the state remains unchanged except for the hypothetical assignment:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is `i - 1`.** 

Note: In practice, the code would raise an `IndexError` due to out-of-bounds access.
