Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `max_products[i]` is initially 0 (since `i` is outside the range of the list `arr` and `max_products`).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code attempts to set `max_products[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.
   - Since `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `arr[i]` and `max_products[i]` are both out of bounds. This will raise an `IndexError`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The code will raise an `IndexError` because `i` is out of bounds for both `arr` and `max_products`.
   - The values of `arr`, `n`, `max_products`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged up to the point of the error.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is 1, an `IndexError` is raised.**
