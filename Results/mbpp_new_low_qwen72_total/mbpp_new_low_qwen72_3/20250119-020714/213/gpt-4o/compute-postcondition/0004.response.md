The code initializes a list `max_products` with `n` elements, all set to 0, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. It then sets the first element of `max_products` to the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, and all other elements in `max_products` are 0**
