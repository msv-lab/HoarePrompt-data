Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, `max_products[1]` is set to `arr[0] * arr[1]`. Otherwise, `max_products[1]` remains `arr[1]`.***
