To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
  - `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
  - `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
  - For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
  - All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i)` is non-empty. This means `i` must be greater than 0.
3. **Given State of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
4. **Ensuring `i` is Greater Than 0**: Since `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `i` will always be greater than 0 as long as `arr` is a valid list (even if it is empty, `i` would be 1).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `i` must be greater than 0, which is guaranteed by `i` being `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j` will start at 0 and go up to `i - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is 0**.
