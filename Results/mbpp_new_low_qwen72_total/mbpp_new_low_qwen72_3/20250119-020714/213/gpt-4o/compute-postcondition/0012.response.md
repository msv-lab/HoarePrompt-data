The value of `max_products[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, this means `max_products[2]` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `max_products[1] * arr[2]`.

Since `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` (depending on the condition mentioned), the new value of `max_products[2]` will be:

- If `max_products[1]` is `arr[1]`, then `max_products[2]` becomes `max(0, arr[1] * arr[2])`.
- If `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]`, then `max_products[2]` becomes `max(0, arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, `max_products[2]` is `max(0, max_products[1] * arr[2])`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, `max_products[2]` is `max(0, max_products[1] * arr[2])`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
