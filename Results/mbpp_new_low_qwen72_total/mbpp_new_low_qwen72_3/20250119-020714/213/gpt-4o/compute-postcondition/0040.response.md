The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) + 1` and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, while `i` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is 2. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, an `IndexError` is raised.**
