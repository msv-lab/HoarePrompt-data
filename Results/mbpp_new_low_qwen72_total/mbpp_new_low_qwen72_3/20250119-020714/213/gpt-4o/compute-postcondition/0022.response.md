The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` by taking the maximum between its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr)`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr)`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.
- `len(arr)` must be greater than 0.
- `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`.

The code snippet:
```
max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is `len(arr)`, which is the index just beyond the last element of `arr`.
2. `j` is `i - 1`, which is the index of the last element of `arr`.
3. `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, so `arr[i]` is greater than the last element of `arr`.
4. `max_products[i]` is initially 0 (since `i` is beyond the last index of `arr`).
5. The new value of `max_products[i]` is the maximum of its current value (0) and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

Since `max_products[j]` is the value at the last index of `max_products` (which is the same as `arr[j]` or a previously computed product), and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, the new value of `max_products[i]` will be `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `max_products[i]` is `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr)`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, `max_products[len(arr)]` is `max_products[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr)]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, `len(arr)` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`.**
