The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is `arr[1]`.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`.

Given these conditions, the value of `max_products[i]` before the code execution is `arr[1]` (since `i` is 1). The value of `max_products[j]` is `arr[0]` (since `j` is 0). The value of `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.

The expression `max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])` evaluates to `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])`.

Since `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, `arr[0] < arr[1]`, and thus `arr[0] * arr[1]` will be greater than `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is positive, or less than `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is negative. However, since `max` function returns the larger of the two values, `max_products[i]` will be set to `arr[0] * arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is positive, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `max_products[i]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]`.

The output state is:
**`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is `arr[0] * arr[1]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`**.
