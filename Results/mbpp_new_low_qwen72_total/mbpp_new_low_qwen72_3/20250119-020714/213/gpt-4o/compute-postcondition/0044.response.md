Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, for each `i` from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or `arr[i]` if no such `j` exists. The loop executes `len(arr) - 1` times, assuming `len(arr) > 1`. If `len(arr) == 1`, the loop does not execute. Variables `arr` and `n` remain constant throughout the loop.**
