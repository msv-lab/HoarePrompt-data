Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, `max_products[2]` is `max(max(0, max_products[1] * arr[2]), max_products[2] * arr[2])`. Otherwise, `max_products[2]` remains 0. All other elements in `max_products` remain 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2.***
