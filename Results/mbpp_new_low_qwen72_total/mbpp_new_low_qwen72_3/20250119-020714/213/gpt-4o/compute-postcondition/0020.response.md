To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr)`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr)`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(i)`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i)` is non-empty, meaning `i` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Initial State**: `i` is `len(arr)`.
- **Range Condition**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0.
- **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is `len(arr)`, and `len(arr)` is always a non-negative integer, the loop will execute if `len(arr) > 0`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 0. Given that `i` is `len(arr)`, the condition simplifies to `len(arr) > 0`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr)`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr)`, `j` is `i - 1`, and `len(arr)` must be greater than 0.**
