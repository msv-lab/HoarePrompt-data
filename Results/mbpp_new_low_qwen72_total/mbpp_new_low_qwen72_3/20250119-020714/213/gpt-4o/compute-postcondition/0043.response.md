To determine the final output state after the loop has completed its execution, we need to follow the steps outlined and analyze the provided loop and initial state.

### Initial State:
- `arr`: A list of integers.
- `n`: An integer greater than `len(arr) + 1`.
- `max_products`: A list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
  - `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
  - `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
  - For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i`: `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j`: `i - 1`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if arr[j] < arr[i]:
        max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - The condition `if arr[j] < arr[i]` checks if the element at index `j` in `arr` is less than the element at index `i` in `arr`.
   - If the condition is true, `max_products[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `max_products[j] * arr[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `arr` and `n` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `max_products` is updated based on the loop's logic.
   - `i` and `j` are not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `max_products[i]` for each valid `j` where `arr[j] < arr[i]`.
   - The loop will not execute if `i` is out of bounds for `arr`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop will not execute because `i` is set to `len(arr) + 1`, which is out of bounds for `arr`.
   - Therefore, the loop body will never be entered, and `max_products` will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- `arr`: Remains a list of integers.
- `n`: Remains greater than `len(arr) + 1`.
- `max_products`: Remains a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, where:
  - `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
  - `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
  - For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
  - All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i`: Remains `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j`: Remains `i - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is `len(arr)`.**
