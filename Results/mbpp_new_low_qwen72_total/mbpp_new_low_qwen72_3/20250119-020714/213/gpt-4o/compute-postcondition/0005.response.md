To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start its first iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Initial Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **State Requirements**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute).
   - `i` must be 1 at the start of the first iteration.
   - The other variables (`arr`, `max_products`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start, but they must be in the correct state for the loop to be meaningful.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 1**
