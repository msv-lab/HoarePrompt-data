To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is `arr[1]`.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop head is `for j in range(i)`.
2. The loop will execute if `range(i)` produces at least one value for `j`.
3. Since `i` is 1, `range(i)` will produce the sequence `[0]`.
4. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly once when `j` is 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be greater than 0. In this case, `i` is 1, which satisfies this condition.
- `j` will be 0 during the first execution of the loop.

### State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is `arr[1]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
