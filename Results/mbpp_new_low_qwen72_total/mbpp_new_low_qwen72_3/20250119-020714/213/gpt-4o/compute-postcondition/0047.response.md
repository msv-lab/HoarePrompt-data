Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum product of a subsequence of `arr` where the subsequence is strictly increasing. If `arr` is empty, the function returns 0. For non-empty lists, the function calculates the maximum product for each element in `arr` by considering all previous elements that are smaller than the current element and multiplying their maximum products by the current element. The final result is the maximum value from these calculated products. If no valid subsequence exists for an element, the element itself is considered as the maximum product. The function does not modify the input list `arr`. **

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Input Parameters**: The function accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers.
- **Return Value**: The function returns an integer. If `arr` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence of `arr`.
- **Final State**:
  - If `arr` is empty, the function returns 0.
  - If `arr` is non-empty, the function constructs a list `max_products` where each element at index `i` represents the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`. The function then returns the maximum value from this list.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty List**: If `arr` is an empty list, the function immediately returns 0.
  - **Single Element List**: If `arr` contains only one element, the function returns that element since it is the only possible subsequence.
  - **All Elements Negative**: If all elements in `arr` are negative, the function will return the largest negative number in `arr` because no positive product can be formed.
  - **No Increasing Subsequences**: If no strictly increasing subsequence exists (e.g., all elements are the same), the function will return the largest element in `arr`.

### Potential Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers. It assumes that the input is always a valid list of integers.
- The function does not check for the presence of zero in the list, which could affect the product calculations, especially if zero is part of the subsequence. However, the function's current logic handles this correctly by treating zero as a potential maximum product for elements that follow it.
