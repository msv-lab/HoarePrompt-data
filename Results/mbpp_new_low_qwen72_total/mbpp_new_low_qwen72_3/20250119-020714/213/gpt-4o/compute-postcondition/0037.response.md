To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
- `j` is 0.
- If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, the code would raise an index error if executed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i)` will iterate over the range from 0 to `i - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(arr) + 1`.
   - `j` is 0.
3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, the loop will execute `len(arr) + 1` times.
   - The variable `j` will be incremented from 0 to `i - 1` (which is `len(arr)`).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains `len(arr) + 1` because it is defined in the loop condition and does not change.
- `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr) + 1`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr) + 1`, `j` is 1.**
