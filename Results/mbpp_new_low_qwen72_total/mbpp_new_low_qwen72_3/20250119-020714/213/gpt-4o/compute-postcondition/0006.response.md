The value of `max_products[i]` is set to `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `max_products[1]` is now equal to `arr[1]`. All other elements in `max_products` remain unchanged, with the first element being `arr[0]` and the rest being 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is `arr[1]`, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is 1**
