The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The function has two possible return scenarios:

- **Case_1:** The function returns `0`.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`, which contains the maximum product values calculated for each element in `arr` based on certain conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and either return `0` or the maximum value from the list `max_products`, depending on the internal logic of the function.
