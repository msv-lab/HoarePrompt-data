To accurately determine the output state after all the executions of the given loop, let's follow the steps outlined in the instruction.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The provided loop is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if arr[j] < arr[i]:
        max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```
This loop is designed to update the `max_products` list based on the conditions specified. The initial state is:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr)`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr)`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `arr`: This list remains unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `n`: This variable is greater than `len(arr)` and does not affect the loop directly.
- **Variables that Change**:
  - `max_products`: This list is updated based on the conditions within the loop.
  - `i`: This variable is used to control the outer loop and is initially set to `len(arr)`.
  - `j`: This variable is used to iterate through the inner loop and is reset to 0 for each iteration of the outer loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1` and updates `max_products[i]` if the condition `arr[j] < arr[i]` is met. However, since `i` is initially set to `len(arr)`, the loop will attempt to access `max_products[i]` and `arr[i]`, which are out of bounds. This would normally cause an `IndexError`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the loop will not execute because `i` is out of bounds. Therefore, no changes will be made to `max_products` beyond its initial state.

### Final Output State
Since the loop does not execute due to the out-of-bounds error, the final state of the variables will be the same as the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is greater than `len(arr)`.
- `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists.
- All other elements in `max_products` are 0.
- `i` is `len(arr)`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `len(arr)`, `max_products` is a list of integers with the same length as `arr`, `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, `max_products[1]` is either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] * arr[1]` depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than `arr[1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `len(arr) - 1`, `max_products[i]` is the maximum value of `max_products[j] * arr[i]` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i` and `arr[j] < arr[i]`, or 0 if no such `j` exists, all other elements in `max_products` are 0, `i` is `len(arr)`, `j` is `i - 1`.**
