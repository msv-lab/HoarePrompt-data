The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum product of a subsequence of `arr` where the subsequence is strictly increasing. If `arr` is empty, the function returns 0. For non-empty lists, the function calculates the maximum product for each element in `arr` by considering all previous elements that are smaller than the current element and multiplying their maximum products by the current element. The final result is the maximum value from these calculated products. If no valid subsequence exists for an element, the element itself is considered as the maximum product. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
