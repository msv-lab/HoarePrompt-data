Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty. According to the problem description, the function should find the depth of a dictionary. An empty dictionary should have a depth of 0, but the current implementation returns 1 for an empty dictionary. This is incorrect.

Example of a failing case:
```python
assert func_1({}) == 0  # Expected output: 0, Actual output: 1
```
