Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program: the function `func_1` returns 1 for an empty dictionary, whereas it should return 0 according to the typical understanding of the depth of a dictionary. However, the problem description does not explicitly specify what the depth of an empty dictionary should be. Without this explicit specification, it's reasonable to interpret that the function could return 1 for an empty dictionary, as it might be considered a "shallow" structure.

However, considering the common convention in data structures, where the depth of an empty collection is often defined as 0, the original assessment's point is valid. The function should indeed return 0 for an empty dictionary to align with this convention.

Given the context and the typical definition of depth in nested structures, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out the issue with the current implementation.

Final: **False**
