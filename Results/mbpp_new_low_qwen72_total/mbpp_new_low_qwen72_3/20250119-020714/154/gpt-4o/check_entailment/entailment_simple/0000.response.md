Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. This is because an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary value is considered to have a depth of 1.
2. If the input `d` is a non-empty dictionary, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This ensures that the function correctly accounts for the deepest level of nesting.

However, there is a minor issue in the base case of the function. The base case should return 0 instead of 1 when the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary. This is because the depth of a non-dictionary value or an empty dictionary should be considered 0, not 1. Returning 1 would incorrectly add an extra level to the depth calculation.

Given the current implementation, the function will return incorrect results for certain cases, such as an empty dictionary or a dictionary containing non-dictionary values.

Correctness: **False**
