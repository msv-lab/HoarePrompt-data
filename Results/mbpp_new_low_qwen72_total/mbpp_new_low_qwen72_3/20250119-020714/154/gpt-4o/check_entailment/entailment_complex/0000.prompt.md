Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2
assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary, possibly nested, with non-cyclic references.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. The exact value depends on the contents of `d` and the implementation of `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` (which can be nested but must not contain cyclic references) as input and returns an integer. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from recursively applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. This effectively computes the depth of the deepest nested dictionary structure within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is an empty dictionary, a non-dictionary type, or contains only non-dictionary values, in which case the function will return 1.
