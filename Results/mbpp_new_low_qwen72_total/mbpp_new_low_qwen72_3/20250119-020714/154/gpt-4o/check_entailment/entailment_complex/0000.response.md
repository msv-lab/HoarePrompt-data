Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to compute the depth of a nested dictionary. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. This is because an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input is considered to have a depth of 1.
2. **Recursive Case**: If the input `d` is a non-empty dictionary, the function recursively calls itself on each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth of these recursive calls. This correctly calculates the depth of the deepest nested dictionary.

Let's analyze the test cases:

- `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})`:
  - The depth of `{'a': 1}` is 1.
  - The depth of `{'c': {'d': {}}}` is 3 (1 for `'c'`, 1 for `'d'`, and 1 for the innermost empty dictionary).
  - The maximum depth among the values is 3, so the function returns 1 + 3 = 4.
  - This matches the expected output.

- `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}})`:
  - The depth of `{'a': 1}` is 1.
  - The depth of `{'c': 'python'}` is 1 (since `'python'` is not a dictionary).
  - The maximum depth among the values is 1, so the function returns 1 + 1 = 2.
  - This matches the expected output.

- `func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}})`:
  - The depth of `{1: 'Sun'}` is 1.
  - The depth of `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}` is 3 (1 for `3`, 1 for `4`, and 1 for `'Mon'`).
  - The maximum depth among the values is 3, so the function returns 1 + 3 = 3.
  - This matches the expected output.

All test cases pass, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
