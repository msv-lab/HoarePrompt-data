Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the maximum number of levels of nesting within the dictionary.

- The base case of the recursion is when the input is either not a dictionary or an empty dictionary, in which case the function returns 1. This is because a non-dictionary or an empty dictionary has no further nesting and thus has a depth of 1.
- For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level found in any of its values.

Let's analyze the test cases:

1. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`:
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'d': {}}` is 2 (1 for `'d'` and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'c': {'d': {}}}` is 3 (1 for `'c'`, 1 for `'d'`, and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` is 4 (1 for `'a'`, 1 for `'b'`, 1 for `'c'`, and 1 for `'d'`).

2. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}`:
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `'python'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'c': 'python'}` is 2 (1 for `'c'` and 1 for `'python'`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` is 2 (1 for `'a'` and 1 for `'b'`).

3. `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}`:
   - The depth of `'Sun'` is 1.
   - The depth of `'Mon'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{4: 'Mon'}` is 2 (1 for `4` and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}` is 3 (1 for `3`, 1 for `4`, and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` is 3 (1 for `1`, 1 for `2`, and 1 for `3`).

All test cases are correctly handled by the function, so the program is correct.
