### Reasoning:

The original assessment points out that the function `func_1` incorrectly returns 1 for an empty dictionary, whereas it should return 0 according to the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Behavior Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the input `d` is not a dictionary or if it is empty. If either condition is true, it returns 1.
   - If `d` is a non-empty dictionary, it recursively calls itself on each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among these values.

2. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` for non-empty dictionaries and non-dictionary inputs.
   - However, it does not explicitly address the edge case of an empty dictionary, which is crucial for the problem description.

3. **Original Assessment Validation:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that an empty dictionary should have a depth of 0, but the function currently returns 1.
   - This discrepancy means that the function does not fully meet the problem description requirements.

4. **Failing Case:**
   - The provided failing case `assert func_1({}) == 0` clearly demonstrates that the function does not handle an empty dictionary correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not handle the case of an empty dictionary correctly, which violates the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
