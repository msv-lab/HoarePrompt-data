Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary, where the depth is defined as the maximum number of levels of nesting within the dictionary. Let's break down the function and the provided test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Base Case:**
   - If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. This is because an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary has no further nesting and thus has a depth of 1.
   - The condition `if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:` checks if `d` is not a dictionary or if it is an empty dictionary. If either condition is true, the function returns 1.

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary using a generator expression `(func_1(value) for value in d.values())`.
   - It then returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level found in any of its values.

### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1: `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`**
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'d': {}}` is 2 (1 for `'d'` and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'c': {'d': {}}}` is 3 (1 for `'c'`, 1 for `'d'`, and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` is 4 (1 for `'a'`, 1 for `'b'`, 1 for `'c'`, and 1 for `'d'`).
   - The function correctly returns 4.

2. **Test Case 2: `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}`**
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `'python'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'c': 'python'}` is 2 (1 for `'c'` and 1 for `'python'`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` is 2 (1 for `'a'` and 1 for `'b'`).
   - The function correctly returns 2.

3. **Test Case 3: `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}`**
   - The depth of `'Sun'` is 1.
   - The depth of `'Mon'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{4: 'Mon'}` is 2 (1 for `4` and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}` is 3 (1 for `3`, 1 for `4`, and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` is 3 (1 for `1`, 1 for `2`, and 1 for `3`).
   - The function correctly returns 3.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly handles all the provided test cases. It accurately calculates the depth of the nested dictionary by considering the base case (empty or non-dictionary) and the recursive case (non-empty dictionary). The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
