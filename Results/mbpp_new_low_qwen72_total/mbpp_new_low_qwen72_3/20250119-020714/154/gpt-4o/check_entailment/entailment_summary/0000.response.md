Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the depth of a nested dictionary. The function works as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. This handles edge cases where the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary.
2. **Recursive Case**: If the input `d` is a non-empty dictionary, the function recursively applies itself to each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among these values. This ensures that the function correctly calculates the depth of the deepest nested dictionary.

The provided test cases:
- `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})` should return 4 because the deepest nested dictionary has 4 levels.
- `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}})` should return 2 because the deepest nested dictionary has 2 levels.
- `func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}})` should return 3 because the deepest nested dictionary has 3 levels.

These test cases are consistent with the expected behavior of the function as described in the problem and execution summary.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct.

Correctness: **True**
