Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.

# Program:
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2
assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3

def func_1(d):
    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 + max((func_1(value) for value in d.values()))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` (which can be nested but must not contain cyclic references) as input and returns an integer. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from recursively applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. This effectively computes the depth of the deepest nested dictionary structure within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is an empty dictionary, a non-dictionary type, or contains only non-dictionary values, in which case the function will return 1.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
