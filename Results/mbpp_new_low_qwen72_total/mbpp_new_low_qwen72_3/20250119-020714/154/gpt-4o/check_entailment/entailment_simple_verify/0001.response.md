Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. Let's break down the logic and the provided test cases to ensure the correctness of the function.

1. **Base Case**:
   - The function checks if the input `d` is not a dictionary or if it is an empty dictionary. In such cases, it returns 1. This is appropriate because a non-dictionary or an empty dictionary has no further nesting and thus has a depth of 1.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary. It then returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level found in any of its values.

Let's analyze the test cases:

1. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`:
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'d': {}}` is 2 (1 for `'d'` and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'c': {'d': {}}}` is 3 (1 for `'c'`, 1 for `'d'`, and 1 for `{}`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` is 4 (1 for `'a'`, 1 for `'b'`, 1 for `'c'`, and 1 for `'d'`).

2. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}`:
   - The depth of `1` is 1.
   - The depth of `'python'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{'c': 'python'}` is 2 (1 for `'c'` and 1 for `'python'`).
   - The depth of `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` is 2 (1 for `'a'` and 1 for `'b'`).

3. `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}`:
   - The depth of `'Sun'` is 1.
   - The depth of `'Mon'` is 1.
   - The depth of `{4: 'Mon'}` is 2 (1 for `4` and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{3: {4: 'Mon'}}` is 3 (1 for `3`, 1 for `4`, and 1 for `'Mon'`).
   - The depth of `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` is 3 (1 for `1`, 1 for `2`, and 1 for `3`).

All test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
