#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary, possibly nested, with non-cyclic references.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. The exact value depends on the contents of `d` and the implementation of `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` (which can be nested but must not contain cyclic references) as input and returns an integer. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from recursively applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. This effectively computes the depth of the deepest nested dictionary structure within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is an empty dictionary, a non-dictionary type, or contains only non-dictionary values, in which case the function will return 1.
