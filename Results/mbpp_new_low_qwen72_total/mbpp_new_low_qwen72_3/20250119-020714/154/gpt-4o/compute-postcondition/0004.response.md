The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`, which is a dictionary, possibly nested, with non-cyclic references. The function has two cases for its return value:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: The function returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. The exact value returned in this case depends on the contents of `d` and the recursive application of `func_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` (possibly nested, with non-cyclic references) and returns either 1 or 1 plus the maximum value obtained from recursively applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`.**
