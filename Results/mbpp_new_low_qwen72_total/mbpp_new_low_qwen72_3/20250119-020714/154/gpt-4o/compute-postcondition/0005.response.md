Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` (which can be nested but must not contain cyclic references) as input and returns an integer. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or not a dictionary, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the maximum value obtained from recursively applying `func_1` to each value in the dictionary `d`. This effectively computes the depth of the deepest nested dictionary structure within `d`. Edge cases include when `d` is an empty dictionary, a non-dictionary type, or contains only non-dictionary values, in which case the function will return 1. **
