The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than 2, or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). It returns `True` if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is not divisible by any integer in the specified range, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.
