Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, and `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5 (which it is not), `count` would become 2. However, since the condition is not met, `count` remains 1 and the program does not return 8.***
