To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given loop and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `count` is 1.
- `num` is 7.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues indefinitely until it meets the return condition. Let's break down the loop:

```python
while True:
    if func_1(num):
        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
    num += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - `num` starts at 7.
   - `func_1(num)` is a function that we assume returns a boolean value. We need to know its behavior, but for now, let's assume it can return `True` or `False`.
   - `num % 6` is checked to see if it is 1 or 5.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `num` is 7.
   - `7 % 6` is 1, which is in the list `[1, 5]`.
   - If `func_1(7)` returns `True`, then:
     - `count` is incremented to 2.
     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num` (which is 7).
   - If `func_1(7)` returns `False`, then:
     - `num` is incremented to 8.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration, `num` is incremented by 1.
   - The same checks are performed:
     - `func_1(num)` must return `True`.
     - `num % 6` must be 1 or 5.
     - If both conditions are met, `count` is incremented.
     - If `count` equals `n`, the loop returns `num`.

### Tracking Variable Changes:
- **`n`**: Remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`count`**: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.
- **`num`**: Increments by 1 in each iteration.

### Summarizing the Loop Behavior:
- The loop will continue to increment `num` until `count` reaches `n`.
- `count` will only increment if `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.
- Once `count` equals `n`, the loop returns the current value of `num`.

### Edge Cases:
- If `func_1(num)` never returns `True` for any `num` where `num % 6` is 1 or 5, the loop will run indefinitely.
- If `n` is very large, the loop may take a long time to complete.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `count` equals `n`.
- At this point, `num` will be the value that satisfies the conditions `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `count` is `n`.
- `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is `n`, `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.**
