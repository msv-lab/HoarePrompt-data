The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The conditions mentioned in the initial state (regarding `func_1(7)`, the remainder when 7 is divided by 6, and the comparison between `count` and `n`) do not affect the execution of the given code snippet, as they are not part of the logic within the snippet itself. Therefore, the values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8. If `func_1(7)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, `count` is 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, `count` remains 2.**
