Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies two conditions: it is a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function continues to search for such numbers until it finds the nth one, which it then returns. The return value is not limited to 7, 8, or 9; it can be any valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number corresponding to the input `n`. **
