The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is 9, so after the increment, `num` becomes 10. The conditions regarding `num % 6` being 1 or 5, and the checks involving `count` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `num`. The state of `count` and `n` remains as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10. If `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. If `num % 6` is not 1 or 5, the program does not return 9 and `count` remains 1.**
