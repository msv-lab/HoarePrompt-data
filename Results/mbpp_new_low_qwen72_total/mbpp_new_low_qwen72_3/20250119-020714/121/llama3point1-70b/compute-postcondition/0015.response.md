Given the `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always true and does not depend on any specific state variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `func_1(7)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, `count` is 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
