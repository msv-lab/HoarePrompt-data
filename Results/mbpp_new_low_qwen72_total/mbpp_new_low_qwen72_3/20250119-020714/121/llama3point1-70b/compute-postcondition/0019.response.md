Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, and `num` is 8. If the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5 (which it is not), `count` becomes 2. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8. Otherwise, `count` remains 2 and the program does not return 8. Since the condition is not met, `count` remains 1 and the program does not return 8.***
