The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` starts as 7. After executing the code, `num` becomes 8.

The conditions mentioned in the initial state (whether `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5) are not affected by this code snippet since they are evaluated based on the original value of `num` (which was 7). However, since the condition checks are not re-evaluated here, the only change is in the value of `num`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8. If `func_1(7)` evaluates to `True` and the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, `count` is 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
