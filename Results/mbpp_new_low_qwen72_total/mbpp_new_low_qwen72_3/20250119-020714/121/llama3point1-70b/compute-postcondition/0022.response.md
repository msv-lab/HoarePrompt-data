For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, and there are no specific variables in the loop head that control the continuation of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9**
