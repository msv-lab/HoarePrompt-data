Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the implementation of the `func_2` function. The function is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number, but it does not follow the correct algorithm for generating NSW primes. Instead, it simply checks for prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is not the same as the NSW primes.

Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation:
- \( S_0 = 1 \)
- \( S_1 = 1 \)
- \( S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n \)

A number \( S_n \) in this sequence is considered a NSW prime if it is also a prime number. The function `func_2` does not use this recurrence relation to generate the sequence, and instead, it uses a different method that is not equivalent to the definition of NSW primes.

The provided function will return prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, but these are not necessarily NSW primes. For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, etc., and the provided function will not correctly generate these specific numbers.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the algorithm for finding NSW primes.

Final: **False**
