Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. This is a standard and efficient way to check for primality.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. However, the definition of NSW primes is not correctly implemented.
   - According to the function summary, the function is supposed to return the nth NSW prime number, which is a prime number that satisfies specific conditions. The first NSW prime is 7.
   - The function uses a simple primality test and a modulo condition to filter primes, but this approach is incorrect for NSW primes.
   - NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation:
     \[
     S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}
     \]
     with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \). The NSW primes are the prime numbers in this sequence.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not use this recurrence relation and instead relies on a simple modulo condition, which is not sufficient to identify NSW primes.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is not sufficient to ensure that `num` is an NSW prime.
   - The assessment also correctly suggests that the program should use the recurrence relation to generate the NSW sequence and then check for primality.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly find the nth NSW prime.

Final: **False**
