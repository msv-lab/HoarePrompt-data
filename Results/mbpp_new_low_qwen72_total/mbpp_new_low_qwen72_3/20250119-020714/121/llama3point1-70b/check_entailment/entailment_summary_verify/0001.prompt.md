You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies two conditions: it is a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function continues to search for such numbers until it finds the nth one, which it then returns. The return value is not limited to 7, 8, or 9; it can be any valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number corresponding to the input `n`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if any of these numbers divide `n` without a remainder. If such a divisor is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This function correctly implements a basic primality test.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - NSW primes are a sequence of prime numbers that satisfy specific conditions. The first NSW prime is 7.
   - The function starts with the first NSW prime (7) and initializes a counter (`count`) to 1.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it increments `num` by 1 and checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is prime, it further checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. This condition ensures that the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a common property of prime numbers greater than 3.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - If the counter reaches `n`, it returns `num`.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_2`. The condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is not sufficient to ensure that `num` is an NSW prime. NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation and are not just any prime number congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

To correctly find the nth NSW prime, the program should use the recurrence relation:
\[ S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \]
with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \), and then check if \( S_n \) is prime.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly find the nth NSW prime because it does not use the correct definition of NSW primes.

Correctness: **False**
