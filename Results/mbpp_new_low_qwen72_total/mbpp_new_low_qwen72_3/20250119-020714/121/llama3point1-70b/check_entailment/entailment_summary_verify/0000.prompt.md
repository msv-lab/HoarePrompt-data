You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies two conditions: it is a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function continues to search for such numbers until it finds the nth one, which it then returns. The return value is not limited to 7, 8, or 9; it can be any valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number corresponding to the input `n`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is used to check if the number is of the form 6k ± 1, which is a common property of prime numbers greater than 3. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to ensure that the number is a Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime. NSW primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers that satisfy a particular recurrence relation, not just any prime number of the form 6k ± 1.

The correct approach to finding the nth NSW prime involves generating the sequence using the recurrence relation and checking for primality. The current implementation does not follow the correct algorithm for generating NSW primes, leading to incorrect results for certain values of `n`.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, etc. The provided program will incorrectly return other prime numbers that happen to be of the form 6k ± 1 but are not part of the NSW sequence.
