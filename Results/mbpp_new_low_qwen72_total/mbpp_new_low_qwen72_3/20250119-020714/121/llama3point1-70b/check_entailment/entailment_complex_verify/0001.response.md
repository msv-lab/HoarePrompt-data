Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks for divisibility. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for checking primality.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - NSW primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers defined by the recurrence relation \( S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \).
   - The function starts with the first NSW prime (7) and initializes a counter (`count`) to 1.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it increments `num` by 1 and checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is prime, it further checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. This condition ensures that the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a common property of prime numbers greater than 3.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - If the counter reaches `n`, it returns `num`.

However, the critical issue is that the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is not sufficient to ensure that `num` is an NSW prime. NSW primes are defined by the specific recurrence relation mentioned above, and simply checking for primality and congruence modulo 6 does not guarantee that the number is an NSW prime.

To correctly find the nth NSW prime, the program should use the recurrence relation to generate the sequence of NSW numbers and then check if each generated number is prime. The current implementation does not follow this approach and thus does not correctly find the nth NSW prime.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
