Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the `func_2` function. The condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition for a number to be a Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime. NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation and are not simply any prime number of the form 6k ± 1.

The correct algorithm for generating NSW primes involves the following steps:
1. Define the recurrence relation for NSW numbers: \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \).
2. Check if the generated NSW number is prime.

The provided `func_2` does not use the correct recurrence relation to generate NSW numbers. Instead, it checks all numbers starting from 7 and filters them based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is not the correct method for generating NSW primes.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, etc. The provided program will likely return other prime numbers that happen to be of the form 6k ± 1 but are not part of the NSW sequence, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect for finding the nth NSW prime.

Final: **False**
