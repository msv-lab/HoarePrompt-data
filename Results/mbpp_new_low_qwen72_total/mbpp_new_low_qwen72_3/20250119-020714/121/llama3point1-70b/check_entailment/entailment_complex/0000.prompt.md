Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` has reached `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than 2, or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). It returns `True` if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is not divisible by any integer in the specified range, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1

num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is `n`, `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` is `True` and `num % 6` is 1 or 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies two conditions: it is a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function continues to search for such numbers until it finds the nth one, which it then returns. The return value is not limited to 7, 8, or 9; it can be any valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number corresponding to the input `n`.
