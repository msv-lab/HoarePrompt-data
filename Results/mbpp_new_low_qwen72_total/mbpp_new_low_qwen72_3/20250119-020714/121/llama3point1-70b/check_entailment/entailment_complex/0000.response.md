Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
   - It correctly returns `False` if `n` is less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and returns `False` if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This implementation is correct for determining if a number is prime.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - The NSW primes are a sequence of prime numbers that satisfy specific conditions.
   - The function correctly returns 7 if `n` is 1, as 7 is the first NSW prime.
   - For `n` greater than 1, it initializes `count` to 1 and starts with `num` set to 7.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1` and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the `count`.
   - When `count` equals `n`, it returns `num`.
   - The loop continues indefinitely until the nth NSW prime is found, ensuring that the function will eventually return the correct value.

Given the problem description and the state of the program at various points, the functions together correctly implement the logic to find the nth NSW prime number.

Correctness: **True**
