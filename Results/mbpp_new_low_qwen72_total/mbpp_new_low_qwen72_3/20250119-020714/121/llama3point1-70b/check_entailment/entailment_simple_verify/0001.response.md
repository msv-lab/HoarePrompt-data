Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the critical issue with the logic in `func_2`. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the nth NSW prime.
   - It starts with the first NSW prime (7) and initializes a counter (`count`) to 1.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it increments `num` by 1 and checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is prime, it further checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - If the counter reaches `n`, it returns `num`.

The critical issue lies in the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. While this condition is true for many prime numbers, it does not ensure that `num` is an NSW prime. NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation:
\[ S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \]
with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \). The nth NSW prime is the nth term in this sequence that is also a prime number.

The current implementation of `func_2` does not use this recurrence relation and instead relies on a simple prime check followed by a modulo condition. This approach is incorrect for finding NSW primes.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not correctly find the nth NSW prime.

Final: **False**
