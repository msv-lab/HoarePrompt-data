Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the provided program. The function `func_2` attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number by checking if a number is prime and then verifying if it is of the form 6k ± 1. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed because NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation, not just by being primes of the form 6k ± 1.

### Key Points from the Analysis:

1. **Prime Checking (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime.
   - This function is accurate and works as intended for the purpose of checking primality.

2. **Finding NSW Primes (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` starts with the first NSW prime, which is 7.
   - It then iterates through subsequent numbers, checking if they are prime and if they are of the form 6k ± 1.
   - The condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is used to filter out non-prime candidates, but this is not sufficient to ensure that the number is a NSW prime.
   - NSW primes are generated by a specific recurrence relation: \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) with initial conditions \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \). A number \( S_n \) is a NSW prime if it is also a prime number.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly find the nth NSW prime, the program should:
1. Generate the NSW sequence using the recurrence relation.
2. Check if each term in the sequence is a prime number.
3. Return the nth prime number in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm for finding NSW primes. It relies on a general prime-checking method and an insufficient condition to identify NSW primes, leading to incorrect results for many values of `n`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical flaw in the program.

Final: **False**
