Reasoning:
The program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. A NSW prime is a prime number \( p \) that satisfies the condition \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \) or \( p \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \).

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number is prime.
   - It correctly handles edge cases (numbers less than 2 are not prime).
   - It uses a common optimization to check divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is efficient and correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - It starts with the first known NSW prime, which is 7.
   - It uses a loop to find subsequent NSW primes by incrementing the number and checking if it is both a prime (using `func_1`) and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
   - The function correctly returns 7 when `n` is 1.
   - For `n` greater than 1, it continues to search for the next NSW prime until it finds the nth one.

The logic in both functions is sound and aligns with the problem description. The implementation of `func_2` ensures that it only returns numbers that are both prime and satisfy the NSW prime condition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
