 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it returns `False` if `n` is less than 2, or if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). It returns `True` if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is not divisible by any integer in the specified range, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies two conditions: it is a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function continues to search for such numbers until it finds the nth one, which it then returns. The return value is not limited to 7, 8, or 9; it can be any valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number corresponding to the input `n`.
