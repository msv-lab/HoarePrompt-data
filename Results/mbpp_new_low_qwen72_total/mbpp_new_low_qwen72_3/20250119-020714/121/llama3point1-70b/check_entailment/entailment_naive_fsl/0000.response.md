Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is used to check if the number is of the form 6k ± 1, which is a common property of prime numbers greater than 3. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to ensure that the number is a Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime. NSW primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers that satisfy a particular recurrence relation, not just any prime number of the form 6k ± 1.

The correct approach to finding the nth NSW prime involves generating the sequence using the recurrence relation and checking for primality. The current implementation does not follow the correct algorithm for generating NSW primes, leading to incorrect results for certain values of `n`.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, etc. The provided program will incorrectly return other prime numbers that happen to be of the form 6k ± 1 but are not part of the NSW sequence.
