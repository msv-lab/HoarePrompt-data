### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct because 0 and 1 are not prime.
   - For numbers greater than or equal to 2, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if any number divides `n` without a remainder. If such a divisor is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - NSW primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and the first NSW prime is 7.
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1 by returning 7.
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes a counter `count` to 1 and starts with the first NSW prime `num = 7`.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it checks if `num` is prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is prime and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 (a property of NSW primes), it increments the counter `count`.
   - When `count` equals `n`, it returns `num`, which is the nth NSW prime.
   - The loop continues until the nth NSW prime is found, ensuring that all conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The functions are well-defined, and the conditions and loops are structured appropriately to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **True**
