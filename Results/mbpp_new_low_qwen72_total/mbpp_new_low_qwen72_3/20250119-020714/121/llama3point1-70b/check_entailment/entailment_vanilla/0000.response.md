Reasoning:  
The provided program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if any of these numbers divide `n` without a remainder. If such a divisor is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This function correctly implements a basic primality test.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - NSW primes are a sequence of prime numbers that satisfy specific conditions. The first NSW prime is 7.
   - The function starts with the first NSW prime (7) and initializes a counter (`count`) to 1.
   - It enters an infinite loop where it increments `num` by 1 and checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is prime, it further checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. This condition ensures that the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a common property of prime numbers greater than 3.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - If the counter reaches `n`, it returns `num`.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_2`. The condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is not sufficient to ensure that `num` is an NSW prime. NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation and are not just any prime number congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

To correctly find the nth NSW prime, the program should use the recurrence relation:
\[ S_{n} = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \]
with initial values \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \), and then check if \( S_n \) is prime.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly find the nth NSW prime because it does not use the correct definition of NSW primes.

Correctness: **False**
