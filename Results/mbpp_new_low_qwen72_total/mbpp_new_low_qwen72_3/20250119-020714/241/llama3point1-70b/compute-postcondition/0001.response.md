The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `main_list` and `sub_list`. Both `main_list` and `sub_list` are lists. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (with its elements converted to strings and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (with its elements converted to strings and concatenated).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `main_list` and `sub_list`, both of which are lists. It returns `True` if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
