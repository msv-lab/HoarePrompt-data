Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to check if a `sub_list` is a sublist of `main_list` by converting both lists to strings and checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for simple cases where the elements are unique and do not contain complex structures that might lead to false positives (e.g., `[1, 23]` and `[1, 2, 3]`).

However, there are several issues and edge cases to consider:
1. **Empty Lists**: If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless both are empty. This behavior is generally expected, but it should be noted.
2. **Non-String Convertible Elements**: If the elements in the lists are not convertible to strings, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This is a valid concern, but it's generally assumed that the function will be used with lists containing elements that can be converted to strings.
3. **Non-List Inputs**: If the inputs are not lists, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This is another valid concern, but it's generally assumed that the function will be used with lists.
4. **Complex Structures**: The function may produce incorrect results for lists with elements that, when converted to strings, can form misleading substrings. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 23])` would incorrectly return `True`.

Given these considerations, the function is correct for simple cases but has limitations and potential issues that need to be addressed for more robust use.

Correctness: **False**
