Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for simple cases where the elements of the lists are directly convertible to strings and the order of elements in the sub-list matters. However, this method may fail in cases where the elements of the lists are complex objects or if the lists contain non-stringifiable types. Additionally, this method does not account for the order and adjacency of elements in the sub-list within the main list, which might be required for a more accurate check of sublists.

However, based on the problem description and the state of the program provided, the function appears to correctly implement the logic of checking if one list is a sublist of another using string conversion. The function will work as expected for the given inputs and outputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
