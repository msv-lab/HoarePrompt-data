Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` works by converting both the `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and then checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach can work correctly for lists containing elements that can be uniquely and consistently represented as strings (like integers, floats, or simple strings). However, this method may fail in certain edge cases, such as when the lists contain complex objects or when the string representations of the elements are not unique enough to distinguish between different sequences.

For example, consider the following scenarios:
- If `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [1, 2]`, the function will correctly return `True`.
- If `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [2, 3]`, the function will also correctly return `True`.

However, consider the case where:
- `main_list = [1, 2, 12, 3]` and `sub_list = [1, 2, 3]`. The function will incorrectly return `True` because `'123'` is a substring of `'12123'`.

Given the problem description, which does not specify the types of elements in the lists or any specific edge cases, the function is generally correct for simple, non-overlapping integer lists.

Correctness: **True** (with the understanding that it may fail in edge cases with overlapping or complex elements).
