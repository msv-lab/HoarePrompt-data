Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function converts the lists into strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach is insufficient for determining if `sub_list` is a true sublist of `main_list` because it only checks for contiguous sequences of elements.

For example, consider the case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sub_list = [1, 3, 5]
```
Here, `sub_list` is indeed a valid sublist of `main_list` because all elements of `sub_list` appear in `main_list` in the same order, but they are not contiguous. The function `func_1` would incorrectly return `False` because the string `"135"` is not a substring of `"12345"`.

Additionally, the function summary and edge cases mentioned in the original assessment are accurate:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` unless both are empty.
- If the elements in `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- The function does not handle non-list inputs, which will raise a `TypeError`.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Final: **False**
