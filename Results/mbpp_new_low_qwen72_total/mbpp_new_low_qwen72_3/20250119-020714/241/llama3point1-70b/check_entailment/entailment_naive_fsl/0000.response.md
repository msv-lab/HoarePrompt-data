Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program converts both lists into strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach fails to handle cases where the elements of `sub_list` are not contiguous in `main_list`, but still form a valid sublist. For example, consider the following case:

```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sub_list = [1, 3, 5]
```

In this case, `sub_list` is a valid sublist of `main_list` because all elements of `sub_list` appear in `main_list` in the same order. However, the program would return `False` because the string `"135"` is not a substring of the string `"12345"`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
