Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (with elements converted to strings and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (with elements converted to strings and concatenated).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input parameters. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and then concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is similarly converted to a string and concatenated). 

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` because an empty string is not a substring of another string unless the other string is also empty.
- If the elements in `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list; if non-list inputs are provided, it will raise a `TypeError`.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
