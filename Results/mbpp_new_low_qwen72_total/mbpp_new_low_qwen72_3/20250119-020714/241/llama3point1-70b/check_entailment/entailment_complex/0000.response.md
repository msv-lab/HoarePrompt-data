Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to check if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for many cases, but it has some limitations:

1. **String Conversion**: The function converts all elements of both lists to strings and concatenates them. This can lead to incorrect results if the elements, when converted to strings, form substrings that don't represent the original sublist. For example, `func_1([1, 23, 4], [2, 3])` would return `True` because `"23"` contains `"2"` and `"3"`, even though `[2, 3]` is not a sublist of `[1, 23, 4]`.

2. **Empty Lists**: The function correctly handles the case where `sub_list` is empty by returning `False` (since an empty string is not a substring of a non-empty string). However, it does not handle the case where `main_list` is empty but `sub_list` is not, which should also return `False`.

3. **Non-List Inputs**: The function assumes that both `main_list` and `sub_list` are lists. If they are not, a `TypeError` will be raised. While this is a reasonable assumption given the problem description, it could be improved with type checking or handling.

4. **Type Conversion Errors**: If the elements in the lists cannot be converted to strings, a `TypeError` will be raised. This is a valid concern, but it is not necessarily a correctness issue if the input is guaranteed to be lists of convertible elements.

Given these points, the function is not fully correct because it can produce incorrect results in certain edge cases due to the string conversion method.

Correctness: **False**
