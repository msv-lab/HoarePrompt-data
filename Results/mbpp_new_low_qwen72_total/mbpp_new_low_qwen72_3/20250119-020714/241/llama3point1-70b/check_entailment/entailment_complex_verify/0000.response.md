Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into string representations and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works correctly when the elements of `sub_list` are contiguous in `main_list`, but it fails to handle cases where the elements of `sub_list` are not contiguous but still form a valid sublist. 

For example, consider the following case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sub_list = [1, 3, 5]
```
Here, `sub_list` is a valid sublist of `main_list` because all elements of `sub_list` appear in `main_list` in the same order. However, the program would return `False` because the string `"135"` is not a substring of the string `"12345"`. This demonstrates that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
