Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the provided solution. The function `func_1` converts both the `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This method works well for simple cases where the elements of `sub_list` are contiguous in `main_list`. However, it fails to handle cases where the elements of `sub_list` are not contiguous but still form a valid sublist when considered in order.

For example, consider the case:
```python
main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sub_list = [1, 3, 5]
```
Here, `sub_list` is indeed a valid sublist of `main_list` because the elements `[1, 3, 5]` appear in `main_list` in the same order, even though they are not contiguous. The function `func_1` would return `False` because the string `"135"` is not a substring of `"12345"`. This clearly shows that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the limitation of the function.

Final: **False**
