Reasoning:
The original assessment accurately identifies the core mechanism of the function `func_1`, which converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach is indeed effective for simple lists containing elements that have unique and consistent string representations, such as integers or simple strings.

However, the original assessment also correctly points out potential issues with this approach:
1. **Overlapping Elements**: As demonstrated in the example `main_list = [1, 2, 12, 3]` and `sub_list = [1, 2, 3]`, the function will incorrectly return `True` because the string `'123'` is a substring of `'12123'`. This is a significant flaw because it can lead to false positives.
2. **Complex Objects**: The function may fail if the lists contain complex objects that do not have unique string representations or if the string representation is not a reliable indicator of the sequence of elements.

Given these points, the function `func_1` is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs and edge cases. While it may work correctly for simple, non-overlapping integer lists, it fails in more complex scenarios.

Final: **False**

The function is incorrect due to its inability to handle edge cases involving overlapping elements and complex objects. A more robust solution would be required to ensure correctness in all scenarios.
