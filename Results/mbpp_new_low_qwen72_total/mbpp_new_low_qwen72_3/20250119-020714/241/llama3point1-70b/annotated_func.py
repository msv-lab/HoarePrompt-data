#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (with elements converted to strings and concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (with elements converted to strings and concatenated).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, as input parameters. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `sub_list` (where each element is converted to a string and then concatenated) is a substring of the string representation of `main_list` (where each element is similarly converted to a string and concatenated). 

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is empty, the function will return `False` because an empty string is not a substring of another string unless the other string is also empty.
- If the elements in `main_list` or `sub_list` are not convertible to strings, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list; if non-list inputs are provided, it will raise a `TypeError`.
