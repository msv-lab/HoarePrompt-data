Reasoning: 

Let's re-evaluate the function `func_1` step by step to ensure its correctness and validate the original assessment.

1. **Conversion to Sets**:
   - `set1 = set(list1)`: Converts `list1` to a set, removing any duplicates.
   - `set2 = set(list2)`: Converts `list2` to a set, removing any duplicates.

2. **Symmetric Difference**:
   - `diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`: Computes the symmetric difference, which includes elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This step is correct and efficient.

3. **Conversion to List**:
   - `result_list = list(diff_elements)`: Converts the set of unique elements to a list. This step is straightforward and correct.

4. **Sorting by First Occurrence**:
   - `result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))`: Sorts the list based on the index of the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the order of elements in the output reflects their first appearance in the input lists. However, there is a potential issue here: if an element appears in both `list1` and `list2`, the `index` method will always return the index from `list1` first, which might not be the desired behavior if the element is supposed to be considered from `list2`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - `return result_list`: Returns the sorted list.

Now, let's verify the test cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]`, `[25, 40, 35]`
  - Symmetric difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected Output: `[10, 20, 30, 15]`
  - Actual Output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - **Issue**: The actual output does not match the expected output because the sorting by first occurrence should consider the order in the combined list, not just `list1`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[6, 7, 1]`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Actual Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - **Correct**: The actual output matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[6, 7, 1]`
  - Symmetric difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected Output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Actual Output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - **Correct**: The actual output matches the expected output.

**Conclusion**:
- The function works correctly for Test Cases 2 and 3.
- However, for Test Case 1, the function does not produce the expected output due to the sorting issue. The sorting logic should consider the combined list `list1 + list2` more carefully to ensure the correct order of elements.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not handle all test cases correctly.

Final: **False**
