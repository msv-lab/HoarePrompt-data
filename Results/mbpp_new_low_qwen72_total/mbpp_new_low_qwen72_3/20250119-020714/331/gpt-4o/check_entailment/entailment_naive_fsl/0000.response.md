Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not always return the correct difference between two lists as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function uses the symmetric difference (`set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`) which returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. However, the problem description seems to imply that the difference should include all unique elements from both lists, preserving the order of appearance in the original lists.

A specific case where the program fails is:
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5])`
- Expected Output: `[1, 4, 5]`
- Actual Output: `[1, 4, 5]` (This might seem correct, but consider the next case)

Another case:
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6])`
- Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`
- Actual Output: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` (Again, this might seem correct, but the issue is more subtle)

The issue becomes clearer with repeated elements:
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5])`
- Expected Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5]` (since the second `2` in the first list should also be considered part of the difference)
- Actual Output: `[1, 4, 5]` (the second `2` is lost because it is removed by the set operations)

Thus, the function does not handle repeated elements correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
