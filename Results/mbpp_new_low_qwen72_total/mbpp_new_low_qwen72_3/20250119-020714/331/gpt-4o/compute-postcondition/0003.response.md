Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The sorting is based on the order of their first occurrence in the concatenated list (`list1 + list2`). If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return a sorted list of the non-empty list's elements. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. The function ensures that the resulting list contains unique elements that are not shared between the two input lists. **
