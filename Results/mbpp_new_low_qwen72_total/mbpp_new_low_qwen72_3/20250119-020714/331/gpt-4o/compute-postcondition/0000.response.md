The provided code snippet performs several operations on `list1` and `list2`:

1. Converts `list1` and `list2` into sets (`set1` and `set2`), which removes any duplicate elements within each list.
2. Computes the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2` and stores the result in `diff_elements`. The symmetric difference includes elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both.
3. Converts `diff_elements` back into a list (`result_list`).
4. Sorts `result_list` based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

Given the initial state where `list1` and `list2` are lists, the final state after executing the code is:

Output State: **list1 is unchanged, list2 is unchanged, set1 is a set containing the unique elements of list1, set2 is a set containing the unique elements of list2, diff_elements is a set containing the elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both, result_list is a sorted list of elements from diff_elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list (list1 + list2)**.
