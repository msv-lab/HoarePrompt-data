To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
      if n % i == 0:
          return True
  ```

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n`: Remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Changing Variables**:
  - `i`: Increments from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `n % i == 0`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i`, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning `True`.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `i` is 2.
  - `n % 2 != 0` (otherwise, the function would have returned `True`).
- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `i` is 3.
  - `n % 3 != 0` (otherwise, the function would have returned `True`).
- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `i` is 4.
  - `n % 4 != 0` (otherwise, the function would have returned `True`).

### Final Output State
- If the loop completes without finding any `i` such that `n % i == 0`, the function does not return `True`.
- This means `n` is a prime number or has no divisors other than 1 and itself up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Therefore, the final output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, and the function does not return `True` if no `i` in the range [2, int(math.sqrt(n))] divides `n` evenly.**
