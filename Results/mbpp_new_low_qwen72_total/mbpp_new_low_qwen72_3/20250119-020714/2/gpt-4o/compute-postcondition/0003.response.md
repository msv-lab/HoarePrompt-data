To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Range Definition**: The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range (inclusive) must be greater than or equal to the lower bound (2).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Lower Bound**: The lower bound of the range is 2.
2. **Upper Bound**: The upper bound of the range is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute at least once if `2 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- Simplifying this condition:
  - `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1 >= 2`
  - `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 1`
  - Since `int(math.sqrt(n))` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, this means `math.sqrt(n)` must be at least 1.
  - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 (since the square root of 1 is 1).

However, we are given that `n` is greater than 1, which already satisfies this condition.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2 (the starting value of the loop).

### Final State:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 2, which is always true given `n > 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2**
