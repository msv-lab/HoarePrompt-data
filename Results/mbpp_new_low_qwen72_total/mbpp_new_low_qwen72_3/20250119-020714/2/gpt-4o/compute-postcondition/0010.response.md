The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be greater than or equal to 4**
