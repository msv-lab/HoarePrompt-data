Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 1*** 

However, there is a logical contradiction here because `n` cannot be both greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1 at the same time. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the if condition will never be true given the precondition. To reflect this, the postcondition should be:

Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, and the if condition `(n <= 1)` is false***
