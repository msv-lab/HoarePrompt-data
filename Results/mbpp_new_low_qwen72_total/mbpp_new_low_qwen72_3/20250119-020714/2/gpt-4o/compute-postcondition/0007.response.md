The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 1, with `n % i` not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be such that `i` (now 3) is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `n % i` is not equal to 0**
