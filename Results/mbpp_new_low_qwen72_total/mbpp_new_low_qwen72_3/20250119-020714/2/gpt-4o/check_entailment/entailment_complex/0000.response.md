Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`. Let's break down the function:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `True` because numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime. This is correct.

2. **Loop for Divisibility Check**: For `n` greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). It checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `True` because `n` is not a prime number. This is also correct.

3. **Return False**: If no divisors are found in the loop, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This is correct.

The assertions provided also correctly test the function with various inputs:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct, as 1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct, as 2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct, as 10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct, as 35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct, as 37 is a prime).

Given that the function logic and the assertions are consistent with the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
