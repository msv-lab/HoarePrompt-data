Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`. The function behaves as follows:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `True`. This is correct because 1 and all negative numbers are not considered prime.
2. For `n` greater than 1, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
3. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The provided test cases also align with this behavior:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (1 is not a prime).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (2 is a prime).
- `func_1(10)` returns `True` (10 is not a prime).
- `func_1(35)` returns `True` (35 is not a prime).
- `func_1(37)` returns `False` (37 is a prime).

Given that the function correctly identifies non-prime and prime numbers according to the problem description and the test cases, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
