You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns a boolean value. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `True`. For integers `n` greater than 1, the function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by any integer `i` in the range [2, int(sqrt(n))]. If no such `i` exists, the function returns `False`. In essence, the function returns `False` only if `n` is a prime number greater than 1; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`. Let's break down the function:

1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `True` because 1 and all negative numbers are not prime.
2. For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
3. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
4. If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5). (Correct)
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7). (Correct)
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number. (Correct)

All test cases are correctly handled by the function.

Correctness: **True**
