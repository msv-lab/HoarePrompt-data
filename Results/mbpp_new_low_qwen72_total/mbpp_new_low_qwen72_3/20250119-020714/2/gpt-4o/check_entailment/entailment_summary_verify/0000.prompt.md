You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns a boolean value. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `True`. For integers `n` greater than 1, the function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by any integer `i` in the range [2, int(sqrt(n))]. If no such `i` exists, the function returns `False`. In essence, the function returns `False` only if `n` is a prime number greater than 1; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The function returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the function for specific inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would make the function incorrect.
