Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers. Let's analyze the function and its behavior step by step using the annotated version:

1. **Initial Check for Numbers Less Than or Equal to 1:**
   - The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`. This is consistent with the problem description, as numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.

2. **Divisibility Check for Numbers Greater Than 1:**
   - The function iterates over the range `[2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1]` to check for divisibility.
   - If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` in this range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no such `i` exists, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are:
     - `func_1(1) == True`: Correct, as 1 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(2) == False`: Correct, as 2 is a prime number.
     - `func_1(10) == True`: Correct, as 10 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(35) == True`: Correct, as 35 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(37) == False`: Correct, as 37 is a prime number.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 1`, it returns `True`.
     - For `n = 2`, it returns `False`.
     - For composite numbers like `10` and `35`, it returns `True`.
     - For prime numbers like `37`, it returns `False`.

Given the analysis above, the function `func_1` behaves as expected and correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
