Reasoning: 

The original assessment provides a clear and accurate breakdown of the function `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the function and the annotations to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **Initial Check (`if n <= 1`):**
   - The function correctly identifies that any number less than or equal to 1 is not a prime number and returns `True`.
   - This is consistent with the mathematical definition of prime numbers, which states that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Loop to Check Divisibility:**
   - The function iterates from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - This is an efficient way to check for factors, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
   - If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Final Return Statement:**
   - If no divisors are found within the specified range, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1(1)`: Returns `True` (Correct, as 1 is not a prime number).
- `func_1(2)`: Returns `False` (Correct, as 2 is a prime number).
- `func_1(10)`: Returns `True` (Correct, as 10 is not a prime number).
- `func_1(35)`: Returns `True` (Correct, as 35 is not a prime number).
- `func_1(37)`: Returns `False` (Correct, as 37 is a prime number).

### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
  - Before the function call: `n` is an integer.
  - After the initial check: `n` is greater than 1.
  - After the loop: If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers and returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. The provided test cases and the annotations support the correctness of the function.

Final: **True**
