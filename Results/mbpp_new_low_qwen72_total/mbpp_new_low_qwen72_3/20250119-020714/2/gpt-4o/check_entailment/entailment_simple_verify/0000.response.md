Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers. It asserts that the function returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are indeed not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient method to determine non-primality. The test cases provided also support the correctness of the function.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Initial State**: Before the function call, `n` is an integer.
   - **First Condition**: If `n <= 1`, the function returns `True`. This is correct because numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
   - **For Loop**: For `n > 1`, the function iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - **Final Return**: If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(1) == True`: Correct, as 1 is not a prime number.
   - `func_1(2) == False`: Correct, as 2 is a prime number.
   - `func_1(10) == True`: Correct, as 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5).
   - `func_1(35) == True`: Correct, as 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7).
   - `func_1(37) == False`: Correct, as 37 is a prime number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case of `n <= 1` correctly.
   - The function efficiently checks for non-primality by only iterating up to the square root of `n`.

Based on the analysis of the problem description, the annotated code, and the test cases, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers.

Final: **True**
