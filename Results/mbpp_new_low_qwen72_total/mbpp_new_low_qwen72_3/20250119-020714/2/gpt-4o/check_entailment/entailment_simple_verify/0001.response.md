Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers, where a non-prime number should return `True` and a prime number should return `False`. Let's analyze the function step-by-step using the provided annotations and test cases:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Prime Numbers (`n <= 1`)**:
   - The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is 1 or any negative number, it returns `True` because 1 and all negative numbers are not prime.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Checking Divisibility**:
   - For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
   - If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Returning `False` for Prime Numbers**:
   - If no divisors are found in the range [2, int(math.sqrt(n))], the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5). (Correct)
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7). (Correct)
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number. (Correct)

The function behaves as expected for all the provided test cases. The annotations also confirm that the function correctly identifies non-prime and prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
