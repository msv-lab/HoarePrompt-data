Reasoning:

The function `func_1(n)` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, the function should return `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if the number is prime.

Let's analyze the function step-by-step:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Prime (n <= 1):**
   - The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `True`. This is correct because 1 is not a prime number, and any number less than 1 is not considered in the context of prime numbers.

2. **Loop to Check Divisibility:**
   - The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each `i` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is non-prime.
   - This approach is correct because if a number `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `n`, it is not a prime number.

3. **Final Return for Prime Numbers:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, let's verify the assertions:

- `assert func_1(1) == True`: Correct, 1 is not a prime number.
- `assert func_1(2) == False`: Correct, 2 is a prime number.
- `assert func_1(10) == True`: Correct, 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5).
- `assert func_1(35) == True`: Correct, 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7).
- `assert func_1(37) == False`: Correct, 37 is a prime number.

All the assertions are correct, and the function logic aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
