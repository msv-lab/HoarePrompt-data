Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The function returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the function for specific inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would make the function incorrect.
