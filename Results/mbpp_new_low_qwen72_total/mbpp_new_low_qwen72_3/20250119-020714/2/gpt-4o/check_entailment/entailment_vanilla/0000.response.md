Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number should return `True`, and a prime number should return `False`. Let's break down the function:

1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `True` because 1 and all negative numbers are not prime.
2. For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
3. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
4. If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number. (Correct)
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5). (Correct)
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number (divisible by 5 and 7). (Correct)
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number. (Correct)

All test cases are correctly handled by the function.

Correctness: **True**
