Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks whether `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). If `n` is a composite number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, even though the initial state annotation specifies that `n` should be greater than 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the primality of `n`.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
