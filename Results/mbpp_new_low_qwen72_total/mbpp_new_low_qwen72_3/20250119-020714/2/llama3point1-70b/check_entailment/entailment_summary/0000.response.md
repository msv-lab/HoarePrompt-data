Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. It correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, which is appropriate since 1 is not a prime number. For other values of `n`, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a composite number. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

However, the problem description specifies that `n` should be greater than 1. The function's behavior when `n` is 1 is an edge case that is handled correctly, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Since the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs (`n > 1`), and even handles the edge case of `n = 1` appropriately, the function is considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
