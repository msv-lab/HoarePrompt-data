Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is not equal to 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `n` is a prime number (no factors were found).
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks whether `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). If `n` is a composite number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, even though the initial state annotation specifies that `n` should be greater than 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the primality of `n`.

# Your response:

Correctness: **True** or **False**
