Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. It works by checking if the input number `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If such a divisor is found, the number is identified as a non-prime (composite) and the function returns `True`. If no divisors are found, the number is considered a prime, and the function returns `False`.

However, there are a couple of issues with the function's correctness based on the problem description and the annotations:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`. However, the problem description states that `n` is an integer greater than 1, so the edge case handling for `n == 1` is redundant. This does not affect the correctness for valid inputs but is unnecessary.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This is correct because if `n` is not a prime, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. If a factor is found, the function correctly returns `True`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If a factor is found, the function returns `True`, which is correct for identifying non-prime numbers.
   - If no factors are found, the function returns `False`, which is correct for identifying prime numbers.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the function behaves as expected for valid inputs (i.e., integers greater than 1).

Correctness: **True**
