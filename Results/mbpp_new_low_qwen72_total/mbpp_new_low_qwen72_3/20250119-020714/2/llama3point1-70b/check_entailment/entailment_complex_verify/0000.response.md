Reasoning: 

1. **Problem Description and Function Behavior**:
   - The problem requires identifying non-prime numbers.
   - A non-prime number (composite number) is any positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number.
   - The function `func_1` returns `True` if `n` is a non-prime number and `False` if `n` is a prime number.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` by returning `True`. This is correct because 1 is not considered a prime number.
   - For `n > 1`, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive).

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is a non-prime number, and the function returns `True`.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at each step.
   - The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - After the `if` block, `n` is still an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1.
   - The loop correctly checks for divisibility, and the final state after the loop confirms that if no divisors are found, `n` is a prime number.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.
   - It mentions the efficient approach of checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
   - No counterexamples are provided where the function fails.

Given the above reasoning and the detailed analysis of the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
