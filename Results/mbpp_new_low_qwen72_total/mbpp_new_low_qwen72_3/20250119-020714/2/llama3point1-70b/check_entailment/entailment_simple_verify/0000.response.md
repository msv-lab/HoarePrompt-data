Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers. However, there is a critical issue with the implementation that affects its correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly returns `True` for `n = 1`, which is indeed a non-prime number.
2. **Loop for Checking Divisibility**: The function iterates from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` to check for divisibility. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a non-prime number.
3. **Return Statement**: If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, the problem description asks for a function to identify non-prime numbers. The current implementation returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers, which is correct. But the function's name `func_1` and the return values suggest that it is identifying non-prime numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement.

The issue arises when considering the logical negation of the function's purpose. If the function is meant to identify non-prime numbers, it should return `False` for non-prime numbers and `True` for prime numbers. This would align with the common convention in programming where `True` often indicates a condition being met (in this case, being a prime number).

Given the current implementation, the function is actually identifying prime numbers and returning the opposite of what the problem statement requires. Therefore, the function is incorrect in terms of its return values.

Final: **False**
