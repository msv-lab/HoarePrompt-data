Reasoning: 

The original assessment identifies a critical issue with the function `func_1`. The function is designed to identify non-prime numbers, but its return values are inconsistent with this goal:

1. **Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function correctly returns `True` for `n == 1` because 1 is not considered a prime number. This part of the function is correct.

2. **Case for `n > 1`:**
   - The function checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If a divisor is found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a non-prime number. This part is also correct.
   - However, if no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, which incorrectly indicates that `n` is a prime number. This is the logical inconsistency identified in the original assessment.

The correct behavior for a function that identifies non-prime numbers should be:
- Return `True` if `n` is a non-prime.
- Return `False` if `n` is a prime.

Given the current implementation:
- The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime.
- It correctly identifies non-prime numbers greater than 1.
- It incorrectly identifies prime numbers greater than 1.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

Final: **False**
