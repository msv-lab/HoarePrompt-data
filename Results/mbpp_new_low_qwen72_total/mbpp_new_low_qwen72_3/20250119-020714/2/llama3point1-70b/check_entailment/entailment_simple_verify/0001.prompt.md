You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: 
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is not equal to 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `n` is a prime number (no factors were found).
    return False
    #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to identify non-prime numbers. According to the logic of the function:
- If `n` is 1, it returns `True`, which is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
- For other values of `n`, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
- If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical inconsistency in the function's return values:
- The function should return `True` when `n` is a non-prime and `False` when `n` is a prime.
- Currently, the function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime.
- For other numbers, the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers but incorrectly identifies prime numbers (since it returns `False` for primes).

To fix this, the function should return `False` when a divisor is found (indicating `n` is non-prime) and `True` otherwise (indicating `n` is prime).

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly identify prime numbers as it should.

Correctness: **False**
