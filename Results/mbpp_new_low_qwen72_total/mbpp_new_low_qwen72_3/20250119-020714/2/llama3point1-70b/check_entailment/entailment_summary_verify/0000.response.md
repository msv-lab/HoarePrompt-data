### Reasoning:

1. **Function Behavior and Problem Description Alignment**:
   - The problem description requires a function to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number is any number that is not a prime number, including 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, etc.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1`. According to the function, `func_1(1)` returns `True`, which is correct because 1 is not a prime number.

3. **Prime Number Identification**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. This is an efficient and correct method to determine if a number is prime.
   - If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

4. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It states that the function returns `True` for composite numbers and `False` for prime numbers, with the special case of `n = 1` returning `True`.
   - The function does not modify `n` and returns a boolean value based on the primality of `n`.

5. **Correctness Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` behaves as expected for all valid inputs. It correctly identifies non-prime numbers and handles the edge case of `n = 1`.
   - No counterexamples have been provided where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description and handles all specified cases correctly.
