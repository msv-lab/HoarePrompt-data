You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks whether `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). If `n` is a composite number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, even though the initial state annotation specifies that `n` should be greater than 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the primality of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to identify non-prime numbers. According to the logic of the function:
- If `n` is 1, it returns `True`, which is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
- For other values of `n`, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
- If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical inconsistency in the function's return values:
- The function should return `True` when `n` is a non-prime and `False` when `n` is a prime.
- Currently, the function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime.
- For other numbers, the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers but incorrectly identifies prime numbers (since it returns `False` for primes).

To fix this, the function should return `False` when a divisor is found (indicating `n` is non-prime) and `True` otherwise (indicating `n` is prime).

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly identify prime numbers as it should.

Correctness: **False**
