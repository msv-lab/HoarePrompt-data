Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the function `func_1`. The function is intended to identify non-prime numbers, and it does so by checking if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. However, the return values are logically inverted compared to the expected behavior:

- The function returns `True` for non-prime numbers (composite numbers and 1), which is correct.
- The function returns `False` for prime numbers, which is incorrect according to the problem description, as it should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

To summarize:
- The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime.
- The function correctly identifies composite numbers as non-prime.
- The function incorrectly identifies prime numbers as not non-prime (i.e., it returns `False` for prime numbers).

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function does not correctly identify prime numbers as it should.

Final: **False**
