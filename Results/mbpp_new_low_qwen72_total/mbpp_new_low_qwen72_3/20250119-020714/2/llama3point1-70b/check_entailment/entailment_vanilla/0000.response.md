Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to identify non-prime numbers. According to the logic of the function:
- If `n` is 1, it returns `True`, which is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
- For other values of `n`, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
- If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical inconsistency in the function's return values:
- The function should return `True` when `n` is a non-prime and `False` when `n` is a prime.
- Currently, the function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime.
- For other numbers, the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers but incorrectly identifies prime numbers (since it returns `False` for primes).

To fix this, the function should return `False` when a divisor is found (indicating `n` is non-prime) and `True` otherwise (indicating `n` is prime).

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly identify prime numbers as it should.

Correctness: **False**
