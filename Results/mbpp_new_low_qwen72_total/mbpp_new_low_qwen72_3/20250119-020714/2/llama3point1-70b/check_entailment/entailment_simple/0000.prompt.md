Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is not equal to 1
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `n` is a prime number (no factors were found).
    return False
    #The program returns False


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
