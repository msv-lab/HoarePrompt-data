Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to identify non-prime numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Return Value for `n == 1`:** The function returns `True` when `n` is 1, which is correct because 1 is not a prime number.
2. **For Loop for Checking Non-Prime Numbers:** The loop checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. This is correct.
3. **Return Value for Prime Numbers:** If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This is also correct.

However, there is a logical inconsistency in the problem statement and the function's behavior:
- The function should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.
- The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime number.
- The function correctly identifies composite numbers (non-prime numbers greater than 1) as non-prime.
- The function correctly identifies prime numbers as prime.

Given the problem statement, the function is logically consistent and behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
