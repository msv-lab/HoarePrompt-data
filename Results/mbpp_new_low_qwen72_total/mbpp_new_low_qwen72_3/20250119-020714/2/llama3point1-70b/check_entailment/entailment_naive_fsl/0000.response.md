Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description. It returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. The function handles edge cases such as `n = 1` correctly, which is indeed a non-prime number. For other numbers, it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient and correct approach to determine if a number is non-prime. No counterexamples have been found where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.
