To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `n` is not equal to 1 (this is redundant since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 2 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range must be greater than or equal to the lower bound (2).
- This means `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be greater than 2, which simplifies to `int(math.sqrt(n))` being at least 2.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Lower Bound**: The lower bound of the range is 2.
2. **Upper Bound**: The upper bound of the range is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be greater than 2.
   - Simplifying, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 2.
   - This implies `math.sqrt(n)` must be at least 2.
   - Squaring both sides, `n` must be at least 4.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 4. Additionally, `i` will start at 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
