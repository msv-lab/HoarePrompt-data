To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 3.
- `n % i` is not equal to 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4.
4. **Range Check**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented to 4.
- `n` must remain such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 4 to ensure the loop can execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, and `n % i` is not equal to 0. If `n % i == 0`, the program returns True. Otherwise, the program does not return anything and the state remains unchanged.**
