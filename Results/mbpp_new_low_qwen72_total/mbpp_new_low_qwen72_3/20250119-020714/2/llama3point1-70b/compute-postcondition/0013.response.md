To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's follow the outlined steps:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
The given loop checks for factors of `n` starting from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any factor is found (i.e., `n % i == 0`), the function returns `True`. The loop stops as soon as a factor is found, meaning the function will return `True` if `n` is not a prime number. If no factors are found, the loop completes without returning, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n`: Remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Changing Variables**:
  - `i`: Increases from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
  - The condition `n % i == 0` determines whether the loop returns `True`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i` in the range, the loop returns `True` and exits immediately.
- If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- After the first iteration, `i` is 2 and `n % 2 != 0` (if it were, the function would have returned `True`).
- After the second iteration, `i` is 3 and `n % 3 != 0` (if it were, the function would have returned `True`).
- After the third iteration, `i` is 4 and `n % 4 != 0` (if it were, the function would have returned `True`).

### Final Output State
- If the loop completes without finding a factor, `n` is a prime number.
- The loop does not modify `n`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `n` is a prime number (no factors were found).**
