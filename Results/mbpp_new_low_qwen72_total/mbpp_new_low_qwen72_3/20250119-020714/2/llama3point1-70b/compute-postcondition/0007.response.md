The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(n))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, and `n % i` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `n % i` is not equal to 0**
