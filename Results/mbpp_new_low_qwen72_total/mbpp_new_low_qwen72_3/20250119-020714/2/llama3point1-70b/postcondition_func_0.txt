The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks whether `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). If `n` is a composite number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, even though the initial state annotation specifies that `n` should be greater than 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the primality of `n`.
