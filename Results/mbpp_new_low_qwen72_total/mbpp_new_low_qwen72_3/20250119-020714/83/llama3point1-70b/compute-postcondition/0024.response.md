Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of comparable elements. It sorts the list `arr` in ascending order using a variation of the selection sort algorithm. The function modifies the list in place and returns the sorted list. After the function concludes, `arr` is fully sorted in ascending order, and contains `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the original list. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with duplicate elements correctly. However, the function does not handle non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing integers and strings) and will raise a `TypeError` if the elements in `arr` cannot be compared. **
