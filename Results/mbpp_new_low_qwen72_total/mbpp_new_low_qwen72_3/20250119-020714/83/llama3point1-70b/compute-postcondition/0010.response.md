The code snippet updates the value of `max_index` to the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`. Given that `size` is `n - 1`, the sublist `arr[:size]` includes all elements of `arr` except the last one. The new value of `max_index` is determined based on this updated calculation.

- `arr` remains a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `size` remains `n - 1`.
- `max_index` is now the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`**.
