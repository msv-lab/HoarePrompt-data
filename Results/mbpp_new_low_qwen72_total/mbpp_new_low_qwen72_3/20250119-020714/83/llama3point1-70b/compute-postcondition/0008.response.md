Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:size]` is reversed, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` before the reversal. If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:size]` remains unchanged.***
