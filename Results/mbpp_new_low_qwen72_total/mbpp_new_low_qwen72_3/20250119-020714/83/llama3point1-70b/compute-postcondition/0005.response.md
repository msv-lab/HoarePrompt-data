The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist from the start of the list up to and including the element at index `max_index`.

- The sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, which means the first element of this sublist swaps places with the last element, the second element swaps with the second-to-last, and so on.
- The rest of the list remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `size`, `max_index` are not modified by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list where the sublist from the start up to and including the element at index `max_index` has been reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, and `max_index` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list where the sublist from the start up to and including the element at index `max_index` has been reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, and `max_index` is not equal to 0.**
