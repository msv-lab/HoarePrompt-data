Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, `size` is 0, and `max_index` is undefined. The loop ensures that after each iteration, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array is moved to its correct position in the sorted portion of the array. The loop iterates `n` times, once for each element in the array, and upon completion, `arr` is fully sorted in ascending order.**
