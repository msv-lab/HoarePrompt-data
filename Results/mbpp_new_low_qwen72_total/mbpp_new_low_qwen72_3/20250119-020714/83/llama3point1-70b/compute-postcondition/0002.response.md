The code snippet `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]` and assigns this index to `max_index`. 

- `arr` remains a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `size` is `n`.
- `max_index` is now the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.**
