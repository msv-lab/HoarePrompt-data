The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist from the start of `arr` up to and including the element at index `max_index`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `size` is `n - 1`.
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, which means the elements from the start of the list up to and including the element at index `max_index` are reversed.
- The rest of the list remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain the same.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed**.
