To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for size in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `size`, which is controlled by the `range(n, 0, -1)` function.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided is:
   - `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- **Condition on `n`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the range function will not generate any values, and the loop will not execute.
- **Initial Value of `size`**: When the loop starts, `size` will be equal to `n`.

### Final State:
Given the conditions above, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `size` will be `n` when the loop begins.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
