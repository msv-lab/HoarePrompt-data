The only objects in the loop head are variables `size` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `size` relative to 0. The loop decrements `size` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `size` was `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `size` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and the loop runs as long as `size` is greater than 0, `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the sublist from the start up to but not including the last element of `arr` is reversed, and `max_index` refers to the index of the maximum element in the original `arr[:size]` before the reversal.**
