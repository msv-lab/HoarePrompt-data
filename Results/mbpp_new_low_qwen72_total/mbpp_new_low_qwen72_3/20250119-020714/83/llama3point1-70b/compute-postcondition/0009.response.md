The only variable in the loop head is `size`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop iterates over the values of `size` from `n` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `size` was some value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` needs to be decremented by 1, ensuring it still meets the condition of being greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` before the last reversal (if any occurred).**
