The code snippet updates the value of `max_index` by finding the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`.

- The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.
- The code reassigns `max_index` to the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.

Since the code only updates `max_index` and does not modify the list `arr` or any other variables, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` (updated)**.
