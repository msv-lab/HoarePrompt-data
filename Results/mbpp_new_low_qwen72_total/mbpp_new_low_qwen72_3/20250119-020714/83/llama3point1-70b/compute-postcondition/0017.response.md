The code reverses the sublist of `arr` from the start up to and including the element at `max_index`. This means the elements before and including `max_index` are reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.

- `arr` is updated such that the sublist from the start to `max_index` inclusive is reversed.
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `size` is `n - 2` (unchanged).
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` (unchanged).

Output State: **`arr` is updated with the sublist from the start to `max_index` inclusive reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`**
