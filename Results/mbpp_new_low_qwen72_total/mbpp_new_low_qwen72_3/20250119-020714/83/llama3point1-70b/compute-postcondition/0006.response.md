Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the sublist from the start up to and including the element at index `max_index` has been reversed.***
