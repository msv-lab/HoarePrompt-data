Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` is intended to sort a list of elements, but it does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function uses a selection sort-like approach combined with reversing subarrays, which can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input list `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. The function should return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but let's analyze what happens:

1. First iteration (`size = 4`):
   - `max_index = 0` (since `4` is the maximum element).
   - Since `max_index` is `0`, no reversals are performed.
   - The list remains `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

2. Second iteration (`size = 3`):
   - `max_index = 1` (since `3` is the maximum element in the first three elements).
   - Since `max_index` is not `0`, the subarray `[4, 3]` is reversed, resulting in `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - The subarray `[3, 4, 2]` is then reversed, resulting in `[2, 4, 3, 1]`.

3. Third iteration (`size = 2`):
   - `max_index = 1` (since `4` is the maximum element in the first two elements).
   - Since `max_index` is not `0`, the subarray `[2, 4]` is reversed, resulting in `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - The subarray `[4, 2]` is then reversed, resulting in `[2, 4, 3, 1]`.

4. Fourth iteration (`size = 1`):
   - No changes are made since `size` is `1`.

The final result is `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted. Therefore, the function does not correctly sort the list for this input, making it incorrect.
