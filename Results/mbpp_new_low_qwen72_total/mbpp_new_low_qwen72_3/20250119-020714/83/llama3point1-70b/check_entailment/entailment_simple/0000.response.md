Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` implements a variant of the selection sort algorithm, where instead of swapping elements, it uses reversals to move the maximum element to its correct position. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `n` is set to the length of the input list `arr`.
2. **Loop through the array from the end to the beginning**: The outer loop iterates over the size of the unsorted portion of the array, starting from `n` down to `1`.
3. **Find the maximum element in the unsorted portion**: `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `size` elements of `arr`.
4. **Move the maximum element to the end of the unsorted portion**:
   - If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion (`max_index != size - 1`), the function performs the following steps:
     - If the maximum element is not at the beginning of the array (`max_index != 0`), it reverses the subarray from the start to `max_index + 1` to bring the maximum element to the start.
     - It then reverses the subarray from the start to `size` to move the maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.
5. **Return the sorted array**: After the loop completes, `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

The function correctly sorts the array in ascending order by repeatedly moving the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The final state of the program after the function call matches the problem description, where `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order.

Correctness: **True**
