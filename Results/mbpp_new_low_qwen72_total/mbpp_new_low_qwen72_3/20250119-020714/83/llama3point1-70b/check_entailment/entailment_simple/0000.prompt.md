Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to sort a list of elements.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, `size` is 0, and `max_index` is undefined. The loop ensures that after each iteration, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array is moved to its correct position in the sorted portion of the array. The loop iterates `n` times, once for each element in the array, and upon completion, `arr` is fully sorted in ascending order.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list `arr` which is fully sorted in ascending order, containing `n` elements.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
