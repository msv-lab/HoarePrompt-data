Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` implements a variation of the selection sort algorithm, but with a twist. Instead of directly swapping the maximum element with the last unsorted element, it reverses subarrays to move the maximum element to the end of the current segment of the array being considered. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop through the array from the end to the beginning**: The outer loop iterates from the length of the array down to 1, effectively reducing the size of the segment of the array that needs to be sorted in each iteration.
2. **Find the index of the maximum element in the current segment**: For each segment of the array (from the start to the current `size`), the function finds the index of the maximum element.
3. **Check if the maximum element is already at the end of the segment**: If the maximum element is not at the end of the current segment (`size - 1`), the function proceeds to move it there.
4. **Reverse the subarray up to and including the maximum element**: If the maximum element is not at the beginning of the array, the subarray from the start to the maximum element is reversed. This moves the maximum element to the front of this subarray.
5. **Reverse the entire segment up to the current size**: The subarray from the start to the current `size` is reversed, which moves the maximum element to the end of the segment.

This approach ensures that after each iteration of the outer loop, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position at the end of the segment. The function continues this process until the entire array is sorted.

Given the problem description, which only requires sorting the list, this function correctly sorts the list, albeit using a non-standard method. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
