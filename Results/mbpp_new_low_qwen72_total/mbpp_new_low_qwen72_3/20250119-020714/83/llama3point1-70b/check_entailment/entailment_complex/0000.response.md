Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to sort a list of elements using a variation of the selection sort algorithm. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by determining the length of the list `arr` and storing it in the variable `n`.

2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from `n` down to 1, decrementing `size` by 1 in each iteration. This loop ensures that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**: In each iteration of the outer loop, the function finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`). This is done using `max(arr[:size])` and `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`.

4. **Swapping Elements**: If the maximum element is not already in its correct position (i.e., at `size - 1`), the function performs a series of swaps:
   - If the maximum element is not at the beginning of the list, it reverses the sublist up to and including the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1]`).
   - Then, it reverses the entire unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`).

5. **Return Statement**: After the outer loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `arr`.

### Key Points:
- **Correctness of Sorting**: The function correctly identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the end of the unsorted portion. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with duplicate elements correctly. However, it assumes that all elements in the list are comparable. If the list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing integers and strings), it will raise a `TypeError`.
- **In-Place Modification**: The function modifies the list in place, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly sorts the list in ascending order and handles the specified edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
