Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` appears to be implementing a variation of the selection sort algorithm, but with a twist. Instead of swapping elements directly, it uses a series of reversals to move the maximum element to its correct position. This approach is known as the pancake sorting algorithm, which is a more complex and less efficient way to sort a list compared to traditional sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.

1. **Algorithm Understanding**:
   - The function iterates over the list from the end to the beginning (`for size in range(n, 0, -1)`).
   - For each subarray `arr[:size]`, it finds the index of the maximum element (`max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`).
   - If the maximum element is not already at the end of the subarray (`if max_index != size - 1`), it performs two reversals:
     - First, it reverses the subarray up to and including the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`).
     - Then, it reverses the entire subarray (`arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`), effectively moving the maximum element to the end of the subarray.
   - This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles empty lists correctly, as no operations will be performed.
   - Lists with duplicate elements are also handled correctly, as the algorithm only depends on the maximum element and its index.
   - The function will raise a `TypeError` if the elements in the list are not comparable, which is a reasonable limitation given that sorting requires comparison.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly sorts the list in ascending order.
   - The execution summary confirms that the function modifies the list in place and returns the sorted list.
   - The function handles edge cases as expected.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
