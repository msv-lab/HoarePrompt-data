Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a list of elements.

# Program:
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of comparable elements. It sorts the list `arr` in ascending order using a variation of the selection sort algorithm. The function modifies the list in place and returns the sorted list. After the function concludes, `arr` is fully sorted in ascending order, and contains `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the original list. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with duplicate elements correctly. However, the function does not handle non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing integers and strings) and will raise a `TypeError` if the elements in `arr` cannot be compared.
