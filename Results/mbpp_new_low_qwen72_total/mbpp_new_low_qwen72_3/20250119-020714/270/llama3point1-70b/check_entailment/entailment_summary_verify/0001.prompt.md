You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

- Program:
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. It returns the sum of all numeric values contained in the tuples within the list. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric (integers or floats). If the list `tuples` is empty, or if any of the tuples within the list are empty, the function will still execute correctly and return 0. However, if the list contains non-tuple elements or if any tuple contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and aims to find the cumulative sum of all the values in these tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and calculate the sum of its elements. This sum is then added to the overall total sum.

- The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`.
- For each tuple `t`, `sum(t)` calculates the sum of its elements.
- The outer `sum` function then sums up all the individual sums calculated by the generator expression.

This approach correctly computes the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuple list.

Correctness: **True**
