Reasoning: 

The original assessment is largely accurate, but there are a few points to consider for a thorough evaluation:

1. **Correct Computation**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the cumulative sum of all values in the given list of tuples. The use of a generator expression inside the `sum` function ensures that each tuple's sum is calculated and then summed together, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Handling Empty Lists and Tuples**: The function handles empty lists and tuples correctly. If `tuples` is an empty list, the generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` will not produce any values, and `sum` will return 0. Similarly, if any tuple within the list is empty, `sum(t)` for that tuple will return 0, and this will not affect the overall sum.

3. **Type Safety**: The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric (integers or floats). If this assumption holds true, the function will work correctly. However, if the list contains non-tuple elements or if any tuple contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This is a valid concern, but it is outside the scope of the problem description, which assumes valid inputs.

4. **Function Summary Accuracy**: The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function will handle empty lists and tuples and will raise a `TypeError` for invalid inputs.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and behaves correctly under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
