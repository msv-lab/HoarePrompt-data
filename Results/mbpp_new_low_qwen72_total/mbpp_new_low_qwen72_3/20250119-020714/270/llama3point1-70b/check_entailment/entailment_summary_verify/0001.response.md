Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior and its correctness in calculating the cumulative sum of all values in the provided list of tuples. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Function Signature and Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`. For each tuple, `sum(t)` calculates the sum of its elements. This part of the function is correct and efficient, as it avoids creating intermediate lists and directly computes the sum on-the-fly.

3. **Outer Sum Function**: The outer `sum` function then sums up all the individual sums calculated by the generator expression. This effectively computes the cumulative sum of all numeric values across all tuples in the list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If the list `tuples` is empty, the generator expression will not produce any values, and the `sum` function will return 0, which is the correct behavior.
   - **Empty Tuples**: If any of the tuples within the list are empty, `sum(t)` for those tuples will return 0, and they will not affect the overall sum.
   - **Non-Numeric Values**: The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric. If this assumption is violated, a `TypeError` will be raised. This is a reasonable assumption given the problem description, and the function summary correctly states this behavior.

5. **Correctness**: The function correctly implements the logic to find the cumulative sum of all the values in the given list of tuples. The original assessment accurately describes the function's behavior and confirms its correctness.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
