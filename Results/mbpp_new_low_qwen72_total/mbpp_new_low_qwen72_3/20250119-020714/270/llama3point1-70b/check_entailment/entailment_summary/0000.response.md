Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all numeric values in a list of tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum their elements. This approach is efficient and concise.

Based on the execution summary:
- The function correctly handles an empty list by returning 0.
- The function correctly handles empty tuples within the list by summing them as 0.
- The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric (integers or floats), which aligns with the problem description.

However, the function does not handle cases where the list contains non-tuple elements or where tuples contain non-numeric values. While this is mentioned in the execution summary, it is not explicitly stated in the problem description that these cases should be handled. Therefore, if we assume that the input is always a list of tuples containing numeric values, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
