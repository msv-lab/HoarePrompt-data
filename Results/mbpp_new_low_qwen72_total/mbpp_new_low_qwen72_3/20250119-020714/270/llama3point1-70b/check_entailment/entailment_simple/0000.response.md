Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples (`tuples`) as an argument. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and calculates the sum of each tuple individually. These individual sums are then summed up to produce the final result, which is the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuples.

The comment indicates that the program is supposed to return the sum of all numeric values contained in the tuples within the list `tuples`. The implementation of the function matches this description perfectly, as it correctly computes the total sum of all elements across all tuples.

Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description and the intended behavior.

Correctness: **True**
