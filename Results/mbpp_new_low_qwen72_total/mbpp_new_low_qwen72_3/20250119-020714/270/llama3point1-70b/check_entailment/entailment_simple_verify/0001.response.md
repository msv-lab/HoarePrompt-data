Reasoning: 
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the `func_1` function. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values. This is correctly stated in the annotated code.

2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`. For each tuple, `sum(t)` calculates the sum of its elements. This part is correctly implemented and described in both the code and the original assessment.

3. **Outer Sum Function**: The outer `sum` function then sums up all the individual sums calculated by the generator expression. This ensures that the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuples is computed correctly.

4. **Correctness**: The function correctly computes the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuple list, as verified by the annotations and the logical flow of the code.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
