Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the cumulative sum of all the values present in the given tuple list. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function expects `tuples` to be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Inner Sum Calculation**: For each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`, the inner `sum(t)` calculates the sum of the elements within that tuple. This is done using a generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)`.

3. **Outer Sum Calculation**: The outer `sum` function then sums up the results of the inner sums, effectively giving the cumulative sum of all values across all tuples.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If `tuples` is an empty list, the generator expression will not yield any values, and `sum` will return 0, which is the correct result.
   - **Empty Tuples**: If any tuple in `tuples` is empty, `sum(t)` for that tuple will return 0, and this will not affect the overall sum.

5. **Correctness**: The function correctly handles all potential cases, including empty lists and tuples, and it works as expected according to the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
