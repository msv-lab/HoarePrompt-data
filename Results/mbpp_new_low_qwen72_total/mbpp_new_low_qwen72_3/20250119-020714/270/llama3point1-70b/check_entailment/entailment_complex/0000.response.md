Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all numeric values present in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function, which iterates over each tuple in the list and computes the sum of its elements. This approach is correct and efficient for the given problem statement.

However, the function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric (integers or floats). If this assumption holds true, the function will work correctly. If the list `tuples` is empty, the function will return 0, which is the expected behavior. Similarly, if any of the tuples within the list are empty, the function will also return 0, which is also correct.

The function will raise a `TypeError` if the list contains non-tuple elements or if any tuple contains non-numeric values. Since the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can consider these cases as outside the scope of the problem.

Given the assumptions and the problem description, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
