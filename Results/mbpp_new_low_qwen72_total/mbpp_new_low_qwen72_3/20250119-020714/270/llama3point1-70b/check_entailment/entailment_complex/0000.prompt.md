Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all numeric values contained in the tuples within the list 'tuples'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. It returns the sum of all numeric values contained in the tuples within the list. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are numeric (integers or floats). If the list `tuples` is empty, or if any of the tuples within the list are empty, the function will still execute correctly and return 0. However, if the list contains non-tuple elements or if any tuple contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
