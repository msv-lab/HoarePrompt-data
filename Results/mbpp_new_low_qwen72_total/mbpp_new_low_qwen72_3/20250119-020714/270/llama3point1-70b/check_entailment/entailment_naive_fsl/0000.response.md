Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly computes the cumulative sum of all the values present in the given tuple list. It iterates over each tuple in the list, calculates the sum of each tuple, and then sums these results to get the final cumulative sum. This approach handles all potential cases, including empty lists and tuples, and works as expected according to the problem description.
