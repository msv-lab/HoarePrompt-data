Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and aims to find the cumulative sum of all the values in these tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and calculate the sum of its elements. This sum is then added to the overall total sum.

- The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`.
- For each tuple `t`, `sum(t)` calculates the sum of its elements.
- The outer `sum` function then sums up all the individual sums calculated by the generator expression.

This approach correctly computes the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuple list.

Correctness: **True**
