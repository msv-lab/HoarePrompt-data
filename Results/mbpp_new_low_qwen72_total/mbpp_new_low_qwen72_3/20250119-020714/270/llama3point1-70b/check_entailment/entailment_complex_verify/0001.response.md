Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all numeric values present in a list of tuples. The provided code and annotations support this functionality:

1. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` correctly iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`. For each tuple, `sum(t)` calculates the sum of its elements. This part of the code is logically sound and performs as intended.

2. **Outer Sum Function**: The outer `sum` function then aggregates these individual sums into a single cumulative sum. This step is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `tuples` is an empty list, the generator expression will not produce any values, and `sum` will return 0, which is the correct behavior.
   - If any tuple within `tuples` is empty, `sum(t)` will return 0 for that tuple, and it will not affect the overall sum.
   - If `tuples` contains non-tuple elements or if any tuple contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` will be raised. However, the problem description assumes valid inputs, so this scenario is outside the scope of the current assessment.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` behaves as expected and correctly computes the cumulative sum of all numeric values in the list of tuples.

Final: **True**
