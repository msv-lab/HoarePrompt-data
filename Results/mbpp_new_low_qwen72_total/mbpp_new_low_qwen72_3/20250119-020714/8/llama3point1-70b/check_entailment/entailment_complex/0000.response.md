Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The logic implemented in the function is mostly correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Syntax Error**: There is a syntax error in the line where the function returns the modified string when the character appears more than once. The line is cut off and incomplete:
   ```python
   return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
   ```
   This should be a single line without any truncation.

2. **Handling of Empty Strings and Multi-Character Inputs**: The function correctly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is not found in `s`. However, the problem description specifies that `char` is a single character string, so the edge case of `char` being a multi-character string is not relevant to the correctness of the function as per the problem statement.

3. **Single Occurrence Handling**: When `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function correctly removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

4. **Multiple Occurrences Handling**: When `char` appears more than once, the function correctly constructs a new string by removing the first and last occurrences.

Given these points, the function is almost correct, but the syntax error must be fixed for the function to work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1):
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence):
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

With this correction, the function should work correctly according to the problem description.
