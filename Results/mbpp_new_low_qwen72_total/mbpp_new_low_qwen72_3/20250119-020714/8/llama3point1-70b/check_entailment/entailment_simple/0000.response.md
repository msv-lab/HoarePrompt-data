Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character `char` from the string `s`. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function correctly uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Single Occurrence**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is correct because it ensures that only one instance of `char` is removed.

3. **Multiple Occurrences**: If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by:
   - Concatenating the substring before the first occurrence.
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences.
   - The substring after the last occurrence.
   This approach effectively removes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.

4. **No Occurrence**: If the character `char` is not found in the string (both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are -1), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged, which is the correct behavior.

Given these points, the function appears to handle all edge cases correctly and performs the required operations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
