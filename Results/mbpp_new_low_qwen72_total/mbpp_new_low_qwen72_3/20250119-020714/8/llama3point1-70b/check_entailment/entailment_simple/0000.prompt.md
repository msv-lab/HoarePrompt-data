Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)

last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. Since `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, this means the only occurrence of `char` in `s` is removed.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string that is the concatenation of: the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`, the substring of `s` from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`, and the substring of `s` from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end. This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' which may or may not contain the character 'char'. If 'char' is present in 's', 'first_occurrence' is the index of its first appearance, and 'last_occurrence' is the index of its last appearance; otherwise, both 'first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' are -1.
