Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `str.find()` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character and `str.rfind()` to find the index of the last occurrence.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is not found in the string (`find` and `rfind` both return `-1`), the original string is returned unchanged.
   - If the character is found only once (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `str.replace(char, '', 1)`.
3. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**: If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.

This approach ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are removed correctly, and the rest of the string remains intact.

Correctness: **True**
