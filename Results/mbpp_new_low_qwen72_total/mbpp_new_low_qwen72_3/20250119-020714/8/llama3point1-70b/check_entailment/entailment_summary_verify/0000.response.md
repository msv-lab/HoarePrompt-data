### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the function `func_1` step by step using the provided function summary and the original assessment:

1. **Function Parameters and Return Values:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `char`.
   - It returns a modified version of `s` based on the presence and position of `char`.

2. **Behavior Based on Function Summary:**
   - **Case 1: `char` is not found in `s`:**
     - The function returns `s` unchanged.
     - This is handled correctly by the condition `if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:`. If `char` is not found, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be `-1`, and the function will return `s` unchanged.

   - **Case 2: `char` appears exactly once in `s`:**
     - The function returns `s` with that single occurrence of `char` removed.
     - This is handled correctly by the condition `if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:`. If `char` appears only once, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be the same index, and the function will remove that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

   - **Case 3: `char` appears more than once in `s`:**
     - The function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
     - This is handled correctly by the condition `else:`. If `char` appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by slicing `s` to exclude the first and last occurrences of `char`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty String (`s` is an empty string):**
     - The function will return an empty string, which is correct.
   - **Empty Character (`char` is an empty string):**
     - The function will return `s` unchanged, which is correct because `find` and `rfind` will not find an empty string as a valid character.
   - **Multi-Character String (`char` is a multi-character string):**
     - The function will treat `char` as a single character and attempt to find it in `s`. If `char` is a multi-character string, this will not match any single character in `s`, and the function will return `s` unchanged. This behavior is consistent with the function's design, although it might be unexpected if the user intended to search for a substring.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly handles the removal of the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string `s`.
   - The assessment also mentions that the function covers all potential cases, including when the character appears only once, multiple times, or not at all in the string.

### Final Evaluation:
The function `func_1` behaves as expected according to the problem description and the function summary. It correctly handles all edge cases and the main logic for removing the first and last occurrences of a character. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
