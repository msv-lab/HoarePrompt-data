Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's break down the function and its behavior based on the provided function summary and edge cases:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `str.find()` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character and `str.rfind()` to find the index of the last occurrence.
   - If the character is not found (`find` and `rfind` both return `-1`), the original string is returned unchanged. This is correct according to the function summary.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is found only once (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `str.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is also correct as it removes the single occurrence of the character.
   - If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string, which is consistent with the function summary.
   - If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `find` and `rfind` will not find an empty string as a valid character. This is also correct.
   - If `char` is a multi-character string, the function will treat it as a single character and attempt to find it in `s`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the multi-character string is not found as a whole, but this is an edge case that the function summary already notes.

3. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**:
   - If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence. This is done using slicing and concatenation, which is correct according to the function summary.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` behaves as expected for all described cases and edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
