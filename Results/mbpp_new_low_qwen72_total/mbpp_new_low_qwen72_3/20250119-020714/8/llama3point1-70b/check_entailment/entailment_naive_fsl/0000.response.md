Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(s, char)` correctly handles the removal of the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string `s`. It uses `find` to locate the first occurrence and `rfind` to locate the last occurrence of the character. If both occurrences are found, it checks if they are the same position and removes only one instance if they are, or removes both instances if they are different. If the character is not found, the original string is returned unchanged. This approach covers all potential cases, including when the character appears only once, multiple times, or not at all in the string.
