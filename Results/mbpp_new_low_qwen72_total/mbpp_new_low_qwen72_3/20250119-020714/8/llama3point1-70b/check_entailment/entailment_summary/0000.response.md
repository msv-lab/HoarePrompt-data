Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly handles the main cases as described in the problem statement:

1. **Character Not Found**: If the character `char` is not found in the string `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. This is handled by checking if `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are both `-1`.
2. **Single Occurrence**: If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function removes that single occurrence. This is achieved by checking if `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence` and using `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove one instance of `char`.
3. **Multiple Occurrences**: If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function removes the first and last occurrences of `char`. This is done by slicing the string to exclude the first and last occurrences.

However, there are a few edge cases to consider:

- **Empty String `s`**: The function correctly returns an empty string if `s` is empty.
- **Empty String `char`**: The function will return `s` unchanged if `char` is an empty string, which is reasonable since an empty string cannot be a valid character to search for.
- **Multi-Character `char`**: The function treats `char` as a single character, so if `char` is a multi-character string, it will not behave as expected. However, this is outside the scope of the problem description, which specifies that `char` should be a single character.

Given these considerations, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
