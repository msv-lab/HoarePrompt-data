Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(s, char)` correctly implements the logic to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string `s`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char`. These methods return `-1` if the character is not found, which is correctly handled in the code.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**: If `char` is not found in `s` (i.e., both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are `-1`), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Handling Single Occurrence**: If `char` appears exactly once in `s` (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is also correct.

4. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function constructs a new string by concatenating:
   - The substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`.
   - The substring from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`.
   - The substring from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s`.

   This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`, which is the desired behavior.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string, which is correct.
   - If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged, which is correct since an empty string is not a valid character to search for.
   - If `char` is a multi-character string, the function will treat it as a single character and attempt to find it in `s`. While this might lead to unexpected behavior, it is consistent with the function's design, and such input is not expected according to the problem description.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
