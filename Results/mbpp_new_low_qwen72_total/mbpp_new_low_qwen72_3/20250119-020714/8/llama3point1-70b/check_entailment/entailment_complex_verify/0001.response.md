Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's break down the function step by step to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)`: This line finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `char` is not found in `s` (both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are `-1`), the function returns `s` unchanged.
   - If `char` is found only once (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

3. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**:
   - If `char` appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`.
     - The substring of `s` from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`.
     - The substring of `s` from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end.

Let's consider the edge cases mentioned in the annotated code:
- **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string, which is correct.
- **Empty Character**: If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged, which is correct because `find` and `rfind` will not find an empty string as a valid character.
- **Multi-character String**: If `char` is a multi-character string, the function will treat it as a single character and attempt to find it in `s`. This is a potential issue, but since the problem description specifies that `char` is a single character, this case is not applicable.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string `s`.

Final: **True**
