Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string `s`. Let's break down the function and verify each part against the provided annotations and problem description:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is not found in the string (`first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are both `-1`), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. This is correct because there is nothing to remove.
   - If the character is found only once (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is also correct because it removes the only occurrence of `char`.

3. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**:
   - If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring from the start up to but not including the first occurrence of `char` (`s[:first_occurrence]`).
     - Concatenating the substring from immediately after the first occurrence up to but not including the last occurrence of `char` (`s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`).
     - Concatenating the substring from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end (`s[last_occurrence + 1:]`).

This approach ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are removed, and the rest of the string remains intact.

**Verification Using Annotations**:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and align with the intended behavior of the function.
- The function handles all edge cases and normal cases as described in the annotations and the original assessment.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
