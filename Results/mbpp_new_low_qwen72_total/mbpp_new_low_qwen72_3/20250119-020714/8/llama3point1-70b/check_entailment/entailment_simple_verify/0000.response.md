Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(s, char)` correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the specified character `char` in the string `s` using `find` and `rfind` methods. It then handles three main scenarios:
1. If the character is not found (`first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are both `-1`), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.
2. If the character is found only once (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `replace` with a count of 1.
3. If the character is found more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence, effectively removing both the first and last occurrences of the character.

The annotated code confirms that each step is logically sound and correctly implemented. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
