#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)

last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. Since `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, this means the only occurrence of `char` in `s` is removed.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string that is the concatenation of: the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`, the substring of `s` from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`, and the substring of `s` from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end. This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' which may or may not contain the character 'char'. If 'char' is present in 's', 'first_occurrence' is the index of its first appearance, and 'last_occurrence' is the index of its last appearance; otherwise, both 'first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' are -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a modified version of `s` based on the presence and position of `char` within `s`:

1. If `char` is not found in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged.
2. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function returns `s` with that single occurrence of `char` removed.
3. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. 

Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged because `find` and `rfind` will not find an empty string as a valid character.
- If `char` is a multi-character string, the function will still treat it as a single character and attempt to find it in `s`, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the multi-character string is not found as a whole.
