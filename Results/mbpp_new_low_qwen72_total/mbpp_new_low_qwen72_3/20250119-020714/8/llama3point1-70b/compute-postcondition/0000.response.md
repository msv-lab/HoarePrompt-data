The provided code snippet searches for the first and last occurrence of a specified character `char` within the string `s`. The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found. Similarly, the `rfind` method returns the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.

- If `char` is present in `s`, `first_occurrence` will hold the index of the first occurrence, and `last_occurrence` will hold the index of the last occurrence.
- If `char` is not present in `s`, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be -1.

No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **s is a string, char is a single character string, first_occurrence is the index of the first occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found), last_occurrence is the index of the last occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found)**
