The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `char` (a single character string). The function returns different results based on the presence and positions of `char` in `s`:

- **Case_1**: If `char` occurs exactly once in `s`, the function returns `s` with the first (and only) occurrence of `char` removed.
- **Case_2**: If `char` occurs more than once in `s`, the function returns a new string that is the concatenation of the substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`, the substring from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`, and the substring from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s`.
- **Case_3**: If `char` does not occur in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed if `char` appears exactly once. If `char` appears more than once, it returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns the original string `s`.**
