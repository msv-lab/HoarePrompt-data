Output State: **The program returns a new string that is the concatenation of: the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`, the substring of `s` from immediately after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`, and the substring of `s` from immediately after the last occurrence of `char` to the end. This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`.**
