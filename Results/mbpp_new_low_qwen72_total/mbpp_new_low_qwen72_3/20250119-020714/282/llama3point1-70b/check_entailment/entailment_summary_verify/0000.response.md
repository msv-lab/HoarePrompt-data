Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation results in the original string being returned due to the sequence of operations:

1. The first `replace` call converts all spaces to underscores.
2. The second `replace` call converts all underscores back to spaces.
3. The third `replace` call converts all spaces back to underscores.

This sequence of operations means that the final result is the same as the original string. Therefore, the function does not achieve the desired behavior of swapping spaces and underscores.

The function should only need to perform two replacements to achieve the correct behavior:

1. Replace all spaces with a temporary character that does not appear in the string.
2. Replace all underscores with spaces.
3. Replace the temporary character with underscores.

However, the provided function does not follow this logic and instead cancels out its own operations.

Final: **False**
