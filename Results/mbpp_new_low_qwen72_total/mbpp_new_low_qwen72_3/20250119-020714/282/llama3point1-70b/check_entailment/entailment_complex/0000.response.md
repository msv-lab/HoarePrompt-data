Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` has a logical flaw. The function is supposed to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation first replaces all spaces with underscores, then it replaces all underscores (which were originally spaces) back to spaces, and finally, it replaces all spaces (which are now the original spaces plus those that were converted back from underscores) with underscores again. This results in the original string being returned unchanged, which is not the intended behavior.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
