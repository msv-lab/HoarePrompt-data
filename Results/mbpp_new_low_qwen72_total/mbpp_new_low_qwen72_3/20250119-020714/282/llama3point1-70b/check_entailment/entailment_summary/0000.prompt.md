Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.

# Program:
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    s = s.replace(' ', '_')
    s = s.replace('_', ' ')
    s = s.replace(' ', '_')
    return s





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string, and returns the string `s` where all spaces have been replaced with underscores (_). However, due to a logical error in the code, the function first replaces all spaces with underscores, then replaces all underscores with spaces, and finally replaces all spaces with underscores again. As a result, the final output is the same as the initial input, meaning the function effectively does nothing to the input string `s`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
