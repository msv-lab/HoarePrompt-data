Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation has a logical flaw. The sequence of operations in the function is:

1. Replace all spaces (' ') with underscores ('_').
2. Replace all underscores ('_') with spaces (' ').
3. Replace all spaces (' ') with underscores ('_') again.

This sequence of operations means that any space that was initially present will be replaced with an underscore, but then immediately converted back to a space, and then back to an underscore again. This results in the original spaces being replaced with underscores, but any underscores that were originally in the string will be left unchanged. Therefore, the function does not achieve the intended goal of swapping spaces and underscores.

Given the problem description, the function should swap spaces and underscores, not just replace spaces with underscores. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
