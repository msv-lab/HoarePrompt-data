Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation will always result in the original string because the first and third `replace` calls effectively cancel each other out. For example, if the input string is `"Hello World"`, the first `replace` call will change it to `"Hello_World"`, the second `replace` call will change it to `"Hello World"`, and the third `replace` call will change it back to `"Hello_World"`. This means that the function does not correctly handle the replacement as described in the problem statement. A correct implementation would only require two `replace` calls without the redundant third one.
