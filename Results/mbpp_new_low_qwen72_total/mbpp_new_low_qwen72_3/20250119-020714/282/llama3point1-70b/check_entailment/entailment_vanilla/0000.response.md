Reasoning:  
The given function `func_1` aims to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string. However, the implementation has a logical flaw. The first `replace` call replaces all spaces with underscores, which is correct for the first part of the task. The second `replace` call then replaces all underscores (which now include both the original underscores and the newly replaced ones) with spaces. This effectively undoes the first replacement, making the string revert to its original form. The third `replace` call again replaces spaces with underscores, but since the string is back to its original form after the second call, this only affects the original spaces, not the original underscores.

To correctly implement the desired functionality, the function should replace spaces with underscores and then replace the original underscores with spaces in a single pass. A more efficient approach would be to use a translation table or a loop to handle both replacements simultaneously.

Given the current implementation, the function will only correctly replace the original spaces with underscores, but it will not replace the original underscores with spaces, leading to incorrect results for strings containing underscores.

Correctness: **False**
