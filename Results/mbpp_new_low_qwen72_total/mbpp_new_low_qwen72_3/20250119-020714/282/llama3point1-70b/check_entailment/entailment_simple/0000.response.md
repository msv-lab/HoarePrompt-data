Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to replace all spaces with underscores and all underscores with spaces in the input string `s`. However, the current implementation has a logical error. The first `replace` call correctly replaces all spaces with underscores. The second `replace` call then replaces all underscores (which were originally spaces) back to spaces, effectively undoing the first replacement for those characters. The third `replace` call again replaces all spaces (including those that were originally underscores) with underscores, but this means that the original underscores will be incorrectly converted to spaces and then back to underscores, while the original spaces will be converted to underscores and then back to spaces.

To fix this, the function should perform both replacements in a single pass, which can be achieved by using a translation table or by splitting and joining the string. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return s.translate(str.maketrans(' _', '_ '))
```

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly swap spaces and underscores as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
