The first line replaces all spaces in the string `s` with underscores (`_`). The second line then replaces all underscores (`_`) back with spaces. The third line again replaces all spaces with underscores (`_`). Since the second and third operations are inverse followed by the same operation again, the net effect is the same as just performing the first operation.

Output State: **s is a string where all spaces have been replaced with underscores (_)**
