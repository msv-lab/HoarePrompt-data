The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence starts with the initial values [3, 0, 2], and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the initial segment of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, which is 3, 3, or 5 respectively. For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function computes the full Perrin sequence up to the nth term and returns the sum of all terms in the sequence.
