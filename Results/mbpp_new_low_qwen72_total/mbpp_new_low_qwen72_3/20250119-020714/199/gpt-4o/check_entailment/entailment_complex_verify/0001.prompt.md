You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `perrin` is a list of length `n + 1` where the elements are `[3, 0, 2, perrin[3], perrin[4], ..., perrin[n]]` and each `perrin[i]` for `i >= 3` is `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, and the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2]. Each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence starts with the initial values [3, 0, 2], and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the initial segment of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, which is 3, 3, or 5 respectively. For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function computes the full Perrin sequence up to the nth term and returns the sum of all terms in the sequence.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to a given index `n`. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
- \( P(0) = 3 \)
- \( P(1) = 0 \)
- \( P(2) = 2 \)
- \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \) for \( n > 2 \)

The function starts with a list `perrin` initialized to `[3, 0, 2]`, which correctly represents the first three Perrin numbers. It then iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive), appending each new Perrin number to the list by summing the appropriate previous elements. Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
1. For `n = 9`, the Perrin sequence up to index 9 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49 \).
2. For `n = 10`, the Perrin sequence up to index 10 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 66 \).
3. For `n = 11`, the Perrin sequence up to index 11 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 17 = 88 \).

All test cases match the expected results, and the function logic correctly generates the Perrin sequence and sums its elements.

Correctness: **True**
