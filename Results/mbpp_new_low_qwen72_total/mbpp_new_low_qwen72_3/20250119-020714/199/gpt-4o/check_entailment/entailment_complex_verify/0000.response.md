Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for the calculation of the nth Perrin number, but the provided function calculates the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the nth term. This is a significant discrepancy because the outputs are fundamentally different. For instance, the 10th Perrin number is 12, but the sum of the first 10 Perrin numbers is 66, as noted in the original assessment. Therefore, the function does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
