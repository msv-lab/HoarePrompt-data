Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but the problem description only asks for the calculation of the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term. This discrepancy means the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. For example, the expected output for `func_1(10)` should be the 10th Perrin number, which is 12, not the sum of the first 10 Perrin numbers (which is 66). Therefore, the function is incorrect.
