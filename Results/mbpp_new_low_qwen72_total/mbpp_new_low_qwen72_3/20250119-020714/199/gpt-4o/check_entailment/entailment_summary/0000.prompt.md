Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence starts with the initial values [3, 0, 2], and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the initial segment of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, which is 3, 3, or 5 respectively. For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function computes the full Perrin sequence up to the nth term and returns the sum of all terms in the sequence.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
