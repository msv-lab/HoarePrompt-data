Reasoning:  
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the first `n + 1` terms of the Perrin sequence. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
- \( P(0) = 3 \)
- \( P(1) = 0 \)
- \( P(2) = 2 \)
- \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \) for \( n \geq 3 \)

The function `func_1` initializes the first three terms of the Perrin sequence and then iterates from 3 to `n`, appending each new term to the list `perrin`. Finally, it returns the sum of all terms in the list.

The provided test cases:
- `func_1(9)` should return the sum of the first 10 terms of the Perrin sequence.
- `func_1(10)` should return the sum of the first 11 terms of the Perrin sequence.
- `func_1(11)` should return the sum of the first 12 terms of the Perrin sequence.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, computing the Perrin sequence correctly and returning the sum of the sequence up to the nth term. The function also handles the case where `n` is less than 0 by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the correct implementation and the passing test cases, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
