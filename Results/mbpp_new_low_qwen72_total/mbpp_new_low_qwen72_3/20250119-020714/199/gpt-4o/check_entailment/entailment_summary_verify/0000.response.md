Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a mismatch between the problem description and the implemented function. The problem description asks for the calculation of the nth Perrin number, whereas the provided function `func_1` calculates the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. This discrepancy is significant because the outputs for specific values of `n` will differ between the two interpretations. For instance, the 10th Perrin number is 12, but the sum of the first 10 Perrin numbers is 66. Therefore, the function `func_1` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
