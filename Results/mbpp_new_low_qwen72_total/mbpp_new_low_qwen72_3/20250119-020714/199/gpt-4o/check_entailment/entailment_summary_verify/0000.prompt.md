You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence starts with the initial values [3, 0, 2], and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the initial segment of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, which is 3, 3, or 5 respectively. For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function computes the full Perrin sequence up to the nth term and returns the sum of all terms in the sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but the problem description only asks for the calculation of the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term. This discrepancy means the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. For example, the expected output for `func_1(10)` should be the 10th Perrin number, which is 12, not the sum of the first 10 Perrin numbers (which is 66). Therefore, the function is incorrect.
