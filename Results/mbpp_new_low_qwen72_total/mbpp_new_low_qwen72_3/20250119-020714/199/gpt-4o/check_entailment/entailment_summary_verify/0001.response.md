Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose of the function `func_1` and its implementation. The function initializes the Perrin sequence with the correct starting values `[3, 0, 2]` and correctly computes subsequent terms by summing the appropriate previous elements. The function also correctly handles the case where `n` is less than 0 by returning 0, and it computes the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term.

The provided test cases are verified and match the expected results:
1. For `n = 9`, the sum of the Perrin sequence up to index 9 is indeed 49.
2. For `n = 10`, the sum of the Perrin sequence up to index 10 is indeed 66.
3. For `n = 11`, the sum of the Perrin sequence up to index 11 is indeed 88.

These results align with the function summary, which describes the function's behavior accurately. The function logic is sound and the implementation correctly follows the definition of the Perrin sequence.

Final: **True**
