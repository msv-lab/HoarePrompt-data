You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence starts with the initial values [3, 0, 2], and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the initial segment of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, which is 3, 3, or 5 respectively. For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function computes the full Perrin sequence up to the nth term and returns the sum of all terms in the sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to a given index `n`. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
- \( P(0) = 3 \)
- \( P(1) = 0 \)
- \( P(2) = 2 \)
- \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \) for \( n > 2 \)

The function starts with a list `perrin` initialized to `[3, 0, 2]`, which correctly represents the first three Perrin numbers. It then iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive), appending each new Perrin number to the list by summing the appropriate previous elements. Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
1. For `n = 9`, the Perrin sequence up to index 9 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49 \).
2. For `n = 10`, the Perrin sequence up to index 10 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 66 \).
3. For `n = 11`, the Perrin sequence up to index 11 is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]`. The sum of these numbers is \( 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 17 = 88 \).

All test cases match the expected results, and the function logic correctly generates the Perrin sequence and sums its elements.

Correctness: **True**
