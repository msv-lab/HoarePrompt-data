### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function begins by checking if `n` is less than 0. If it is, the function returns 0. This is a reasonable check because the problem statement specifies that `n` should be a non-negative integer. However, since the problem description and the state of the program indicate that `n` is always non-negative, this check is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the function.

2. **Perrin Sequence Initialization**: The Perrin sequence is initialized with the first three terms `[3, 0, 2]`. This is correct according to the definition of the Perrin sequence.

3. **Loop for Generating Perrin Numbers**: The loop iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive) and appends the next Perrin number to the list. The formula used to generate the next Perrin number is `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`, which is correct according to the definition of the Perrin sequence.

4. **Sum Calculation**: After the loop, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list. This is consistent with the problem statement, which asks for the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the `n`-th term.

5. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, `func_1(11) == 88`) are correct and match the expected output for the given inputs.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The test cases also confirm that the function works as expected.

Correctness: **True**
