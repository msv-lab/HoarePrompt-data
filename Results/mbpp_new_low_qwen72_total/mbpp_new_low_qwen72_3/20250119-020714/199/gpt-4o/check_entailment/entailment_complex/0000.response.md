Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if `n` is negative. Since the problem specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, the check `if (n < 0)` is a safety measure. If `n` is negative, the function returns 0, which is appropriate as the Perrin sequence is not defined for negative indices.

2. **Initialization**: The Perrin sequence is initialized with the first three terms `[3, 0, 2]`. This is correct according to the definition of the Perrin sequence.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive. For each index `i`, the next term in the Perrin sequence is calculated as `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]` and appended to the list `perrin`. This correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Perrin sequence.

4. **Sum Calculation**: After the loop, the function returns the sum of the entire `perrin` list. This is consistent with the problem statement, which asks for the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the nth term.

5. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, `func_1(11) == 88`) are correct and match the expected output for the given input values.

Given these points, the function appears to be implemented correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
