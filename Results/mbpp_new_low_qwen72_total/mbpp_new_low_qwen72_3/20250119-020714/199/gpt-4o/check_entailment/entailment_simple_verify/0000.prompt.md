You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `perrin` is a list of length `n + 1` where the elements are `[3, 0, 2, perrin[3], perrin[4], ..., perrin[n]]` and each `perrin[i]` for `i >= 3` is `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, and the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2]. Each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but the problem description only asks for the calculation of the nth Perrin number, not the sum of all Perrin numbers up to the nth term. This discrepancy means the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. For example, the expected output for `func_1(10)` should be the 10th Perrin number, which is 12, not the sum of the first 10 Perrin numbers (which is 66). Therefore, the function is incorrect.
