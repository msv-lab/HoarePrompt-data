To determine the output state after all the executions of the given loop, we need to follow the steps outlined and analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and code.

### Initial State:
- `perrin = [3, 0, 2]`
- `n` is a non-negative integer and `n >= 0`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, the loop appends the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3` of the list `perrin` to the end of the list `perrin`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - The variable `perrin` is updated in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - The loop index `i` increments from 3 to `n`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute if `n >= 3`.
   - If `n < 3`, the loop will not execute, and `perrin` will remain `[3, 0, 2]`.
   - For each iteration, the new element appended to `perrin` is the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop executes, the length of `perrin` will be `n + 1` because the loop appends one new element for each value of `i` from 3 to `n`.
   - The relationship between the elements of `perrin` will follow the rule defined in the loop.

### Final Output State:
- **If `n < 3`**:
  - The loop does not execute.
  - Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`**.

- **If `n >= 3`**:
  - The loop executes `n - 2` times.
  - After the loop, the length of `perrin` will be `n + 1`.
  - The elements of `perrin` will be the initial three elements followed by the sums of the previous elements as defined by the loop.

### Example Calculation for `n = 5`:
- Initial state: `perrin = [3, 0, 2]`
- Iteration 1 (`i = 3`): `perrin[3] = perrin[1] + perrin[0] = 0 + 3 = 3` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3]`
- Iteration 2 (`i = 4`): `perrin[4] = perrin[2] + perrin[1] = 2 + 0 = 2` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`
- Iteration 3 (`i = 5`): `perrin[5] = perrin[3] + perrin[2] = 3 + 2 = 5` → `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`

### General Output State:
- **If `n < 3`**:
  - Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`**.

- **If `n >= 3`**:
  - Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `perrin` is a list of length `n + 1` where the elements are `[3, 0, 2, perrin[3], perrin[4], ..., perrin[n]]` and each `perrin[i]` for `i >= 3` is `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`**.

Therefore, the final output state is:
**Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `n >= 3`, `perrin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `perrin[i]` for `i >= 3` is `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`; if `n < 3`, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`.**
