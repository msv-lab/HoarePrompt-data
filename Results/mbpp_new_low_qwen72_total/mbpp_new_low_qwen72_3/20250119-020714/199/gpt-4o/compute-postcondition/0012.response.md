The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 3, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, where the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2] and each subsequent term is the sum of the terms two places and three places back in the sequence.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than 3, it returns 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it returns the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the nth term.**
