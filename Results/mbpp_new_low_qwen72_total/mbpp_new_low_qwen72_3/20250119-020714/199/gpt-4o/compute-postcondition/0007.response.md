The value of `perrin[i - 2]` is `perrin[2]`, which is 2, and the value of `perrin[i - 3]` is `perrin[1]`, which is 0. Therefore, `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` appends the value 2 + 0, which is 2, to the list `perrin`. The new value of `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`, `i` is 4**
