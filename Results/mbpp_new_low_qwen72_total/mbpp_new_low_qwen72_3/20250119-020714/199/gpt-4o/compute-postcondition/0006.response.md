The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`, `i` is 4**
