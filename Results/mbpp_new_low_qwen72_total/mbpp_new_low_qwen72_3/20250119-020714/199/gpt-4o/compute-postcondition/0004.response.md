To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the initial state.

Given:
- `perrin` is initialized with the values `[3, 0, 2]`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer (i.e., `n` is greater than or equal to 0).

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over the range from 3 to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute if there is at least one value in the range from 3 to `n`.
2. **Range Condition**: For the range `range(3, n + 1)` to contain at least one value, `n + 1` must be greater than 3. This simplifies to `n` being greater than or equal to 3.
3. **Initial State**: The list `perrin` is already initialized with `[3, 0, 2]`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `i` will start at 3, and the list `perrin` will remain `[3, 0, 2]`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2]`, `i` is 3**.
