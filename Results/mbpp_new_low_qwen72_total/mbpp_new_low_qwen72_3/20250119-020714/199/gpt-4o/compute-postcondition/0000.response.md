Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, and the current value of n is less than 0*** 

However, this postcondition is logically inconsistent because a non-negative integer cannot be less than 0. Given the precondition, the if condition `if (n < 0)` would never be true, so the program would never enter the if block. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the postcondition, considering the given precondition, is:

Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, and the if condition `(n < 0)` is false***
