The code appends the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3` of the list `perrin` to the end of the list `perrin`. Given that `i` is 3, the elements at indices 1 and 0 are used, which are 0 and 3, respectively. The sum of these elements (0 + 3) is 3, which is appended to the list `perrin`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`, `i` is 3**.
