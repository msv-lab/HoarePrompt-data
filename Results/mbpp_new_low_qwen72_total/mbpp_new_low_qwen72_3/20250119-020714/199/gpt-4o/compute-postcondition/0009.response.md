The value of `perrin[i - 2]` is `perrin[3]`, which is 3, and the value of `perrin[i - 3]` is `perrin[2]`, which is 2. Therefore, `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` appends the value 3 + 2 = 5 to the list `perrin`. The updated list `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so `n` is still greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is still 5.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `perrin` is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5]`, `i` is 5**
