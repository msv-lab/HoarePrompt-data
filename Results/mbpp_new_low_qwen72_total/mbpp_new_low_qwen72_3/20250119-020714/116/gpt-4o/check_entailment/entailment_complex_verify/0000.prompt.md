You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Annotated Code: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle (in radians) of the complex number `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis. The function handles complex numbers correctly, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures that the phase angle is within the range \([-π, π)\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. However, the test cases provided only check the conversion for real numbers (i.e., numbers with no imaginary part). This does not fully cover the range of inputs that the function should handle, such as complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts. For example, `func_1(1+1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`, but this case is not tested. Therefore, the program is not fully verifying the correctness of the function for all potential inputs.
