Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the test cases provided do not cover the full range of inputs that the function `func_1` should handle. The function itself is correct in its implementation; it uses the `cmath.polar` function, which correctly converts a complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple of the magnitude and the phase angle. However, the test cases only check for real numbers (with no imaginary part), which is insufficient to ensure the function works correctly for all complex numbers. For instance, the test case `func_1(1+1j)` should be included to verify the function's behavior with complex numbers having both real and imaginary parts.

Given that the function itself is implemented correctly but the test cases are inadequate, the original assessment is justified in marking the program as incorrect due to incomplete testing.

Final: **False**
