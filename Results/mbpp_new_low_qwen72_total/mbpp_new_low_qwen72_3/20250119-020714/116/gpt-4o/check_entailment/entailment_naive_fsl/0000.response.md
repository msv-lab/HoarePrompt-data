Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. However, the test cases provided only check the conversion for real numbers (i.e., numbers with no imaginary part). This does not fully cover the range of inputs that the function should handle, such as complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts. For example, `func_1(1+1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`, but this case is not tested. Therefore, the program is not fully verifying the correctness of the function for all potential inputs.
