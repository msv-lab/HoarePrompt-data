Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The `cmath.polar` function returns a tuple containing the magnitude (or modulus) and the phase angle (or argument) of the complex number. The function `func_1` correctly converts the input `num` to a complex number using `complex(num)` and then applies `cmath.polar` to get the polar coordinates.

However, the test cases provided in the assertions are only testing real numbers (1, 4, 5). While these are valid complex numbers (with an imaginary part of 0), they do not fully cover the range of possible inputs, such as complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts. Despite this, the function will still work correctly for these inputs, as the polar coordinates of a real number (a + 0j) are simply (|a|, 0).

Given that the function is correct for the provided test cases and will work for any complex number, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
