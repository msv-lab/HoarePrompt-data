Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The `cmath.polar` function takes a complex number and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians). The function `func_1` correctly converts the input `num` to a complex number using `complex(num)` and then applies `cmath.polar` to it.

However, the test cases provided in the assertions are not entirely representative of the function's intended use case. The test cases only check for real numbers (1, 4, 5), which are special cases where the imaginary part is zero. While these test cases will pass because the magnitude of a real number is the number itself and the phase angle is 0.0, they do not cover the full range of possible complex numbers (e.g., numbers with both real and imaginary parts).

Despite this, the function itself is correct and will handle any complex number, including those with non-zero imaginary parts. The function correctly returns the magnitude and phase angle as expected.

Correctness: **True**
