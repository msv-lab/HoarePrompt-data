Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

# Annotated Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle (in radians) of the complex number `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis. The function handles complex numbers correctly, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures that the phase angle is within the range \([-π, π)\).

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
