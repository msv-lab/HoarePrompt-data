Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a given number into its polar coordinates. The `cmath.polar` function is used correctly to achieve this. The function takes a single argument `num`, which can be a real number or a complex number, and converts it to a complex number using `complex(num)`. This ensures that even if a real number is passed, it is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part of 0.

The assertions provided are testing the function with real numbers (1, 4, and 5). For these inputs, the expected output is a tuple where the magnitude is the number itself and the phase angle is 0.0, which is exactly what `cmath.polar` returns. Therefore, the assertions are valid and correctly test the function's behavior.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works as intended for the given test cases. The only suggestion made was to use a more descriptive function name, which is a good practice but does not affect the correctness of the function.

Final: **True**
