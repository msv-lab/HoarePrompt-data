Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a given number (which can be interpreted as a complex number with an imaginary part of 0) into its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The `cmath.polar` function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number. For real numbers (like 1, 4, and 5), the magnitude is the number itself, and the phase angle is 0.0, which matches the expected output in the assertions.

However, there is a minor issue with the function name used in the assertions. The assertions call `func_1`, but the function defined is also named `func_1`. This is consistent, but it would be more clear if the function name were more descriptive, such as `convert_to_polar`.

Given that the function works correctly for the provided test cases, and the assertions are valid, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
