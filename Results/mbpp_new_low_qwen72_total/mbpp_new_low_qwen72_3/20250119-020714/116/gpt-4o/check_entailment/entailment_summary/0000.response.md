Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` uses the `cmath.polar` method to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates, which returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle. The function works correctly for the test cases provided, where the input is a real number (which is a special case of a complex number with an imaginary part of 0). The `cmath.polar` method is designed to handle both real and complex numbers, ensuring that the magnitude and phase angle are calculated accurately. The execution summary confirms that the function handles various types of complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures the phase angle is within the correct range.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
