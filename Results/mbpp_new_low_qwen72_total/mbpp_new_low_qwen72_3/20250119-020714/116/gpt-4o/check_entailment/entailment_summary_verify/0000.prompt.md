You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis. The function handles complex numbers correctly, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures that the phase angle is within the range \([-π, π)\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. However, the test cases provided only check the conversion for real numbers (i.e., numbers with no imaginary part). This does not fully cover the range of inputs that the function should handle, such as complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts. For example, `func_1(1+1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`, but this case is not tested. Therefore, the program is not fully verifying the correctness of the function for all potential inputs.
