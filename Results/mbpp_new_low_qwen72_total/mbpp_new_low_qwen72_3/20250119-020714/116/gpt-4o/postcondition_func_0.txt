The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis. The function handles complex numbers correctly, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures that the phase angle is within the range \([-π, π)\).
