The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a complex number. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number `num`. The magnitude represents the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis.

Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`.**
