Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane, and the phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis. The function handles complex numbers correctly, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and ensures that the phase angle is within the range \([-π, π)\). **

### Explanation:
- **Input:** The function accepts a single parameter `num`, which is expected to be a complex number.
- **Output:** The function returns a tuple `(magnitude, phase_angle)`, where:
  - `magnitude` is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane.
  - `phase_angle` is the angle (in radians) formed with the positive real axis, ranging from \(-π\) to \(π\).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `num` is a purely real number (e.g., `3 + 0j`), the phase angle will be `0` or `π` depending on the sign of the real part.
  - If `num` is a purely imaginary number (e.g., `0 + 3j`), the phase angle will be \(\frac{π}{2}\) or \(-\frac{π}{2}\) depending on the sign of the imaginary part.
  - If `num` is `0 + 0j`, both the magnitude and phase angle will be `0`.
- **Missing Functionality:**
  - The function assumes that `num` is always a valid complex number. It does not handle cases where `num` might be a non-complex type, such as an integer or string, which would raise a `TypeError` when passed to `complex()`.
