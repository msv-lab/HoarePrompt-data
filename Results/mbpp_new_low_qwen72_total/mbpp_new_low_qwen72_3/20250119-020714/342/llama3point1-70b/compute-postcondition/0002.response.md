The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if there is at least one even number and one odd number in the list, the function returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nums`, a list of integers. It returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list, or `None` if either an even or odd number does not exist.**
