The provided code snippet searches through the list `nums` to find the first even number and the first odd number, assigning them to the variables `even` and `odd`, respectively. If no even or odd numbers are found, the respective variables are set to `None`.

- The first line uses a generator expression to find the first even number in `nums` and assigns it to `even`. If no even number is found, `even` is set to `None`.
- The second line similarly finds the first odd number in `nums` and assigns it to `odd`. If no odd number is found, `odd` is set to `None`.

Since the initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers, the values of `even` and `odd` will depend on the contents of `nums`. However, we can summarize the final state based on the logic of the code:

Output State: **nums is a list of integers, even is the first even number in nums or None if no even number exists, odd is the first odd number in nums or None if no odd number exists**
