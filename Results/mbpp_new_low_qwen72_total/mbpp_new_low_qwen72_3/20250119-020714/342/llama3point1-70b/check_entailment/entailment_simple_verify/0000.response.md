Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue in the program. The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the input list might contain only even numbers or only odd numbers. When either the first even or the first odd number is not found, the `next` function returns `None`. Multiplying `None` with any number results in a `TypeError`. This is a violation of the problem description, which implies that the function should handle such cases gracefully without raising an exception.

The provided example case `[2, 4, 6]` (only even numbers) clearly demonstrates this issue. In this case, `odd` will be `None`, and the multiplication `even * odd` will raise a `TypeError`.

To address this, the function should include a check to ensure that both `even` and `odd` are not `None` before performing the multiplication. If either is `None`, the function could return a specific value (e.g., `None` or `0`) to indicate that the product cannot be computed.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
