Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the function `func_1` when the input list `nums` does not contain both an even and an odd number. Specifically, if `even` or `odd` is `None`, attempting to multiply them will result in a `TypeError`. This is a valid concern because the problem description does not explicitly state that the input list will always contain at least one even and one odd number. Therefore, the function as written is not robust and can fail under certain conditions.

However, the original assessment also suggests that the function could be considered correct if we assume valid inputs (i.e., the list always contains at least one even and one odd number). Since the problem description does not provide this guarantee, we cannot make this assumption without additional context or constraints.

Given the potential for the function to raise an error, the original assessment's conclusion that the function is incorrect is accurate. To make the function more robust, it should include error handling or return a specific value when an even or odd number is not found.

Final: **False**
