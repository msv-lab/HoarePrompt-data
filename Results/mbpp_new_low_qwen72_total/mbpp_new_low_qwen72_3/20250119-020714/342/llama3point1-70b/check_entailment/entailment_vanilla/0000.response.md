Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The approach used is to use generator expressions with `next` to find the first even and the first odd number. If no such numbers are found, `None` is returned by `next`, which will lead to a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `even` and `odd` if one of them is `None`.

However, the problem does not specify how to handle cases where there is no even or odd number in the list. Given that the function will raise an error in such cases, it can be considered incorrect unless we assume that the input list will always contain at least one even and one odd number.

To make the function more robust, it should handle cases where either an even or odd number is not found by returning a specific value (like `None` or `0`) or raising a custom error.

Correctness: **False**  

If the input list can be assumed to always contain at least one even and one odd number, the function would be correct. However, without this assumption, the function is incorrect because it can raise a `TypeError`.
