You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Edge cases include scenarios where the list is empty, contains only even numbers, or contains only odd numbers, all of which result in the function returning `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number. For example, if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, the `next` function will return `None` for the missing type, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to multiply `even` and `odd`. This violates the problem description, which requires finding the product of the first even and odd number in the list. 

Example case:
- Input: `[2, 4, 6]` (only even numbers)
- Expected output: The program should ideally handle this case gracefully, but instead, it raises a `TypeError` because `odd` is `None`.

To fix this, the program should check if both `even` and `odd` are not `None` before performing the multiplication.
