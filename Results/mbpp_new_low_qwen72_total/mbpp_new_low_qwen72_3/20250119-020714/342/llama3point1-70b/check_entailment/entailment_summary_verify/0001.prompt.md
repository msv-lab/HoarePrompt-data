You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Edge cases include scenarios where the list is empty, contains only even numbers, or contains only odd numbers, all of which result in the function returning `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The approach used is to use generator expressions with `next` to find the first even and the first odd number. If no such numbers are found, `None` is returned by `next`, which will lead to a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `even` and `odd` if one of them is `None`.

However, the problem does not specify how to handle cases where there is no even or odd number in the list. Given that the function will raise an error in such cases, it can be considered incorrect unless we assume that the input list will always contain at least one even and one odd number.

To make the function more robust, it should handle cases where either an even or odd number is not found by returning a specific value (like `None` or `0`) or raising a custom error.

Correctness: **False**  

If the input list can be assumed to always contain at least one even and one odd number, the function would be correct. However, without this assumption, the function is incorrect because it can raise a `TypeError`.
