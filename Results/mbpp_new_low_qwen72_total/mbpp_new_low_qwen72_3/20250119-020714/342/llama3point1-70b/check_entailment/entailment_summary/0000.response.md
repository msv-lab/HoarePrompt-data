Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums` and return their product. The use of the `next` function with generators is efficient and appropriate for this task. If either an even or an odd number is not found, the `next` function will return `None` for that specific number. When the product of an integer and `None` is calculated, it results in `None`, which is consistent with the expected behavior described in the execution summary. This handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with only even numbers, or a list with only odd numbers, correctly returning `None`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
