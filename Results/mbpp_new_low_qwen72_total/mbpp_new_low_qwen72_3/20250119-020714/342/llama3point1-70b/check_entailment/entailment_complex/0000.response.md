Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is as follows:

1. It uses a generator expression with `next()` to find the first even number in the list. If no even number is found, it assigns `None` to the variable `even`.
2. Similarly, it uses another generator expression with `next()` to find the first odd number in the list. If no odd number is found, it assigns `None` to the variable `odd`.
3. The function then returns the product of `even` and `odd`.

If either `even` or `odd` is `None`, the multiplication operation will result in `None` because in Python, any arithmetic operation involving `None` (or more specifically, any non-numeric type) will raise a TypeError. However, in this context, since the function is designed to return `None` when either an even or an odd number is not found, the behavior is correct.

The function correctly handles edge cases such as:
- An empty list.
- A list containing only even numbers.
- A list containing only odd numbers.
- A list containing both even and odd numbers.

Therefore, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
