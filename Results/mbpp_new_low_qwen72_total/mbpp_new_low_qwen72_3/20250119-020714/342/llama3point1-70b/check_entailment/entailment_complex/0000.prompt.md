Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)

odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd
    #The program returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list 'nums', or None if either an even or odd number does not exist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Edge cases include scenarios where the list is empty, contains only even numbers, or contains only odd numbers, all of which result in the function returning `None`.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
