Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The logic used in the function is:

1. It uses a generator expression within the `next()` function to find the first even number in the list. If no even number is found, it sets `even` to `None`.
2. Similarly, it uses another generator expression within the `next()` function to find the first odd number in the list. If no odd number is found, it sets `odd` to `None`.
3. Finally, it returns the product of `even` and `odd`.

However, there is a minor issue in the code: the variable `odd` is defined outside the function scope, which means it will be a global variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior if `odd` is used elsewhere in the program. To fix this, `odd` should be defined inside the function.

Despite this issue, the function will still work correctly in the context of finding the product of the first even and odd numbers, assuming the function is called as intended and `odd` is not modified elsewhere in the program.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd if even is not None and odd is not None else None
```

Given the original code, the function will return `None` if either an even or odd number does not exist, which is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True** (but with a note on the scope of the `odd` variable)
