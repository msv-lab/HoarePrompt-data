The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function returns `None`. Edge cases include scenarios where the list is empty, contains only even numbers, or contains only odd numbers, all of which result in the function returning `None`.
