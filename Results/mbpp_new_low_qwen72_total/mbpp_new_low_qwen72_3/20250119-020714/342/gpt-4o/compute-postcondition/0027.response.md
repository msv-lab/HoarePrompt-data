The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`, where `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list `lst` and `first_even` is the first even integer in the list `lst`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is `None`, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers in the list. If either the first odd or the first even integer is not found, it returns `None`.**
