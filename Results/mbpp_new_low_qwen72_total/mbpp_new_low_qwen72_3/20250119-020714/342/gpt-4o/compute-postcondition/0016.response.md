The `break` statement only affects the flow control, causing an immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. It does not alter the values of variables.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
- `num` is the second integer in the list.
- If `num` is even and `first_even` is initially `None`, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`.
- Otherwise, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, if `num` is even and `first_even` is initially `None`, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`; otherwise, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.**
