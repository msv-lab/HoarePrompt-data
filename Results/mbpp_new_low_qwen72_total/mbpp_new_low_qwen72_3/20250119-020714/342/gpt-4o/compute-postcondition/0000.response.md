The provided code initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None`. These variables are intended to store the first odd and even numbers encountered in the list `lst`, respectively. However, the code snippet does not include any logic to iterate through the list or assign values to these variables based on the contents of `lst`. Therefore, the initialization of `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None` is the only change made by this code block.

Output State: **lst is a list of integers, first_odd is None, first_even is None**
