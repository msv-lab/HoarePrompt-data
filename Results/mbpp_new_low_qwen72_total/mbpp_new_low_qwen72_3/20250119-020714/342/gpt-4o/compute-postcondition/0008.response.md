Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is even, `first_odd` is `None` and `first_even` is set to `num`. Otherwise, `first_odd` is `num` (if `num` is odd) or remains `None` (if `num` is even), and `first_even` remains `None`. Currently, `first_odd` is not `None` and `first_even` is not `None`.***
