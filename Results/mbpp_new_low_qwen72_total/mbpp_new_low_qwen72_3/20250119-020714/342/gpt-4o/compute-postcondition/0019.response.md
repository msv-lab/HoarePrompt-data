The value of `first_odd` is set to the value of `num`, which is the third integer in the list `lst`. The conditions for updating `first_even` are not met because the code snippet only updates `first_odd`. Therefore, the state of `first_even` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `first_odd` is set to the third integer in the list, `first_even` remains unchanged.**
