The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `lst`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list `lst` has at least one element, the loop can execute. The variables `first_odd` and `first_even` being `None` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

For the loop to execute the first time, `lst` must have at least one integer, and `num` will be set to the first integer in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `first_odd` is None, `first_even` is None**
