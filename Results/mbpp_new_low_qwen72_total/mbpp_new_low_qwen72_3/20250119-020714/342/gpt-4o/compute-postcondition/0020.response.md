Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` is None and `num` is odd, `first_odd` is set to `num`, and `first_even` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `first_odd` is not None or `num` is even, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.***
