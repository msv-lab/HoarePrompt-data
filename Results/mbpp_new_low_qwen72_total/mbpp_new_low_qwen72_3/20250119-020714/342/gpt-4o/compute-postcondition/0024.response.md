Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is None, and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num`, and `first_odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.***
