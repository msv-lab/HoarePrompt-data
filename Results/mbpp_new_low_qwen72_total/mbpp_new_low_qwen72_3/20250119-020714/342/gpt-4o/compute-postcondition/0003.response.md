The value of `first_odd` is assigned the value of `num`. Since `num` is the first integer in the list and is specified to be odd, `first_odd` now holds this odd value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `first_odd` is `num`, `first_even` is None, and the current value of `num` is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).**
