The code snippet `first_even = num` assigns the value of `num` to `first_even`. According to the initial state, `num` is the second integer in the list `lst`. The condition specifies that if `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Since the code snippet directly sets `first_even` to `num`, it implies that `num` is even. Therefore, `first_odd` remains `None`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `first_even` is `num`, `first_odd` is `None`.**
