Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list. If `num` is odd and `first_odd` is initially `None`, `first_odd` is set to `num` and `first_even` remains `None`. If `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`.***
