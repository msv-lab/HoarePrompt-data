Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list. If `num` is even and `first_even` is initially `None`, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Otherwise, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.***
