Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers found in the list. If the list contains no odd or no even integers, the function returns `None`. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even integers. If the list is empty, the function will also return `None`. **
