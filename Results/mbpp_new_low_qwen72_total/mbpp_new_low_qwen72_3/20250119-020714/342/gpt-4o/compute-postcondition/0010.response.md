Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is even, `first_odd` is `None` and `first_even` is set to `num`. If `num` is odd, `first_odd` is `num` and `first_even` remains `None`. If both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
