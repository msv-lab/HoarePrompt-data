The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `lst`. The loop's execution depends on the list `lst` having enough elements for the loop to continue. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` will be the third integer in the list.

Since the conditions for `first_odd` and `first_even` do not affect the loop head, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is None, and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` is None or `first_even` is not None, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.**
