The code assigns the value of `num` to `first_odd`. Based on the initial state, `num` is the second integer in the list `lst`. If `num` is even, `first_odd` was initially `None`, and `first_even` was set to `num`. If `num` is odd, `first_odd` was initially `num`, and `first_even` remained `None`.

Since the code `first_odd = num` is executed, the value of `first_odd` is now `num`, regardless of whether `num` is even or odd.

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `first_odd` is `num`, and if `num` is even, `first_even` is `num`; if `num` is odd, `first_even` is `None`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `first_odd` is `num`, if `num` is even, `first_even` is `num`; if `num` is odd, `first_even` is `None`**.
