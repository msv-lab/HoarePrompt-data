The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no new assignments or changes to the variables are made within the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.
- `num` is the first integer in the list.
- If `num` is even, `first_odd` is `None` and `first_even` is set to `num`.
- Otherwise, `first_odd` is `num` (if `num` is odd) or remains `None` (if `num` is even), and `first_even` remains `None`.
- Currently, `first_odd` is not `None` and `first_even` is not `None`.

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `lst`, `num`, `first_odd`, or `first_even`. It only affects the flow of control, causing the program to exit the loop or conditional block it is in.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `first_odd` is not `None`, `first_even` is not `None`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
