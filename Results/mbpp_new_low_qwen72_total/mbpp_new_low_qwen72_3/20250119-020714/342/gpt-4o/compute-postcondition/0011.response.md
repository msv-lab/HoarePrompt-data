The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least 2 integers. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list. For the next iteration, `num` should be the second integer in the list.

If `num` was even, `first_odd` is `None` and `first_even` is set to `num`. If `num` was odd, `first_odd` is `num` and `first_even` remains `None`. The conditions for breaking out of the loop (both `first_odd` and `first_even` being not `None`) do not affect the state of `lst` or `num` directly, so they are not considered for adjustment in this context.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `lst` must still be a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
- `num` is now the second integer in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list. If `num` is even, `first_odd` is `None` and `first_even` is set to `num`. If `num` is odd, `first_odd` is `num` and `first_even` remains `None`.**
