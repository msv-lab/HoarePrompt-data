Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is None, and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `first_odd` is None or `first_even` is not None, the state of `first_even` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.***
