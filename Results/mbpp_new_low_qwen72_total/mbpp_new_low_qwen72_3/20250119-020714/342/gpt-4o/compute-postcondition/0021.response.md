The provided code snippet sets `first_even` to the value of `num`. Based on the initial state, `num` is the third integer in the list `lst`. The conditions regarding `first_odd` do not affect the current operation because the code does not include any conditional logic related to these conditions.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `first_even` is set to the value of `num`.
- The state of `first_odd` remains unchanged.
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `first_even` is `num`, `first_odd` remains unchanged.**
