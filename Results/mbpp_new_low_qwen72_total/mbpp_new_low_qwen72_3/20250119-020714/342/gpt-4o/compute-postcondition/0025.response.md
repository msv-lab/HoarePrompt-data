Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with any number of integers. `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. `first_even` is the first even integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. The loop will stop executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`, or after iterating through all elements in the list.**
