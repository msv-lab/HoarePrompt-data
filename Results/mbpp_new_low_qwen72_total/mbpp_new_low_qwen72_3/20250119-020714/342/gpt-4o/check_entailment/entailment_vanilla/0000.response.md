Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None`. These variables will store the first odd and even numbers found in the list, respectively.

2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop. During each iteration:
   - If `first_odd` is still `None` and the current number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), it sets `first_odd` to the current number.
   - If `first_even` is still `None` and the current number is even (`num % 2 == 0`), it sets `first_even` to the current number.
   - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been set (i.e., they are not `None`), the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary iterations.

3. **Return Statement**: The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `4`
  - Product: `1 * 4 = 4`
  - Expected output: `4` (matches the assertion)

- For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `2`
  - Product: `1 * 2 = 2`
  - Expected output: `2` (matches the assertion)

- For the list `[1, 5, 7, 9, 10]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `10`
  - Product: `1 * 10 = 10`
  - Expected output: `10` (matches the assertion)

All test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
