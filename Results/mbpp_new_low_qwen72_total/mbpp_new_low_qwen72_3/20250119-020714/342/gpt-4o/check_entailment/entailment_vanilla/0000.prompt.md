Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
