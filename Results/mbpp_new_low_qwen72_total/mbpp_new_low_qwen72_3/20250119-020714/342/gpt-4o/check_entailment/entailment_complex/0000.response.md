Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list. The implementation correctly initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None` and iterates through the list to set these variables when the first even and odd numbers are encountered. The function breaks out of the loop as soon as both values are found, which is efficient. However, there is a potential issue with the return statement: if the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, the function will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will raise a `TypeError`.

To fix this, the function should check if both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None` before returning their product. If either is `None`, the function should return `None`.

Given the current implementation, the function will fail with a `TypeError` if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, because it will try to multiply a number by `None`.

Correctness: **False**
