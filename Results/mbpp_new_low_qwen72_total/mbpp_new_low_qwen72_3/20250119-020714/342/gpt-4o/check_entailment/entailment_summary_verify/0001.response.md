Reasoning: 

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the function's logic and verifies it against the provided test cases. Let's re-evaluate the function step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`. This ensures that the variables are only assigned values when an odd or even number is found, respectively.

2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop. It checks each number:
   - If the current number is odd and `first_odd` is still `None`, it sets `first_odd` to the current number.
   - If the current number is even and `first_even` is still `None`, it sets `first_even` to the current number.
   - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been set, the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary iterations.

3. **Return Statement**: The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` remains `None` (which would happen if the list does not contain both an odd and an even number), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `None` by an integer.

However, the function summary states that the function should return `None` if the list contains no odd or no even integers. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly. To fix this, we need to add a check before returning the product to ensure that both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
        return first_odd * first_even
    else:
        return None
```

With this correction, the function will now return `None` if the list does not contain both an odd and an even number.

Given the original function's behavior and the provided test cases, the original assessment was accurate in terms of the logic and test cases, but it did not account for the potential `None` return value when the list lacks either an odd or an even number.

Final: **False** (The original function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list does not contain both an odd and an even number.)
