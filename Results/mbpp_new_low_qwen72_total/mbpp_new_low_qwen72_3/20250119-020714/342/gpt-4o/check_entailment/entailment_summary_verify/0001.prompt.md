You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers found in the list. If the list contains no odd or no even integers, the function returns `None`. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even integers. If the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None`. These variables will store the first odd and even numbers found in the list, respectively.

2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop. During each iteration:
   - If `first_odd` is still `None` and the current number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), it sets `first_odd` to the current number.
   - If `first_even` is still `None` and the current number is even (`num % 2 == 0`), it sets `first_even` to the current number.
   - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been set (i.e., they are not `None`), the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary iterations.

3. **Return Statement**: The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `4`
  - Product: `1 * 4 = 4`
  - Expected output: `4` (matches the assertion)

- For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `2`
  - Product: `1 * 2 = 2`
  - Expected output: `2` (matches the assertion)

- For the list `[1, 5, 7, 9, 10]`:
  - First odd number: `1`
  - First even number: `10`
  - Product: `1 * 10 = 10`
  - Expected output: `10` (matches the assertion)

All test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
