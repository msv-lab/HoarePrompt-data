Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the list contains only odd numbers or only even numbers. In these scenarios, one of the variables `first_odd` or `first_even` remains `None`, and attempting to multiply `None` by an integer results in a `TypeError`.

To illustrate, consider the following test cases:
- Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (all odd numbers)
- Input: `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (all even numbers)

In both cases, the function will attempt to multiply `None` by an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

The function summary also confirms that the function should return `None` if the list contains no odd or no even integers. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly and will raise an error instead.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
