You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program: 
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any number of integers. `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. `first_even` is the first even integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. The loop will stop executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`, or after iterating through all elements in the list.
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`, where `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list `lst` and `first_even` is the first even integer in the list `lst`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is `None`, the program will return `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers found in the list. If the list contains no odd or no even integers, the function returns `None`. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even integers. If the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list contains no even or no odd numbers. In such scenarios, the variables `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to multiply them. For example, if the input list is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (all odd numbers), or `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (all even numbers), the program will raise an error because it tries to multiply `None` by an integer.
