Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list.
2. The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None`. These variables will store the first odd and even numbers encountered in the list, respectively.
3. The function iterates over the list `lst` using a `for` loop. During each iteration, it checks if the current number is odd or even and updates `first_odd` and `first_even` accordingly.
4. The loop breaks early if both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been found, which optimizes the function by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
5. After the loop, the function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` remains `None` (i.e., if the list does not contain an odd or even number), the multiplication will result in `None` because `None` multiplied by any number results in `None`.

Let's verify the test cases:

- `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8])`:
  - First odd: 1
  - First even: 4
  - Product: 1 * 4 = 4
  - Expected: 4
  - Result: Correct

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`:
  - First odd: 1
  - First even: 2
  - Product: 1 * 2 = 2
  - Expected: 2
  - Result: Correct

- `func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10])`:
  - First odd: 1
  - First even: 10
  - Product: 1 * 10 = 10
  - Expected: 10
  - Result: Correct

All test cases are satisfied, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
