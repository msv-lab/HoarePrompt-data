Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any number of integers. `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. `first_even` is the first even integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. The loop will stop executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`, or after iterating through all elements in the list.
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`, where `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list `lst` and `first_even` is the first even integer in the list `lst`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is `None`, the program will return `None`.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
