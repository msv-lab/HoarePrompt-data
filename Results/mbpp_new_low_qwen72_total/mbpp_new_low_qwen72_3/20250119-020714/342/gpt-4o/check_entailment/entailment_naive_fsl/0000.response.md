Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list contains no even or no odd numbers. In such scenarios, the variables `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to multiply them. For example, if the input list is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (all odd numbers), or `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (all even numbers), the program will raise an error because it tries to multiply `None` by an integer.
