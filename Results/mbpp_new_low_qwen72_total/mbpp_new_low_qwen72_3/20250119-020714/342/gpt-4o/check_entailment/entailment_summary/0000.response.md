Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the first even and first odd numbers in the list and returns their product. The function iterates through the list until it finds both the first even and the first odd numbers, at which point it breaks out of the loop and returns their product. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- For `[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `4`, so the product is `1 * 4 = 4`.
- For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `2`, so the product is `1 * 2 = 2`.
- For `[1, 5, 7, 9, 10]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `10`, so the product is `1 * 10 = 10`.

The function handles the case where the list might not contain an even or odd number by returning `None` if either is not found, although this specific case is not covered by the provided test cases. However, the function's logic is correct for the given problem statement and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
