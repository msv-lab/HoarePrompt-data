Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers found in the list. If the list contains no odd or no even integers, the function returns `None`. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even integers. If the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
