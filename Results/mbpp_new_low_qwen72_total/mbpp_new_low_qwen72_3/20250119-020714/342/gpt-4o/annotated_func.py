def func_1(lst):

    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any number of integers. `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. `first_even` is the first even integer in the list if there is one, otherwise it remains `None`. The loop will stop executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None`, or after iterating through all elements in the list.
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`, where `first_odd` is the first odd integer in the list `lst` and `first_even` is the first even integer in the list `lst`. If either `first_odd` or `first_even` is `None`, the program will return `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd and the first even integers found in the list. If the list contains no odd or no even integers, the function returns `None`. The function stops iterating through the list as soon as it finds both the first odd and the first even integers. If the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.
