The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `x`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least three elements, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.**
