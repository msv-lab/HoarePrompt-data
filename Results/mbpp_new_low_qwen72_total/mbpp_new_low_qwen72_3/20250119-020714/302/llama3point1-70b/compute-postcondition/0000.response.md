The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `x`, and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:

1. The list `arr` must have at least one element, because the loop iterates over the elements of `arr`.
2. The variable `i` will be 0, as it is the index of the first element in the list.
3. The variable `x` will be the first element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state where `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, `num` is an integer**
