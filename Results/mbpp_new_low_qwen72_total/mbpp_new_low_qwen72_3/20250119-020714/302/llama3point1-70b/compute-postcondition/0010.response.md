Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is the index of the last element checked in `arr`, and `x` is the last element checked in `arr`. If `x` equals `num`, the function returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function does not return any value. The loop will not execute if `arr` is empty.**
