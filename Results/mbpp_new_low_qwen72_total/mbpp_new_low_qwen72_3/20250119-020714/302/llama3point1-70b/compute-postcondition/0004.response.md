The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `x`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two elements, `i` must be 1, and `x` must be the second element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least two elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, `num` is an integer, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
