Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by returning -1, as the loop will not execute and the function will reach the final return statement. **
