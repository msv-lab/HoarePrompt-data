Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotated code and the original assessment both confirm that the function iterates through the array, checking each element against the target number. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of the match. If no match is found after the loop completes, the function returns -1. The function also correctly handles the case where the input array is empty by returning -1, as the loop will not execute, and the function will reach the final return statement.

The original assessment accurately states that while the function works correctly, it does not leverage the sorted nature of the array to optimize the search. However, the problem description does not require an optimized solution, only a correct one. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
