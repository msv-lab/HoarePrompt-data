Reasoning:
The function `func_1` indeed iterates through the array using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If no match is found, the function returns -1. This approach is logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. It accurately states that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if found, and -1 if not found. The summary also correctly notes that the function handles the case where the array is empty by returning -1.

The original assessment is accurate in stating that while the function works correctly, it does not leverage the sorted nature of the array for a more efficient search (e.g., using binary search). However, the problem statement does not require the use of a more efficient algorithm, only that the function finds the index of the first occurrence of the given number.

Final: **True**
