You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

- Program:
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by returning -1, as the loop will not execute and the function will reach the final return statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not utilize the fact that the array is sorted, which is a key part of the problem description. A more efficient approach would be to use binary search to find the first occurrence of the given number in O(log n) time complexity, rather than using a linear search which has O(n) time complexity. Additionally, the current implementation will not correctly handle cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array, as it may return the index of any occurrence, not necessarily the first one.

For example, consider the array `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and the target number `num = 2`. The current implementation could return `1` or `2`, but the correct answer should always be `1` (the index of the first occurrence).
