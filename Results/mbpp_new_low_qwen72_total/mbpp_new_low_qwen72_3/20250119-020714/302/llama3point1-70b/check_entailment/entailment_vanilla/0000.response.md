Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If no match is found, the function returns -1. This approach works correctly for the given problem, although it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted, which could potentially allow for a more efficient solution using binary search.

However, the program as written meets the requirements of the problem statement, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Correctness: **True**
