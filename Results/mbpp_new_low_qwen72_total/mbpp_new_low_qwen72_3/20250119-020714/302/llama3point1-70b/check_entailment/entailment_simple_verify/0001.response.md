Reasoning: 

The provided function `func_1` indeed correctly solves the problem of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using a for loop and checks each element against the target number. When it finds a match, it immediately returns the index. If no match is found throughout the array, the function returns -1, which is the expected behavior according to the problem statement.

The annotations confirm that:
- The function starts with `arr` being a sorted list of integers and `num` being an integer.
- During the loop, if `x` (the current element) matches `num`, the function returns the current index `i`.
- After the loop, if no match is found, the function returns -1.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works as intended, even though it does not leverage the sorted nature of the array to optimize performance (e.g., using binary search). However, the problem statement does not specify a requirement for optimal performance, only correctness.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
