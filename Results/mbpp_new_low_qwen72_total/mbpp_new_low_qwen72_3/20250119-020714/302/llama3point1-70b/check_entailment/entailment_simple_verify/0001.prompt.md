You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

- Program: 
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is the index of the last element checked in `arr`, and `x` is the last element checked in `arr`. If `x` equals `num`, the function returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function does not return any value. The loop will not execute if `arr` is empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If no match is found, the function returns -1. This approach works correctly for the given problem, although it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted, which could potentially allow for a more efficient solution using binary search.

However, the program as written meets the requirements of the problem statement, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Correctness: **True**
