Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates through the array using a for loop, and for each element, it checks if the element is equal to `num`. If a match is found, the function returns the index immediately. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1` to indicate that `num` is not present in the array.

Based on the problem description and the annotated program:
1. The function correctly handles the case where `num` is found in the array by returning the index of the first occurrence.
2. The function correctly handles the case where `num` is not found in the array by returning `-1`.
3. The function also correctly handles the edge case where the array `arr` is empty, as the loop will not execute, and the function will return `-1`.

Given these points, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
