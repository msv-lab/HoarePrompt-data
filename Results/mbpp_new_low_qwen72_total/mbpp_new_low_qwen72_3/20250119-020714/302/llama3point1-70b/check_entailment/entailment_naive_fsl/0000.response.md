Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not utilize the fact that the array is sorted, which is a key part of the problem description. A more efficient approach would be to use binary search to find the first occurrence of the given number in O(log n) time complexity, rather than using a linear search which has O(n) time complexity. Additionally, the current implementation will not correctly handle cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array, as it may return the index of any occurrence, not necessarily the first one.

For example, consider the array `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and the target number `num = 2`. The current implementation could return `1` or `2`, but the correct answer should always be `1` (the index of the first occurrence).
