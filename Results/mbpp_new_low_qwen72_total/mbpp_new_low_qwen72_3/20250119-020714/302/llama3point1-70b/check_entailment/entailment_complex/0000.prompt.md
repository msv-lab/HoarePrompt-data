Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is the index of the last element checked in `arr`, and `x` is the last element checked in `arr`. If `x` equals `num`, the function returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function does not return any value. The loop will not execute if `arr` is empty.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by returning -1, as the loop will not execute and the function will reach the final return statement.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
