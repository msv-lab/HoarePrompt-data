Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using a for loop, checking each element to see if it matches the target number (`num`). If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of that element. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`, which is the correct behavior for indicating that the target number was not found in the array.

The function also handles the case where the input array is empty by returning `-1`, as the loop will not execute and the function will directly reach the final return statement.

Given the problem description and the state of the program at various points, the function behaves as expected and meets all the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
