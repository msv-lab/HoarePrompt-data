Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

# Program:
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by returning -1, as the loop will not execute and the function will reach the final return statement.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
