Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using a for loop, checking each element against the target number. If the target number is found, the function immediately returns the index. If the loop completes without finding the target number, the function returns -1, indicating that the number is not present in the array.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling both cases where the number is found and where it is not found, including the edge case of an empty array.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
