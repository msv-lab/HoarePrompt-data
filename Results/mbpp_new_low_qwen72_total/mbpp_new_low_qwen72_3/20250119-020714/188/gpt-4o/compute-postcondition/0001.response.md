The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and an unused parameter `_`. `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium. The function returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezium, calculated as \((a + b) / 2\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium, and returns their average, \((a + b) / 2\).**
