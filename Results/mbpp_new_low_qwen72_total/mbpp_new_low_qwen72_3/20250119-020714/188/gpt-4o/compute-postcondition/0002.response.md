Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It computes and returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\). The parameter `_` is unused and does not affect the function's behavior. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the function will still compute the average but the result may not be meaningful in the context of a trapezium. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function returns the computed average, and the input parameters remain unchanged. **
