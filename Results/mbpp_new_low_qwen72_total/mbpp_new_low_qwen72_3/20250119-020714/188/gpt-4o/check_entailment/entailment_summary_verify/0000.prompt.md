You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program:
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It computes and returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\). The parameter `_` is unused and does not affect the function's behavior. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the function will still compute the average but the result may not be meaningful in the context of a trapezium. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function returns the computed average, and the input parameters remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two parallel sides. However, the function signature includes a third parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is unnecessary and misleading, as it suggests that the function might take three parameters when only two are relevant. Moreover, the problem description does not specify the purpose of this third parameter, which makes the function's behavior unclear for inputs that include this parameter. For example, calling `func_1(15, 25, 35)` works as expected, but the presence of the third parameter without any use in the function logic indicates a potential issue in the design of the function. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect due to this unnecessary parameter.
