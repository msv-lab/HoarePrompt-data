### Reasoning:

The original assessment points out that the function `func_1` includes an unnecessary third parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. While this is true, it does not necessarily make the function incorrect in terms of its primary functionality. The function correctly calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), which is the correct mathematical formula for the median length of a trapezium.

However, the presence of the unused parameter `_` can be misleading and is not a good practice. It could confuse users about the function's intended use and parameters. Despite this, the function still produces the correct results for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

While the function `func_1` is mathematically correct and produces the correct output, the inclusion of an unused parameter `_` is a design flaw that can lead to confusion. However, this flaw does not affect the correctness of the function's output for the given problem.

**Final: False**

The function is technically correct in its output, but the design flaw with the unused parameter makes it incorrect in terms of best practices and clarity. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
