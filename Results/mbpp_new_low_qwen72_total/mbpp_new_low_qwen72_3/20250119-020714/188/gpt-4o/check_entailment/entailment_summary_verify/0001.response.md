Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is indeed not used in the calculation and does not affect the function's behavior.

The test cases provided are:
1. `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return 20.
2. `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return 15.
3. `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return 7.5.

These test cases were verified and all pass as expected:
- For `func_1(15, 25, 35)`, the calculation is \((15 + 25) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20\).
- For `func_1(10, 20, 30)`, the calculation is \((10 + 20) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\).
- For `func_1(6, 9, 4)`, the calculation is \((6 + 9) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5\).

The function summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezium. The unused parameter `_` does not interfere with the correctness of the function.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
