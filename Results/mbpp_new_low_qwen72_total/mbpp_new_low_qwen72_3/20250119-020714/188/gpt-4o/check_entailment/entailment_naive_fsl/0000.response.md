Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two parallel sides. However, the function signature includes a third parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is unnecessary and misleading, as it suggests that the function might take three parameters when only two are relevant. Moreover, the problem description does not specify the purpose of this third parameter, which makes the function's behavior unclear for inputs that include this parameter. For example, calling `func_1(15, 25, 35)` works as expected, but the presence of the third parameter without any use in the function logic indicates a potential issue in the design of the function. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect due to this unnecessary parameter.
