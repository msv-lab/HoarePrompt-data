Reasoning: 

The original assessment points out that the function `func_1` has an unnecessary third parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation of the median length of a trapezium. While it is true that the third parameter is not used and could be considered misleading, this does not inherently make the function incorrect in terms of its primary functionality. The function correctly calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The provided test cases all pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected for the intended purpose.

However, the presence of the unused parameter can be seen as a poor design choice because it may confuse users who might wonder about the purpose of this parameter. Despite this, the core functionality of the function is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Given that the original assessment focuses on the design aspect rather than the functional correctness, and considering that the function works correctly for the given problem, the original assessment can be challenged.

Final: **True**
