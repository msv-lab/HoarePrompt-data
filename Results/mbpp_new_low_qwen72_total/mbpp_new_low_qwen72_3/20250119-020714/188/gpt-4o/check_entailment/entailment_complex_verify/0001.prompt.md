You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It computes and returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\). The parameter `_` is unused and does not affect the function's behavior. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the function will still compute the average but the result may not be meaningful in the context of a trapezium. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function returns the computed average, and the input parameters remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, which suggests it might be an unnecessary parameter or a placeholder for another value that is not relevant to the median length calculation.

The test cases provided are:
1. `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return 20.
2. `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return 15.
3. `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return 7.5.

Let's verify each test case:
- For `func_1(15, 25, 35)`, the calculation is \((15 + 25) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20\).
- For `func_1(10, 20, 30)`, the calculation is \((10 + 20) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\).
- For `func_1(6, 9, 4)`, the calculation is \((6 + 9) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5\).

All test cases pass, and the function correctly implements the formula for the median length of a trapezium.

Correctness: **True**
