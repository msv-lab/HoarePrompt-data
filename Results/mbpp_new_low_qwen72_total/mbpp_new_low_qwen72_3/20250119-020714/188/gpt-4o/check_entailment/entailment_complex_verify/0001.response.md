Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is indeed not used in the calculation, which aligns with the problem description that only requires the lengths of the parallel sides. The test cases provided in the original assessment are valid and correctly evaluated. The function returns the expected results for each test case, confirming its correctness.

Final: **True**
