You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two parallel sides. However, the function signature includes a third parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is unnecessary and misleading, as it suggests that the function might take three parameters when only two are relevant. Moreover, the problem description does not specify the purpose of this third parameter, which makes the function's behavior unclear for inputs that include this parameter. For example, calling `func_1(15, 25, 35)` works as expected, but the presence of the third parameter without any use in the function logic indicates a potential issue in the design of the function. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect due to this unnecessary parameter.
