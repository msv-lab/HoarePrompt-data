Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is indeed not used in the calculation and serves as a placeholder or an unnecessary parameter.

The test cases provided in the original assessment are:
1. `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return 20.
2. `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return 15.
3. `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return 7.5.

These test cases are verified as follows:
- For `func_1(15, 25, 35)`, the calculation is \((15 + 25) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20\).
- For `func_1(10, 20, 30)`, the calculation is \((10 + 20) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\).
- For `func_1(6, 9, 4)`, the calculation is \((6 + 9) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5\).

All test cases pass, confirming that the function correctly implements the formula for the median length of a trapezium. The annotations also support this reasoning by confirming that the function returns the average of the lengths of the parallel sides.

Final: **True**
