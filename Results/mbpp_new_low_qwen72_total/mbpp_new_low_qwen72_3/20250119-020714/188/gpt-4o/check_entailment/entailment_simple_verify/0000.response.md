Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the inclusion of the third parameter `_` in the function `func_1` is unnecessary and potentially misleading. The function is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium using the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation and does not contribute to the functionality of the function. While the function itself produces the correct output for the provided test cases, the presence of an unused parameter violates good programming practices and can lead to confusion for other developers who might use or maintain the code.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the function's design. The function should be modified to remove the unnecessary parameter to improve clarity and maintainability.

Final: **False**
