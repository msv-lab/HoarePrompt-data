Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of its two parallel sides. The formula used in the function, \((a + b) / 2\), correctly calculates this median length. The third parameter `_` is not used in the computation, which is acceptable since it is not needed for calculating the median length of a trapezium. The assertions provided in the annotated program are consistent with the expected behavior of the function, and they all pass, indicating that the function works as intended for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
