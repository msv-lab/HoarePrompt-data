Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function correctly implements this calculation by returning \((a + b) / 2\). The third parameter `_` is indeed unused and does not affect the computation. The provided test cases all pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. The execution summary confirms that the function correctly computes the average of `a` and `b` and that the input parameters remain unchanged.

However, it is worth noting that the function does not check for the validity of the inputs (e.g., whether `a` and `b` are non-negative). While the problem description does not explicitly require such checks, in a practical application, it might be beneficial to include them to ensure the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function meets the requirements and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
