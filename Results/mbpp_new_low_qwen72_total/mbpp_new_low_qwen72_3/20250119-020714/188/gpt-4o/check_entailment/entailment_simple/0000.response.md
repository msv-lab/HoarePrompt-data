Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The formula used in the function, `(a + b) / 2`, correctly computes this average. The third parameter `_` is not used in the function, but it does not affect the correctness of the function since the problem only requires the use of `a` and `b`.

The assertions provided in the annotated program are testing the function with different sets of values for `a` and `b`. Each assertion checks if the function returns the expected result, which is the average of `a` and `b`. All the assertions are correct:

- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return `(15 + 25) / 2 = 20`
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return `(10 + 20) / 2 = 15`
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return `(6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5`

Since the function uses the correct formula and the assertions pass, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
