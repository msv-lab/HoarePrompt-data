The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are expected to be of the same length, and each element in `tup2` is non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the floor division (integer division) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function ensures that no division by zero occurs due to the non-zero constraint on `tup2`. If the input tuples are not of the same length or if `tup2` contains a zero, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error.
