The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, and each element in `tup2` is non-zero. The function returns a tuple `result` where each element is the result of the floor division of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of the same length with non-zero elements in `tup2`. It returns a tuple `result` where each element is the floor division of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
