Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to take two tuples and perform element-wise integer division using the floor division operator `//`. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the resulting tuple. The annotated code confirms that both input tuples are of the same length and that each element in the second tuple (`tup2`) is non-zero, which ensures that there are no division by zero errors.

Let's re-evaluate the test cases to ensure they align with the expected behavior:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`:
   - 10 // 5 = 2
   - 4 // 2 = 2
   - 6 // 3 = 2
   - 9 // 3 = 3
   - Result: (2, 2, 2, 3)

2. `func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4))`:
   - 12 // 6 = 2
   - 6 // 3 = 2
   - 8 // 4 = 2
   - 16 // 4 = 4
   - Result: (2, 2, 2, 4)

3. `func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9))`:
   - 20 // 5 = 4
   - 14 // 7 = 2
   - 36 // 6 = 6
   - 18 // 9 = 2
   - Result: (4, 2, 6, 2)

All the test cases produce the expected results, and the function behaves as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate, and there are no issues with the function's implementation or the test cases.

Final: **True**
