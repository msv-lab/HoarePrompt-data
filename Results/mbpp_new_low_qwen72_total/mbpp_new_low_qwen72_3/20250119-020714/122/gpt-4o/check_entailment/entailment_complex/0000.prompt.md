Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, and each element in tup2 is non-zero.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple(a // b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    return result
    #The program returns a tuple `result` where each element is the floor division of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Each element in `tup2` is non-zero, ensuring no division by zero errors.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are expected to be of the same length, and each element in `tup2` is non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the floor division (integer division) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function ensures that no division by zero occurs due to the non-zero constraint on `tup2`. If the input tuples are not of the same length or if `tup2` contains a zero, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error.
