Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise floor division on two tuples of the same length, with the constraint that no element in the second tuple (`tup2`) is zero. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to iterate over the paired elements of `tup1` and `tup2` using the `zip()` function, performing floor division (`//`) on each pair.

The test cases provided in the assertions match the expected output, indicating that the function works as intended under the given constraints. The comments also correctly describe the function's behavior and constraints, including the potential for undefined behavior if the input tuples are not of the same length or if `tup2` contains a zero.

Given the constraints and the provided test cases, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
