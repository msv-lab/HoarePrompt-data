Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise floor division on two tuples. The provided test cases in the `assert` statements correctly validate the functionality of the function. Each test case checks if the output of `func_1` matches the expected result, which it does. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to iterate over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using `zip`, and performs floor division using the `//` operator. This approach is appropriate and efficient for the given problem.

The execution summary confirms that the function assumes the input tuples are of the same length and that no element in `tup2` is zero, which aligns with the problem's constraints. Given these assumptions, the function behaves as intended and produces the correct results for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
