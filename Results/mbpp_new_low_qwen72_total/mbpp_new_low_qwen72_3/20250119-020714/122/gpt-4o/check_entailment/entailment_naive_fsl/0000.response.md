Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`). This means that the results will be truncated towards zero, which might not be the intended behavior for a mathematical division operation, especially when dealing with non-integer results. For example, `func_1((10, 5), (3, 2))` would return `(3, 2)` instead of the expected `(3.3333333333333335, 2.5)`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
