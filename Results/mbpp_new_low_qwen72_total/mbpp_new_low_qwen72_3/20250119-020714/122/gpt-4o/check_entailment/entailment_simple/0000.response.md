Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise floor division on two tuples of the same length, where each element in the second tuple (`tup2`) is guaranteed to be non-zero. The provided assertions test the function with different input tuples and check if the output matches the expected results. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the floor division of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

- The first assertion checks if dividing `(10, 4, 6, 9)` by `(5, 2, 3, 3)` results in `(2, 2, 2, 3)`, which is correct.
- The second assertion checks if dividing `(12, 6, 8, 16)` by `(6, 3, 4, 4)` results in `(2, 2, 2, 4)`, which is correct.
- The third assertion checks if dividing `(20, 14, 36, 18)` by `(5, 7, 6, 9)` results in `(4, 2, 6, 2)`, which is correct.

The function correctly handles the division and ensures that the division is floor division, which is appropriate given the context of the problem statement. Since all assertions pass and the function behaves as expected, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
