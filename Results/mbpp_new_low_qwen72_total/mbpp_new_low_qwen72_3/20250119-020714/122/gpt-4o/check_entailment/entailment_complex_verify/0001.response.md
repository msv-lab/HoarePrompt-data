Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed performs element-wise integer division on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple containing the results of these division operations.

The annotated code confirms that:
1. The function expects `tup1` and `tup2` to be tuples of the same length.
2. Each element in `tup2` is non-zero, ensuring that no division by zero errors occur.
3. The function returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the floor division (integer division) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

The provided test cases were correctly evaluated in the original assessment:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 3)`.
2. `func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 4)`.
3. `func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9))` results in `(4, 2, 6, 2)`.

These results match the expected outputs, and the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
