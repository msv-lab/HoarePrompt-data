Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function. The problem description specifies "mathematical division," which typically implies floating-point division. However, the function `func_1` uses integer division (`//`), which truncates the result towards zero. This can lead to incorrect results when the division does not yield an integer. For instance, `func_1((10, 5), (3, 2))` returns `(3, 2)` instead of the expected `(3.3333333333333335, 2.5)`.

The annotations confirm that the function correctly performs floor division, but they do not address the issue of whether this matches the problem's requirement for "mathematical division." Since the problem description does not specify integer division, the use of `//` is indeed a deviation from the expected behavior.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue. The function as written does not fully meet the problem description, particularly for cases where the division results are not integers.

Final: **False**
