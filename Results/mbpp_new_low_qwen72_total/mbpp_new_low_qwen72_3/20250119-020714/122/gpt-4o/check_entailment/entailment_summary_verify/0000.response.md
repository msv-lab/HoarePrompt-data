Reasoning: The original assessment points out that the program uses integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`). However, the problem description explicitly states that the function should perform "mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples." While this could be interpreted as either integer or floating-point division, the use of integer division in the provided implementation is consistent with the test cases given in the problem description. All the test cases provided in the problem description involve integer results, which align with the behavior of the `//` operator.

Furthermore, the function summary confirms that the function is designed to perform floor division, returning a tuple of integers. Given that the test cases and the function summary align with the behavior of the program, the original assessment is inaccurate in assuming that floating-point division is required.

Final: **True**
