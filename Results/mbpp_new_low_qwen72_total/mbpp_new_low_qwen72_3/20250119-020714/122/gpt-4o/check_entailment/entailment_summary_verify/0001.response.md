Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the specified behavior of performing element-wise floor division on the corresponding elements of two input tuples. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple containing the results of these division operations. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, producing the correct results for the given inputs.

The function summary also supports this conclusion by stating that the function assumes the input tuples are of the same length and that each element in `tup2` is non-zero, ensuring that no division by zero errors occur. These assumptions are consistent with the problem description and the implementation of the function.

Given the function's correct implementation and the successful verification through the provided test cases, there is no reason to overturn the original assessment.

Final: **True**
