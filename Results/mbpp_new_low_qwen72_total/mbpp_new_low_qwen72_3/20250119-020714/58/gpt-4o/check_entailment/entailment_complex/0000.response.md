Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works correctly because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list effectively counts the number of `True` values.

The provided test cases also support this:
- `assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2` correctly asserts that there are 2 `True` values.
- `assert func_1([False, False]) == 0` correctly asserts that there are 0 `True` values.
- `assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3` correctly asserts that there are 3 `True` values.

The comments in the program accurately describe the state and behavior of the function. The function does not modify the input list and handles an empty list by returning 0, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
