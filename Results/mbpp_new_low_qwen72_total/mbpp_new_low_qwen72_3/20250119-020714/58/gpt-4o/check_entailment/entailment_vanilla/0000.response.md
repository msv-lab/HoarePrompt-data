Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` booleans in the given list. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list directly will give the count of `True` values.

However, the test cases provided use the `assert` statement to check the correctness of the function, but they do not define the function `func_1` before the `assert` statements. This would cause a `NameError` when the code is run because `func_1` is called before it is defined.

To fix this, the function definition should come before the `assert` statements.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)

assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3
```

Given the original code, the placement of the function definition is incorrect, leading to a potential runtime error.

Correctness: **False**
