Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` uses the `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in the given list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, summing the list directly will correctly count the number of `True` values. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.
