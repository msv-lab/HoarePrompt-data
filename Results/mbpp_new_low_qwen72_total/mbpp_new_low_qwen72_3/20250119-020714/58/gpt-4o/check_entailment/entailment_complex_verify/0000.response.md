Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` values in the given list by leveraging Python's behavior where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function sums these integer equivalents, effectively counting the number of `True` values. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with mixed boolean values, all `False` values, and all `True` values, and they all pass. The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as described, and there are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.

Final: **True**
