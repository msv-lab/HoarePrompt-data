Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bool_list is a list of boolean values.
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)
    #The program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list `bool_list`, where True is treated as 1 and False as 0.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
