Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` boolean values in the given list. In Python, boolean values can be treated as integers where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. The `sum` function in Python adds up all the elements in the list. When applied to a list of booleans, it effectively counts the number of `True` values because each `True` contributes `1` to the sum, and each `False` contributes `0`.

The provided assertions test different scenarios:
- `assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2`: This list has two `True` values, so the sum should be `2`.
- `assert func_1([False, False]) == 0`: This list has no `True` values, so the sum should be `0`.
- `assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3`: This list has three `True` values, so the sum should be `3`.

All these assertions pass, indicating that the function works correctly for the given test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
