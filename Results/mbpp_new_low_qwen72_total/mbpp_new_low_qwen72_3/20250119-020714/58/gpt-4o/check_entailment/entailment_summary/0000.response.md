Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of boolean values and returns the count of `True` values in the list. The function uses the built-in `sum` function, which works correctly for this purpose because in Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0 when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, summing the list will effectively count the number of `True` values.

The test cases provided in the assertions are:
1. `assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2` - This is correct because there are two `True` values in the list.
2. `assert func_1([False, False]) == 0` - This is correct because there are no `True` values in the list.
3. `assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3` - This is correct because there are three `True` values in the list.

All the assertions pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
