You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values, and returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` booleans in the given list. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list directly will give the count of `True` values.

However, the test cases provided use the `assert` statement to check the correctness of the function, but they do not define the function `func_1` before the `assert` statements. This would cause a `NameError` when the code is run because `func_1` is called before it is defined.

To fix this, the function definition should come before the `assert` statements.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)

assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3
```

Given the original code, the placement of the function definition is incorrect, leading to a potential runtime error.

Correctness: **False**
