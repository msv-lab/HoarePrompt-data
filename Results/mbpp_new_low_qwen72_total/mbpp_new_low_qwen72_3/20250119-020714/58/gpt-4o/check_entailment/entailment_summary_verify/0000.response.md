Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` values in the given list by leveraging Python's treatment of `True` as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function effectively adds up all the `True` values (each contributing 1) and `False` values (each contributing 0), resulting in the total count of `True` values. The provided test cases validate this behavior for different scenarios, including lists with mixed values, all `False` values, and all `True` values. The function summary confirms that the function does not modify the input list and handles empty lists by returning 0, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
