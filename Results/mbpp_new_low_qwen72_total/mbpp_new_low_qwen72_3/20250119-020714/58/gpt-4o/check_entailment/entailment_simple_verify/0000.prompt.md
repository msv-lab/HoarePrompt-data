You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

- Program: 
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bool_list is a list of boolean values.
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)
    #The program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list `bool_list`, where True is treated as 1 and False as 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` uses the `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in the given list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, summing the list directly will correctly count the number of `True` values. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.

End of Original Assessment

Your Response: 
Reasoning: [Your explanation] 
Final: **True** or **False**
