Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is logically sound for counting the number of `True` booleans in a list. It leverages the fact that in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, so summing the list directly yields the desired count.

However, the original assessment also correctly points out a critical issue: the `assert` statements are placed before the function definition, which would result in a `NameError` when the code is executed. This is a valid concern and must be addressed to ensure the code runs correctly.

The corrected code provided in the original assessment is indeed the proper way to structure the program to avoid the `NameError`.

Given this, the original assessment's conclusion that the code is incorrect due to the placement of the function definition is accurate.

Final: **False**
