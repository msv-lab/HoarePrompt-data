Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` values in the given list by leveraging Python's treatment of `True` as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function sums these integer equivalents, effectively counting the number of `True` values. The provided test cases cover a range of scenarios, including lists with mixed boolean values, all `False` values, and all `True` values, and they all pass, confirming the function's correctness. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
