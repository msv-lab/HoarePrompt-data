The provided code calculates two values based on the initial value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The first line calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and assigns it to `sum_n`. The second line calculates the square of `sum_n` and assigns it to `sum_cubes_n`.

- For `sum_n`, since `n` is a non-negative integer, the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- For `sum_cubes_n`, the value of `sum_n` is squared.

No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `sum_n` and `sum_cubes_n` along with the original value of `n`.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, sum_n is n * (n + 1) // 2, sum_cubes_n is (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2**
