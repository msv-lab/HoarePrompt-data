You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the value `(n * (n + 1) // 2)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Sum of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_n`)**:
   The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is:
   \[
   \text{sum\_n} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This is correctly implemented in the function as:
   ```python
   sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
   ```

2. **Sum of Cubes of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_cubes_n`)**:
   The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:
   \[
   \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This is also correctly implemented in the function as:
   ```python
   sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
   ```

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   The function then returns the difference between `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n`:
   ```python
   return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
   ```

Let's verify the test cases:
- For `n = 3`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 6^2 = 36
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 36 - 6 = 30
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(3) == 30`.

- For `n = 5`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 15^2 = 225
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 225 - 15 = 210
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(5) == 210`.

- For `n = 2`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 3^2 = 9
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 9 - 3 = 6
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(2) == 6`.

Since all the test cases are correct and the logic of the function is sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
