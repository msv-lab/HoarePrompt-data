Reasoning:

The original assessment is indeed accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sum of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_n`)**:
   - The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is:
     \[
     \text{sum\_n} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - This is correctly implemented in the function as:
     ```python
     sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
     ```
   - The use of integer division `//` ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for this context.

2. **Sum of Cubes of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_cubes_n`)**:
   - The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:
     \[
     \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
     \]
   - This is also correctly implemented in the function as:
     ```python
     sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
     ```

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The function then returns the difference between `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n`:
     ```python
     return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
     ```

4. **Verification of Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 3`:
     \[
     \text{sum\_n} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 6^2 = 36
     \]
     \[
     \text{result} = 36 - 6 = 30
     \]
     This matches the test case `func_1(3) == 30`.

   - For `n = 5`:
     \[
     \text{sum\_n} = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 15^2 = 225
     \]
     \[
     \text{result} = 225 - 15 = 210
     \]
     This matches the test case `func_1(5) == 210`.

   - For `n = 2`:
     \[
     \text{sum\_n} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 3^2 = 9
     \]
     \[
     \text{result} = 9 - 3 = 6
     \]
     This matches the test case `func_1(2) == 6`.

Given that the mathematical formulas and their implementations are correct, and all the test cases are verified to produce the expected results, the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
