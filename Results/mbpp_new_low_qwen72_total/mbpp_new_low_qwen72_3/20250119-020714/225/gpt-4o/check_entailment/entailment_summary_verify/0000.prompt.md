You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the value `(n * (n + 1) // 2)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The formula used in the function is mathematically correct:

- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by \( \text{sum}_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \).

The function then returns the difference \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n - \text{sum}_n \), which matches the problem description. The test cases provided also verify the correctness of the implementation for specific values of `n`. No edge cases or potential issues are evident, so the program is correct for all potential cases.
