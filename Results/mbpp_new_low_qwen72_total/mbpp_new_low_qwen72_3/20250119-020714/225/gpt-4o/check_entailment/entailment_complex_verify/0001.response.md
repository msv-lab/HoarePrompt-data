Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the function `func_1` and verifies it against the provided test cases. However, there is a critical error in the annotated version of the code that needs to be addressed.

In the annotated code, the comment states:
```python
#The program returns (n * (n + 1) // 2) - (n * (n + 1) // 2), which simplifies to 0, since both `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n` are equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
```
This statement is incorrect. The correct formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is indeed the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, as correctly implemented in the function:
```python
sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
```
Therefore, `sum_cubes_n` is not equal to `sum_n`, but rather `sum_cubes_n` is the square of `sum_n`.

Let's re-evaluate the function step-by-step using the correct formulas:

1. **Sum of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_n`)**:
   \[
   \text{sum\_n} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Sum of Cubes of the First `n` Natural Numbers (`sum_cubes_n`)**:
   \[
   \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
   \]

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   The function returns the difference between `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n`:
   \[
   \text{result} = \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]

Now, let's verify the test cases again:

- For `n = 3`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 6^2 = 36
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 36 - 6 = 30
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(3) == 30`.

- For `n = 5`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 15^2 = 225
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 225 - 15 = 210
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(5) == 210`.

- For `n = 2`:
  \[
  \text{sum\_n} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = 3^2 = 9
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 9 - 3 = 6
  \]
  This matches the test case `func_1(2) == 6`.

Given that the test cases are correct and the logic of the function is sound, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated code's incorrect statement does not affect the correctness of the function itself.

Final: **True**
