Reasoning:  
The program is intended to compute the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, there is an error in the implementation. The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is correctly implemented as `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`. The formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers should be `(n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2`, but the program incorrectly uses `sum_n ** 2` after the calculation of `sum_n`.

The final return statement is also incorrect. It returns `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, which is the correct form for the intended computation, but because `sum_cubes_n` is not calculated correctly, the result is wrong. Specifically, the comment suggests that the program is returning the difference between two identical values, which would always be 0. This is not the case, but the logic leading up to the return statement is flawed.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(3)` should return `36 - 6 = 30`
- `func_1(5)` should return `225 - 15 = 210`
- `func_1(2)` should return `9 - 3 = 6`

These results match the expected outputs according to the problem statement, indicating that the function is producing the correct output despite the logical flaw in the comments. Therefore, the function is correct in its implementation and output, even though the comments are misleading.

Correctness: **True**
