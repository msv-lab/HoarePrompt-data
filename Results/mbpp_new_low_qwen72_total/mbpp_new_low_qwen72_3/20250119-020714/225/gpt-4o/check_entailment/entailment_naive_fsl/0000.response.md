Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The formula used in the function is mathematically correct:

- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by \( \text{sum}_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \).

The function then returns the difference \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n - \text{sum}_n \), which matches the problem description. The test cases provided also verify the correctness of the implementation for specific values of `n`. No edge cases or potential issues are evident, so the program is correct for all potential cases.
