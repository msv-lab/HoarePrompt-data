#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `num_strings`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string represents a valid integer, and returns a sorted list of integers. Each integer in the returned list corresponds to one of the strings in the input list, converted to an integer. The function assumes that all strings in the input list can be successfully converted to integers. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-integer strings, which would result in a `ValueError`.
