Reasoning:
The function `func_1` indeed takes a list of strings representing numbers and sorts them numerically by first converting each string to an integer. The function then returns a sorted list of these integers. This approach is correct for sorting the numbers in numerical order, which is the primary requirement as stated in the problem description.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings. However, since the problem description does not specify the type of the output, and the primary goal is to sort the numbers numerically, the current implementation meets the requirements.

The function also assumes that all strings in the input list can be successfully converted to integers. This is a reasonable assumption given that the problem description mentions "valid inputs" and the function summary confirms that non-integer strings would raise a `ValueError`. Since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this assumption is valid.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
