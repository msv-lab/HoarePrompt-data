Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the function's output and the problem description. The function `func_1` indeed converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and then returns a list of integers. However, the problem description specifies that the function should return a list of strings sorted numerically. To align with the problem description, the function should convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them.

Given the function summary and the problem description, the current implementation of `func_1` is incomplete because it does not convert the sorted integers back to strings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is incorrect based on the problem requirements.

To correct this, the function should be modified to convert the sorted integers back to strings. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return [str(num) for num in sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])]
```

However, since the task is to evaluate the given program, we must conclude based on the provided code.

Final: **False**
