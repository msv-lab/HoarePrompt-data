You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string represents a valid integer, and returns a sorted list of integers. Each integer in the returned list corresponds to one of the strings in the input list, converted to an integer. The function assumes that all strings in the input list can be successfully converted to integers. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-integer strings, which would result in a `ValueError`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) and attempts to sort them numerically. The approach used in the function is to convert each string to an integer using a list comprehension, and then sort the resulting list of integers. This will correctly sort the numbers in numerical order, not lexicographical order, which is the desired behavior according to the problem statement.

However, the function returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as the original input. If the requirement is to return a list of strings, this would be incorrect. But since the problem statement does not explicitly specify the type of the output, and sorting numerically is the primary goal, we can consider this correct.

Additionally, the function assumes that all elements in `num_strings` can be converted to integers. If any element cannot be converted, a `ValueError` will be raised. Since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this assumption is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
