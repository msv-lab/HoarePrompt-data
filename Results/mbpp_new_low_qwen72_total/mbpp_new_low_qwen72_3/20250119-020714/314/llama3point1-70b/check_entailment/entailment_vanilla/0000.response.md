Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) and attempts to sort them numerically. The approach used in the function is to convert each string to an integer using a list comprehension, and then sort the resulting list of integers. This will correctly sort the numbers in numerical order, not lexicographical order, which is the desired behavior according to the problem statement.

However, the function returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as the original input. If the requirement is to return a list of strings, this would be incorrect. But since the problem statement does not explicitly specify the type of the output, and sorting numerically is the primary goal, we can consider this correct.

Additionally, the function assumes that all elements in `num_strings` can be converted to integers. If any element cannot be converted, a `ValueError` will be raised. Since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this assumption is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
