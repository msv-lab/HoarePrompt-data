Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function converts each string in the list to an integer and sorts them, but it returns a list of integers instead of a list of strings, which is not consistent with the problem statement that requires sorting a list of strings numerically. For example, if the input is `["10", "2", "30"]`, the function will return `[2, 10, 30]` (a list of integers), instead of `['2', '10', '30']` (a list of strings). This discrepancy makes the function incorrect according to the problem description.
