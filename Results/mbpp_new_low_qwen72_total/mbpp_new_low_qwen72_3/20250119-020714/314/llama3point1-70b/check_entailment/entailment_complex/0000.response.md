Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer, and return a sorted list of integers. The implementation uses a list comprehension to convert each string in the input list to an integer and then sorts the resulting list of integers. 

Based on the provided comments and the problem description:
1. The function correctly handles the conversion of strings to integers using `int(num)`.
2. The function correctly sorts the list of integers using the `sorted` function.
3. The function returns an empty list if the input list is empty, which is the expected behavior.
4. The function assumes that all strings in the input list can be successfully converted to integers, and it does not handle cases where the input list contains non-integer strings, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, the problem description and the comments both state that the input is assumed to be valid, so this assumption is reasonable.

Given these points, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and behaves as intended for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
