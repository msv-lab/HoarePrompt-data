Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `num_strings`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
