Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`), where each string is expected to represent a valid integer. It uses a list comprehension to convert each string in the list to an integer, and then sorts the resulting list of integers using the `sorted` function. The sorted list of integers is then returned.

Based on the problem description, the goal is to sort a list of strings of numbers numerically. The provided function correctly converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list. This meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
