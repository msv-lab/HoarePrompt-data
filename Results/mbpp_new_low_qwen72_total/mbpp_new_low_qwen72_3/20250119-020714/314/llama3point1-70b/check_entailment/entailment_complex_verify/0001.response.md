Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` correctly converts each string in the input list to an integer, sorts the integers, and returns the sorted list. This approach ensures that the numbers are sorted numerically rather than lexicographically, which aligns with the problem statement's requirement.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function returns a list of integers instead of strings. However, the problem statement does not explicitly require the output to be a list of strings, so returning a list of integers is acceptable.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

The original assessment also notes that the function assumes all elements in the input list can be converted to integers. This is a reasonable assumption given that the problem statement specifies valid inputs. If an invalid input is provided (e.g., a string that cannot be converted to an integer), a `ValueError` will be raised, but this is not a concern under the assumption of valid inputs.

Based on the annotated code and the original assessment, the function behaves as intended and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
