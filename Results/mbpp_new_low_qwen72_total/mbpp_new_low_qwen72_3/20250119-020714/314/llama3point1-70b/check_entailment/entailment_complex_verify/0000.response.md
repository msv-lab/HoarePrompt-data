Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`. The problem description explicitly states that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, implying that the output should still be a list of strings. However, the provided function `func_1` returns a list of integers after converting and sorting the strings. This mismatch means that while the function correctly sorts the numbers, it does not return the result in the expected format (a list of strings).

To align the function with the problem description, the sorted integers should be converted back to strings before being returned. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to an incorrect output type.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the function's output format. Therefore, the function as written is incorrect according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
