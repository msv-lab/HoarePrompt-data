Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly converts each string in the input list to an integer and sorts the resulting list of integers. The function meets the requirements of sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically. It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list. However, the function does not handle invalid input (i.e., non-integer strings), but this is noted in the execution summary as an assumption that all strings can be successfully converted to integers. Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the function is correct within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
