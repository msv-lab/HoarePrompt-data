Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`. The problem description specifies that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically, implying that the output should also be a list of strings. However, the provided function `func_1` converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and then returns a list of integers. This means that the function does not adhere to the requirement of returning a list of strings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is incorrect because it does not meet the specified output format.

Final: **False**
