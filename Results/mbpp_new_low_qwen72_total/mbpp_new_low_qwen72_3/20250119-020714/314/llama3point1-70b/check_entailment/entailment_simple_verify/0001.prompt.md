You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program: 
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string represents a valid integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `num_strings`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) and attempts to sort them numerically. The approach used in the function is to convert each string to an integer using a list comprehension, and then sort the resulting list of integers. This will correctly sort the numbers in numerical order, not lexicographical order, which is the desired behavior according to the problem statement.

However, the function returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as the original input. If the requirement is to return a list of strings, this would be incorrect. But since the problem statement does not explicitly specify the type of the output, and sorting numerically is the primary goal, we can consider this correct.

Additionally, the function assumes that all elements in `num_strings` can be converted to integers. If any element cannot be converted, a `ValueError` will be raised. Since the problem statement assumes valid inputs, this assumption is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
