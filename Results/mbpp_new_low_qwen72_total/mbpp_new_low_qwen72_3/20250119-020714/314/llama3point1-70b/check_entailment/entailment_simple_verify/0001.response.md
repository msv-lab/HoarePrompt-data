Reasoning:
The original assessment is largely accurate. The function `func_1` does indeed convert each string in the input list to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns the sorted list. This meets the primary goal of sorting the numbers numerically, which is the core requirement of the problem statement.

The annotations confirm that:
1. The input `num_strings` is a list of strings, each representing a valid integer.
2. The function converts these strings to integers and sorts them.
3. The output is a sorted list of integers.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function returns a list of integers, not strings. However, the problem statement does not explicitly require the output to be a list of strings. It only specifies that the list should be sorted numerically. Therefore, returning a list of integers is acceptable.

Additionally, the function assumes that all elements in `num_strings` can be converted to integers, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement's assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the assumptions made.
