Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

#State of the program right berfore the function call: velocity is a non-negative float representing wind speed in km/h, and temperature is a float representing temperature in Celsius.
def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = (13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 +
    0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16)
    return round(wind_chill_index)
    #The program returns the rounded value of the wind chill index, calculated as \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \), where `velocity` is a non-negative float representing wind speed in km/h and `temperature` is a float representing temperature in Celsius.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a non-negative float representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a float representing temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) and returns the rounded value of this index. The function ensures that the result is always a rounded integer. Edge cases include scenarios where `velocity` is zero or very low, which should still yield a valid wind chill index, and extreme temperatures, which are handled by the formula without additional checks.
