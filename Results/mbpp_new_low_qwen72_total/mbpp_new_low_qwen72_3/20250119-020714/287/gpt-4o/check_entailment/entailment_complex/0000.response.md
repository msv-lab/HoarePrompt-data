Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the wind chill index formula as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the function matches the standard wind chill index calculation formula:

\[ \text{Wind Chill Index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

The function also rounds the result to the nearest integer using the `round` function, which is consistent with the requirement to return the wind chill index rounded to the next integer.

The provided test cases are:
- `func_1(120, 35)` should return `40`
- `func_1(40, 20)` should return `19`
- `func_1(10, 8)` should return `6`

These test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the results match the expected values.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as zero or very low wind velocities and extreme temperatures, as the formula itself is designed to handle these scenarios without additional checks.

Therefore, based on the implementation, the test cases, and the handling of edge cases, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
