Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the expected results from the test cases and the actual results calculated using the provided formula. Let's re-evaluate the calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

1. For `velocity = 120` and `temperature = 35`:
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times 35 - 11.37 \times 120^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 35 \times 120^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   120^{0.16} \approx 3.025
   \]
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 21.7525 - 34.38575 + 41.97175 \approx 42.46
   \]
   Rounding 42.46 gives 42, not 40. This suggests an error in the test case or the formula.

2. For `velocity = 40` and `temperature = 20`:
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times 20 - 11.37 \times 40^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 20 \times 40^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   40^{0.16} \approx 2.224
   \]
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 12.43 - 25.2668 + 17.5488 \approx 17.832
   \]
   Rounding 17.832 gives 18, not 19. This suggests another error in the test case or the formula.

3. For `velocity = 10` and `temperature = 8`:
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times 8 - 11.37 \times 10^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 8 \times 10^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   10^{0.16} \approx 1.452
   \]
   \[
   \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 4.972 - 16.46544 + 4.29936 \approx 5.82592
   \]
   Rounding 5.82592 gives 6, which matches the expected result.

From the above calculations, it is clear that the first two test cases (`func_1(120, 35)` and `func_1(40, 20)`) have discrepancies between the expected and actual results. The third test case (`func_1(10, 8)`) is correct.

Given that the discrepancies are significant and the formula itself is correct, it is likely that the test cases provided are incorrect or the expected results are misstated.

Final: **False**
