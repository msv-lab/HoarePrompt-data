Reasoning: 

The original assessment points out that the `round` function does not always round to the next integer, which is true. However, the problem description specifically asks for the wind chill index to be rounded to the next integer. This implies that any fractional part should be rounded up to the next whole number, regardless of its value. The `math.ceil` function is indeed the appropriate function to use for this purpose.

Let's verify the function with the provided test cases using `math.ceil`:

1. For the input `(120, 35)`, the calculated wind chill index is:
   \[
   13.12 + 0.6215 \times 35 - 11.37 \times 120^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 35 \times 120^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 13.12 + 21.7525 - 45.48 + 19.5075 \approx 40.89
   \]
   Using `math.ceil(40.89)` results in 41, but the expected output is 40, which suggests there might be a slight discrepancy in the test case itself.

2. For the input `(40, 20)`, the calculated wind chill index is:
   \[
   13.12 + 0.6215 \times 20 - 11.37 \times 40^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 20 \times 40^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 13.12 + 12.43 - 17.36 + 7.76 \approx 15.95
   \]
   Using `math.ceil(15.95)` results in 16, but the expected output is 19, which again suggests a discrepancy in the test case.

3. For the input `(10, 8)`, the calculated wind chill index is:
   \[
   13.12 + 0.6215 \times 8 - 11.37 \times 10^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times 8 \times 10^{0.16}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 13.12 + 4.972 - 7.66 + 3.17 \approx 13.592
   \]
   Using `math.ceil(13.592)` results in 14, but the expected output is 6, which again suggests a discrepancy in the test case.

Given these discrepancies, it appears that the test cases provided may not accurately reflect the expected outputs for the given inputs. However, the core issue identified in the original assessment—using `round` instead of `math.ceil`—is still valid.

To ensure the function meets the requirement of rounding to the next integer, the function should be modified to use `math.ceil`:

```python
import math

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return math.ceil(wind_chill_index)
```

Final: **False**

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the rounding method. The function should use `math.ceil` to ensure it always rounds to the next integer. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final evaluation is **False**.
