Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the wind chill index using the formula:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

However, the problem description specifies that the wind chill index should be rounded to the next integer. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which means it rounds down if the decimal part is less than 0.5 and up if it is 0.5 or more. To round to the next integer, the `math.ceil` function should be used instead.

For example, consider the input `(10, 8)`:
- The calculated wind chill index is approximately 5.64.
- Using `round(5.64)` results in 6, which is correct in this case.
- However, for an input like `(10, 7)`, the calculated wind chill index might be 5.3, and `round(5.3)` would result in 5, whereas the correct answer should be 6 (the next integer).

Thus, the function does not meet the requirement of rounding to the next integer for all potential cases.
