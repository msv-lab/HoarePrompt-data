Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` implements the wind chill index calculation correctly according to the given formula. The function takes two parameters, `velocity` and `temperature`, and uses them in the formula to compute the wind chill index. The result is then rounded to the nearest integer using Python's `round` function, which aligns with the problem description that requires the index to be rounded to the next integer.

The test cases provided in the `assert` statements are also checked against expected values, and they seem to match the expected behavior of the function. The execution summary confirms that the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as zero or very low velocities and extreme temperatures.

However, there is a minor discrepancy in the problem description: it states that the wind chill index should be rounded to the "next" integer, which typically implies rounding up. The `round` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer, which could be either up or down depending on the decimal part. If the requirement is to always round up, the `math.ceil` function should be used instead of `round`.

Given the information and the test cases provided, the function appears to be correct in terms of implementation and handling the specified inputs.

Correctness: **True** 

If the requirement is strictly to round up to the next integer, the function would need to be adjusted, but based on the current information, the function is considered correct.
