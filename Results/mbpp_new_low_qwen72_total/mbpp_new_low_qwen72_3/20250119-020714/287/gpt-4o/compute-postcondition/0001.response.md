Output State: **The program returns the rounded value of the wind chill index, calculated as \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \), where `velocity` is a non-negative float representing wind speed in km/h and `temperature` is a float representing temperature in Celsius.**
