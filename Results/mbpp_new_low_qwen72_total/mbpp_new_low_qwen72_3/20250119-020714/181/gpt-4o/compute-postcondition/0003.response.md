Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and is intended to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. However, due to a coding error, the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function does not correctly compute or return the intended average value. The final state of the program after the function call will be an error state, with the function raising an exception. **
