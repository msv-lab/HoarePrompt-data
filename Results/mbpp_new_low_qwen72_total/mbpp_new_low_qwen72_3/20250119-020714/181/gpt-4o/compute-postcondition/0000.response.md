The code initializes a range of natural numbers from 1 to `n`, calculates the cubes of these numbers, computes the sum of these cubes, and then finds the average of these cubes by dividing the sum by `n`.

- `natural_numbers` is set to a range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `cubes` is a list containing the cubes of each number in `natural_numbers`.
- `sum_of_cubes` is the sum of all elements in the `cubes` list.
- `average` is the result of dividing `sum_of_cubes` by `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer, the calculations are based on this value. The final state includes the updated values of `natural_numbers`, `cubes`, `sum_of_cubes`, and `average`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, natural_numbers is range(1, n + 1), cubes is [x**3 for x in range(1, n + 1)], sum_of_cubes is the sum of cubes, average is sum_of_cubes / n**
