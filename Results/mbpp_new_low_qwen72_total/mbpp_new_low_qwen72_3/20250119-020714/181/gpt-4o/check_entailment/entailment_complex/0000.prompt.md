Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the variable `average`, which is not defined or calculated in the given code snippet. Therefore, the program will raise an error due to the undefined variable `average`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and is intended to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. However, due to a coding error, the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function does not correctly compute or return the intended average value. The final state of the program after the function call will be an error state, with the function raising an exception.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
