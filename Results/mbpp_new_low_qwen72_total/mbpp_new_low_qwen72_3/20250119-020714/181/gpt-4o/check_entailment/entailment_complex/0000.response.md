Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is intended to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. However, there is a logical error in the code. The variable `average` is correctly calculated as the sum of the cubes divided by `n`, but the comment suggests that the program will raise a `NameError` because `average` is referenced before it is assigned. This is incorrect; the variable `average` is indeed defined and used correctly in the function. The actual issue is with the indentation of the `return` statement, which should be aligned with the `average` calculation to ensure the function returns the correct value.

Given the correct indentation, the function should work as expected. However, the provided test cases do not match the expected output of the function. For example, the average of the cubes of the first 3 natural numbers (1, 8, 27) is (1 + 8 + 27) / 3 = 12, which matches the second test case. However, the first test case (for `n=2`) should be (1 + 8) / 2 = 4.5, and the third test case (for `n=1`) should be 1, both of which are correct according to the provided test cases.

Therefore, the function logic is correct, but the test cases are consistent with the function's expected behavior. The only issue is the indentation of the `return` statement, which is a minor syntax error.

Correctness: **False**

However, if we assume the indentation is correct (as it should be), then the function is logically correct, and the test cases are also correct. In this case:

Correctness: **True**
