Reasoning: The original assessment is inaccurate. According to the function summary, there is a claim that the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned, which would lead to a `NameError`. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code, this is not the case. The variable `average` is correctly defined and used after the necessary calculations are performed. The code snippet:

```python
natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
average = sum_of_cubes / n
return average
```

clearly shows that `average` is calculated after `sum_of_cubes` and `n` are determined. Additionally, the assertions provided:

```python
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1
```

all pass, which confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. There are no issues with the logic or the sequence of operations within the function.

Final: **True**
