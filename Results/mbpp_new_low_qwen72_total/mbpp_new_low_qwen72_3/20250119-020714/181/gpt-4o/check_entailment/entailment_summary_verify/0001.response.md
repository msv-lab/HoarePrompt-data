Reasoning:
The original assessment contains an error in its reasoning. The function summary provided indicates that there is a `NameError` because the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code, this is not the case. The variable `average` is correctly assigned after the sum of cubes is computed, and the function should work as intended.

Let's re-evaluate the function step-by-step:

1. **Natural Numbers**: The range `range(1, n + 1)` generates the first `n` natural numbers.
2. **Cubes**: The list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]` computes the cube of each number in the range.
3. **Sum of Cubes**: The `sum(cubes)` function calculates the total sum of these cubes.
4. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated by dividing the sum of cubes by `n`.
5. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed average.

Given the test cases:
- For `n = 2`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2
  - Cubes: 1^3, 2^3 = 1, 8
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5
  - The function returns 4.5, which matches the expected output.

- For `n = 3`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3
  - Cubes: 1^3, 2^3, 3^3 = 1, 8, 27
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36
  - Average: 36 / 3 = 12
  - The function returns 12, which matches the expected output.

- For `n = 1`:
  - Natural numbers: 1
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1
  - Sum of cubes: 1
  - Average: 1 / 1 = 1
  - The function returns 1, which matches the expected output.

The function `func_1` is correctly implemented and handles all the provided test cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct.

Final: **True**
