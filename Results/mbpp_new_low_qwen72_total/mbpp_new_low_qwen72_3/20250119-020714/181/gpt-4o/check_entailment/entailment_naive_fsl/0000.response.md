Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers, computes their cubes, sums these cubes, and then divides by `n` to get the average. The assertions provided also pass, confirming that the function works as expected for the given test cases. There are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for any positive integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
