Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary mentions a `NameError` due to the variable `average` being referenced before assignment, but upon reviewing the code, there is no such issue. The variable `average` is properly defined and used within the function. The main issue lies in the test cases provided. The expected outputs for the test cases do not match the actual results of the function. Let's verify the correct outputs:

- For `n=2`: The cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\). The sum is \(1 + 8 = 9\), and the average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\).
- For `n=3`: The cubes are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(3^3 = 27\). The sum is \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\), and the average is \(36 / 3 = 12\).
- For `n=1`: The cube is \(1^3 = 1\). The sum is \(1\), and the average is \(1 / 1 = 1\).

The provided test cases are actually correct according to the function's logic. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct and behaves as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
