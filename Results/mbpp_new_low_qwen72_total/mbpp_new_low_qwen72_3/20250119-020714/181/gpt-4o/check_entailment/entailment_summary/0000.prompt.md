Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and is intended to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. However, due to a coding error, the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function does not correctly compute or return the intended average value. The final state of the program after the function call will be an error state, with the function raising an exception.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
