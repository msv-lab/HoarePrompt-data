You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the variable `average`, which is not defined or calculated in the given code snippet. Therefore, the program will raise an error due to the undefined variable `average`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and is intended to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. However, due to a coding error, the variable `average` is referenced before it is assigned, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function does not correctly compute or return the intended average value. The final state of the program after the function call will be an error state, with the function raising an exception.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Natural Numbers**: The range `range(1, n + 1)` generates the first `n` natural numbers.
2. **Cubes**: The list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]` computes the cube of each number in the range.
3. **Sum of Cubes**: The `sum(cubes)` function calculates the total sum of these cubes.
4. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated by dividing the sum of cubes by `n`.

Now, let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For `n = 2`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2
  - Cubes: 1^3, 2^3 = 1, 8
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5
  - The function returns 4.5, which matches the expected output.

- For `n = 3`:
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3
  - Cubes: 1^3, 2^3, 3^3 = 1, 8, 27
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36
  - Average: 36 / 3 = 12
  - The function returns 12, which matches the expected output.

- For `n = 1`:
  - Natural numbers: 1
  - Cubes: 1^3 = 1
  - Sum of cubes: 1
  - Average: 1 / 1 = 1
  - The function returns 1, which matches the expected output.

All the test cases are correctly handled by the function, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
