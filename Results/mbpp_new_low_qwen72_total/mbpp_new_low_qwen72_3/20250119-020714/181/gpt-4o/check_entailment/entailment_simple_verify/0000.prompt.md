You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the variable `average`, which is not defined or calculated in the given code snippet. Therefore, the program will raise an error due to the undefined variable `average`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers, computes their cubes, sums these cubes, and then divides by `n` to get the average. The assertions provided also pass, confirming that the function works as expected for the given test cases. There are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for any positive integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
