Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. The NSW primes are a sequence of prime numbers that satisfy specific conditions, and the first NSW prime is defined as 7.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is a standard prime-checking function that correctly identifies whether a given number is prime.
- It works by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
- This function is well-defined and handles edge cases like 0, 1, and negative numbers correctly.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is designed to find the nth NSW prime number.
- For `n = 1`, it directly returns 7, which is correct according to the definition of NSW primes.
- For `n > 1`, it starts from 7 and increments the number, checking each one to see if it is a prime and if it satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.
- The condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` ensures that the number is either of the form 6k + 1 or 6k - 1, which is a necessary condition for a number to be a prime (except for 2 and 3).

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_2` does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is less than 1, but the problem statement specifies that `n` is a positive integer, so this is not an issue.
- The function will continue to run indefinitely if it does not find the required number, but this is expected behavior for a search algorithm that is guaranteed to find the number eventually.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are implemented correctly and work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers, and `func_2` correctly identifies the nth NSW prime number by using `func_1` and the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
