 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and checks whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. 

- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or greater, the function iterates over all integers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If any of these integers divide `n` without a remainder, the function returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- For `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `False` because neither 0 nor 1 are prime numbers.
- For `n = 2`, the function returns `True` since 2 is the smallest prime number.
- For negative integers, the function also returns `False` because negative numbers are not considered prime.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. For `n = 1`, it always returns 7. For `n > 1`, it searches for NSW primes greater than 7, ensuring that the number is a prime (as determined by `func_1`) and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. The function continues searching until it finds the nth such number and returns it. The function assumes that `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers. If the function does not find the required number due to an error in `func_1` or other issues, it will continue to run indefinitely. The annotations contain inaccuracies; specifically, the function does not return 8 or 9 under any circumstances as described in Case_3 and Case_4.
