### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - The function correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors.
   - If any divisor is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number.
   - The first NSW prime is defined as 7, which is correctly returned if `n` is 1.
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes `count` to 1 and starts checking numbers starting from 7.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if a number is prime.
   - It also checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a necessary condition for a number to be a NSW prime.
   - When the count of such primes reaches `n`, it returns the current number.

3. **State Analysis**:
   - The state transitions and conditions are correctly described in the comments.
   - The program correctly handles the base case (n = 1) and the general case (n > 1).
   - The loop continues until the nth NSW prime is found, ensuring that the program will eventually terminate with the correct result.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Correctness: **True**
