Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Annotated Program:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer, and n is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the loop has checked all divisors from 2 up to and including `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1

num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is not equal to `n`.
