Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number has a fundamental issue in its approach. The NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation and not by checking if a number is prime and satisfies additional conditions. The NSW primes are generated using the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 1 \]
\[ S_1 = 1 \]
\[ S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \]

A NSW prime is a prime number that appears in this sequence. The program provided checks for primes and then further checks if they satisfy certain conditions (being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6), which is not the correct method to generate NSW primes.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, etc., and they are generated using the recurrence relation, not by incrementing a number and checking for primality.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth NSW prime number.
