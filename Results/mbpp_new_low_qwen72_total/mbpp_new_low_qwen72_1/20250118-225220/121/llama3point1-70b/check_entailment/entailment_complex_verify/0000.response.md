### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a fundamental issue with the provided program. The Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation, and the program provided does not use this recurrence relation. Instead, it checks for primes and then applies an additional condition (`num % 6 in [1, 5]`), which is not the correct method to identify NSW primes.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - NSW primes are generated using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}
     \]
   - A NSW prime is a prime number that appears in this sequence.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if a number is prime using `func_1`.
   - It then checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not follow the recurrence relation that defines NSW primes.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly find the nth NSW prime, the program should generate the sequence using the recurrence relation and then check if each term in the sequence is a prime number.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - However, the annotations do not address the fundamental issue that the program is not using the correct method to generate NSW primes.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth NSW prime number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
