Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately generate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a number is prime.
   - It handles the base case (numbers less than 2 are not prime).
   - It efficiently checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number.
   - The function returns `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - It correctly handles the base case where `n = 1` by returning 7, which is the first NSW prime.
   - However, the logic for finding subsequent NSW primes is flawed. The NSW primes are not just any primes that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. They are generated by a specific recurrence relation:
     \[
     S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n
     \]
   - The current implementation checks all primes that satisfy the modulo condition, which is incorrect. This means that the function may return numbers that are not NSW primes.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for generating NSW primes and thus is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
