You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. For `n = 1`, it always returns 7. For `n > 1`, it searches for NSW primes greater than 7, ensuring that the number is a prime (as determined by `func_1`) and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. The function continues searching until it finds the nth such number and returns it. The function assumes that `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers. If the function does not find the required number due to an error in `func_1` or other issues, it will continue to run indefinitely. The annotations contain inaccuracies; specifically, the function does not return 8 or 9 under any circumstances as described in Case_3 and Case_4.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Let's break down the program and analyze each part:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a number is prime.
   - It correctly handles the base case where numbers less than 2 are not prime.
   - It uses a loop to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to test for primality.
   - The function returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - It starts with the first NSW prime, which is 7.
   - It uses a counter to keep track of how many NSW primes have been found.
   - It iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks if each number is prime using `func_1`.
   - If a number is prime and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, it increments the count.
   - When the count reaches `n`, it returns the current number.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_2`. The NSW primes are not just any primes that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. They are generated by a specific recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n \]

The NSW primes are those primes in the sequence \( S_n \). The current implementation does not follow this recurrence relation and instead checks all primes that satisfy the modulo condition, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for finding the nth NSW prime number.

Correctness: **False**
