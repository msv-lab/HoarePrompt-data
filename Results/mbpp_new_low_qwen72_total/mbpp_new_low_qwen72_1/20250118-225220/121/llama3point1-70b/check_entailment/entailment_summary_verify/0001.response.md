Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a fundamental flaw in the implementation of the function `func_2`. The problem description asks for the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number, which is defined by a specific recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n \]

The NSW primes are those primes that appear in the sequence \( S_n \). However, the provided implementation of `func_2` does not use this recurrence relation. Instead, it checks all primes greater than 7 and filters them based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. This approach is incorrect because it does not generate the NSW primes but rather a subset of primes that happen to satisfy the modulo condition.

To correctly implement the function, one should generate the sequence \( S_n \) using the recurrence relation and then check if each \( S_n \) is prime. The current implementation does not do this and thus fails to find the correct NSW primes.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect for finding the nth NSW prime number.

Final: **False**
