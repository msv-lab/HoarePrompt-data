### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Definition of NSW Primes**:
   - NSW primes are defined by a specific recurrence relation:
     \[
     S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}
     \]
   - A NSW prime is a prime number that appears in this sequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly checks if a number is prime.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to find the nth NSW prime by:
     - Starting with the number 7 (which is the first NSW prime).
     - Incrementing the number and checking if it is prime and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Method**: The program checks for primes and then applies a modular condition, which is not how NSW primes are generated. NSW primes are derived from a specific sequence, not by checking individual numbers for primality and modular conditions.
   - **Recurrence Relation Ignored**: The program does not use the recurrence relation \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) to generate the sequence of NSW numbers.
   - **Infinite Loop Risk**: The program may run indefinitely if it fails to find a number that meets the criteria, especially since the criteria are not aligned with the definition of NSW primes.

4. **Example**:
   - The first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, etc. These are generated using the recurrence relation, not by incrementing and checking each number individually.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the nth NSW prime number. It uses an incorrect method and does not follow the definition of NSW primes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
