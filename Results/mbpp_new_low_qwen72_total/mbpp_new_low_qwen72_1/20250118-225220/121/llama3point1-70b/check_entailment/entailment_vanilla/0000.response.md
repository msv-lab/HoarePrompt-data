Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Let's break down the program and analyze each part:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a number is prime.
   - It correctly handles the base case where numbers less than 2 are not prime.
   - It uses a loop to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to test for primality.
   - The function returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - It starts with the first NSW prime, which is 7.
   - It uses a counter to keep track of how many NSW primes have been found.
   - It iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks if each number is prime using `func_1`.
   - If a number is prime and it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, it increments the count.
   - When the count reaches `n`, it returns the current number.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_2`. The NSW primes are not just any primes that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. They are generated by a specific recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} + S_n \]

The NSW primes are those primes in the sequence \( S_n \). The current implementation does not follow this recurrence relation and instead checks all primes that satisfy the modulo condition, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for finding the nth NSW prime number.

Correctness: **False**
