Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer, and n is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the loop has checked all divisors from 2 up to and including `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and checks whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. 

- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or greater, the function iterates over all integers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). If any of these integers divide `n` without a remainder, the function returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- For `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `False` because neither 0 nor 1 are prime numbers.
- For `n = 2`, the function returns `True` since 2 is the smallest prime number.
- For negative integers, the function also returns `False` because negative numbers are not considered prime.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, and n is not equal to 1
    count = 1

num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is not equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. For `n = 1`, it always returns 7. For `n > 1`, it searches for NSW primes greater than 7, ensuring that the number is a prime (as determined by `func_1`) and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. The function continues searching until it finds the nth such number and returns it. The function assumes that `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers. If the function does not find the required number due to an error in `func_1` or other issues, it will continue to run indefinitely. The annotations contain inaccuracies; specifically, the function does not return 8 or 9 under any circumstances as described in Case_3 and Case_4.
