Reasoning:  
The provided functions aim to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime.
   - It correctly handles edge cases where `n < 2` and returns `False`.
   - It uses a loop to check divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient way to determine primality.
   - The function returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise.
   - This function appears to be correct for determining prime numbers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is designed to find the nth NSW prime number.
   - For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 7, which is the first NSW prime.
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes `count` to 1 and starts with `num = 7`.
   - It enters a loop where it increments `num` and checks if `num` is a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `num` is a prime and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, it increments `count`.
   - When `count` equals `n`, it returns `num`.
   - The loop ensures that the function continues to search for the next NSW prime until the nth one is found.

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The comment "The function does not return 8 or 9 under any circumstances" is correct because 8 and 9 are not prime numbers.
- The function does not have an explicit termination condition other than finding the nth NSW prime, which is appropriate for this problem.

Given the above analysis, the functions appear to correctly implement the logic for finding the nth NSW prime number. The prime checking function (`func_1`) is correct, and the NSW prime finder (`func_2`) follows the correct logic to find the desired number.

Correctness: **True**
