The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `count` is 1.
- `num` is 9.
- `count` is not equal to `n`.
- If `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is updated to 2.
- If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9.
- Otherwise, `count` remains 2 and `num` remains 9.

After executing the code snippet:

- `num` is incremented from 9 to 10.
- The conditions related to `num % 6` being 1 or 5 are no longer relevant since `num` is now 10, and `num % 6` is 4.
- `count` remains 1 (unchanged) because the condition to update `count` to 2 was not met.
- `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `count` remains 1, which means it is still not equal to `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
