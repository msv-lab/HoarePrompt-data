Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, and `n` is not equal to 1. `count` is 1, and `num` is 7. If `func_1(num)` returns `True` for the current value of `num`, and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is incremented to 2, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `func_1(num)` does not return `True` for the current value of `num`, then `count` remains 1 and `num` remains 7.***
