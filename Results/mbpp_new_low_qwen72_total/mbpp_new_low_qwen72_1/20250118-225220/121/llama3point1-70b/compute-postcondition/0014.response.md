`num` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 7, making `num` equal to 8. The value of `count` remains unchanged at 1. The conditions regarding `func_1(num)` and the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 are not affected by this increment. The value of `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
