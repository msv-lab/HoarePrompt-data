Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, and the function `func_1(num)` returns `True` for the current value of `num`. Additionally, the remainder when `num` is divided by 6 is either 1 or 5. `count` is not equal to `n`.***
