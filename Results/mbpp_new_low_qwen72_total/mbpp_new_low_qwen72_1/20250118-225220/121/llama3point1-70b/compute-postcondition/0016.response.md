The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and `count` is not equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and `count` is not equal to `n`**
