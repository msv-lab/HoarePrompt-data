For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state of the variables and is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9, and `count` is not equal to `n`**
