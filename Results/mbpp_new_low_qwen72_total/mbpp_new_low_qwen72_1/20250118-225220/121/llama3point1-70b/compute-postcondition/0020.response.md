Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8, and `count` is not equal to `n`. If `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is incremented to 2. If `count` equals `n` after this increment, the program returns 8. Otherwise, `count` remains 1, `num` remains 8, and the program continues without changing any of the variables.***
