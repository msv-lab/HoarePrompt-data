The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is 8, so after the increment, `num` becomes 9. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the value of `count` or `n` in this particular code snippet, and no return takes place. The initial state specifies that if `num % 6` is 1 or 5, `count` is incremented to 2, but this condition is checked before the increment of `num`, and since the new value of `num` is 9, which does not satisfy the condition (`9 % 6` is 3), `count` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 9, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
