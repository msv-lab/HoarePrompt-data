Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues indefinitely until a specific condition is met (`count == n`).
   - The initial state is:
     - `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
     - `count` is 1.
     - `num` is 7.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `num` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `count` is incremented only when `func_1(num)` returns `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the first iteration, `num` becomes 8, but `count` remains 1 because `8 % 6` is 2, which is neither 1 nor 5.
   - After the second iteration, `num` becomes 9, but `count` remains 1 because `9 % 6` is 3, which is neither 1 nor 5.
   - After the third iteration, `num` becomes 10, but `count` remains 1 because `10 % 6` is 4, which is neither 1 nor 5.
   - The loop will continue to increment `num` until `func_1(num)` returns `True` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` reaches `n`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship `count` is not equal to `n` holds true after each iteration.
   - `num` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `count` remains 1 until the conditions are met to increment it.
   - `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes 3 times is:
**`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
