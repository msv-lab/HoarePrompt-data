For a `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that can prevent the loop from executing another iteration. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 8, and `count` is not equal to `n`**
