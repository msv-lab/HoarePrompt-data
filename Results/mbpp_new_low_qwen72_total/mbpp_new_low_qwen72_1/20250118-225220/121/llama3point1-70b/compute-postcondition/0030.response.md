The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer indicating the position in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. Based on the value of `n`, the function returns different values:

- Case_1: The function returns 7.
- Case_2: The function returns 7, which is a positive integer. The function `func_1(num)` returns `True` for this value, and the remainder when 7 is divided by 6 is 1.
- Case_3: The function returns 8.
- Case_4: The function returns 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return a specific integer value based on the cases provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 7 in Case_1, 7 in Case_2 (with additional conditions), 8 in Case_3, or 9 in Case_4.**
