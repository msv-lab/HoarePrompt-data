The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number. For `n = 1`, it always returns 7. For `n > 1`, it searches for NSW primes greater than 7, ensuring that the number is a prime (as determined by `func_1`) and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. The function continues searching until it finds the nth such number and returns it. The function assumes that `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers. If the function does not find the required number due to an error in `func_1` or other issues, it will continue to run indefinitely. The annotations contain inaccuracies; specifically, the function does not return 8 or 9 under any circumstances as described in Case_3 and Case_4.
