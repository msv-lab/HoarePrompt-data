Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a given number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only added once.
   - The function returns the correct sum of proper divisors.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find and sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates through each number from 1 to `n` and checks if the number is part of an amicable pair.
   - The conditions `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)` are correctly implemented to identify amicable pairs.
   - The function sums up all numbers that satisfy these conditions and returns the total sum.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The combination of both functions correctly implements the problem statement.
   - The program will correctly identify and sum all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified number `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
