You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, as no number from 1 to 1 can satisfy the given conditions, resulting in a return value of 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers up to a specified number. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles both perfect squares and non-perfect squares by checking if `i * i != n`.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and uses `func_1` to find pairs of amicable numbers. It ensures that the sum of the proper divisors of `a` is `b` and the sum of the proper divisors of `b` is `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. It then adds `a` to the sum of amicable numbers.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs, ensuring that only true amicable pairs are summed. Therefore, the program is correct.
