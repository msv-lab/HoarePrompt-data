### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Behavior**:
  - The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
  - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
  - If `i` is a divisor, it adds `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum` unless `i * i == n` (to avoid adding the same divisor twice).
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` from `divisors_sum` to exclude `n` itself.

**Correctness**:
- The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors.
- It handles both perfect squares and non-perfect squares appropriately.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n`.
  - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
  - If both conditions are met, it adds `num` to `amicable_sum`.

**Correctness**:
- The function correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers.
- It ensures that the sum of proper divisors of `a` is `b` and the sum of proper divisors of `b` is `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- The condition `func_1(num) < n` is necessary to ensure that the pair `(num, func_1(num))` is within the range from 1 to `n`.

#### Edge Cases:
- When `n = 1`, there are no amicable numbers between 1 and 1, so the function correctly returns 0.
- For other values of `n`, the function correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers within the range.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers up to a specified number. Both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
