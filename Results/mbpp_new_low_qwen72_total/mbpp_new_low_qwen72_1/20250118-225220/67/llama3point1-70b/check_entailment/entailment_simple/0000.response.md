### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a given number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `n`, it checks if `i * i` is not equal to `n` to avoid adding the same divisor twice. If so, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum`. Otherwise, it only adds `i`.
   - Finally, it returns `divisors_sum - n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum of divisors.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of all amicable numbers up to a given number `n`.
   - It iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num)` is less than `n`.
   - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`. If both conditions are true, `num` is an amicable number.
   - If `num` is an amicable number, it adds `num` to `amicable_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns `amicable_sum`.

### Correctness:
- The logic in both functions is correct. `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors, and `func_2` correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers.
- The conditions for identifying amicable numbers are correctly implemented.
- The state of the program at each step is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
