Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1(n)`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
     - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i * i != n` to avoid adding the same divisor twice in the case of a perfect square.
     - If `i * i != n`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum`.
     - If `i * i == n`, it adds only `i` to `divisors_sum`.
     - Finally, it returns `divisors_sum - n` to exclude `n` itself from the sum of divisors.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function correctly calculates the sum of proper divisors, but there is a subtle issue in the way it handles divisors. When `i` is a divisor, `n // i` is also a divisor, but both should be added only once. The current implementation can add `i` and `n // i` twice if `i` is not the square root of `n`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2(n)`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
     - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` to ensure the sum of proper divisors of `num` is less than `n`.
     - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` to ensure that `num` and `func_1(num)` form an amicable pair.
     - If both conditions are met, it adds `num` to `amicable_sum`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The condition `func_1(num) < n` is not necessary for identifying amicable pairs. Amicable pairs can have sums of proper divisors greater than `n`.
     - The function correctly identifies and sums amicable numbers, but the unnecessary condition might exclude valid amicable pairs.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The main issue is in `func_1` where it can add divisors twice. This can lead to incorrect results.
   - The condition `func_1(num) < n` in `func_2` is not required and might exclude valid amicable pairs.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does not correctly handle the sum of proper divisors and may exclude valid amicable pairs due to the unnecessary condition.

Final: **False**
