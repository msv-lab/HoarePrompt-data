Reasoning:
The provided program aims to sum all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`. Let's break down the analysis based on the annotated code and the original assessment.

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
- **Logic**:
  - The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
  - For each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum` if `i * i != n` (to avoid double-counting the square root).
  - If `i * i == n`, it only adds `i` once.
  - Finally, it subtracts `n` from `divisors_sum` to exclude `n` itself.

The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue with the handling of the square root of `n`. Specifically, the condition `if i * i != n` ensures that the square root is not double-counted, but the subtraction of `n` at the end is unnecessary because `n` is not included in the sum of divisors. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of identifying amicable numbers.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: Sum all amicable numbers up to a specified number `n`.
- **Logic**:
  - The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` (which is not strictly necessary for the definition of amicable numbers but ensures the pair is within the range).
  - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
  - If these conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to `amicable_sum`.

The logic in `func_2` is correct. The conditions ensure that the number is part of an amicable pair and is within the specified range.

### Potential Issue in `func_1`:
- The subtraction of `n` at the end of `func_1` is unnecessary. However, since `n` is not included in the sum of divisors, this does not affect the identification of amicable pairs.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic and functionality of the program.
- The minor issue in `func_1` (unnecessary subtraction of `n`) does not impact the correctness of the program for finding amicable numbers.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
