You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of the divisors of the positive integer `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. 

- `func_1` calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself). The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checks if the number is a divisor, and adds both the divisor and its complement (if they are different) to the sum. Finally, it subtracts `n` itself from the sum to get the sum of proper divisors.

- `func_2` uses `func_1` to find and sum all amicable numbers up to `n`. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number `num`, it checks if the sum of proper divisors of `func_1(num)` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`. If these conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to `amicable_sum`.

The logic in both functions appears to be correct. However, there is a potential issue in `func_1` where it might double-count the square root of `n` when `n` is a perfect square. This can be corrected by adjusting the condition to avoid adding the square root twice. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program for finding amicable numbers because the sum of divisors is used in a way that still correctly identifies amicable pairs.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program should correctly sum all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified number `n`.

Correctness: **True**
