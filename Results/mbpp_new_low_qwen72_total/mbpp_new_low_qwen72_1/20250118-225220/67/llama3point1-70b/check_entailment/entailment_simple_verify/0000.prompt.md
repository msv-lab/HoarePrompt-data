You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(n
    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of the divisors of the positive integer `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers up to a specified number. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles both perfect squares and non-perfect squares by checking if `i * i != n`.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and uses `func_1` to find pairs of amicable numbers. It ensures that the sum of the proper divisors of `a` is `b` and the sum of the proper divisors of `b` is `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. It then adds `a` to the sum of amicable numbers.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs, ensuring that only true amicable pairs are summed. Therefore, the program is correct.
