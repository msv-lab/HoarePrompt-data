 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    divisors_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i != n:
                divisors_sum += i + n // i
            else:
                divisors_sum += i
    return divisors_sum - n
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its proper divisors (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles the calculation of divisors, including handling the case where `n` is a perfect square. The function ensures that each divisor pair is only counted once, even when `n` is a perfect square. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer representing the sum of the proper divisors of `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    amicable_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if func_1(num) < n:
            if func_1(func_1(num)) == num and num != func_1(num):
                amicable_sum += num
    return amicable_sum
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, as no number from 1 to 1 can satisfy the given conditions, resulting in a return value of 0.
