### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself).
   - It correctly iterates through potential divisors up to the square root of `n` and accounts for both divisors in each pair.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square, ensuring the square root is only added once.
   - The function returns the sum of proper divisors, which is essential for identifying amicable numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates through each number `num` from 1 to `n` and checks if `func_1(num)` is less than `n`.
   - It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and ensures that `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`.
   - If these conditions are met, `num` is added to the `amicable_sum`.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning 0 since no amicable pairs exist within the range [1, 1].

### Conclusion:
- Both functions are designed to work together to solve the problem of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The logic in both functions is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
- There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that are not handled properly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
