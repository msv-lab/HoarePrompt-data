Reasoning:  
The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. 

- `func_1` calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number `n` (excluding `n` itself). The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checks if the number is a divisor, and adds both the divisor and its complement (if they are different) to the sum. Finally, it subtracts `n` itself from the sum to get the sum of proper divisors.

- `func_2` uses `func_1` to find and sum all amicable numbers up to `n`. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number `num`, it checks if the sum of proper divisors of `func_1(num)` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`. If these conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to `amicable_sum`.

The logic in both functions appears to be correct. However, there is a potential issue in `func_1` where it might double-count the square root of `n` when `n` is a perfect square. This can be corrected by adjusting the condition to avoid adding the square root twice. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program for finding amicable numbers because the sum of divisors is used in a way that still correctly identifies amicable pairs.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program should correctly sum all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified number `n`.

Correctness: **True**
