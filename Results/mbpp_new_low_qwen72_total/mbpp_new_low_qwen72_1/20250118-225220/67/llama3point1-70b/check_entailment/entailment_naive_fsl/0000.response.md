Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies and sums all amicable numbers up to a specified number. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this:

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles both perfect squares and non-perfect squares by checking if `i * i != n`.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and uses `func_1` to find pairs of amicable numbers. It ensures that the sum of the proper divisors of `a` is `b` and the sum of the proper divisors of `b` is `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. It then adds `a` to the sum of amicable numbers.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs, ensuring that only true amicable pairs are summed. Therefore, the program is correct.
