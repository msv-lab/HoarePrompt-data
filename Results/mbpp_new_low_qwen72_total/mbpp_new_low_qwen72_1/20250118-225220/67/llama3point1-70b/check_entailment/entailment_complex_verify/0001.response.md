Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`

#### Purpose:
- Calculate the sum of proper divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).

#### Analysis:
- The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
- For each divisor `i`, it adds `i` and `n // i` to the sum, unless `i * i == n` (i.e., `n` is a perfect square), in which case it only adds `i` once.
- Finally, it subtracts `n` from the sum to get the sum of proper divisors.

#### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by avoiding double-counting the square root.
- The subtraction of `n` at the end ensures that `n` itself is not included in the sum of proper divisors.
- The function works as intended and returns the correct sum of proper divisors.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`

#### Purpose:
- Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.

#### Analysis:
- The function iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`.
- For each number `num`, it checks if `func_1(num) < n` (to ensure the number is within the range).
- It then checks if `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
- If these conditions are met, `num` is an amicable number, and it is added to `amicable_sum`.

#### Correctness:
- The function correctly identifies amicable numbers by using the properties of `func_1`.
- The conditions `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)` ensure that only amicable pairs are considered.
- The sum of all such `num` values is returned.

### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose and logic of both functions.
- It notes a potential issue with double-counting the square root in `func_1`, but correctly states that this does not affect the overall correctness for identifying amicable numbers.
- The assessment concludes that the program should correctly sum all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The reasoning in the original assessment is accurate.
- The program correctly implements the logic for finding and summing amicable numbers.
- There are no significant issues that would cause the program to fail in its intended purpose.

Final: **True**
