The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its proper divisors (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles the calculation of divisors, including handling the case where `n` is a perfect square. The function ensures that each divisor pair is only counted once, even when `n` is a perfect square. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer representing the sum of the proper divisors of `n`.
