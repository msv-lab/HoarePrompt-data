    return divisors_sum - n
    #The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of the divisors of the positive integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its proper divisors (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles the calculation of divisors, including handling the case where `n` is a perfect square. The function ensures that each divisor pair is only counted once, even when `n` is a perfect square. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer representing the sum of the proper divisors of `n`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
    return amicable_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all integers `num` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the conditions: `func_1(num) < n`, `func_1(func_1(num)) == num`, and `num != func_1(num)`. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, as no number from 1 to 1 can satisfy the given conditions, resulting in a return value of 0.
