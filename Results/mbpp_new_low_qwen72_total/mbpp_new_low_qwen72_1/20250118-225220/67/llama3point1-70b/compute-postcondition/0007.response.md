The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` and the upper limit `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `amicable_sum` is 0, and `num` is 2. If `func_1(num)` is less than `n` and `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` while `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.**
