To determine the final output state after the loop completes its execution, we need to follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: `n` is a positive integer, `divisors_sum` is 0.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `n` (inclusive).
- **Condition**: For each `i`, if `n % i == 0`, then:
  - If `i * i != n`, add both `i` and `n // i` to `divisors_sum`.
  - If `i * i == n`, add only `i` to `divisors_sum`.

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**:
  - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
  - `i` increments by 1 in each iteration.
- **Updated Variables**:
  - `divisors_sum` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will iterate through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `n`.
- For each divisor `i` of `n`, it adds either `i` and `n // i` (if `i` is not the square root of `n`) or just `i` (if `i` is the square root of `n`).

### 4. Verify Relationships
- The loop ensures that all divisors of `n` are considered, and their sums are added to `divisors_sum`.
- The loop stops when `i` exceeds the integer square root of `n`.

### Final Output State Calculation
- After the loop completes, `divisors_sum` will contain the sum of all divisors of `n`, excluding `n` itself.
- The value of `i` will be one more than the last integer part of the square root of `n`.

### Final Output State
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer.
- **`i`**: Equals `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
- **`divisors_sum`**: Contains the sum of all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, and `divisors_sum` is the sum of all divisors of `n` excluding `n` itself.**
