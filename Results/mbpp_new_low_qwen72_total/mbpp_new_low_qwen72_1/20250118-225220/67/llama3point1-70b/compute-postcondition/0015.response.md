To solve this, we need to understand the behavior of the given loop and how it updates the variable `amicable_sum` based on the conditions provided. Hereâ€™s the detailed analysis following the specified steps:

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For each `num`, it checks two conditions:
1. `func_1(num) < n`
2. `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`

If both conditions are met, `amicable_sum` is incremented by `num`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
  - `num` changes from 1 to `n` in each iteration.
- **Non-Invariant Variables**:
  - `amicable_sum` can change based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates `n` times, from `num = 1` to `num = n`.
- For each `num`, if `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is incremented by `num`.
- If no such `num` satisfies the conditions, `amicable_sum` remains 0.

### Verify Relationships
- After each iteration, `num` increments by 1.
- The value of `amicable_sum` depends on the number of `num` values that satisfy the conditions.

### Final Output State
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `num` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes (though this is not typically part of the final state since it is outside the loop's scope).
- `amicable_sum` will be the sum of all `num` values that satisfy the conditions.

Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `amicable_sum` is the sum of all `num` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` and `num != func_1(num)`.**
