The code snippet provided updates the value of `amicable_sum` by adding the current value of `num` to it. Initially, `amicable_sum` is 0, and `num` is 2. The condition described in the initial state determines whether `amicable_sum` was set to 1 before this code executes. However, the provided code snippet itself does not check these conditions again; it simply adds `num` to `amicable_sum`.

Given the initial state, if the conditions were met, `amicable_sum` would have been set to 1. Therefore, when the line `amicable_sum += num` is executed, `amicable_sum` will be updated to 1 + 2 = 3.

If the conditions were not met, `amicable_sum` would remain 0, and when the line `amicable_sum += num` is executed, `amicable_sum` will be updated to 0 + 2 = 2.

Since the initial state does not specify whether the conditions were met, we consider both possibilities:

- If the conditions were met: `amicable_sum` is updated to 3.
- If the conditions were not met: `amicable_sum` is updated to 2.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer (at least 1), and `num` remains 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `num` is 2, `amicable_sum` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the conditions were met in the initial state.**
