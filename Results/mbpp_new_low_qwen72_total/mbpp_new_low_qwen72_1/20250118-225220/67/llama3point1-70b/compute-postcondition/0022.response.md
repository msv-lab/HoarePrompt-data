Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its proper divisors (excluding `n` itself). It correctly handles the calculation of divisors, including handling the case where `n` is a perfect square. The function ensures that each divisor pair is only counted once, even when `n` is a perfect square. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer representing the sum of the proper divisors of `n`. **

### Explanation:
- **Input:** The function takes a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
- **Output:** The function returns an integer, which is the sum of all divisors of `n` excluding `n` itself.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is 1, the function returns 0 because 1 has no proper divisors.
  - If `n` is a prime number, the function returns 1 because the only proper divisor of a prime number is 1.
  - If `n` is a perfect square, the function correctly adds the square root of `n` only once to the sum of divisors.
- **Final State:** After the function concludes, the program has computed and returned the sum of the proper divisors of `n`. The variable `divisors_sum` holds the sum of all divisors of `n`, and the function returns `divisors_sum - n`.
