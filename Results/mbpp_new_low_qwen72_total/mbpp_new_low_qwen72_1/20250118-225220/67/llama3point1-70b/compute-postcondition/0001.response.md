To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `num` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Understand the Range Function:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element.
   - The range `range(1, n + 1)` will contain at least one element if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (which means `n` is at least 1).
   - `amicable_sum` is 0.

5. **State at the Start of the First Iteration:**
   - When the loop starts, `num` will be set to the first value in the range, which is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the range to contain at least one element.
   - `amicable_sum` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1, and `num` will be 1. The value of `amicable_sum` remains 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `amicable_sum` is 0, `num` is 1**
