Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(n)`

Given the code snippet:
```
return divisors_sum - n
```

We need to consider the following:
- The variable `divisors_sum` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown or not provided.
- The operation `divisors_sum - n` implies that `divisors_sum` should be a sum of some values, possibly the divisors of `n`.
- Since `divisors_sum` is not explicitly defined, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for the expression `divisors_sum - n`.

However, based on the context, if `divisors_sum` is intended to represent the sum of the divisors of `n`, the output would be the difference between the sum of the divisors of `n` and `n` itself.

Output State: **The program returns the value of `divisors_sum - n`, where `divisors_sum` is the sum of the divisors of the positive integer `n`.**
