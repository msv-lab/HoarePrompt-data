To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `num` is 2, and `amicable_sum` is 0.
- The loop condition: `num` ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- Additional conditions inside the loop (not directly affecting the loop head):
  - If `func_1(num) < n` and `func_1(func_1(num)) == num` while `num != func_1(num)`, then `amicable_sum` is set to 1. Otherwise, `amicable_sum` remains 0.

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop head is: `for num in range(1, n + 1):`
- Variables in the loop head: `num` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
   - `num` is 2.
   - `amicable_sum` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `num` is within the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - `num` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the current iteration where `num` is 2, the next value of `num` will be 3.
   - The loop will continue if `3 <= n`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains a positive integer (at least 1).
- `num` is incremented to 3.
- `amicable_sum` remains 0 unless the conditions inside the loop change it, but this is not part of the loop head adjustment.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `num` is 3, and `amicable_sum` is 0.**
