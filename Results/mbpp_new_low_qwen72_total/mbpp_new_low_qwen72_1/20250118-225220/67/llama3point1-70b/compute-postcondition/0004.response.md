The code snippet `amicable_sum += num` increments the value of `amicable_sum` by the value of `num`.

- Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `amicable_sum` is 0, `num` is 1, and the result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`. Additionally, `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num` and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`.

- Impact of the Code: The value of `amicable_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it. Since `num` is 1, `amicable_sum` becomes 1.

- Updated Values: `amicable_sum` is now 1.

- Unchanged Values: `n` remains a positive integer (at least 1), `num` remains 1, the result of `func_1(num)` is still less than `n`, `func_1(func_1(num))` still equals `num`, and `num` is still not equal to `func_1(num)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `amicable_sum` is 1, `num` is 1, the result of `func_1(num)` is less than `n`, `func_1(func_1(num))` equals `num`, and `num` is not equal to `func_1(num)`**.
