Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the function `func_1`. The function does indeed take a list of strings representing numbers, converts them to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list of integers. The assessment also correctly points out that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings, which could be a potential issue depending on the strict interpretation of the problem statement.

However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings. It only mentions sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically. The term "numerically" suggests that the focus is on the numeric values, and the output being a list of integers is a reasonable interpretation, especially since the numeric values are sorted correctly.

The function summary confirms that the function behaves as intended, converting the strings to integers, sorting them, and handling edge cases like an empty input list or invalid input strings (raising a `ValueError`).

Given the information provided, the original assessment's conclusion that the function is correct (assuming returning a list of integers is acceptable) is valid. Therefore, there is no need to overturn the original assessment.

Final: **True**
