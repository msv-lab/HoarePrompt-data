You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input, where each string represents a numeric value. It converts these strings to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers. If `num_strings` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) where each string represents a number. It converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers. This approach correctly handles the conversion and sorting of the numbers.

However, the function returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as might be expected from the problem statement (which asks to sort a list of strings of numbers). If the requirement is strictly to return a list of strings, the function would need to convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them.

Assuming the problem allows for returning a list of integers (since the numeric values are correctly sorted), the function is correct.

If the requirement is to return a list of strings, the function would need to be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return [str(num) for num in sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])]
```

Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, I will assume that returning a list of integers is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
