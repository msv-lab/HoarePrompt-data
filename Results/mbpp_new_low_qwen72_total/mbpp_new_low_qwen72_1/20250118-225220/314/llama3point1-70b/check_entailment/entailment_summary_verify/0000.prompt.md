You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input, where each string represents a numeric value. It converts these strings to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers. If `num_strings` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts the list of strings of numbers numerically but returns a list of integers instead of strings. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of strings sorted numerically. For example, if the input is `["10", "2", "1"]`, the function should return `["1", "2", "10"]` as a list of strings, but the current implementation returns `[1, 2, 10]` as a list of integers. This does not meet the requirement of returning the sorted list in the same string format as the input.

End of Original Assessment
