### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the provided function `func_1`. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to sort a list of strings of numbers numerically and return the sorted list in the same string format. However, the current implementation of `func_1` converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and then returns a list of integers, which does not meet the requirement.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input and Conversion**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input.
   - It uses a list comprehension to convert each string in `num_strings` to an integer using `int(num)`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is then sorted using the `sorted` function, which sorts them in ascending numerical order.

3. **Output**:
   - The sorted list of integers is returned.

4. **Expected Output**:
   - According to the problem description, the function should return a list of strings, not integers.
   - For example, if the input is `["10", "2", "1"]`, the expected output should be `["1", "2", "10"]`.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary confirms that the function returns a list of integers, not strings.
   - This aligns with the observed behavior of the function.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not meet the requirement of returning a list of strings sorted numerically.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
