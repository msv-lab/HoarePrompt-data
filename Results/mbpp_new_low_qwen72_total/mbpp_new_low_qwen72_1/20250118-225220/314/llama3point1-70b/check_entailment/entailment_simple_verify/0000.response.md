Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and then returns a list of integers. However, the problem description specifically requires the function to return a list of strings, not integers. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements.

To address this, the function should convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to an incorrect output format.

Given the annotations, we can confirm that the list of integers is indeed sorted correctly, but the issue lies in the final step where the integers need to be converted back to strings. The annotations do not explicitly mention this final conversion step, which is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is incorrect due to the mismatch in the output format.

Final: **False**
