Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts each string in the input list to an integer, sorts the list of integers, and returns the sorted list. The assessment also correctly notes that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings, which could be a potential issue depending on the interpretation of the problem statement.

However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings. It only mentions sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically. Since the primary goal is to ensure that the numeric values are sorted correctly, and the function achieves this by converting the strings to integers and sorting them, the function can be considered correct under the assumption that the output type (integers) is acceptable.

The original assessment's conclusion that the function is correct assuming it is acceptable to return a list of integers is reasonable. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
