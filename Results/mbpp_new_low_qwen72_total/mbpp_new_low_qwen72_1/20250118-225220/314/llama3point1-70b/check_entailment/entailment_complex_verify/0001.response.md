Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to sort a list of strings representing numbers numerically. The function correctly converts each string to an integer, sorts the list of integers, and returns the sorted list. This behavior aligns with the primary goal of sorting the numbers numerically.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function returns a list of integers rather than a list of strings. However, the problem description does not explicitly specify the format of the output (i.e., whether it should be a list of strings or integers). Given this ambiguity, the original assessment reasonably assumes that returning a list of integers is acceptable.

The annotated code provides a clear and accurate description of the function's behavior, confirming that it converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list. The annotations also note that the function will raise a `ValueError` if any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer, which is a valid point but does not affect the correctness of the function under the assumption of valid inputs.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment's reasoning and conclusion are accurate. The function meets the problem's requirements when interpreted as allowing a list of integers as the output.

Final: **True**
