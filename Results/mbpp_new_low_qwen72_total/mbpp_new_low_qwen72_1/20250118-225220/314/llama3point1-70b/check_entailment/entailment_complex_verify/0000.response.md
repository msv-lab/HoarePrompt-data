Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` returns a list of integers instead of a list of strings. The problem description explicitly states that the function should sort a list of strings of numbers numerically and return the result as a list of strings. However, the current implementation converts the strings to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list of integers. This does not meet the requirement of maintaining the output as a list of strings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is incorrect based on the problem description.

Final: **False**
