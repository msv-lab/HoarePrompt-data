Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly sorts a list of strings that represent numeric values by first converting them to integers and then sorting them. The function handles an empty list by returning an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior. However, the function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric strings, which would result in a `ValueError`. According to the problem description, we assume valid inputs, so this behavior is acceptable under that assumption.

Correctness: **True**
