Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings` as input, where each string represents a numeric value. It converts these strings to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers. If `num_strings` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
