Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) where each string represents a numeric value. It converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers using the `sorted` function. The sorted list of integers is returned. This approach correctly implements the requirement to sort the strings numerically, as converting the strings to integers ensures that they are sorted based on their numeric values rather than lexicographically.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to handle the input correctly and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
