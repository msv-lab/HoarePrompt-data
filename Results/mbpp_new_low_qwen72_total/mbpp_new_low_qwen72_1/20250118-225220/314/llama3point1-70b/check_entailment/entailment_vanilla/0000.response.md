Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) where each string represents a number. It converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers. This approach correctly handles the conversion and sorting of the numbers.

However, the function returns a list of integers, not a list of strings as might be expected from the problem statement (which asks to sort a list of strings of numbers). If the requirement is strictly to return a list of strings, the function would need to convert the sorted integers back to strings before returning them.

Assuming the problem allows for returning a list of integers (since the numeric values are correctly sorted), the function is correct.

If the requirement is to return a list of strings, the function would need to be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return [str(num) for num in sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])]
```

Given the ambiguity in the problem statement, I will assume that returning a list of integers is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
