Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts the list of strings of numbers numerically but returns a list of integers instead of strings. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of strings sorted numerically. For example, if the input is `["10", "2", "1"]`, the function should return `["1", "2", "10"]` as a list of strings, but the current implementation returns `[1, 2, 10]` as a list of integers. This does not meet the requirement of returning the sorted list in the same string format as the input.
