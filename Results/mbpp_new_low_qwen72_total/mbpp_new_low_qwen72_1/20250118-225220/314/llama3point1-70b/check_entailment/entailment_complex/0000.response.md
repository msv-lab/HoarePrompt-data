Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of strings, where each string represents a numeric value, and return a sorted list of the corresponding integers. The implementation uses a list comprehension to convert each string to an integer and then sorts the resulting list of integers. This approach is correct and efficient for the given problem.

However, there is a potential issue that needs to be considered: if any string in the input list cannot be converted to an integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`. This is not explicitly handled in the function, but it is mentioned in the comments. Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume that all strings in the input list are valid numeric representations.

Given these points, the function is correct under the assumption of valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
