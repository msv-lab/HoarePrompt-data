Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is found, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` is returned, or -1 is returned if `num` is not found. **

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function will return -1 since the loop will not execute.
- If `num` is the first element in `arr`, the function will return 0.
- If `num` is the last element in `arr`, the function will return `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function will return -1, and the final value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The return postconditions provided (returning 0, 1, 2, or -1) do not accurately reflect the behavior of the function. The function only returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` or -1 if `num` is not found. There is no specific logic that would cause the function to return 0, 1, or 2 unless those indices correspond to the positions of `num` in `arr`.
