Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` remains constant throughout the loop, and if `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is not found, the loop completes without returning any value. The final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.**
