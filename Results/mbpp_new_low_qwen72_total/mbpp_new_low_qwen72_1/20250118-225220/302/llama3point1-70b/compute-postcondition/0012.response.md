The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns 1.
- Case_3: The function returns 2.
- Case_4: If `num` is not found in the list `arr`, the function returns -1, and the final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and return specific values based on predefined cases, including indicating whether `num` was not found in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and returns 0, 1, 2, or -1 based on predefined cases. If `num` is not found in `arr`, it returns -1.**
