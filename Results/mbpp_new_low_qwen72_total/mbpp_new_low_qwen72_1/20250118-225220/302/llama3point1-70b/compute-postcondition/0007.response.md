The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least two elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least three elements, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must be set to the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least three elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in `arr`. If `x` equals `num`, the program returns 1. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to `num` and the program does not return 1.**
