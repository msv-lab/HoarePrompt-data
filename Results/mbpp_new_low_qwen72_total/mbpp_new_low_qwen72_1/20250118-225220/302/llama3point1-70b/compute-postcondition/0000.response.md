To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will start iterating.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `num` is an integer.

The loop statement is:
```python
for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, which are derived from `enumerate(arr)`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. This is because `enumerate(arr)` will yield pairs `(i, x)` where `i` is the index and `x` is the element at that index in `arr`.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `i` should be 0 (the first index).
   - `x` should be the first element in `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `arr` must be a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and the initial values of `i` and `x` should be 0 and the first element of `arr`, respectively.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**.
