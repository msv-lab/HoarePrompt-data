You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

- Program: 
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` remains constant throughout the loop, and if `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is not found, the loop completes without returning any value. The final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that `num` was not found in the list `arr`. The final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the element. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`. This approach correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function works as intended, even though it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted (which could allow for a more efficient binary search).

Correctness: **True**
