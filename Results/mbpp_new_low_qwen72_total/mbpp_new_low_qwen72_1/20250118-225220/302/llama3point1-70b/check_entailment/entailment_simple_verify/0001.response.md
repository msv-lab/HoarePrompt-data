Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the array `arr` and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`.

The annotated code provides additional clarity:
- Before the function call, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer.
- Inside the loop, the function correctly checks each element and returns the index if a match is found.
- After the loop, if no match is found, the function returns `-1`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem statement.

While the function does not leverage the sorted nature of the array to use a more efficient algorithm like binary search, this does not affect its correctness. The function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
