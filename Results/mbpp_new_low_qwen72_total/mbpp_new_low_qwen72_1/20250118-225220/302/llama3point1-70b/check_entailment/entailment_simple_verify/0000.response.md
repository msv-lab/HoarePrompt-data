Reasoning: The original assessment raises a valid point regarding the efficiency of the solution. While the provided function `func_1` is correct in terms of its output—it accurately finds the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the array—the assessment correctly notes that the function does not leverage the sorted nature of the array. A linear search is less efficient (O(n)) compared to a binary search (O(log n)), especially for large arrays. However, the problem description only specifies that the function should "find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array" and does not explicitly require the most efficient solution. Given this, the function meets the basic functional requirements described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**

The function is correct in terms of its specified functionality, even though a more efficient approach could be used. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the inefficiency, but this does not make the function incorrect in the context of the problem description.
