Reasoning: The original assessment points out that while the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, it does not utilize the sorted property of the array to improve efficiency. This is a valid point from a performance perspective. However, the correctness of a program is typically evaluated based on whether it meets the functional requirements specified in the problem description, rather than its efficiency alone. The problem description does not explicitly require the use of a specific algorithm or mention any performance constraints. Given this, the function `func_1` meets the functional requirements of the problem description by returning the correct index of the first occurrence of the number or -1 if the number is not found.

Therefore, the original assessment, while highlighting a valid concern about efficiency, incorrectly concludes that the program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is functionally correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
