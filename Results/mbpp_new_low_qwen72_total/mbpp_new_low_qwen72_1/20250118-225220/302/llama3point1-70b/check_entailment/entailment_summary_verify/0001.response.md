Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function iterates through the array `arr` and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If no match is found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

However, the original assessment also notes that the function does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. While this is true, it does not affect the correctness of the function in terms of meeting the specified requirements. The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array, even if it is not the most efficient method.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the function `func_1` meets the required specifications and behaves correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
