Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a valid concern regarding the efficiency of the solution. While the function `func_1` is logically correct and will return the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array, it does not utilize the sorted property of the array to optimize the search process. The linear search implemented in `func_1` has a time complexity of O(n), whereas a binary search could achieve the same goal with a time complexity of O(log n).

The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the function, confirming that it returns the correct index if the number is found, or -1 if the number is not found. However, the efficiency issue is a significant point that should be addressed, especially given the problem's context of working with a sorted array.

Final: **False** 

The function is correct in terms of its logic and output, but it fails to meet the efficiency requirement implied by the problem description. A more efficient solution using binary search is recommended.
