Reasoning:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's state and behavior at key points:

1. **Initial State**: The function receives a sorted list `arr` and an integer `num`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The function iterates through the array using a for loop with `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. If `x` equals `num`, the function immediately returns the index `i`.
3. **Post-Loop State**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1`.

The annotations confirm that:
- The function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it exists in `arr`.
- If `num` is not found, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`.

While the function does not utilize the sorted nature of the array to optimize the search (e.g., using binary search), it still correctly solves the problem as specified. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the function works as intended.

Final: **True**
