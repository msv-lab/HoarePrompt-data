Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`). The function iterates through the array using a for loop, checking each element to see if it matches `num`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of the element. If no match is found after the loop completes, the function returns `-1`.

- The function correctly uses `enumerate` to iterate over both the index and the value of each element in the array.
- The function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it exists in the array.
- If `num` is not found, the function returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem statement.
- The state comments indicate that the final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`, which is consistent with the behavior of the loop.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
