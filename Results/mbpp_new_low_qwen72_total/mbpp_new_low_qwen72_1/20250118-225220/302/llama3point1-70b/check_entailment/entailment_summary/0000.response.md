Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using a `for` loop with `enumerate` to get both the index and the value at each position. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number (`num`), it immediately returns the index. If the loop completes without finding the target number, the function returns `-1`.

The function does not modify the input array or the target number, which is consistent with the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index or `-1` when the target number is not found.

Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
