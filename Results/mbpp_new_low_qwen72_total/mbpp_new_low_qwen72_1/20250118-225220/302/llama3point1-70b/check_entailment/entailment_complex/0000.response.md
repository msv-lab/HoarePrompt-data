Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop through the array**: The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the array. This allows it to access both the index `i` and the value `x` at each position in the array.
2. **Check for the target number**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `x` is equal to the target number `num`.
3. **Return the index if found**: If `x` equals `num`, the function immediately returns the current index `i`.
4. **Handle not found case**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns `-1` to indicate that `num` is not present in the array.

The comments accurately describe the state of the program at different points:
- Before the function call, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer.
- After the loop, if `num` is found, the function returns the correct index. If `num` is not found, the loop completes, and the function returns `-1`.

The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
