Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` remains constant throughout the loop, and if `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is not found, the loop completes without returning any value. The final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that `num` was not found in the list `arr`. The final value of `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if the loop completes without finding `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is found, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` is returned, or -1 is returned if `num` is not found.
