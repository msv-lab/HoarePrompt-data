Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The problem description specifically asks for a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array. The provided function `func_1` uses a linear search approach, which will indeed find the index of the first occurrence of the given number, but it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search, which would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n). Therefore, while the function works correctly for finding the first occurrence, it does not meet the efficiency requirement implied by the sorted nature of the array. 

For example, consider the sorted array `arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6]` and the number `num = 4`. The function will return the correct index `2`, but it will not be as efficient as a binary search.
