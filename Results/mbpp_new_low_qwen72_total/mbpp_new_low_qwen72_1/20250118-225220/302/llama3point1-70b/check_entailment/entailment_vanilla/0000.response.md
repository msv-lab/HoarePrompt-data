Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using a for loop and checks each element to see if it matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index of the element. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `-1`. This approach correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function works as intended, even though it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted (which could allow for a more efficient binary search).

Correctness: **True**
