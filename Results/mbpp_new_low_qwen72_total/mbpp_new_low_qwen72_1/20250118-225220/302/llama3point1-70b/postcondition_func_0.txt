The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is found, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `num`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that either the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` is returned, or -1 is returned if `num` is not found.
