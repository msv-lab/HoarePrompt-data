You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2

sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
    #The program returns the value of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, where `sum_cubes_n` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2)` and `sum_n` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since both `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n` are the same, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the value of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, where `sum_cubes_n` is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`(n * (n + 1) // 2)


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula used in the function:

1. `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2` correctly computes the sum of the first n natural numbers.
2. `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2` correctly computes the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers, as the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
3. The function returns the difference between these two values, which is the required result according to the problem description.

The test cases provided also verify the correctness of the function for specific inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
