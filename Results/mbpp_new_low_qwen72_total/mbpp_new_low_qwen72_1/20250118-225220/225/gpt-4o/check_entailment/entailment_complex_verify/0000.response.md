Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is indeed correct.

1. **Sum of the First n Natural Numbers**:
   - The formula `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers. This is a well-known formula derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

2. **Sum of Cubes of the First n Natural Numbers**:
   - The formula `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2` is also correct. It is a known mathematical identity that the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \left( \sum_{i=1}^n i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n i^3
     \]
   - This means that `sum_cubes_n` is indeed the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The function returns `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`. According to the problem description, this should be the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
   - However, the annotated code suggests that the program returns `0` because it states that `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n` are the same. This is incorrect. While `sum_cubes_n` is the square of `sum_n`, they are not the same value unless `n` is `0` or `1`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided in the program are:
     - `func_1(3) == 30`
     - `func_1(5) == 210`
     - `func_1(2) == 6`
   - Let's verify these:
     - For `n = 3`:
       - `sum_n = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 6 ** 2 = 36`
       - `sum_cubes_n - sum_n = 36 - 6 = 30` (Correct)
     - For `n = 5`:
       - `sum_n = 5 * (5 + 1) // 2 = 15`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 15 ** 2 = 225`
       - `sum_cubes_n - sum_n = 225 - 15 = 210` (Correct)
     - For `n = 2`:
       - `sum_n = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3`
       - `sum_cubes_n = 3 ** 2 = 9`
       - `sum_cubes_n - sum_n = 9 - 3 = 6` (Correct)

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the test cases confirm its correctness.

Final: **True**
