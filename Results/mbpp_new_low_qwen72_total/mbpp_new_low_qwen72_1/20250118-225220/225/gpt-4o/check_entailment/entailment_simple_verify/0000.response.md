Reasoning: The original assessment contains a significant error in the understanding of the problem and the implementation of the solution. The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to calculate the difference between the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. However, the function incorrectly calculates the sum of cubes as the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is not the same as the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

To clarify:
- The sum of the first n natural numbers is indeed `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers is **not** `sum_n ** 2`. Instead, it should be calculated as the sum of `i^3` for each `i` from 1 to n.

The correct formula for the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers is:
\[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \]

However, this is not the same as the sum of the individual cubes of each number from 1 to n. The correct way to compute the sum of cubes is:
\[ \text{sum\_cubes\_n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 \]

Given the incorrect implementation, the function will not produce the correct results for the problem described. For example:
- For `n = 3`, the correct sum of cubes is \( 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 \), and the sum of the first 3 natural numbers is \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \). The difference should be \( 36 - 6 = 30 \), but the function incorrectly returns \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) because it uses the incorrect formula.

Thus, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the function is incorrect.

Final: **False**
