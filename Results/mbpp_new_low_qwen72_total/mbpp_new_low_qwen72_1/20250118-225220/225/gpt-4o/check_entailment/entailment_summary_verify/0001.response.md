Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the mathematical formulas used in the function `func_1` and accurately calculates the expected outputs for the given test cases. Let's break down the function step by step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Sum of the first `n` natural numbers**:
   \[
   \text{sum}_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula is correctly implemented in the code as:
   ```python
   sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
   ```

2. **Sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers**:
   \[
   \text{sum\_cubes}_n = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This formula is correctly implemented in the code as:
   ```python
   sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
   ```

3. **Difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers**:
   \[
   \text{difference} = \text{sum\_cubes}_n - \text{sum}_n
   \]
   This is correctly calculated in the code as:
   ```python
   return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
   ```

The test cases provided in the original assessment are also correct:
- For `n = 3`:
  - \(\text{sum}_3 = \frac{3(3 + 1)}{2} = 6\)
  - \(\text{sum\_cubes}_3 = 6^2 = 36\)
  - Difference: \(36 - 6 = 30\)

- For `n = 5`:
  - \(\text{sum}_5 = \frac{5(5 + 1)}{2} = 15\)
  - \(\text{sum\_cubes}_5 = 15^2 = 225\)
  - Difference: \(225 - 15 = 210\)

- For `n = 2`:
  - \(\text{sum}_2 = \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 3\)
  - \(\text{sum\_cubes}_2 = 3^2 = 9\)
  - Difference: \(9 - 3 = 6\)

All the calculations and the implementation of the function `func_1` are correct and consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
