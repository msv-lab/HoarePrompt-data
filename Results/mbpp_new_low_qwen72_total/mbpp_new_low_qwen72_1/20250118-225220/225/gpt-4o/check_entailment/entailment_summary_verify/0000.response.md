### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

#### Mathematical Formulas:
1. **Sum of the first `n` natural numbers**:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers**:
   \[
   S_{n^3} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
   \]

#### Function Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` performs the following steps:
1. Computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
2. Computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( S_{n^3} = S_n^2 \).
3. Returns the difference \( S_{n^3} - S_n \).

#### Test Cases:
- `func_1(3) == 30`
  - \( S_3 = \frac{3(3 + 1)}{2} = 6 \)
  - \( S_{3^3} = 6^2 = 36 \)
  - Difference: \( 36 - 6 = 30 \)
- `func_1(5) == 210`
  - \( S_5 = \frac{5(5 + 1)}{2} = 15 \)
  - \( S_{5^3} = 15^2 = 225 \)
  - Difference: \( 225 - 15 = 210 \)
- `func_1(2) == 6`
  - \( S_2 = \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 3 \)
  - \( S_{2^3} = 3^2 = 9 \)
  - Difference: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

All test cases match the expected results.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. It confirms that:
- `sum_n` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `sum_cubes_n` is the square of `sum_n`.
- The function returns the difference between `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic and passes all provided test cases. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
