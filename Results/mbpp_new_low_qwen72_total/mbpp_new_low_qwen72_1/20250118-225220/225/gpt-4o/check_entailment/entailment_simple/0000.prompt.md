Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(3) == 30
assert func_1(5) == 210
assert func_1(2) == 6

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2

sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2
    return sum_cubes_n - sum_n
    #The program returns the value of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, where `sum_cubes_n` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2)` and `sum_n` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since both `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n` are the same, the program returns 0.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
