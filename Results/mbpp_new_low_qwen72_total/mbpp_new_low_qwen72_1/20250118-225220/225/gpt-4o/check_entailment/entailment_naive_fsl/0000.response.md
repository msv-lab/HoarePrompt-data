Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula used in the function:

1. `sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2` correctly computes the sum of the first n natural numbers.
2. `sum_cubes_n = sum_n ** 2` correctly computes the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers, as the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
3. The function returns the difference between these two values, which is the required result according to the problem description.

The test cases provided also verify the correctness of the function for specific inputs. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
