Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The formulas used in the program are:

1. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers: \( \text{sum}_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \)
2. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers: \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \)

The function `func_1` correctly calculates these values and returns the difference \( \text{sum\_cubes}_n - \text{sum}_n \).

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

1. For `n = 3`:
   - Sum of the first 3 natural numbers: \( \text{sum}_3 = \frac{3(3 + 1)}{2} = 6 \)
   - Sum of the cubes of the first 3 natural numbers: \( \text{sum\_cubes}_3 = 6^2 = 36 \)
   - Difference: \( 36 - 6 = 30 \)

2. For `n = 5`:
   - Sum of the first 5 natural numbers: \( \text{sum}_5 = \frac{5(5 + 1)}{2} = 15 \)
   - Sum of the cubes of the first 5 natural numbers: \( \text{sum\_cubes}_5 = 15^2 = 225 \)
   - Difference: \( 225 - 15 = 210 \)

3. For `n = 2`:
   - Sum of the first 2 natural numbers: \( \text{sum}_2 = \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 3 \)
   - Sum of the cubes of the first 2 natural numbers: \( \text{sum\_cubes}_2 = 3^2 = 9 \)
   - Difference: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

All the test cases match the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
