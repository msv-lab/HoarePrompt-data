Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the value of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, where `sum_cubes_n` is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`(n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2`) and `sum_n` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`). Despite the annotations suggesting that the function always returns 0, the actual computation results in `sum_cubes_n` being significantly larger than `sum_n` for `n > 1`, leading to a non-zero return value. For `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function does indeed return 0. **

### Explanation:
- **Input:** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- **Output:** The function returns the value of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, where:
  - `sum_n` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
  - `sum_cubes_n` is the square of `sum_n`, calculated as `sum_n ** 2`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `n = 0`, both `sum_n` and `sum_cubes_n` are 0, so the function returns 0.
  - For `n = 1`, both `sum_n` and `sum_cubes_n` are 1, so the function returns 0.
  - For `n > 1`, `sum_cubes_n` is much larger than `sum_n`, so the function returns a positive value.
- **Final State:** After the function concludes, the returned value is `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, which is 0 for `n = 0` or `n = 1` and a positive value for `n > 1`.
