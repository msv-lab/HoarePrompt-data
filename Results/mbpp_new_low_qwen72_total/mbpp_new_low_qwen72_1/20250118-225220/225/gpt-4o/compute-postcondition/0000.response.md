The provided code calculates two values based on the initial value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The first line calculates the sum of the first `n` integers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and assigns this value to `sum_n`. The second line calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` integers by squaring `sum_n` and assigns this value to `sum_cubes_n`.

Given the initial state where `n` is a non-negative integer, the code will compute `sum_n` and `sum_cubes_n` based on the value of `n`.

- `sum_n` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum_cubes_n` is then calculated as `sum_n ** 2`.

No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, sum_n is n * (n + 1) // 2, sum_cubes_n is (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2**
