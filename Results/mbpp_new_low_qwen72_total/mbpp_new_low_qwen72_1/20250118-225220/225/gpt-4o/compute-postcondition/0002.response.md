The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The function computes two values: `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n`, both of which are calculated using the formula `(n * (n + 1) // 2)`. Since `sum_cubes_n` and `sum_n` are the same, the function returns the result of `sum_cubes_n - sum_n`, which is always 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0.**
