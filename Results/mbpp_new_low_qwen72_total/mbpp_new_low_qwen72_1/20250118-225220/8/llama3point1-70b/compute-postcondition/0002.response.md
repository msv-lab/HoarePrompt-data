Postcondition: ***s is a string, char is a single character string, first_occurrence is the index of the first occurrence of char in s, last_occurrence is the index of the last occurrence of char in s, and both first_occurrence and last_occurrence are not -1, indicating that char is present in s at least once. Additionally, first_occurrence is equal to last_occurrence, meaning that char appears exactly once in s.***
