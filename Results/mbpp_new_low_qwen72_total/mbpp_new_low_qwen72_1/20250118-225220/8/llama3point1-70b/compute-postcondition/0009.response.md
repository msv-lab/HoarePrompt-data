Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string based on the following cases:
1. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function returns `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed.
2. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
3. If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged.
- If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` but all occurrences are adjacent (e.g., "aaa"), the function will still remove the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters.**
  
Note: The code has a minor syntax error where the line continuation is incorrect, but this does not affect the overall functionality described.
