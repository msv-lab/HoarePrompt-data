The code snippet provided finds the first and last occurrence of a character `char` in the string `s` using the `find` and `rfind` methods, respectively. These methods return the index of the first and last occurrence of the specified character in the string. If the character is not found, both methods return -1.

- The first line assigns the result of `s.find(char)` to `first_occurrence`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.
- The second line assigns the result of `s.rfind(char)` to `last_occurrence`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.

No other variables are affected by these operations.

Output State: **s is a string, char is a single character string, first_occurrence is the index of the first occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found), last_occurrence is the index of the last occurrence of char in s (or -1 if char is not found)**
