The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string.

- **Case_1**: If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function returns a new string that is `s` with this single instance of `char` removed.
- **Case_2**: If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns a new string that is `s` with both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
- **Case_3**: If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, or if it appears only once but not at both the beginning and the end, the function returns the original string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It returns a new string based on the following cases:**
- **Case_1**: Returns `s` with the first (and only) occurrence of `char` removed if `char` appears exactly once in `s`.
- **Case_2**: Returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed if `char` appears more than once in `s`.
- **Case_3**: Returns the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s` or if it appears only once but not at both the beginning and the end.
