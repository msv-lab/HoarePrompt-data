Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s, char)` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string `s`. Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly in all potential cases:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**: If either the first or last occurrence is not found (i.e., `-1` is returned), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged, which is the correct behavior.

3. **Single Occurrence**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the function removes only one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which is the correct behavior.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**: If there are multiple occurrences of `char`, the function constructs a new string by removing the first and last occurrences using slicing: `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`.

The function handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that the first and last occurrences of the specified character are removed from the string. Therefore, the program is correct.
