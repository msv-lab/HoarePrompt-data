Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. Let's break down the logic and validate it against the problem description and potential edge cases:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(char)` to find the index of the last occurrence.
   - This approach is correct for finding the first and last occurrences of the character.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character is not present in the string, so the function returns the original string.
   - This is correct as per the problem description.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - This is also correct. The `replace` method with the count parameter ensures that only the first occurrence is removed.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.
   - This is implemented correctly and ensures that both the first and last occurrences of the character are removed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged. This is a reasonable behavior as there are no characters to remove.
   - If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` but all occurrences are adjacent (e.g., "aaa"), the function will still remove the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters. This is also correct as per the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
