Reasoning: 

The function `func_1(s, char)` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character `char` from the string `s`. Let's break down the function step-by-step and verify its correctness:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)`: This finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means that `char` is not present in `s`. In this case, the function returns `s` unchanged, which is the correct behavior.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it means `char` appears exactly once in `s`. The function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove this single occurrence. This is correct because `replace` will remove the first occurrence of `char`.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are different, it means `char` appears more than once in `s`. The function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char` (`s[:first_occurrence]`).
     - Taking the substring from just after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char` (`s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`).
     - Taking the substring from just after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s` (`s[last_occurrence + 1:]`).
   - These substrings are then concatenated together to form the final result, which correctly removes the first and last occurrences of `char`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged, which is the correct behavior.
   - If `s` contains multiple adjacent occurrences of `char` (e.g., "aaa"), the function will remove the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(s, char)` correctly implements the desired behavior for all cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
