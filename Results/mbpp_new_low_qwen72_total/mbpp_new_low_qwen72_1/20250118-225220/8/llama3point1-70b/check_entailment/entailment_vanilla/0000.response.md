Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(char)` to find the index of the last occurrence.
2. **Handling No Occurrences**: If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character is not present in the string, so the function returns the original string.
3. **Single Occurrence**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
4. **Multiple Occurrences**: If there are multiple occurrences, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.

This logic correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
