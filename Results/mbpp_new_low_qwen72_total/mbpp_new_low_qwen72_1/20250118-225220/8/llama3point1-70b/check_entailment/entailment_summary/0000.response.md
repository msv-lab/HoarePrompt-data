Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function correctly handles the following scenarios:
1. If the character appears exactly once, it removes that single occurrence.
2. If the character appears more than once, it removes the first and last occurrences.
3. If the character does not appear at all, it returns the original string unchanged.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected in these scenarios. Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as when the string is empty or the character is an empty string by returning the original string unchanged.

The potential edge case mentioned in the execution summary (where the character appears multiple times but all occurrences are adjacent) is also handled correctly. For example, if the input string is "aaa" and the character is "a", the function will remove the first and last 'a', resulting in "a".

Given this analysis, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
