Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)

last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first (and only) occurrence of `char` removed. Since `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the returned string will be `s` without this single instance of `char`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a new string that is a version of `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. The string consists of the substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`, concatenated with the substring from just after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`, and finally concatenated with the substring from just after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's', which is a string where either the first or the last occurrence of 'char' is not found in 's'.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
