Reasoning:  
- The function correctly identifies the first and last occurrence of the specified character using `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`.
- If the character is found only once, it removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
- If the character is found more than once, it constructs a new string by excluding the first and last occurrences of the character.
- If the character is not found at all, the original string is returned unchanged.
- The logic and flow of the program align with the problem statement and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
