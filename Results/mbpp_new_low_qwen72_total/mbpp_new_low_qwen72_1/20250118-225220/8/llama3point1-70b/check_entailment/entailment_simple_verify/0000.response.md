Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the functionality and correctness of the `func_1(s, char)` function. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`. These methods are appropriate for finding the positions of characters in a string.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character `char` is not found in the string `s`. In this case, the function correctly returns the original string `s` unchanged. This is the correct behavior because there are no occurrences to remove.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the function removes only one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is the correct behavior because there is only one occurrence of the character, and removing it once is sufficient.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences of `char`, the function constructs a new string by removing the first and last occurrences using slicing: `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`. This correctly removes the first and last occurrences while preserving the rest of the string.

The annotated code also supports these points by explaining the behavior of the function in different scenarios. The function handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that the first and last occurrences of the specified character are removed from the string.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
