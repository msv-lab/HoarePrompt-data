Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. Let's break down the logic and verify each part:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character `char` is not present in the string `s`. In this case, the function returns the original string `s`. This is correct because there are no occurrences to remove.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`, it means the character `char` appears only once in the string `s`. The function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is correct because `replace` will remove the first (and only) occurrence of `char`.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences, the function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char` (`s[:first_occurrence]`).
     - Concatenating the substring from just after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char` (`s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`).
     - Concatenating the substring from just after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s` (`s[last_occurrence + 1:]`).

The annotated code confirms that these steps are correctly implemented and logically sound. The function correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
