Reasoning:

The function `func_1(s, char)` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character `char` from the string `s`. Let's break down the function and its behavior step-by-step to verify the correctness:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character `char` is not present in the string `s`.
   - In this case, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged, which is the correct behavior.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are the same, it means the character `char` appears exactly once in the string `s`.
   - The function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove this single occurrence. This is the correct behavior.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences of `char`, the function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring before the first occurrence: `s[:first_occurrence]`
     - Taking the substring between the first and last occurrences, excluding the first occurrence: `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`
     - Taking the substring after the last occurrence: `s[last_occurrence + 1:]`
   - These substrings are concatenated to form the new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string, the function will return the empty string unchanged, which is correct.
   - **Empty Character**: If `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged, which is correct.
   - **Adjacent Characters**: If `s` contains multiple adjacent occurrences of `char` (e.g., "aaa"), the function will remove the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters. This is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(s, char)` correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
