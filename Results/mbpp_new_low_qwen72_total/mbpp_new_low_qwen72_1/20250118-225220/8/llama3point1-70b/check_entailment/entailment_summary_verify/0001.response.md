Reasoning:
The original assessment is largely accurate, but let's break down the function and the provided function summary to ensure everything is covered:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the index of the last occurrence of the character.
   - Both methods return `-1` if the character is not found in the string.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, the function correctly returns the original string `s`.

3. **Single Occurrence**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove this single occurrence.
   - This is correct because `s.replace(char, '', 1)` replaces the first occurrence of `char` with an empty string, effectively removing it.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.
   - This is achieved by slicing the string: `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, the function will return `s` unchanged, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char` but all occurrences are adjacent (e.g., "aaa"), the function will still remove the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters.

Given the function summary and the analysis above, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior for all specified cases and edge cases.

Final: **True**
