Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Handling No Occurrences**: If `char` is not found in `s` (i.e., both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are `-1`), the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.

3. **Single Occurrence**: If `char` appears exactly once in `s` (i.e., `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`), the function removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**: If `char` appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by concatenating three parts:
   - The substring from the start of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `char`.
   - The substring from just after the first occurrence of `char` up to but not including the last occurrence of `char`.
   - The substring from just after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of `s`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, the function correctly returns the original string `s` unchanged.
   - If `s` contains multiple adjacent occurrences of `char` (e.g., "aaa"), the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences, effectively removing the outermost `char` characters.

Given the above analysis, the function handles all specified cases and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
