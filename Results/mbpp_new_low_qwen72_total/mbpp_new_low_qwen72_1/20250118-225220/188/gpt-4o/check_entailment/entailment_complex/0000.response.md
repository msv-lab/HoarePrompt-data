Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average length of its two parallel sides. The formula used in the function, `(a + b) / 2`, correctly implements this calculation. The third parameter `_` is not used, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the function since it is ignored in the computation. The assertions provided test the function with different sets of values and confirm that the function returns the expected results. Given that the problem description and the function's implementation match, and assuming the inputs are non-negative as specified, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
