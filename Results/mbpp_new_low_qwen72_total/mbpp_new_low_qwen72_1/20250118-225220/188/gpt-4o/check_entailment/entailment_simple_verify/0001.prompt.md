You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average length of the parallel sides of the trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the median length of a trapezium. The median of a trapezium is the average of its two parallel sides, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The function correctly implements this formula.

However, the function signature includes an additional parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is unnecessary and can be misleading, but it does not affect the correctness of the function's output.

The test cases provided use the function with three arguments, but only the first two (the lengths of the parallel sides) are relevant for the calculation. The third argument is ignored due to the `_` placeholder in the function definition.

Given that the function correctly computes the median length of the trapezium based on the provided inputs, the program is considered correct despite the unused parameter.

Correctness: **True**
