Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the third parameter in the function `func_1` should play a role in calculating the median length of a trapezium. According to the problem description, the task is to find the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function `func_1` correctly computes this average using the parameters `a` and `b`. The third parameter `_` is indeed ignored, but this is not an issue because the median length calculation does not require any additional parameters beyond the lengths of the two parallel sides. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs.

Final: **True**
