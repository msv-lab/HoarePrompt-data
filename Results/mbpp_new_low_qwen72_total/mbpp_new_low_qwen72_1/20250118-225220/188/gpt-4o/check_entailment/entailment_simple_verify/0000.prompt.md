You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average length of the parallel sides of the trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes three parameters, but only uses the first two (`a` and `b`). The third parameter `_` is ignored. However, the problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which typically requires the lengths of the two parallel sides (the bases) and the height. The median length of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The provided function correctly calculates the average of `a` and `b`, but it does not account for the third parameter, which might be intended to represent the height or another dimension of the trapezium. Since the problem description does not specify what the third parameter represents, and the function does not use it, it is unclear if the function is correctly solving the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
