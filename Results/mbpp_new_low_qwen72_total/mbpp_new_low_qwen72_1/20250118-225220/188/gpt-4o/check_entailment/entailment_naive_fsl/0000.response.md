Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes three parameters, but only uses the first two (`a` and `b`). The third parameter `_` is ignored. However, the problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which typically requires the lengths of the two parallel sides (the bases) and the height. The median length of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The provided function correctly calculates the average of `a` and `b`, but it does not account for the third parameter, which might be intended to represent the height or another dimension of the trapezium. Since the problem description does not specify what the third parameter represents, and the function does not use it, it is unclear if the function is correctly solving the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
