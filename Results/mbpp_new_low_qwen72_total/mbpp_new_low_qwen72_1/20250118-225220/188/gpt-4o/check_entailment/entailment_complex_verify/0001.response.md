Reasoning:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the median length of a trapezium. The median of a trapezium is indeed the average of its two parallel sides, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The function correctly implements this formula.

The function signature includes an additional parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. While this parameter is unnecessary and can be misleading, it does not affect the correctness of the function's output. The function correctly computes the median length of the trapezium using the provided values of `a` and `b`.

The test cases provided are:
- `assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20`: This is correct because \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\).
- `assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15`: This is correct because \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\).
- `assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5`: This is correct because \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\).

All test cases pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected.

Given that the function correctly computes the median length of the trapezium based on the provided inputs and the unused parameter does not affect the output, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
