Reasoning: 

The problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium. The median length of a trapezium is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this calculation by returning \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides.

The original assessment is incorrect in suggesting that the third parameter `_` should be used. The problem description does not specify what the third parameter represents, and the function correctly ignores it. The function's behavior aligns with the problem's requirements, as it only needs the lengths of the parallel sides to compute the median length.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function works correctly:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` returns 20, which is the average of 15 and 25.
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` returns 15, which is the average of 10 and 20.
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` returns 7.5, which is the average of 6 and 9.

Given that the function meets the requirements and the test cases pass, the original assessment should be overturned.

Final: **True**
