Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The formula used in the function, `(a + b) / 2`, correctly implements this calculation. The third parameter `_` is not used in the function, which is consistent with the problem statement that only requires the lengths of the parallel sides (`a` and `b`).

The test cases provided:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20` calculates \((15 + 25) / 2 = 20\), which is correct.
- `func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15` calculates \((10 + 20) / 2 = 15\), which is correct.
- `func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5` calculates \((6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5\), which is correct.

All test cases produce the expected results, and the function logic aligns with the mathematical definition of the median length of a trapezium.

Correctness: **True**
