Reasoning: The original assessment is partially accurate but overly cautious. The problem description specifically asks for the median length of a trapezium, which is indeed the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The function `func_1` correctly calculates this median length using the formula \((a + b) / 2\). The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, but this is not necessarily a flaw because the problem description does not require the third parameter to be used. The function meets the requirements of the problem as stated.

The original assessment raises a valid point about the unused third parameter, but it does not make the function incorrect for the specific task of finding the median length of a trapezium. The function works correctly with the inputs provided and any other valid inputs for `a` and `b`.

Final: **True**
