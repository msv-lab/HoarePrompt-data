Reasoning:
The original assessment is largely accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the median length of a trapezium using the formula \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The function signature includes an additional parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is indeed unnecessary and can be misleading, but it does not affect the correctness of the function's output.

The test cases provided in the program are consistent with the expected behavior of the function:
- `func_1(15, 25, 35)` should return \( (15 + 25) / 2 = 20 \)
- `func_1(10, 20, 30)` should return \( (10 + 20) / 2 = 15 \)
- `func_1(6, 9, 4)` should return \( (6 + 9) / 2 = 7.5 \)

All these test cases pass, indicating that the function behaves as intended. The function summary confirms that the function correctly calculates the median length of the trapezium and that the third parameter is ignored.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is correct despite the unused parameter.

Final: **True**
