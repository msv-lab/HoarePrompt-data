You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

- Program:
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It calculates and returns the average length of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is not used in the function and has no effect on the computation. The function ensures that the returned value is the arithmetic mean of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes non-negative inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes three parameters, but only uses the first two (`a` and `b`). The third parameter `_` is ignored. However, the problem description asks for a function to find the median length of a trapezium, which typically requires the lengths of the two parallel sides (the bases) and the height. The median length of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The provided function correctly calculates the average of `a` and `b`, but it does not account for the third parameter, which might be intended to represent the height or another dimension of the trapezium. Since the problem description does not specify what the third parameter represents, and the function does not use it, it is unclear if the function is correctly solving the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
