Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the median length of a trapezium. The median of a trapezium is the average of its two parallel sides, which is given by the formula `(a + b) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides. The function correctly implements this formula.

However, the function signature includes an additional parameter `_` which is not used in the calculation. This parameter is unnecessary and can be misleading, but it does not affect the correctness of the function's output.

The test cases provided use the function with three arguments, but only the first two (the lengths of the parallel sides) are relevant for the calculation. The third argument is ignored due to the `_` placeholder in the function definition.

Given that the function correctly computes the median length of the trapezium based on the provided inputs, the program is considered correct despite the unused parameter.

Correctness: **True**
