Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the median length of a trapezium, which is defined as the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The formula used in the function, \((a + b) / 2\), correctly computes this median length. The third parameter `_` is not used in the calculation, which is consistent with the problem statement since it is not relevant to the median length calculation. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs.

However, the problem description does not specify what should happen if the inputs are negative. The execution summary mentions that the behavior is undefined for negative inputs, but the function itself does not handle this case explicitly. Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume that the inputs will always be non-negative, and thus the function is correct under this assumption.

Correctness: **True**
