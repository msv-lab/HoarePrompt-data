Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.

# Program:
assert func_1(15, 25, 35) == 20
assert func_1(10, 20, 30) == 15
assert func_1(6, 9, 4) == 7.5

def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It calculates and returns the average length of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is not used in the function and has no effect on the computation. The function ensures that the returned value is the arithmetic mean of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes non-negative inputs.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
