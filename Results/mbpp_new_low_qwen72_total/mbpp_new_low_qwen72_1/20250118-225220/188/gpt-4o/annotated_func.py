#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium.
def func_1(a, b, _):
    return (a + b) / 2
    #The program returns the average length of the parallel sides of the trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `_`. It calculates and returns the average length of the parallel sides of a trapezium, which is \((a + b) / 2\), where `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides. The third parameter `_` is not used in the function and has no effect on the computation. The function ensures that the returned value is the arithmetic mean of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is negative, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes non-negative inputs.
