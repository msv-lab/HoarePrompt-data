The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, but only the first two (`a` and `b`) are used. `a` and `b` are non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium. The function returns the average length of these parallel sides, calculated as \((a + b) / 2\).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative real numbers representing the lengths of the parallel sides of a trapezium, and returns their average length \((a + b) / 2\).**
