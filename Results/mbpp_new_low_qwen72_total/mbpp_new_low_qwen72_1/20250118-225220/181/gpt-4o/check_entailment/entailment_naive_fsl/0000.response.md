Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers correctly. It generates the list of natural numbers from 1 to `n`, computes their cubes, sums them up, and then divides by `n` to get the average. The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. There are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
