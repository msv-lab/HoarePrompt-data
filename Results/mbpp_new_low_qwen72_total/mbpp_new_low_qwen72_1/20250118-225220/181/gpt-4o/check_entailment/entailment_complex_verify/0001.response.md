Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose of the function `func_1` and the steps it takes to compute the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function generates a list of natural numbers from 1 to `n`, computes their cubes, sums these cubes, and then divides the sum by `n` to find the average. 

The test cases provided in the original assessment are also correctly evaluated:
- For `func_1(2)`, the cubes of the first 2 natural numbers (1 and 2) are 1 and 8, respectively. The sum of these cubes is 9, and the average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\).
- For `func_1(3)`, the cubes of the first 3 natural numbers (1, 2, and 3) are 1, 8, and 27, respectively. The sum of these cubes is 36, and the average is \(36 / 3 = 12\).
- For `func_1(1)`, the cube of the first natural number (1) is 1, and the average is \(1 / 1 = 1\).

The annotated code also aligns with the original assessment, confirming that the function correctly computes the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

Given that the function logic is sound and the test cases are correctly verified, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
