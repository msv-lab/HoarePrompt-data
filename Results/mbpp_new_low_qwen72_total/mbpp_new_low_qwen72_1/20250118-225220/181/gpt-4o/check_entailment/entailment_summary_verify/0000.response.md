### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires a function to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. This means the function should take a positive integer `n` and return the average of \(1^3, 2^3, \ldots, n^3\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `n`.
   - It generates a list of natural numbers from 1 to `n` using `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - It computes the cubes of these numbers using a list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]`.
   - It calculates the sum of these cubes using `sum(cubes)`.
   - It computes the average by dividing the sum of cubes by `n`.
   - Finally, it returns the average.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the input `n` and performs the required calculations.
   - It assumes `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will not behave as expected, but this is outside the scope of the problem description, which assumes valid inputs.

4. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1(2) == 4.5`: For `n = 2`, the cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\). The sum is \(1 + 8 = 9\), and the average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\). This assertion is correct.
   - `assert func_1(3) == 12`: For `n = 3`, the cubes are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(3^3 = 27\). The sum is \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\), and the average is \(36 / 3 = 12\). This assertion is correct.
   - `assert func_1(1) == 1`: For `n = 1`, the cube is \(1^3 = 1\). The sum is \(1\), and the average is \(1 / 1 = 1\). This assertion is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases.
   - There are no logical errors or edge cases within the scope of the problem description.
