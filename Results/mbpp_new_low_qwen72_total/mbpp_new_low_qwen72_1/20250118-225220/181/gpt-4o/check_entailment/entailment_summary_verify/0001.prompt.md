You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It calculates the sum of the cubes of all integers from 1 to `n` and then divides this sum by `n` to compute the average. The function returns this average. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it expects a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the average of the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to `n` divided by `n` is returned.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:
1. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers using `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. It computes the cube of each number in this list.
3. It sums these cubes.
4. It divides the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- For `func_1(2)`: The first 2 natural numbers are 1 and 2. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 = 9\). The average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\). This matches the expected output.
- For `func_1(3)`: The first 3 natural numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(3^3 = 27\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\). The average is \(36 / 3 = 12\). This matches the expected output.
- For `func_1(1)`: The first natural number is 1. Its cube is \(1^3 = 1\). The sum of the cubes is \(1\). The average is \(1 / 1 = 1\). This matches the expected output.

Since all the test cases pass and the logic is sound, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
