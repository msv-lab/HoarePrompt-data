Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:
1. It generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers using `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. It computes the cube of each number in this list.
3. It sums these cubes.
4. It divides the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- For `func_1(2)`: The first 2 natural numbers are 1 and 2. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 = 9\). The average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\). This matches the expected output.
- For `func_1(3)`: The first 3 natural numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(3^3 = 27\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\). The average is \(36 / 3 = 12\). This matches the expected output.
- For `func_1(1)`: The first natural number is 1. Its cube is \(1^3 = 1\). The sum of the cubes is \(1\). The average is \(1 / 1 = 1\). This matches the expected output.

Since all the test cases pass and the logic is sound, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
