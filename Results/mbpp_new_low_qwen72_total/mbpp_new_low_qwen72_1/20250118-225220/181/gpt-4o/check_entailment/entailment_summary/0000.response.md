Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The logic implemented in the function is correct:

1. It generates a list of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It computes the cube of each number in this list.
3. It sums these cubes.
4. It divides the sum by `n` to get the average.

The assertions provided are used to test the function with specific values of `n`:
- For `n = 2`, the cubes are \(1^3\) and \(2^3\), which are 1 and 8. The sum is 9, and the average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\).
- For `n = 3`, the cubes are \(1^3\), \(2^3\), and \(3^3\), which are 1, 8, and 27. The sum is 36, and the average is \(36 / 3 = 12\).
- For `n = 1`, the cube is \(1^3\), which is 1. The average is \(1 / 1 = 1\).

These assertions are correct and match the expected output. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to errors or incorrect results. Since the problem description specifies that valid inputs are assumed, we can consider the function correct within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
