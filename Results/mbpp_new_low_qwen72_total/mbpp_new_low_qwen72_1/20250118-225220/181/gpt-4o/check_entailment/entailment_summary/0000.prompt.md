Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
    sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It calculates the sum of the cubes of all integers from 1 to `n` and then divides this sum by `n` to compute the average. The function returns this average. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it expects a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the average of the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to `n` divided by `n` is returned.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
