Reasoning:  
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
- The logic follows these steps:
  1. Generate a list of the first `n` natural numbers.
  2. Compute the cube of each number in this list.
  3. Sum these cubes.
  4. Divide the sum by `n` to get the average.
- The assertions provided in the program are used to test the correctness of the function:
  - For `func_1(2)`, the cubes are \(1^3\) and \(2^3\), which sum to \(1 + 8 = 9\). The average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\).
  - For `func_1(3)`, the cubes are \(1^3\), \(2^3\), and \(3^3\), which sum to \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\). The average is \(36 / 3 = 12\).
  - For `func_1(1)`, the cube is \(1^3\), which is \(1\). The average is \(1 / 1 = 1\).
- All assertions pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the given test cases.
- The function assumes `n` is a positive integer, which is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
