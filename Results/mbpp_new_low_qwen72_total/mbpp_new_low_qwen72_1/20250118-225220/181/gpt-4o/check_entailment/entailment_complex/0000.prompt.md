Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(2) == 4.5
assert func_1(3) == 12
assert func_1(1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)

cubes = [(x ** 3) for x in natural_numbers]

sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)

average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
    #The program returns the average which is the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to n divided by n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It calculates the sum of the cubes of all integers from 1 to `n` and then divides this sum by `n` to compute the average. The function returns this average. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it expects a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the average of the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to `n` divided by `n` is returned.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
