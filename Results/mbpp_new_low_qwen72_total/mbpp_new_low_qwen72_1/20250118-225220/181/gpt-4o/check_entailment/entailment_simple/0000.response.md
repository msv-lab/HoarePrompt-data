Reasoning:  
The program is designed to calculate the average of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers. The logic in the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. It generates a list of natural numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. It computes the cube of each number in this list.
3. It sums up all the cubes.
4. It divides the total sum of cubes by \( n \) to get the average.
5. It returns the computed average.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Natural numbers: [1, 2]
  - Cubes: [1, 8]
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5
  - Expected output: 4.5
  - Actual output: 4.5 (Correct)

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Natural numbers: [1, 2, 3]
  - Cubes: [1, 8, 27]
  - Sum of cubes: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36
  - Average: 36 / 3 = 12
  - Expected output: 12
  - Actual output: 12 (Correct)

- For \( n = 1 \):
  - Natural numbers: [1]
  - Cubes: [1]
  - Sum of cubes: 1
  - Average: 1 / 1 = 1
  - Expected output: 1
  - Actual output: 1 (Correct)

All the test cases match the expected results, and the logic of the function is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
