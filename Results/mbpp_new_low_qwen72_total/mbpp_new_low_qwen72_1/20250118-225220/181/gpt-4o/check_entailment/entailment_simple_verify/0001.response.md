Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the steps taken by the function `func_1` to compute the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The steps are as follows:

1. **Generating the Range**: The function uses `range(1, n + 1)` to generate a list of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. **Cubing the Numbers**: It then computes the cube of each number in this list using a list comprehension `[x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]`.
3. **Summing the Cubes**: The function sums these cubes using `sum(cubes)`.
4. **Calculating the Average**: Finally, it divides the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.

The original assessment also correctly verifies the function with the provided test cases:
- For `func_1(2)`: The first 2 natural numbers are 1 and 2. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 = 9\). The average is \(9 / 2 = 4.5\).
- For `func_1(3)`: The first 3 natural numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Their cubes are \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(3^3 = 27\). The sum of the cubes is \(1 + 8 + 27 = 36\). The average is \(36 / 3 = 12\).
- For `func_1(1)`: The first natural number is 1. Its cube is \(1^3 = 1\). The sum of the cubes is \(1\). The average is \(1 / 1 = 1\).

All the test cases pass, and the logic implemented in the function is correct.

Final: **True**
