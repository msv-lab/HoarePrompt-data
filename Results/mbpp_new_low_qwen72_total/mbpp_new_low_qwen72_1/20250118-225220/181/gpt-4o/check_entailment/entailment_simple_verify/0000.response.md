Reasoning: 

Let's break down the function step-by-step using the annotations and the problem description to verify its correctness:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
       cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
       sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
       average = sum_of_cubes / n
       return average
   ```

3. **Annotations and Step-by-Step Verification**:
   - **State of the program right before the function call**: `n` is a positive integer.
   - **Generating Natural Numbers**:
     ```python
     natural_numbers = range(1, n + 1)
     ```
     This line correctly generates a range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - **Cubing the Numbers**:
     ```python
     cubes = [x ** 3 for x in natural_numbers]
     ```
     This list comprehension correctly computes the cube of each number in the range.
   - **Summing the Cubes**:
     ```python
     sum_of_cubes = sum(cubes)
     ```
     This line correctly sums all the cubed values.
   - **Calculating the Average**:
     ```python
     average = sum_of_cubes / n
     ```
     This line correctly divides the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.
   - **Returning the Result**:
     ```python
     return average
     ```
     The function returns the calculated average.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(2) == 4.5`: The cubes of the first 2 natural numbers are 1 and 8. Their sum is 9, and the average is 9 / 2 = 4.5.
   - `func_1(3) == 12`: The cubes of the first 3 natural numbers are 1, 8, and 27. Their sum is 36, and the average is 36 / 3 = 12.
   - `func_1(1) == 1`: The cube of the first 1 natural number is 1. The sum is 1, and the average is 1 / 1 = 1.

All test cases are correct, and the function logic aligns with the problem description.

Conclusion: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

Final: **True**
