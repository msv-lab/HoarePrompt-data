The code snippet initializes a range of natural numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, computes the cubes of these numbers, calculates the sum of these cubes, and then computes the average of the cubes. 

- `natural_numbers` is a range object from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `cubes` is a list containing the cubes of each number in `natural_numbers`.
- `sum_of_cubes` is the sum of all elements in the `cubes` list.
- `average` is the result of dividing `sum_of_cubes` by `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer, the final state will reflect these computations based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, natural_numbers is range(1, n + 1), cubes is a list of cubes of numbers from 1 to n, sum_of_cubes is the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to n, average is sum_of_cubes divided by n**
