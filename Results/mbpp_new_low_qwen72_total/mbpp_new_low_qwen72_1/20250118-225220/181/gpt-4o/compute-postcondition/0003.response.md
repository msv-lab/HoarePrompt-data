Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It calculates the sum of the cubes of all integers from 1 to `n` and then divides this sum by `n` to compute the average. The function returns this average. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it expects a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the average of the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to `n` divided by `n` is returned. **
