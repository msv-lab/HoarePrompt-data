The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of numbers, and for each index `i`, `tup2[i]` is guaranteed not to be zero. The function returns a tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The length of `result` is the same as the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of numbers, and returns a tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
