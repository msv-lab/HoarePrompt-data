Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of numbers, where each element in `tup2` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The length of the returned tuple `result` is the same as the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2` are not equal, a `ValueError` will be raised due to the `zip` function, which stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. **
