Output State: **The program returns a tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Since `tup2[i]` is guaranteed not to be zero for any index `i`, the division operation is valid for all elements. The length of `result` is the same as the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2`.**
