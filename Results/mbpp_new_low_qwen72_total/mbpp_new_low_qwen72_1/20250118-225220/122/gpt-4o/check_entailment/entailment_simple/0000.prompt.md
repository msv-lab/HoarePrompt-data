Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of numbers, and for each index i, tup2[i] is not zero.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple(a // b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    return result
    #The program returns a tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Since `tup2[i]` is guaranteed not to be zero for any index `i`, the division operation is valid for all elements. The length of `result` is the same as the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2`.

Correctness: **True** or **False**
