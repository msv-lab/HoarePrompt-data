Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division on two tuples. The provided assertions test the function with different tuples and check if the results match the expected output. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

Given the problem statement and the state of the program, it is mentioned that `tup2[i]` is guaranteed not to be zero for any index `i`. This ensures that the division operation is always valid and will not raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

The function's logic and the provided assertions are consistent and correct. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
