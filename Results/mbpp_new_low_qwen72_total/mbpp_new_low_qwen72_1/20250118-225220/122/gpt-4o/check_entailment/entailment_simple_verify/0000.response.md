Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it uses integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`). However, the problem description does not explicitly specify that the division should be floating-point division. Instead, it only mentions "mathematical division operation element-wise." In Python, the `//` operator performs floor division, which is a form of mathematical division that returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result. This is still a valid form of division and can be considered correct unless the problem specifically requires floating-point results.

The provided test cases also suggest that the expected output is integer division, as the results are tuples of integers. If the problem required floating-point results, the test cases would likely include decimal points.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The function `func_1` is correctly performing the specified operation based on the provided problem description and test cases.

Final: **True**
