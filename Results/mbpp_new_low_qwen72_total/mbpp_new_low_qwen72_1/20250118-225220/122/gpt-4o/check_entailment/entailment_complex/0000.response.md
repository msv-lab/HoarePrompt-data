Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division between two tuples. The program uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to iterate over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using the `zip` function. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which is appropriate given the problem description.

The assertions provided test the function with different tuples and check if the output matches the expected results. All the assertions pass, indicating that the function behaves as intended for the given test cases.

The comment about the state of the program mentions that `tup2[i]` is guaranteed not to be zero for any index `i`, which ensures that no division by zero errors occur. Additionally, the comment correctly notes that if the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2` are not equal, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is a behavior that aligns with how `zip` works in Python.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
