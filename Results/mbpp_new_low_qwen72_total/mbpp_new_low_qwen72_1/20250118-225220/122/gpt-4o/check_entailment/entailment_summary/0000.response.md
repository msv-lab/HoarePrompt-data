Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division between two tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple with the results of the integer division. The `zip` function pairs elements from both tuples until the shortest tuple is exhausted, ensuring that the operation is performed only up to the length of the shorter tuple. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which requires element-wise division.

The function is tested with three assertions, and all of them pass without any errors. This indicates that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Additionally, the execution summary confirms that the function correctly handles the division and returns the expected results.

Given the consistency between the problem description, the function implementation, and the execution summary, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
