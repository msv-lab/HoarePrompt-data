Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`). This means that the function will return the floor value of the division results, which may not be the intended behavior according to the problem description, especially when the division results are not whole numbers. For example, if the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected result should be `(2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, but the function will return `(2, 2, 2, 3)`. To make the function correct, it should use regular division (`/`).
