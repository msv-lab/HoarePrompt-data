Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division on two tuples. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the integer division of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The use of the floor division operator `//` ensures that the result is an integer, which aligns with the problem requirements.

The provided test cases are correctly evaluated:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 3)`.
2. `func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4))` results in `(2, 2, 2, 4)`.
3. `func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9))` results in `(4, 2, 6, 2)`.

These results match the expected outputs, confirming that the function behaves as intended. The function summary also correctly describes the behavior of the function, including the handling of non-equal tuple lengths, which would indeed raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function stopping at the shortest input iterable.

Given the correct implementation, the matching test cases, and the accurate function summary, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
