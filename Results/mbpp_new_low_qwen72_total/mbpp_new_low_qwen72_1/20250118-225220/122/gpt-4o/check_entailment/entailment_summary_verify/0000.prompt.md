You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in two tuples and performs mathematical division operation element-wise across the given tuples.

- Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
assert func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (2, 2, 2, 4)
assert func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9)) == (4, 2, 6, 2)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple((a // b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of numbers, where each element in `tup2` is guaranteed to be non-zero. It returns a new tuple `result` where each element is the integer division (`//`) of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The length of the returned tuple `result` is the same as the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the lengths of `tup1` and `tup2` are not equal, a `ValueError` will be raised due to the `zip` function, which stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`). This means that the function will return the floor value of the division results, which may not be the intended behavior according to the problem description, especially when the division results are not whole numbers. For example, if the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected result should be `(2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, but the function will return `(2, 2, 2, 3)`. To make the function correct, it should use regular division (`/`).
