Reasoning: The original assessment raises a valid point about the difference between integer division (`//`) and regular division (`/`). However, the problem description does not explicitly specify that the result should be a tuple of floats rather than integers. The term "mathematical division" can be interpreted in different ways, but since the examples provided in the problem description do not include fractional results, it is reasonable to assume that integer division is acceptable. Moreover, the function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, which performs integer division and returns a tuple of integers. The function meets the requirements as implied by the examples and the function summary. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate in this context.

Final: **True**
