Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a potential issue with the use of integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`). However, the problem description specifically mentions "mathematical division operation element-wise," which can be interpreted as either integer division or floating-point division depending on the context. Given the test cases provided, the expected results are integers, which aligns with the use of integer division in the function. Therefore, the function behaves correctly based on the provided test cases and the likely intended behavior.

The annotated code also confirms that the function operates correctly under the assumption that `tup2` contains no zeros, ensuring that division operations are valid. The function correctly returns a tuple of the same length as the input tuples, performing element-wise integer division.

Final: **True**
