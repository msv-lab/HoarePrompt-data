Reasoning:  
The given function `func_1` is designed to perform element-wise integer division on two tuples. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the integer division of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The use of the floor division operator `//` ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for this problem since the expected results in the assertions are tuples of integers.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`:
   - 10 // 5 = 2
   - 4 // 2 = 2
   - 6 // 3 = 2
   - 9 // 3 = 3
   - Result: (2, 2, 2, 3) (matches the expected output)

2. `func_1((12, 6, 8, 16), (6, 3, 4, 4))`:
   - 12 // 6 = 2
   - 6 // 3 = 2
   - 8 // 4 = 2
   - 16 // 4 = 4
   - Result: (2, 2, 2, 4) (matches the expected output)

3. `func_1((20, 14, 36, 18), (5, 7, 6, 9))`:
   - 20 // 5 = 4
   - 14 // 7 = 2
   - 36 // 6 = 6
   - 18 // 9 = 2
   - Result: (4, 2, 6, 2) (matches the expected output)

Since all the test cases produce the expected results, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
