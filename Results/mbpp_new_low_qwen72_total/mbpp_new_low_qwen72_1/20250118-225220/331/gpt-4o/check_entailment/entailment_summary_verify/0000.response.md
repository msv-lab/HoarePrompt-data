Reasoning:

The original assessment points out a critical flaw in the function's handling of the order of elements. Let's break down the function and the test cases to verify this:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` converts both input lists into sets (`set1` and `set2`).
   - It then computes the symmetric difference of these sets, which gives elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both.
   - The result is converted back to a list and sorted based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
     - Expected Output: `[10, 20, 30, 15]`
     - Symmetric Difference: `{10, 15, 20, 30}`
     - Concatenated List: `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 40, 35]`
     - Sorted Result: `[10, 15, 20, 30]` (based on the first occurrence in the concatenated list)
     - **Issue**: The sorting based on the concatenated list does not preserve the original order from `list1` and `list2`.

   - **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Expected Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Symmetric Difference: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
     - Concatenated List: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`
     - Sorted Result: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (correctly ordered)

   - **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Expected Output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - Symmetric Difference: `{2, 3, 6, 7}`
     - Concatenated List: `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]`
     - Sorted Result: `[2, 3, 6, 7]` (correctly ordered)

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly identifies the symmetric difference but fails to preserve the original order of elements in the resulting list for some test cases.
   - Specifically, the issue arises when elements in the symmetric difference have different positions in the original lists, leading to incorrect sorting.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function does not always produce the correct output due to the sorting mechanism used.

Final: **False**
