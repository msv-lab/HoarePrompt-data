Reasoning:
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of the function `func_1`. The function indeed finds the symmetric difference between two lists and sorts the resulting elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of the inputs. Let's break down the steps and verify them against the provided test cases:

1. **Set Conversion**: The function converts the input lists `list1` and `list2` into sets `set1` and `set2` to eliminate duplicates and prepare for set operations.
2. **Symmetric Difference**: The `symmetric_difference` method is used to find elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both.
3. **List Conversion**: The resulting set of symmetric differences is converted back into a list.
4. **Sorting**: The list is sorted based on the index of each element in the concatenated list of the original inputs (`list1 + list2`). This ensures that the elements are ordered based on their first appearance in the input lists.

Now, let's verify the test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
  - Symmetric difference: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Concatenated list: `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 40, 35]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Actual output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Concatenated list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Actual output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
  - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Concatenated list: `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Actual output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Result: Correct

All test cases pass, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the function summary. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
