Reasoning: 

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of `func_1` and its correctness. Let's break down the function and the test cases to ensure everything is correct:

1. **Function Breakdown:**
   - **Conversion to Sets:** The function converts the input lists `list1` and `list2` into sets `set1` and `set2`. This step removes any duplicates within each list and prepares the data for set operations.
   - **Symmetric Difference:** The `symmetric_difference` method is used to find elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This results in a set `diff_elements` containing the unique elements from both lists.
   - **Conversion to List and Sorting:** The resulting set `diff_elements` is converted back to a list. The list is then sorted based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are ordered by their first appearance in the combined input lists.

2. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 40, 35]`: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
   - **Test Case 2:** `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - **Test Case 3:** `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
     - Symmetric difference: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
     - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`

All test cases pass as expected, confirming that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
