### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires writing a function to get the difference between two lists. This means the function should return a list of elements that are present in one list but not in the other, maintaining the order of appearance in the original lists.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` converts the input lists `list1` and `list2` into sets `set1` and `set2`.
   - It then computes the symmetric difference (`diff_elements`) between these sets, which gives elements that are in either set but not in both.
   - The result is converted back to a list and sorted based on the first occurrence in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`.

3. **Evaluating the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function does not maintain the order of elements as they appear in the original lists, which is crucial for the correct output.
   - Specifically, it mentions that the function will return `[10, 15, 20, 30]` instead of `[10, 20, 30, 15]` for the input `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`.

4. **Verifying the Code with Test Cases**:
   - Let's verify the function with the provided test cases:
     - **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
       - `set1 = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}`
       - `set2 = {25, 40, 35}`
       - `diff_elements = {10, 15, 20, 30}`
       - `result_list = [10, 15, 20, 30]` (sorted based on first occurrence in `list1 + list2`)
       - Expected output: `[10, 20, 30, 15]`
       - Actual output: `[10, 15, 20, 30]` (incorrect order)
     - **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
       - `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
       - `set2 = {1, 6, 7}`
       - `diff_elements = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
       - `result_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (sorted based on first occurrence in `list1 + list2`)
       - Expected output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
       - Actual output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (correct)
     - **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
       - `set1 = {1, 2, 3}`
       - `set2 = {1, 6, 7}`
       - `diff_elements = {2, 3, 6, 7}`
       - `result_list = [2, 3, 6, 7]` (sorted based on first occurrence in `list1 + list2`)
       - Expected output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
       - Actual output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]` (correct)

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The function does not maintain the order of elements as they appear in the original lists, which is crucial for the correct output. The sorting based on the concatenated list `list1 + list2` does not necessarily preserve the original order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
