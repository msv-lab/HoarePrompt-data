Reasoning:

The original assessment is thorough and correctly identifies the purpose and mechanism of the function `func_1`. Let's break down the function step by step and verify its behavior against the provided test cases.

1. **Conversion to Sets**:
   - `set1 = set(list1)`: Converts `list1` to a set to remove duplicates.
   - `set2 = set(list2)`: Converts `list2` to a set to remove duplicates.

2. **Finding Symmetric Difference**:
   - `diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`: Computes the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, which includes elements that are in either set but not in both.

3. **Converting Set to List**:
   - `result_list = list(diff_elements)`: Converts the set `diff_elements` to a list.

4. **Sorting the Result**:
   - `result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))`: Sorts the list `result_list` based on the index of each element in the concatenated list `list1 + list2`. This ensures that the elements are ordered based on their first appearance in the input lists.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`
  - `set1 = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}`
  - `set2 = {25, 40, 35}`
  - `diff_elements = {10, 15, 20, 30}`
  - `result_list = [10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence in `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 40, 35]`: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Expected: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - Actual: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`
  - **Pass**

- **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])`
  - `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
  - `set2 = {6, 7, 1}`
  - `diff_elements = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
  - `result_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Actual: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - **Pass**

- **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`
  - `set1 = {1, 2, 3}`
  - `set2 = {6, 7, 1}`
  - `diff_elements = {2, 3, 6, 7}`
  - `result_list = [2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Sorted by first occurrence in `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]`: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Expected: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Actual: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - **Pass**

All test cases pass, confirming that the function correctly computes the symmetric difference and sorts the result based on the first occurrence in the concatenated list of inputs.

Final: **True**
