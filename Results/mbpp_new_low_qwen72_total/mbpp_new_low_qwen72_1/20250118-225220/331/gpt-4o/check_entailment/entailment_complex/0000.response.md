Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to return the symmetric difference between two lists, sorted by their first occurrence in the concatenated list of the two input lists.

2. **Set Operations**:
   - The function converts both input lists (`list1` and `list2`) into sets (`set1` and `set2`). This is correct because sets are used to efficiently find the unique elements and perform set operations.
   - The `symmetric_difference` method is used to find elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. This is the correct operation for finding the difference between the two lists.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The result of the symmetric difference is converted back into a list (`result_list`).
   - The list is then sorted using a custom key, which sorts elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. This ensures that the order of elements in the result matches their first appearance in the original lists.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])` should return `[10, 15, 20, 30]`. The function correctly identifies these elements as they are present in `list1` but not in `list2`.
   - The second test case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])` should return `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The function correctly identifies these elements as they are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.
   - The third test case `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])` should return `[2, 3, 6, 7]`. The function correctly identifies these elements as they are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return the non-empty list sorted by the order of their first occurrence in the non-empty list.
   - If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correctly implemented and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
