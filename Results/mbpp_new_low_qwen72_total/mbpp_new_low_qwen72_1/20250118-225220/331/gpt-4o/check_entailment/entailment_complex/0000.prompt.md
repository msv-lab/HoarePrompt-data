Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to get the difference between two lists.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 6, 7]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)

set2 = set(list2)

diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

result_list = list(diff_elements)

result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
    return result_list
    #The program returns a sorted list of elements in `diff_elements` based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return the non-empty list sorted by the order of their first occurrence in the non-empty list. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
