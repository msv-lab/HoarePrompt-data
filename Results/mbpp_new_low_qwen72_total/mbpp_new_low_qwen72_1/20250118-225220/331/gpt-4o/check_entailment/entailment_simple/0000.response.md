Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and aims to return a list of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. This is correctly achieved using the `symmetric_difference` method of sets.

2. The `symmetric_difference` method returns a set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. This matches the problem's requirement.

3. The result is converted back to a list and sorted based on the index of the first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. This ensures that the order of the resulting list respects the original order of elements as they appear in the input lists.

4. The assertions provided in the annotated program are used to test the correctness of the function. Let's verify each one:
   - `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])` should return `[10, 15, 20, 30]`.
     - Elements in `list1` but not in `list2`: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`.
     - Elements in `list2` but not in `list1`: `[]`.
     - Result: `[10, 15, 20, 30]`.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1])` should return `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
     - Elements in `list1` but not in `list2`: `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.
     - Elements in `list2` but not in `list1`: `[6, 7]`.
     - Result: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])` should return `[2, 3, 6, 7]`.
     - Elements in `list1` but not in `list2`: `[2, 3]`.
     - Elements in `list2` but not in `list1`: `[6, 7]`.
     - Result: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`.

All assertions are satisfied, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
