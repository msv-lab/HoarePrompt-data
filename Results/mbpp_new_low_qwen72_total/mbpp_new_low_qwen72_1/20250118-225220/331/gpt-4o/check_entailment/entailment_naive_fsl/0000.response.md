Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution uses `set.symmetric_difference` to find elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. However, this approach does not maintain the order of elements as they appear in the original lists, which is crucial for the correct output according to the test cases provided. For example, consider the input `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`. The expected output is `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, but the actual output of the function will be `[10, 15, 20, 30]` because the `sort` function used in the code sorts the elements based on their first occurrence in the combined list `list1 + list2`, which does not necessarily preserve the original order of elements in `list1` and `list2`.

To fix this, the function would need to handle the order of elements more carefully, possibly by iterating through the original lists and constructing the result list while preserving the order.
