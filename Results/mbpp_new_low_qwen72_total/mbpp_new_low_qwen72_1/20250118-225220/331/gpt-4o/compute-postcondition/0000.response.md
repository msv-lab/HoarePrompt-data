The code block converts `list1` and `list2` into sets (`set1` and `set2`), finds the symmetric difference between these sets (elements present in one set but not both), converts this result back into a list (`result_list`), and then sorts this list based on the first occurrence of each element in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.

- `set1` is a set containing unique elements from `list1`.
- `set2` is a set containing unique elements from `list2`.
- `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both.
- `result_list` is a sorted list of `diff_elements`, where the sorting is based on the first occurrence of each element in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists, set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1, set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2, diff_elements is a set containing elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both, result_list is a sorted list of elements in diff_elements based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of list1 and list2**
