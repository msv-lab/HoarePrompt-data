Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return the non-empty list sorted by the order of their first occurrence in the non-empty list. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Parameters**: The function takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`.
- **Output**: A sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.
- **Sorting Criteria**: The elements are sorted based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `list1` is empty and `list2` is non-empty, the function will return the elements of `list2` sorted by their first occurrence in `list2`.
  - If `list2` is empty and `list1` is non-empty, the function will return the elements of `list1` sorted by their first occurrence in `list1`.
  - If both `list1` and `list2` are empty, the function will return an empty list.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not handle cases where the elements in `list1` and `list2` are not hashable (e.g., lists or dictionaries), which would cause a `TypeError` when converting them to sets. Additionally, the function assumes that the elements in `list1` and `list2` are unique; if duplicates are present, the sorting might not be as expected.
