The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, based on their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return the non-empty list sorted by the order of their first occurrence in the non-empty list. If both lists are empty, the function will return an empty list.
