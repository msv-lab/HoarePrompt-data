Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

# Program:
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values. It returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. The function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
