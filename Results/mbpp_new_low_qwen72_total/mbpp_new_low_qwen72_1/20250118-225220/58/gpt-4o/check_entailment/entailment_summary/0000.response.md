Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The function uses the built-in `sum` function, which works by adding up all the elements in the list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list effectively counts the number of `True` values.

The test cases provided are:
- `func_1([True, False, True])` should return `2` (since there are two `True` values).
- `func_1([False, False])` should return `0` (since there are no `True` values).
- `func_1([True, True, True])` should return `3` (since there are three `True` values).

All these test cases pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected.

Additionally, the execution summary confirms that the function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return `0`.

Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
