You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

- Program: 
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bool_list is a list of boolean values.
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)
    #The program returns the sum of the boolean values in `bool_list`, where True is treated as 1 and False as 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values. It returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. The function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works correctly for this purpose because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list will effectively count the number of `True` values.

However, the test cases provided are incomplete because they do not include a test case with an empty list or a list that contains only `False` values. Despite this, the function itself is correct and will work as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
