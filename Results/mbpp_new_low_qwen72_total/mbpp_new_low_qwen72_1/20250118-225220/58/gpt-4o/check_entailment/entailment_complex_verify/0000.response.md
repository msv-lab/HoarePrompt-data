Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` booleans in the given list by leveraging Python's treatment of `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`. The `sum` function effectively adds up these values, providing the count of `True` values in the list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including mixed boolean values, all `False` values, and all `True` values, and the function behaves as expected in all these cases. The annotations also confirm that the function's behavior aligns with the intended functionality, and no edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail.

Final: **True**
