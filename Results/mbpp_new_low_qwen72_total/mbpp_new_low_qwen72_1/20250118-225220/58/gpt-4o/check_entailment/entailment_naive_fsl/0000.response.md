Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `True` booleans in the given list by using the `sum` function. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, so summing the list directly gives the count of `True` values. The provided test cases cover lists with mixed boolean values, all `False` values, and all `True` values, and the function works correctly for all these cases. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the function to fail.
