Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works correctly for this purpose because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list will effectively count the number of `True` values.

However, the test cases provided are incomplete because they do not include a test case with an empty list or a list that contains only `False` values. Despite this, the function itself is correct and will work as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
