Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which is appropriate because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Summing the list will indeed count the number of `True` values.

The function summary confirms that `func_1` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, and it will work correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0. This aligns with the intended behavior described in the problem statement.

The original assessment correctly points out that the test cases provided are incomplete, as they do not cover all edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only `False` values. However, the function itself is correct and will work as expected for the given test cases and any other valid input.

To further validate the function, we can add the missing test cases:
```python
assert func_1([]) == 0  # Empty list
assert func_1([False, False, False]) == 0  # List with only False values
```

These additional test cases would confirm that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

Final: **True**
