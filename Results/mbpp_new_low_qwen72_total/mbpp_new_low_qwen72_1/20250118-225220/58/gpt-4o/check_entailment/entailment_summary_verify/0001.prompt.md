You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2
assert func_1([False, False]) == 0
assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3

def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values. It returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. The function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values. The implementation uses the `sum` function, which works correctly for this purpose because in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. Therefore, summing the list will effectively count the number of `True` values.

However, the test cases provided are incomplete because they do not include a test case with an empty list or a list that contains only `False` values. Despite this, the function itself is correct and will work as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
