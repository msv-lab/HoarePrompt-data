Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` boolean values in a given list. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in arithmetic operations. The `sum` function in Python can sum up all the elements in an iterable, treating `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`. Therefore, using `sum(bool_list)` will correctly count the number of `True` values in the list.

The provided assertions test different scenarios:
- `[True, False, True]` should return `2` because there are two `True` values.
- `[False, False]` should return `0` because there are no `True` values.
- `[True, True, True]` should return `3` because all values are `True`.

All these assertions are correct, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
