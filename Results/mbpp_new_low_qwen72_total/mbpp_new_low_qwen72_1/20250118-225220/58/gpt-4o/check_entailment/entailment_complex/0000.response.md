Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of `True` booleans in a given list. In Python, boolean values can be treated as integers where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. The `sum` function in Python adds up all the elements in an iterable. When applied to a list of booleans, `sum` will effectively count the number of `True` values because each `True` contributes `1` to the sum, and each `False` contributes `0`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1([True, False, True]) == 2` correctly counts 2 `True` values.
- `assert func_1([False, False]) == 0` correctly counts 0 `True` values.
- `assert func_1([True, True, True]) == 3` correctly counts 3 `True` values.

These test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with mixed values, lists with only `False` values, and lists with only `True` values. The function behaves as expected in all these cases.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
