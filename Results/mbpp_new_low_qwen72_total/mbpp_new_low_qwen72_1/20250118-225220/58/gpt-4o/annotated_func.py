#State of the program right berfore the function call: bool_list is a list of boolean values.
def func_1(bool_list):
    return sum(bool_list)
    #The program returns the sum of the boolean values in `bool_list`, where True is treated as 1 and False as 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values. It returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. The function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0.
