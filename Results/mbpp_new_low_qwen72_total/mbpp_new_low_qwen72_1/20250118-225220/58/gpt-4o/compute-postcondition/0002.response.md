Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `bool_list`, which is a list of boolean values. It returns the sum of these values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0. The function works correctly for any list of boolean values, including empty lists, where it will return 0. **

Explanation:
- The function takes a list of boolean values (`bool_list`) as input.
- It uses the `sum` function to add up the values in the list, where `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0.
- If the list is empty, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0.
- The function handles all possible boolean inputs and edge cases, such as an empty list or a list containing only `True` or `False` values.
