Reasoning: 

The provided program and its annotated version align well with the problem description and the original assessment. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Base Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `n < 0` by returning 0. This ensures that the function behaves as expected for invalid inputs.
   - The initial list `perrin = [3, 0, 2]` correctly sets the first three terms of the Perrin sequence.

2. **Loop for Generating the Sequence:**
   - The for loop `for i in range(3, n + 1)` iterates from 3 to `n`, inclusive, which is appropriate for generating the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term.
   - Inside the loop, `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` correctly computes each new term by summing the term two positions back and the term three positions back. This adheres to the definition of the Perrin sequence.

3. **Summing the Sequence:**
   - After the loop, `return sum(perrin)` correctly returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list, which includes the initial terms and all generated terms up to the `n`-th term.

4. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - The test cases provided in the original assessment are verified and correct:
     - For \( n = 9 \): The sequence is [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12], and the sum is 49.
     - For \( n = 10 \): The sequence is [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14], and the sum is 66.
     - For \( n = 11 \): The sequence is [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17], and the sum is 88.

Given that the function correctly generates the Perrin sequence and sums it up as described, and all provided test cases pass, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
