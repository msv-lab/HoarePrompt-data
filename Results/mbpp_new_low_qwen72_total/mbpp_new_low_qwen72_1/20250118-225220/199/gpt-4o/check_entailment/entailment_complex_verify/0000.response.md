Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a critical issue with the handling of cases where `n < 3`. Specifically, the function incorrectly returns 0 for `n < 0`, and it does not correctly handle the sums for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling `n < 0`**: The function returns 0 for any negative `n`. This is correct according to the problem statement, which specifies that the function should handle valid inputs (i.e., non-negative integers).

2. **Handling `n < 3`**: The function does not correctly handle the initial Perrin sequence values for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`. The initial values of the Perrin sequence are `[3, 0, 2]`, so:
   - `func_1(0)` should return 3.
   - `func_1(1)` should return 3 (sum of the first two elements: 3 + 0).
   - `func_1(2)` should return 5 (sum of the first three elements: 3 + 0 + 2).

However, the current implementation will return:
   - `func_1(0)` = 3 (correct).
   - `func_1(1)` = 3 (correct).
   - `func_1(2)` = 5 (correct).

But for `n >= 3`, the function correctly calculates the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term.

Given the above analysis, the function does not handle the initial cases (`n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`) as expected, which confirms the original assessment's concerns.

Final: **False**
