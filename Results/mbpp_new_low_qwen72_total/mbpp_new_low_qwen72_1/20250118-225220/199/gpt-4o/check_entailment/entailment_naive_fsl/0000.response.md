Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is less than 3. For `n < 3`, the function should return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence values `[3, 0, 2]` up to the nth index, but it currently returns 0 for `n < 0`. Additionally, for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`, the function should return the sum of the initial values up to those indices. For example, `func_1(0)` should return 3, `func_1(1)` should return 3, and `func_1(2)` should return 5. The current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.
