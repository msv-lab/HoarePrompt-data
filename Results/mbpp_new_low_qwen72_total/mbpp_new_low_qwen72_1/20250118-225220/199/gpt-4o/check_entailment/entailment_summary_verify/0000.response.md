Reasoning:

The original assessment points out that the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the cases where `n` is less than 3. Let's analyze this in detail:

1. **Negative `n`**: The function correctly returns 0 for any `n < 0`, which aligns with the function summary. This part of the function is correct.

2. **`n = 0`**: According to the function summary, the function should return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence values up to the 0th index. The initial Perrin sequence is `[3, 0, 2]`, so `func_1(0)` should return 3. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and would return 3, which is consistent with the initial values. Therefore, this specific case is handled correctly.

3. **`n = 1`**: Similarly, `func_1(1)` should return the sum of the initial values up to the 1st index, which is 3 (from the 0th index) + 0 (from the 1st index) = 3. The current implementation handles this correctly.

4. **`n = 2`**: For `n = 2`, the function should return the sum of the initial values up to the 2nd index, which is 3 (from the 0th index) + 0 (from the 1st index) + 2 (from the 2nd index) = 5. The current implementation also handles this correctly.

5. **`n >= 3`**: For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function correctly calculates the Perrin sequence and returns the sum of all terms up to the `n`-th term. This is in line with the function summary.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly handles all cases as described in the function summary. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues with `n < 3` cases, which are actually handled correctly by the function.

Final: **True**
