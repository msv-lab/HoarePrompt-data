You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term, where the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2] and each subsequent term is the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back. The function then returns the sum of the entire Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is less than 3. For `n < 3`, the function should return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence values `[3, 0, 2]` up to the nth index, but it currently returns 0 for `n < 0`. Additionally, for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`, the function should return the sum of the initial values up to those indices. For example, `func_1(0)` should return 3, `func_1(1)` should return 3, and `func_1(2)` should return 5. The current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.
