Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: perrin = [3, 0, 2] + [perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3] for i in range(3, n + 1)]
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the list `perrin`, which starts with [3, 0, 2] and continues with elements calculated as the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back, for each index from 3 to n inclusive. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
