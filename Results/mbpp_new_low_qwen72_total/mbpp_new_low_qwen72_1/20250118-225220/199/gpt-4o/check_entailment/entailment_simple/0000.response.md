### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts with an initial check to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns 0. This is consistent with the problem statement, which assumes valid inputs (non-negative integers).

2. **Base Case Initialization**: The Perrin sequence is initialized with the first three elements `[3, 0, 2]`. This is correct according to the definition of the Perrin sequence.

3. **Loop Calculation**: The function uses a loop to calculate the Perrin numbers from the 4th element up to the `n`-th element. For each `i` from 3 to `n`, it appends the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back to the list `perrin`. This is the correct way to generate the Perrin sequence.

4. **Sum Calculation**: After generating the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th element, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `perrin`. This is also correct according to the problem statement, which asks for the sum of the Perrin numbers.

5. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, `func_1(11) == 88`) are consistent with the expected output for the Perrin sequence. These test cases confirm that the function is working correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It initializes the Perrin sequence correctly, generates the sequence up to the `n`-th element, and returns the sum of the sequence. The test cases also pass, further confirming the correctness of the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**
