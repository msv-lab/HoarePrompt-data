Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to generate the Perrin sequence and calculate its sum up to the `n`-th term. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if `n` is less than 0 and returns 0 in that case. This is appropriate because the Perrin sequence is only defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Initial Sequence**: The initial values `[3, 0, 2]` are correctly set up for the Perrin sequence.

3. **Sequence Generation**: The for loop correctly generates the Perrin sequence from the 3rd term to the `n`-th term. Each term is the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back, which matches the definition of the Perrin sequence.

4. **Sum Calculation**: After generating the sequence, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `perrin` list, which is the correct result according to the problem statement.

5. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 49`, `func_1(10) == 66`, `func_1(11) == 88`) are correct and match the expected output for the Perrin sequence sums up to those indices.

Given that the function correctly follows the problem description and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
