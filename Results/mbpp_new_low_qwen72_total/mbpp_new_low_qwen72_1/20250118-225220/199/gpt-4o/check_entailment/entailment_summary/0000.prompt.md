Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

# Program:
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term, where the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2] and each subsequent term is the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back. The function then returns the sum of the entire Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
