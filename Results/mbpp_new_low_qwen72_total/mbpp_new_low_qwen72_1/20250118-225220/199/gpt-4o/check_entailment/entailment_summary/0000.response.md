Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The initial conditions for the Perrin sequence are correctly set as [3, 0, 2]. The loop iterates from 3 to `n`, appending the next term in the sequence by summing the terms at positions `i-2` and `i-3`. Finally, the function returns the sum of the entire list `perrin`, which contains the first `n+1` terms of the Perrin sequence (since the list is 0-indexed).

The provided test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as intended, calculating the Perrin sequence and returning the sum of its terms.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
