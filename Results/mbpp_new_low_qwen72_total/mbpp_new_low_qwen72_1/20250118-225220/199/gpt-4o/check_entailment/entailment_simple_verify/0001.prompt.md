You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: perrin = [3, 0, 2] + [perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3] for i in range(3, n + 1)]
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the list `perrin`, which starts with [3, 0, 2] and continues with elements calculated as the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back, for each index from 3 to n inclusive. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
- \( P(0) = 3 \)
- \( P(1) = 0 \)
- \( P(2) = 2 \)
- For \( n > 2 \), \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \)

The function initializes the first three terms of the Perrin sequence and then iterates from 3 to \( n \) to compute subsequent terms. It appends each new term to the list `perrin` and finally returns the sum of all elements in the list.

Let's verify the correctness of the function with the provided test cases:

1. For \( n = 9 \):
   - The Perrin sequence up to the 9th term is: [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]
   - The sum of these terms is: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49
   - The function correctly returns 49.

2. For \( n = 10 \):
   - The Perrin sequence up to the 10th term is: [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]
   - The sum of these terms is: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 66
   - The function correctly returns 66.

3. For \( n = 11 \):
   - The Perrin sequence up to the 11th term is: [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]
   - The sum of these terms is: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 17 = 88
   - The function correctly returns 88.

All the test cases pass, and the function correctly computes the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the nth term.

Correctness: **True**
