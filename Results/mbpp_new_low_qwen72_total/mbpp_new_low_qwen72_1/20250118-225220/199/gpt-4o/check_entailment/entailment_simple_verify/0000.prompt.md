You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

- Program: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

def func_1(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    return sum(perrin)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(9) == 49
assert func_1(10) == 66
assert func_1(11) == 88

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, and n is greater than or equal to 0
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: perrin = [3, 0, 2] + [perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3] for i in range(3, n + 1)]
    return sum(perrin)
    #The program returns the sum of the list `perrin`, which starts with [3, 0, 2] and continues with elements calculated as the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back, for each index from 3 to n inclusive. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to the nth term, but it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is less than 3. For `n < 3`, the function should return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence values `[3, 0, 2]` up to the nth index, but it currently returns 0 for `n < 0`. Additionally, for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`, the function should return the sum of the initial values up to those indices. For example, `func_1(0)` should return 3, `func_1(1)` should return 3, and `func_1(2)` should return 5. The current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.
