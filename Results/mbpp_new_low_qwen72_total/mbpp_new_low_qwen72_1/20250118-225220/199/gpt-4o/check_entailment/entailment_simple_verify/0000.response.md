Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a critical issue with the handling of cases where `n` is less than 3. The function currently returns 0 for `n < 0`, which is correct according to the problem statement that assumes valid inputs (i.e., non-negative integers). However, the function does not handle the cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2 correctly. For these values, the function should return the sum of the initial Perrin sequence values up to the nth index:

- `func_1(0)` should return 3 (since the sequence starts with 3).
- `func_1(1)` should return 3 (since the sequence is [3, 0]).
- `func_1(2)` should return 5 (since the sequence is [3, 0, 2]).

The current implementation, however, will return 3, 3, and 5 respectively only if the loop is skipped, but it does not explicitly handle these cases. Therefore, the function is incorrect for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2`.

Final: **False**
