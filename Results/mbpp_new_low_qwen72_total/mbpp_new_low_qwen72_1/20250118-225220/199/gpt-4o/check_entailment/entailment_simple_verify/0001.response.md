Reasoning:
The provided program and its annotations are consistent with the original assessment. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Base Cases**:
   - The function initializes the first three terms of the Perrin sequence: `[3, 0, 2]`.
   - The base case for \( n < 0 \) is handled correctly by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Perrin Sequence Calculation**:
   - The function uses a for loop to generate the Perrin sequence from the 3rd term to the nth term.
   - Each new term is calculated as the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back, which matches the definition of the Perrin sequence: \( P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) \).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - After generating the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `perrin`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases for \( n = 9 \), \( n = 10 \), and \( n = 11 \) are verified to be correct:
     - For \( n = 9 \): The sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12]` and the sum is 49.
     - For \( n = 10 \): The sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14]` and the sum is 66.
     - For \( n = 11 \): The sequence is `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17]` and the sum is 88.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic and flow of the function are correct.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the Perrin numbers up to the nth term and passes all the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
