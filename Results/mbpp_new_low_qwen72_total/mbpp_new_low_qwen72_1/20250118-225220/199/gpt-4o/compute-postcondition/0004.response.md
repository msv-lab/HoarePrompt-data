To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

- **State before the loop starts:**
  - `n` is a non-negative integer (i.e., `n >= 0`).
  - `perrin = [3, 0, 2]`.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(3, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Function:**
   - The `range(3, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 3 up to but not including `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if there is at least one number in the range `3` to `n + 1`.
   - This means `n + 1` must be greater than 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., `n >= 3`).

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined because it is initialized by the `range` function during the first iteration.
   - The list `perrin` is already defined as `[3, 0, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 3. The initial state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, but it will be set to 3 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `perrin = [3, 0, 2]`**
