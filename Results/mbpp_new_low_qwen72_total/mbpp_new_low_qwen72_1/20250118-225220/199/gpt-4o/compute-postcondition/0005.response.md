The code snippet `perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])` appends a new value to the list `perrin`. This new value is the sum of the elements at indices `i-2` and `i-3` in the list `perrin`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `perrin = [3, 0, 2]`.

Since `n` is at least 3, the index `i` in the context of this operation would start from 3 (as the list is 0-indexed, and the first three elements are already defined). Therefore, when `i = 3`:

- `perrin[i - 2]` corresponds to `perrin[1]` which is `0`.
- `perrin[i - 3]` corresponds to `perrin[0]` which is `3`.

So, the new element added to the list `perrin` is `0 + 3 = 3`.

Thus, the updated state of the list `perrin` after executing the code is `[3, 0, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3]`**
