The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. In Case_1, the function returns 0. In Case_2, the function returns the sum of the list `perrin`, which starts with [3, 0, 2] and continues with elements calculated as the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back, for each index from 3 to `n` inclusive. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If a specific condition is met (not detailed here), it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of a list `perrin` starting with [3, 0, 2], where each subsequent element is the sum of the element two positions back and the element three positions back, up to index `n`.**
