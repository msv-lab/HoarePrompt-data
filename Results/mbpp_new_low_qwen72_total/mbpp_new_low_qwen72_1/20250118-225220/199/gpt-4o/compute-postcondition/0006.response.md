The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 3 (since the loop starts from 3), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 to satisfy the condition `i <= n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3]`**
