The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 3 (the first value in the range), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to have started.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the condition `i <= n` to hold true.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`, `i` is 4**
