Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term, where the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2] and each subsequent term is the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back. The function then returns the sum of the entire Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Negative Input:** If `n` is negative, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Zero Input:** If `n` is 0, the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence [3, 0, 2], which is 5.
- **Small Positive Input:** For small values of `n` (e.g., 1 or 2), the function returns the sum of the initial Perrin sequence plus any additional terms calculated.
- **Large Positive Input:** For larger values of `n`, the function continues to extend the Perrin sequence and returns the sum of all terms up to the `n`-th term.

The function correctly handles all non-negative integer inputs and returns the appropriate sum based on the Perrin sequence. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases that the code fails to handle.
