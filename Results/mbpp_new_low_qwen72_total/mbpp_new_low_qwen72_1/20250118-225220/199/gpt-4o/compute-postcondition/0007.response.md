The code appends a new element to the list `perrin`. The new element is calculated as `perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3]`. Given that `i` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, we assume `i` is the current length of the `perrin` list, which is 4. Therefore, the new element is `perrin[2] + perrin[1]`, which is `2 + 0 = 2`.

The updated list `perrin` will be `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`**
