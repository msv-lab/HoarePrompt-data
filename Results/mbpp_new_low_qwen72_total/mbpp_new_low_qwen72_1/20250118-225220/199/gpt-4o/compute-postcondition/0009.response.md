The code appends a new element to the list `perrin` which is calculated as the sum of the elements at indices `i - 2` and `i - 3`. Given that `i` is 4, the new element is `perrin[2] + perrin[1]`, which is `2 + 0 = 2`. After this operation, the list `perrin` becomes `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `perrin = [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2]`, `i` is 4**
