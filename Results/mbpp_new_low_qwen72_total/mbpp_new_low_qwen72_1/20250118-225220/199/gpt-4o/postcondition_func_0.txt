The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is negative, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term, where the sequence starts with [3, 0, 2] and each subsequent term is the sum of the term two positions back and the term three positions back. The function then returns the sum of the entire Perrin sequence up to the `n`-th term. The exact sum depends on the value of `n`.
