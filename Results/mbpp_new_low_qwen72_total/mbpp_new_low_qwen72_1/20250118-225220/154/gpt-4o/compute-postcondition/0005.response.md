Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `d`, which is expected to be a dictionary. The function returns an integer representing the depth of the deepest nested dictionary within `d`. If `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. If `d` contains nested dictionaries, the function returns 1 plus the maximum depth of any nested dictionary. This means that for a dictionary with no nested dictionaries, the function returns 1, and for a dictionary with nested dictionaries, it returns 1 plus the depth of the deepest nested dictionary. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer, etc.), the function returns 1.
- If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function also returns 1.
- The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth recursively.
- The function assumes that all values in the dictionary are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries. If a value is neither (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle. **
