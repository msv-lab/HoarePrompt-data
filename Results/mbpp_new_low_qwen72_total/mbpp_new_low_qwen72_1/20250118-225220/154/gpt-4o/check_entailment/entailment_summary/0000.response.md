Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a dictionary. It works by checking if the input is a dictionary and if it is not empty. If the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1, which is the base case. If the input is a non-empty dictionary, the function recursively calculates the maximum depth of the values in the dictionary and adds 1 to it.

The provided test cases and the execution summary indicate that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description. However, there is a potential edge case mentioned in the execution summary where the function may raise a `TypeError` if a value in the dictionary is neither a dictionary nor a non-dictionary object (e.g., a list). Despite this, the problem description and the test cases do not specify handling such edge cases, so we can assume that the function is correct within the scope of the given problem.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the function is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
