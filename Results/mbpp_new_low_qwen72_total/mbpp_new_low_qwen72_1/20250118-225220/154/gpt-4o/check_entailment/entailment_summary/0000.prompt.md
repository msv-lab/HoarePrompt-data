Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.

# Program:
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2
assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3

def func_1(d):
    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 + max((func_1(value) for value in d.values()))





# Execution Summary:
- If `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer, etc.), the function returns 1.
- If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function also returns 1.
- The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth recursively.
- The function assumes that all values in the dictionary are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries. If a value is neither (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
