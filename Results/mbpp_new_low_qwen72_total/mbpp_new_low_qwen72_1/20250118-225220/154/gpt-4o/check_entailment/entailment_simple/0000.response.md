Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. The function works recursively by checking if the input is a dictionary and if it is not empty. If the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1, indicating that the current level is the bottommost level (either a leaf node or an empty dictionary).

If the input is a non-empty dictionary, the function computes the depth of each value in the dictionary by calling itself recursively. It then returns 1 plus the maximum depth of these values, which correctly accounts for the current level of nesting.

The provided assertions test the function with different nested dictionaries and check if the returned depth matches the expected values. All the assertions pass, which indicates that the function behaves as intended.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
