Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the maximum number of levels of nesting within the dictionary.

- The base case of the recursion is when the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, in which case the function returns 1. This is correct because an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary value can be considered to have a depth of 1.
- For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level of any nested dictionaries.

The provided test cases:
1. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` should return 4, as the deepest nesting is 4 levels deep.
2. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` should return 2, as the deepest nesting is 2 levels deep.
3. `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` should return 3, as the deepest nesting is 3 levels deep.

These test cases are consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
