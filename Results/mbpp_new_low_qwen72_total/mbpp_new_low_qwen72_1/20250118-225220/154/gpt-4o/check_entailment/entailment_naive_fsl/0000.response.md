Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` incorrectly returns a depth of 1 for an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary type. According to the problem description, the function should find the depth of a dictionary, which implies that the minimum depth should be 1 only for a non-nested dictionary with at least one key-value pair. For an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input, the function should either return 0 or handle these cases more appropriately. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

- Input: `func_1({})` should return 0 or handle this case differently since it's an empty dictionary, but the current implementation returns 1.
