Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the maximum number of levels of nesting within the dictionary.

- The base case of the recursion is when the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, in which case the function returns 1. This is correct because an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary value can be considered to have a depth of 1.
- For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level of any nested dictionaries.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`
   - The deepest nesting is 4 levels deep (`'d': {}`).
   - The function will return `1 + max(1, 1 + max(1, 1 + max(1)))`, which simplifies to `1 + 3 = 4`.

2. `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}`
   - The deepest nesting is 2 levels deep (`'c': 'python'`).
   - The function will return `1 + max(1, 1 + max(1))`, which simplifies to `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}`
   - The deepest nesting is 3 levels deep (`{4: 'Mon'}`).
   - The function will return `1 + max(1, 1 + max(1, 1 + max(1)))`, which simplifies to `1 + 2 = 3`.

The function behaves as expected for these test cases, and the original assessment correctly identifies the base case and recursive step. The provided test cases are consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
