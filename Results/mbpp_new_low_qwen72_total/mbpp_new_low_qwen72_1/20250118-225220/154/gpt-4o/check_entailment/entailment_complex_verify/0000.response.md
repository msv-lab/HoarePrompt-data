Reasoning: 

The original assessment points out a critical issue with the function `func_1`: it returns a depth of 1 for an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary type. This is indeed a flaw in the implementation because the problem description asks for the depth of a dictionary, and an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input does not have any depth in the context of nested structures.

Let's break down the behavior of the function:

1. **Empty Dictionary Case**: When the input dictionary `d` is empty (`{}`), the function returns 1. This is incorrect because an empty dictionary has no nested levels, so its depth should be 0.

2. **Non-Dictionary Input Case**: When the input `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer), the function also returns 1. This is also incorrect because the depth of a non-dictionary input should not be defined in the same way as a dictionary. The function should either return 0 or raise an appropriate error for such cases.

3. **Correct Handling of Nested Dictionaries**: For valid dictionary inputs, the function correctly calculates the depth by recursively calling itself on each value in the dictionary and returning 1 plus the maximum depth of the nested dictionaries.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The function does not handle the edge cases of empty dictionaries and non-dictionary inputs correctly.

Final: **False**
