Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is indeed designed to calculate the depth of a nested dictionary. Let's break down the function and its behavior based on the provided information and the function summary:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If the input `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer, etc.), the function returns 1. This is appropriate because a non-dictionary value can be considered to have a depth of 1.
   - If the input `d` is an empty dictionary, the function also returns 1. This is correct because an empty dictionary can be considered to have a depth of 1.

2. **Recursive Case Handling:**
   - For non-empty dictionaries, the function recursively calculates the depth of each value in the dictionary and returns 1 plus the maximum depth found among the values. This correctly accounts for the current level of the dictionary plus the deepest level of any nested dictionaries.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The test cases provided are:
     - `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` should return 4, as the deepest nesting is 4 levels deep.
     - `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}` should return 2, as the deepest nesting is 2 levels deep.
     - `{1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}` should return 3, as the deepest nesting is 3 levels deep.
   - These test cases are consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

4. **Potential Edge Case:**
   - The function summary mentions that if a value in the dictionary is neither a dictionary nor a non-dictionary object (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. However, the problem description and the provided test cases do not include such edge cases. Therefore, this potential issue does not affect the correctness of the function based on the given problem and test cases.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the depth of a nested dictionary and handles the provided test cases as expected.

Final: **True**
