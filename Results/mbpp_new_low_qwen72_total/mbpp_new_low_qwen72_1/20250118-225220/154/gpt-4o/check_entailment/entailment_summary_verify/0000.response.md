### Reasoning:

The original assessment points out that the function `func_1` returns 1 for both empty dictionaries and non-dictionary types. However, the problem description does not explicitly state how the function should handle empty dictionaries or non-dictionary types. Let's break down the requirements and the behavior of the function:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the depth of a dictionary. The depth of a dictionary is defined as the maximum number of levels of nesting within the dictionary. For example:
   - `{'a': 1}` has a depth of 1.
   - `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}` has a depth of 4.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - If the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1.
   - If the input is a non-empty dictionary, the function recursively calculates the depth by adding 1 to the maximum depth of its values.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth recursively.
   - The function returns 1 for empty dictionaries and non-dictionary types.
   - The function assumes that all values in the dictionary are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the function should return 0 for an empty dictionary or handle it differently.
   - However, the problem description does not specify what the function should return for an empty dictionary or non-dictionary types.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The function's behavior of returning 1 for an empty dictionary or non-dictionary types is consistent with the idea that an empty dictionary or non-dictionary type has no depth, but the function treats it as a base case with a depth of 1.
   - The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth as expected.

Given that the problem description does not specify the behavior for empty dictionaries or non-dictionary types, the function's current implementation is not necessarily incorrect. It is a design choice to return 1 for these cases, and it does not violate the core requirement of finding the depth of a dictionary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function `func_1` is correct based on the given problem description and the provided test cases. The original assessment's concern about the behavior for empty dictionaries and non-dictionary types is a matter of design choice rather than a fundamental correctness issue.
