Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the depth of a dictionary.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4
assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2
assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each value is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value returned by `func_1(value)` for each value in the dictionary `d`. Each value in `d` is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:- If `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer, etc.), the function returns 1.
- If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function also returns 1.
- The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth recursively.
- The function assumes that all values in the dictionary are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries. If a value is neither (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
