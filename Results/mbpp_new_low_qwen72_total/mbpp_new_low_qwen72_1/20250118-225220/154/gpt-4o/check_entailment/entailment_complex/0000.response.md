Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the depth of a dictionary. It works by recursively checking each value in the dictionary and determining the maximum depth of any nested dictionaries. Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Base Case**: If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 1. This is correct because a non-dictionary or an empty dictionary has a depth of 1.
2. **Recursive Case**: If the input `d` is a non-empty dictionary, the function calculates the depth by adding 1 to the maximum depth of the values in the dictionary. This is done using a generator expression inside the `max` function, which calls `func_1` on each value in the dictionary.

The provided test cases are:
- `assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}) == 4`: This is correct because the deepest nested dictionary has a depth of 4.
- `assert func_1({'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 'python'}}) == 2`: This is correct because the deepest nested dictionary has a depth of 2.
- `assert func_1({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4: 'Mon'}}}) == 3`: This is correct because the deepest nested dictionary has a depth of 3.

However, there is a potential edge case mentioned in the comments: if a value in the dictionary is neither a dictionary nor a non-dictionary object (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. This is a valid concern, but the problem description and the state of the program assume that all values are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries. Therefore, this edge case is outside the scope of the problem.

Given the assumptions and the provided test cases, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
