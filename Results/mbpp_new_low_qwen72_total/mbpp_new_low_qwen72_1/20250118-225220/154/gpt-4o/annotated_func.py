#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each value is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
def func_1(d):
    if (not isinstance(d, dict) or not d) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1 + max(func_1(value) for value in d.values())
        #The program returns 1 plus the maximum value returned by `func_1(value)` for each value in the dictionary `d`. Each value in `d` is either a non-dictionary object or another dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:- If `d` is not a dictionary (e.g., `None`, a list, an integer, etc.), the function returns 1.
- If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function also returns 1.
- The function correctly handles nested dictionaries and calculates the depth recursively.
- The function assumes that all values in the dictionary are either non-dictionary objects or other dictionaries. If a value is neither (e.g., a list), the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1` on it. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle.
