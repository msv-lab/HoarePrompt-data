The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must still be greater than `i` (which means `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be at least 3).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 3, and `n % i` is not equal to 0**
