Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, and it will always return `True` in such cases, which is incorrect according to the intended behavior. **

### Explanation:
- **Input:** The function accepts an integer `n` greater than 1.
- **Output:** 
  - Returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `n`).
  - Returns `False` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself).
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function incorrectly returns `True` because the initial check should return `False` for non-prime numbers.
  - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 1 and checks for divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which is an efficient way to determine primality.
- **Missing Logic:**
  - The function should return `False` immediately if `n` is less than or equal to 1 to correctly identify non-prime numbers.
