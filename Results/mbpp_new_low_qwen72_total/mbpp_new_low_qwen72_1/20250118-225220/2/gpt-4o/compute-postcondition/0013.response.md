To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
      if n % i == 0:
          return True
  ```

### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Variables**:
  - `n`: This variable remains constant throughout the loop.
  - `i`: This variable is updated in each iteration, starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- In each iteration, it checks if `n % i == 0`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i`, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning `True`.

### 4. Verify Relationships
- **Invariants**:
  - `n` remains constant.
  - `i` ranges from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- **Conditions**:
  - The loop will execute if `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= 2`, which is always true for `n > 1`.
  - The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2, but this case is not applicable as per the initial state.

### Final Output State
- **Final Values**:
  - `n` remains the same as the initial value.
  - `i` will have iterated from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- **Conditions**:
  - If the loop finds any `i` such that `n % i == 0`, it returns `True`.
  - If the loop completes without finding such an `i`, the function does not return `True` (implying `n` is a prime number).

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes executing is:
- If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True` at some point during the loop.
- If `n` is a prime number, the function does not return `True` and the loop completes.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as:
Output State: **If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function does not return `True`.**
