The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer greater than 1. The function has multiple return cases:

- **Case_1**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_4**: The program returns `True` if `n % 4` is 0. If `n % 4` is not 0, the program does not return a value.
- **Case_5**: The program returns `False`.

Since the cases are mutually exclusive (if one case is fulfilled, none of the others are), the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` greater than 1 and return `True` if any of the first four conditions are met, specifically if `n` is divisible by 4. If none of the conditions for returning `True` are met, the function returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 4 or if any of the first four conditions are met. If none of the conditions for returning `True` are met, it returns `False`.**
