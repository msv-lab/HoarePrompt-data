The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the expression `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration), making `i` 4. Additionally, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must still be greater than `i` for the loop condition to be true.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be 4.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be at least 4, meaning `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 4. If `n % i` is 0, the program returns True. Otherwise, `n % i` is not equal to 0 and the program does not return a value.**
