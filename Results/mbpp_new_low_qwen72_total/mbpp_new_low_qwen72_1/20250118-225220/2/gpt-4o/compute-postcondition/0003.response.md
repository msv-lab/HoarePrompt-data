To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the components involved in the loop:

- The loop variable `i` starts at 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than or equal to 2.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than 1, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2. Let's analyze this condition:

1. **Calculate `math.sqrt(n)`**: Since `n` is greater than 1, `math.sqrt(n)` will be a positive number greater than 1.
2. **Convert to integer**: `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `math.sqrt(n)`.
3. **Add 1**: `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will be at least 2 because `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 1 (since `n > 1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be 2.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be at least 2, which is guaranteed by the fact that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2**.
