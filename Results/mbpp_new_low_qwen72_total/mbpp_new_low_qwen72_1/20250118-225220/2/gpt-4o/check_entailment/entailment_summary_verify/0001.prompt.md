You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, and it will always return `True` in such cases, which is incorrect according to the intended behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number is any number that is not a prime number. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

- The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`, which aligns with the fact that 1 and negative numbers are not considered prime.
- For numbers greater than 1, the function checks if there exists any divisor between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If such a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is not prime.
- If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is prime.

The test cases provided in the assertions are consistent with this logic:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number.
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number.

All the test cases are correctly implemented, and the function logic matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
