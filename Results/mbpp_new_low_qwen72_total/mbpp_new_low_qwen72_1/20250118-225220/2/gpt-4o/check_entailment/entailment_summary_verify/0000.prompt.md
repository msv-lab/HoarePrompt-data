You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, and it will always return `True` in such cases, which is incorrect according to the intended behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The function correctly returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, and `False` otherwise. All provided test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the tested inputs. No edge cases or potential issues are identified that would make the function incorrect.
