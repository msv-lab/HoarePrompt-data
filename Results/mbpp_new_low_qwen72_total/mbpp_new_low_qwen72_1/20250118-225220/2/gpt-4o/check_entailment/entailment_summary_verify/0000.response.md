### Reasoning:

1. **Function Behavior for \( n \leq 1 \)**:
   - According to the function summary, `func_1` returns `True` for \( n \leq 1 \).
   - The function summary also mentions that this behavior is incorrect because 1 is not considered a prime number, but it should not be classified as a non-prime number in the context of identifying non-prime numbers. This is a discrepancy in the problem description and the function implementation.

2. **Function Behavior for \( n > 1 \)**:
   - The function correctly checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). This is an efficient method to determine if a number is non-prime.
   - If \( n \) is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, the function returns `True`, indicating that \( n \) is not a prime number.
   - If \( n \) is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, the function returns `False`, indicating that \( n \) is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases:
     - `assert func_1(1) == True`: Correct according to the function implementation but incorrect according to the problem description.
     - `assert func_1(2) == False`: Correct.
     - `assert func_1(10) == True`: Correct.
     - `assert func_1(35) == True`: Correct.
     - `assert func_1(37) == False`: Correct.
   - The test cases cover a range of inputs and all pass, which suggests that the function works as implemented.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function is correct and passes all provided test cases.
   - However, the function's behavior for \( n \leq 1 \) is inconsistent with the problem description, which does not specify how to handle these cases but implies they should not be considered non-prime.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is correct in its implementation for \( n > 1 \), but it has an issue with the handling of \( n \leq 1 \). According to the problem description, 1 should not be considered a non-prime number, but the function currently returns `True` for \( n = 1 \), which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**. The function is incorrect due to the handling of \( n \leq 1 \).
