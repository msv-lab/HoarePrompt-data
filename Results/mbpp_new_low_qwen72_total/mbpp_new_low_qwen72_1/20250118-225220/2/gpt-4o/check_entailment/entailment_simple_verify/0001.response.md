Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is intended to identify non-prime numbers. Let's break down the function and the annotations to verify its correctness:

1. **Initial Check for `n <= 1`:**
   - The function returns `True` for `n <= 1`. This is correct because 1 and all negative numbers are not prime numbers.
   - The annotation correctly states that after this check, `n` is an integer greater than 1.

2. **Loop to Check Divisors:**
   - The function iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This is an efficient way to check for divisors because if `n` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding divisor less than or equal to its square root.
   - If `n % i == 0` for any `i` in the range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - The annotation correctly describes that if a divisor is found, the function returns `True`.

3. **Return Statement After the Loop:**
   - If no divisors are found within the loop, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
   - The annotation correctly states that if no divisors are found, the function returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The test cases provided in the assertions are consistent with the expected behavior:
     - `func_1(1)` returns `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(2)` returns `False` (correct).
     - `func_1(10)` returns `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(35)` returns `True` (correct).
     - `func_1(37)` returns `False` (correct).

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description and the provided test cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
