You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Annotated Code: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function does not return `True`.
    return False
    #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The function correctly returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, and `False` otherwise. All provided test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the tested inputs. No edge cases or potential issues are identified that would make the function incorrect.
