You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Annotated Code: 
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function does not return `True`.
    return False
    #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number is any number that is not a prime number. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

- The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`, which aligns with the fact that 1 and negative numbers are not considered prime.
- For numbers greater than 1, the function checks if there exists any divisor between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If such a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is not prime.
- If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is prime.

The test cases provided in the assertions are consistent with this logic:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number.
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number.

All the test cases are correctly implemented, and the function logic matches the problem requirements.
