Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem statement, a non-prime number is any number that is not a prime number. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

- The function correctly returns `True` for `n <= 1`, which aligns with the fact that 1 and negative numbers are not considered prime.
- For numbers greater than 1, the function checks if there exists any divisor between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If such a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is not prime.
- If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is prime.

The test cases provided in the assertions are consistent with this logic:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` because 1 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because 2 is a prime number.
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` because 35 is not a prime number.
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` because 37 is a prime number.

All the test cases are correctly implemented, and the function logic matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
