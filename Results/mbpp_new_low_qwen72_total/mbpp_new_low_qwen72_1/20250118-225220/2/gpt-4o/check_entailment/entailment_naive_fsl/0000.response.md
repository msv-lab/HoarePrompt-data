Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the problem description. It returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime. For numbers greater than 1, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine if a number is non-prime. The function correctly returns `True` if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, and `False` otherwise. All provided test cases also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for the tested inputs. No edge cases or potential issues are identified that would make the function incorrect.
