Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. However, there is a logical inconsistency in the handling of numbers less than or equal to 1. The function returns `True` for these cases, which is technically correct because 1 and negative numbers are not considered prime. However, the execution summary mentions that this behavior is incorrect according to the intended behavior, which suggests that the function should only be defined for positive integers greater than 1.

Given the problem statement, the function should only be evaluated for valid inputs (i.e., integers greater than 1). Since the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers for valid inputs (as demonstrated by the test cases), and the problem description does not explicitly state how the function should handle invalid inputs, we can consider the function correct within the scope of valid inputs.

However, if the problem description or the intended behavior requires the function to handle all integer inputs correctly, including those less than or equal to 1, then the function is incorrect because it does not meet this requirement.

Based on the provided information and the assumption that the function should only be evaluated for valid inputs (integers greater than 1), the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
