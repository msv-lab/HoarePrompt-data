Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Annotated Program:
import math

assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
assert func_1(35) == True
assert func_1(37) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function does not return `True`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, and it will always return `True` in such cases, which is incorrect according to the intended behavior.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
