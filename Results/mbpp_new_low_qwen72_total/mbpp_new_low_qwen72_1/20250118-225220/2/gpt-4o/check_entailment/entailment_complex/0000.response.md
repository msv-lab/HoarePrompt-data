Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts with a check to see if `n` is less than or equal to 1. According to the problem statement, the function should only handle integers greater than 1. However, the function returns `True` for these cases, which is incorrect because the problem does not specify the expected behavior for `n <= 1`. This is a logical error that deviates from the intended behavior.

2. **Prime Number Check**: For `n > 1`, the function correctly uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This is also correct.

4. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided in the assert statements are consistent with the intended behavior of the function for valid inputs (integers greater than 1).

However, the initial check for `n <= 1` is incorrect and should be handled differently. Since the problem specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 1, the function should not return `True` for `n <= 1`. Instead, it should either raise an error or handle this case appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the function is incorrect due to the handling of `n <= 1`.

Correctness: **False**
