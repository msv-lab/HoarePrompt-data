Reasoning: 
The original assessment is mostly correct but contains a subtle issue that needs addressing. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Behavior for `n <= 1`**:
   - The function returns `True` for `n <= 1`. This is correct because 1 and any number less than 1 are not prime numbers.
   - However, the problem description specifically asks to identify non-prime numbers, and the function correctly identifies that 1 and negative numbers are non-prime.

2. **Function Behavior for `n > 1`**:
   - The function checks for divisors from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - If any divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
   - If no divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(1) == True`: Correct, 1 is not a prime number.
   - `func_1(2) == False`: Correct, 2 is a prime number.
   - `func_1(10) == True`: Correct, 10 is not a prime number.
   - `func_1(35) == True`: Correct, 35 is not a prime number.
   - `func_1(37) == False`: Correct, 37 is a prime number.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number and `False` if `n` is a prime number.
   - The function handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 by returning `True`, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
