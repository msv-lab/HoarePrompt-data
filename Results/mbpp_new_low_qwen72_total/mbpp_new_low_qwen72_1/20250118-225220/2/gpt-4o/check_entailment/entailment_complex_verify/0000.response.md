### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers.
   - The function returns `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if the number is prime.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 by returning `True`. This is because numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
   - For numbers greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds such a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is non-prime.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are:
     - `func_1(1) == True`: Correct, as 1 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(2) == False`: Correct, as 2 is a prime number.
     - `func_1(10) == True`: Correct, as 10 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(35) == True`: Correct, as 35 is not a prime number.
     - `func_1(37) == False`: Correct, as 37 is a prime number.
   - All test cases pass, which suggests that the function is working as expected for these inputs.

4. **Annotated Code Review:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points:
     - Before the function call: `n` is an integer.
     - After the `if` block: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
     - After the `for` loop: If `n` is not a prime number, the function returns `True`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`.
   - The overall description of the function is accurate: it returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 1.
   - The function uses an efficient method (checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`) to determine if a number is non-prime.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the problem description and the provided test cases. There are no identified issues that would make the function incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
