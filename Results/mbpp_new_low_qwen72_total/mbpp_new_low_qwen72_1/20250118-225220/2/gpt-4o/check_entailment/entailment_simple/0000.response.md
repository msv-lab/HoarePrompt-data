Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. It should return `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if the number is prime.
2. The initial condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `True`, which is correct because 1 and any number less than 1 are not considered prime.
3. The for loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is an efficient way to check for factors of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number, and the function correctly returns `True`.
4. If the for loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The provided assertions test the function with various inputs:
- `func_1(1)` should return `True` (correct).
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` (correct).
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` (correct).
- `func_1(35)` should return `True` (correct).
- `func_1(37)` should return `False` (correct).

All the assertions pass, and the function logic is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
