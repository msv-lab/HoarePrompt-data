The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, and it will always return `True` in such cases, which is incorrect according to the intended behavior.
