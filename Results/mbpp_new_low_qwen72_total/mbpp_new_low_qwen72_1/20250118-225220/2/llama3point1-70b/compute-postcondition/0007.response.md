The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, and the expression `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. To determine the next state, we need to consider how these variables change or are used in the loop condition.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than 2.
- `n % i` is not equal to 0 (this indicates that `n` is not divisible by `i`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` must still be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

Given that `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. The condition `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than 3, and `n % i` is not equal to 0**
