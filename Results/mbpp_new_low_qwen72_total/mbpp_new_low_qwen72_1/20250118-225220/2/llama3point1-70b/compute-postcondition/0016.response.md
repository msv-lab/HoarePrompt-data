Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks if `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). It returns `True` if `n` is composite and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is 1, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which is a bug since 1 is neither prime nor composite. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is composite or prime, respectively. **
