The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, along with the expression `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The loop condition depends on `i` being less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than 3.
- `n % i` is not equal to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 4) for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than 4, and `n % i` is not equal to 0.**
