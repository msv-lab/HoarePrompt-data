To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `n` is not equal to 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Definition**: The loop iterates over the range `range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)`. This means the loop will start with `i = 2` and continue as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element. This means that the upper bound of the range, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, must be greater than the lower bound, which is 2.

3. **Mathematical Condition**:
   - The condition for the range to contain at least one element is:
     \[
     2 < int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying this inequality:
     \[
     1 < int(math.sqrt(n))
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     math.sqrt(n) > 1
     \]
   - Squaring both sides:
     \[
     n > 1
     \]

4. **Initial State**:
   - Given that `n` is an integer greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 1, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will be at least 2, ensuring that the range contains at least one element (i.e., 2).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be an integer greater than 1.
- `i` must start at 2.
- `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` must be greater than 2, which is guaranteed by `n > 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is greater than 2**
