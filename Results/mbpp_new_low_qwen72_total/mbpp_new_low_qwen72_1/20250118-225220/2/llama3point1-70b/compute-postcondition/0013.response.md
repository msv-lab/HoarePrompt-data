To determine the final output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to follow the steps outlined and analyze the loop's behavior in detail.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop checks if `n` is divisible by any integer `i` within the range `[2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1]`. If `n % i == 0` for any `i`, the function returns `True`.

### Tracking Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Changing Variables**: `i` increments from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- If `n % i == 0` for any `i` in this range, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning `True`.

### Verify Relationships
- If `n` is a prime number, the loop will not find any `i` such that `n % i == 0`, and the function will not return `True`.
- If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will find at least one `i` such that `n % i == 0`, and the function will return `True`.

### Final Output State
- **Variables**:
  - `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
  - `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` if the loop completes without finding a divisor.
- **Conditions**:
  - If the loop finds a divisor, the function returns `True`.
  - If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function does not return anything explicitly, but implicitly the function would return `None` (if it were a function).

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes executing is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, otherwise it returns `None`.**
