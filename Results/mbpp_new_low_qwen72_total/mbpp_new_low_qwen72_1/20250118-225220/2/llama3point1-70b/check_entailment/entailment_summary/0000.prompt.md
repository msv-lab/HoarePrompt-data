Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks if `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). It returns `True` if `n` is composite and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is 1, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which is a bug since 1 is neither prime nor composite. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is composite or prime, respectively.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
