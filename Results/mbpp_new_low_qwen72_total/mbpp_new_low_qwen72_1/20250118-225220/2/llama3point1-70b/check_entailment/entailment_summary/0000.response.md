Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers (composite numbers). However, there is a fundamental issue with the function's handling of the number 1. According to the standard definition, 1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number. Therefore, the function should return `False` for `n = 1` to indicate that 1 is not a composite number. 

Additionally, the function correctly identifies composite numbers by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is a composite number, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Given the above points, the function is incorrect due to its handling of `n = 1`.

Correctness: **False**
