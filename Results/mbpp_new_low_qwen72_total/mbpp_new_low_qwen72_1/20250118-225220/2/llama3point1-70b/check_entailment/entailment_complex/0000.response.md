Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime (composite) numbers. However, there is a logical error in the function when it handles the case where `n` is 1. According to the definition of prime and composite numbers:
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not prime (i.e., it has divisors other than 1 and itself).
- The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.

The function incorrectly returns `True` for `n == 1`, which is incorrect because 1 is not a composite number. This is a bug in the function.

Additionally, the function correctly identifies composite numbers for `n > 1` by checking if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If it finds such a divisor, it returns `True`. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Given the bug for the case `n == 1`, the function is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
