Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number (composite number) is defined as a number that has divisors other than 1 and itself. The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime number, which is a special case. For other numbers, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any number divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is identified as a non-prime, and the function returns `True`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is prime. However, the function's logic is inverted compared to the typical definition of prime and non-prime numbers. It returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the function is logically correct based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
