Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

# Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
