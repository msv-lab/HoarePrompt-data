Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the function's purpose and its behavior but overlooks a critical detail regarding the special case of the number 1. According to the problem description, the function should identify non-prime numbers. Mathematically, 1 is neither prime nor composite, but it is often treated as a special case in algorithms that deal with prime and composite numbers. The function `func_1` returns `True` for `n = 1`, which is technically incorrect because 1 is not a composite number. This is a deviation from the standard mathematical definition of composite numbers, which are integers greater than 1 that have more than two positive divisors.

However, the problem description does not explicitly specify how the function should handle the number 1. If we assume that the problem description implicitly allows treating 1 as a non-prime number (which is a common approach in many contexts), then the function's behavior is consistent with the problem statement. In this case, the function correctly identifies all composite numbers (non-prime numbers greater than 1) and returns `True` for them, while it returns `False` for prime numbers, which is the intended behavior.

Given this context, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function is logically correct based on the given problem description, assuming that treating 1 as a non-prime number is acceptable.

Final: **True**
