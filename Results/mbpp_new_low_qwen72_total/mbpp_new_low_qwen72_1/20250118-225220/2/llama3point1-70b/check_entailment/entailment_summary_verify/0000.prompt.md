You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks if `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). It returns `True` if `n` is composite and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is 1, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which is a bug since 1 is neither prime nor composite. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is composite or prime, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers for all potential cases. It checks if the number is 1, which is not a prime number, and returns `True`. For other numbers, it iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This logic correctly handles all edge cases and inputs.
