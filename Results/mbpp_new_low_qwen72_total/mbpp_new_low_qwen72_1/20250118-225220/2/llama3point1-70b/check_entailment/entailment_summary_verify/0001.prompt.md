You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks if `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). It returns `True` if `n` is composite and `False` if `n` is a prime number. If `n` is 1, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which is a bug since 1 is neither prime nor composite. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on whether `n` is composite or prime, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number (composite number) is defined as a number that has divisors other than 1 and itself. The function correctly identifies 1 as a non-prime number, which is a special case. For other numbers, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any number divides `n` without a remainder, `n` is identified as a non-prime, and the function returns `True`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is prime. However, the function's logic is inverted compared to the typical definition of prime and non-prime numbers. It returns `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the function is logically correct based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
