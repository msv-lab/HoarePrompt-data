### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers. A non-prime number is a composite number or the number 1.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and checks if `n` is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number).
- It returns `True` if `n` is composite and `False` if `n` is a prime number.
- If `n` is 1, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which is a bug since 1 is neither prime nor composite.

#### Code Analysis:
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

1. **Case when \( n = 1 \):**
   - The function returns `True`.
   - According to the problem description, 1 is neither prime nor composite. Therefore, returning `True` is incorrect.

2. **Case when \( n > 1 \):**
   - The function iterates from 2 to the square root of \( n \) (inclusive).
   - If \( n \) is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `True`, indicating that \( n \) is composite.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that \( n \) is prime.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers for all potential cases.
- However, the function incorrectly handles the case when \( n = 1 \).

#### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` is incorrect because it returns `True` for \( n = 1 \), which is not a valid classification according to the problem description.
- The function should return `False` for \( n = 1 \) to be consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
