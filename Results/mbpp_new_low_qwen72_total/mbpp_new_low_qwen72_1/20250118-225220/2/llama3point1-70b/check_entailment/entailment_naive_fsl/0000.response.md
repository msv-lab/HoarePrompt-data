Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers for all potential cases. It checks if the number is 1, which is not a prime number, and returns `True`. For other numbers, it iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. This logic correctly handles all edge cases and inputs.
