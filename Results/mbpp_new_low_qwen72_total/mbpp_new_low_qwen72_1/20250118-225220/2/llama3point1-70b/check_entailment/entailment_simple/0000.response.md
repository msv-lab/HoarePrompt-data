Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Initial Check**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input. The initial check `if (n == 1):` correctly identifies that 1 is not a prime number and returns `True`. This is correct because 1 is indeed not a prime number.

2. **Loop to Check Divisibility**: The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This is an efficient way to check for divisibility because if `n` is not a prime, it must have a divisor less than or equal to its square root. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Return Statement After Loop**: If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

However, there is a logical inconsistency in the comments and the function's behavior:
- The comment after the loop states that the function should return `True` if `n` is not a prime number, which is correct.
- But the function actually returns `False` after the loop, which means it correctly identifies prime numbers by returning `False`.

Given the problem statement and the function's behavior, the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers by returning `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
