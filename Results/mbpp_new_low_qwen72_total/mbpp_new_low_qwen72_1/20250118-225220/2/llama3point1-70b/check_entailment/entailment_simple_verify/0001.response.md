Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` is designed to identify non-prime numbers. According to the problem description, a non-prime number is any number that is not a prime number. The function correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1 by returning `True`, as 1 is not considered a prime number.

For other values of `n`, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors. If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a non-prime number. If no divisors are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The annotations in the code help to validate the program's behavior:
- Before the function call: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- After the `if (n == 1)` block: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1.
- After the `for` loop: If a divisor is found, the function returns `True`. If no divisor is found, the function returns `False`.

The original assessment correctly states that the function's logic is inverted compared to the typical definition of prime and non-prime numbers. However, this inversion is consistent with the problem statement, which requires the function to return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers.

Given that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
