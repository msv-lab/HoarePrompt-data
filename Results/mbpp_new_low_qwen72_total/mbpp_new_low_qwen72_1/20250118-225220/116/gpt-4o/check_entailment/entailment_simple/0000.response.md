Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The `cmath.polar` function returns a tuple where the first element is the magnitude (or absolute value) of the complex number, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians).

However, the test cases provided in the assertions only test the function with real numbers (1, 4, 5), which are a subset of complex numbers. When a real number is passed to `complex()`, it is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part of 0. For these specific inputs, the polar coordinates will always have a magnitude equal to the absolute value of the input and a phase angle of 0.0 radians, which is consistent with the expected results in the assertions.

While the function works correctly for the given test cases, it would be more comprehensive to test it with actual complex numbers (e.g., `1+1j`, `2-3j`) to ensure it handles the imaginary part correctly. However, based on the provided test cases and the problem description, the function is correct for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
