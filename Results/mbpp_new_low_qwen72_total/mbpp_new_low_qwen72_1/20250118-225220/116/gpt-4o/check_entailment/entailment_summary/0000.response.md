Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `cmath.polar` method to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates. The `cmath.polar` function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle of the complex number. The test cases provided in the assertions are for real numbers (1, 4, 5), which are a subset of complex numbers with an imaginary part of 0. For these inputs, the magnitude is the absolute value of the number, and the phase angle is 0.0 radians, which matches the expected output.

However, the function is designed to handle any valid complex number, not just real numbers. The execution summary confirms that the function works correctly for all valid complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the correctness of the implementation, the function `func_1` is correct.

Correctness: **True**
