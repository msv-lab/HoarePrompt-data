Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a number `num` and converts it to a complex number using `complex(num)`. It then uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert this complex number to its polar form, which returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle. The test cases provided use real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which when converted to complex numbers have no imaginary part. The expected results for these real numbers are tuples with the magnitude equal to the number itself and the phase angle equal to 0.0, which is what `cmath.polar` will return for these inputs. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
