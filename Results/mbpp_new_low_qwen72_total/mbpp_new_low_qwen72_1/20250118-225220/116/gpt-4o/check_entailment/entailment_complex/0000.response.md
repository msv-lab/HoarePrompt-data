Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is designed to convert a complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function.
- The `assert` statements test the function with real numbers (1, 4, 5). These numbers are treated as complex numbers with an imaginary part of 0. For these inputs, the magnitude should be the number itself, and the phase angle should be 0.0 radians, which is correct.
- The function correctly uses `complex(num)` to ensure that the input is treated as a complex number, even if it is provided as a real number.
- The comment indicates that the function returns a tuple where the first element is the magnitude and the second element is the phase angle, which aligns with the behavior of `cmath.polar`.
- The function is expected to handle all valid complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and the provided implementation meets this requirement.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
