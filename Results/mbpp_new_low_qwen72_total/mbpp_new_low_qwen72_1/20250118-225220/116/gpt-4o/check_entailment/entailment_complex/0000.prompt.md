Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

# Annotated Program:
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple representing the polar coordinates of the complex number `num`. The first element of the tuple is the magnitude (or absolute value) of `num`, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians) of `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple representing its polar coordinates. The first element of the tuple is the magnitude (or absolute value) of `num`, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The function handles all valid complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts. If `num` is zero (0+0j), the magnitude will be 0, and the phase angle will be 0.0 radians.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
