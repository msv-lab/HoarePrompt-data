Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to convert a given number to its polar coordinates. The function uses `cmath.polar` to achieve this, which correctly returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle of the complex number. The test cases provided are for real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which are valid inputs for the `complex` constructor. When a real number is passed to `complex`, it is treated as a complex number with a zero imaginary part. For such inputs, the magnitude is the number itself, and the phase angle is 0.0 radians. The `cmath.polar` function correctly computes these values, and the test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected.

The annotations also correctly describe the state of the program and the function's behavior. They accurately state that the function returns a tuple with the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number, and they handle the case where the input is zero.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` works correctly for the provided test cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
