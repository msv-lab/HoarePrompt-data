Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` converts a real number to a complex number and then to polar coordinates using `cmath.polar`. However, the function only handles real numbers, which are a subset of complex numbers. The problem description requires converting complex numbers to polar coordinates, but the function does not handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.

For example, if we pass a complex number like `1 + 1j` to `func_1`, the function will still work, but the test cases provided do not cover this scenario. Here's a case where the function fails:

```python
assert func_1(1 + 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
```

The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, and thus the program is incorrect.
