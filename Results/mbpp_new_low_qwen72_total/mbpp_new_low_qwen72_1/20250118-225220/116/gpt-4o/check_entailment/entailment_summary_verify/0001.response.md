Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts a given number to a complex number and then uses `cmath.polar` to return its polar coordinates. The test cases provided are valid and cover the scenario where the input is a real number (i.e., a complex number with an imaginary part of 0). For such inputs, the expected output is a tuple where the magnitude is the absolute value of the number and the phase angle is 0.0 radians, which is exactly what the function `func_1` returns.

However, the function summary also mentions that the function should handle all valid complex numbers, including those with non-zero imaginary parts. While the original assessment does not explicitly test these cases, the function `func_1` is still correct because `cmath.polar` is designed to handle any complex number, and the function `func_1` correctly passes the input to `cmath.polar`.

To further validate the correctness, consider additional test cases with complex numbers having non-zero imaginary parts:

```python
assert func_1(1 + 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
assert func_1(-1 - 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, -2.356194490192345)
```

These test cases would also pass, confirming that `func_1` works as expected for a broader range of inputs.

Given that the function handles both real and complex numbers correctly, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
