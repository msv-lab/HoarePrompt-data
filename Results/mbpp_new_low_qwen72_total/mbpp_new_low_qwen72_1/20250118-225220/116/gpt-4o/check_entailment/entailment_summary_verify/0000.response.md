### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires writing a Python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. This means the function should handle any valid complex number, including those with both real and imaginary parts.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `num`.
   - It converts `num` to a complex number using `complex(num)`.
   - It then uses `cmath.polar` to convert the complex number to polar coordinates, returning a tuple `(magnitude, phase)`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle any valid complex number.
   - The summary states that it returns the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number.
   - It specifically mentions handling all valid complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases only check for real numbers (e.g., `1`, `4`, `5`).
   - These test cases do not cover complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function only handles real numbers and does not handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.
   - It provides an example where `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`.

6. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the function with the example provided in the original assessment:
     ```python
     assert func_1(1 + 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
     ```
   - Running this test case:
     ```python
     import cmath

     def func_1(num):
         return cmath.polar(complex(num))

     print(func_1(1 + 1j))  # Output: (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
     ```
   - The function correctly returns the expected polar coordinates for the complex number `1 + 1j`.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` correctly handles both real and complex numbers.
- The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the function only handles real numbers and fails to handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.
- The function passes the additional test case provided in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
