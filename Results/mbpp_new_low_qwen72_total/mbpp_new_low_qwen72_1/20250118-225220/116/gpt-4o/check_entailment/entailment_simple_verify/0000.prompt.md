You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Annotated Code: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple representing the polar coordinates of the complex number `num`. The first element of the tuple is the magnitude (or absolute value) of `num`, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians) of `num`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` converts a real number to a complex number and then to polar coordinates using `cmath.polar`. However, the function only handles real numbers, which are a subset of complex numbers. The problem description requires converting complex numbers to polar coordinates, but the function does not handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.

For example, if we pass a complex number like `1 + 1j` to `func_1`, the function will still work, but the test cases provided do not cover this scenario. Here's a case where the function fails:

```python
assert func_1(1 + 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
```

The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, and thus the program is incorrect.
