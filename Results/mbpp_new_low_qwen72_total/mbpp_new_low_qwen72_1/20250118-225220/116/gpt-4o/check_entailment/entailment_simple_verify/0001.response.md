Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts a given number to a complex number using `complex(num)` and then uses `cmath.polar` to convert this complex number to its polar form, returning a tuple of the magnitude and the phase angle. The test cases provided in the code are all for real numbers (1, 4, and 5). For real numbers, the imaginary part is 0, so the magnitude is the absolute value of the number, and the phase angle is 0.0 radians. The `cmath.polar` function behaves as expected for these inputs, returning the correct magnitude and phase angle. Therefore, the function works correctly for the given test cases.

However, the annotated code mentions that "num is a complex number" right before the function call, but the test cases only use real numbers. This discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the function for the given test cases, but it might suggest that the function should be tested with actual complex numbers to ensure broader correctness.

Given the provided test cases and the behavior of the function, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts real numbers to their polar coordinates as expected.

Final: **True**
