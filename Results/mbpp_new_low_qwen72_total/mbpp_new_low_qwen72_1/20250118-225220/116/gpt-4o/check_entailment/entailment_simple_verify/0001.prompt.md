You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

- Program: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))



- Annotated Code: 
import cmath

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a complex number.
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
    #The program returns a tuple representing the polar coordinates of the complex number `num`. The first element of the tuple is the magnitude (or absolute value) of `num`, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians) of `num`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes a number `num` and converts it to a complex number using `complex(num)`. It then uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert this complex number to its polar form, which returns a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle. The test cases provided use real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which when converted to complex numbers have no imaginary part. The expected results for these real numbers are tuples with the magnitude equal to the number itself and the phase angle equal to 0.0, which is what `cmath.polar` will return for these inputs. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
