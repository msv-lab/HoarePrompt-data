Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to handle real numbers, which are a subset of complex numbers. However, the function itself is not incorrect in its implementation for the specific cases provided. The function `cmath.polar` correctly converts any complex number (including those with both real and imaginary parts) to its polar coordinates. 

The issue lies in the test cases, which only cover real numbers. The function will indeed work correctly for complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts, as demonstrated by the following test case:

```python
assert func_1(1 + 1j) == (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
```

This test case would pass, confirming that the function can handle general complex numbers. Therefore, the function itself is correct, but the test cases are insufficient to fully validate its correctness.

Final: **True** 

The function is correct, but the test cases should be expanded to include complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts to ensure comprehensive validation.
