The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns a tuple representing its polar coordinates. The first element of the tuple is the magnitude (or absolute value) of `num`, and the second element is the phase angle (in radians) of `num`. The function handles all valid complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts. If `num` is zero (0+0j), the magnitude will be 0, and the phase angle will be 0.0 radians.
