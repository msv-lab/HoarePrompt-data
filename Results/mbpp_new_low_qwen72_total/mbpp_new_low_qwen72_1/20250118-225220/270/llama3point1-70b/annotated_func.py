#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers contained in the tuples within the list 'tuples'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing integers. It returns the sum of all integers contained in the tuples within the list `tuples`. If the list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0. If any of the tuples within the list are empty, those tuples contribute 0 to the final sum. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are integers and does not handle other data types.
