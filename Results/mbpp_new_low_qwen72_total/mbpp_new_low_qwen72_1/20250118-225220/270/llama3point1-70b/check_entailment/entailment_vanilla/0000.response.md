Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to compute the cumulative sum of all values in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple. This intermediate sum is then added to the overall cumulative sum. 

Given the problem description, the function correctly sums up all the values in the tuples. The use of a generator expression ensures that the function is memory efficient, as it does not create an intermediate list of sums.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
