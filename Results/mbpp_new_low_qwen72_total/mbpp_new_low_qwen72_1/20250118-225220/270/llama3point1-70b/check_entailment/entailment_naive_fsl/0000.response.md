Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and returns the cumulative sum of all the values present in these tuples. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each tuple in the list, summing up the elements of each tuple, and then sums these intermediate results to get the final cumulative sum. This approach correctly handles the requirement to sum all values across all tuples in the list, and there are no obvious edge cases or issues that would cause this function to fail in its intended purpose. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential inputs.
