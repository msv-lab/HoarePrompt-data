Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cumulative sum of all the integers present in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list `tuples`, and for each tuple, it calculates the sum of its elements. These individual sums are then summed up to produce the final result.

Given the problem description and the state of the program, the function correctly computes the cumulative sum of all integers in the tuples. The comment within the function also accurately describes what the function does.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
