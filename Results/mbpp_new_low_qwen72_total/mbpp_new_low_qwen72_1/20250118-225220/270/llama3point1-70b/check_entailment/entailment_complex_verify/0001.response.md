Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all values in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple. These intermediate sums are then aggregated into a single cumulative sum.

Based on the annotated code:
1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing integers.
2. The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples` and computes the sum of the integers in each tuple.
3. The outer `sum` function aggregates these intermediate sums into a single cumulative sum.
4. If the list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0, as there are no tuples to sum.
5. If any of the tuples within the list are empty, they contribute 0 to the final sum.
6. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are integers and does not handle other data types, which aligns with the problem description that specifies the input as a list of tuples containing integers.

The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose and behavior of the function. The use of a generator expression ensures memory efficiency, and the function accurately computes the cumulative sum as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
