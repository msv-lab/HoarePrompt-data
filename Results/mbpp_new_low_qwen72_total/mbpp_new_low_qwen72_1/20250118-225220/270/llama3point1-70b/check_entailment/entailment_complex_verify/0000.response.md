Reasoning: The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers contained in a list of tuples. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function uses a generator expression to iterate over each tuple in the list, summing the elements of each tuple, and then summing these intermediate results to produce the final cumulative sum. This approach is efficient and straightforward. The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling both non-empty and empty tuples appropriately. The function also correctly returns 0 if the input list is empty. Given the problem description and the constraints (assuming valid inputs), the function meets the requirements without any apparent issues or edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Final: **True**
