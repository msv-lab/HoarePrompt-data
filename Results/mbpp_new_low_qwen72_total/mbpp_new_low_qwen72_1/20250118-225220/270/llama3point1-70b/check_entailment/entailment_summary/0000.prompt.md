Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

# Program:
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing integers. It returns the sum of all integers contained in the tuples within the list `tuples`. If the list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0. If any of the tuples within the list are empty, those tuples contribute 0 to the final sum. The function assumes that all elements within the tuples are integers and does not handle other data types.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
