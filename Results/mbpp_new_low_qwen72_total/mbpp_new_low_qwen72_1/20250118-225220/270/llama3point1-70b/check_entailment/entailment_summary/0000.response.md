Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` aims to calculate the cumulative sum of all integers present in a list of tuples. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum up all the integers. This approach is efficient and concise. The function also handles edge cases correctly:
- If the list `tuples` is empty, the function returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
- If any of the tuples within the list are empty, they contribute 0 to the final sum, which is also correct.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as intended, summing up all integers in the tuples and handling empty lists and tuples appropriately. There are no mentioned issues or unexpected behaviors.

Therefore, the function appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
