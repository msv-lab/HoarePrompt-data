Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all integers present in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple, then sums these results to get the final cumulative sum. This approach is efficient and concise.

- The function correctly handles an empty list of tuples by returning 0, as `sum([])` returns 0.
- It also correctly handles empty tuples within the list by contributing 0 to the final sum, as `sum(())` returns 0.
- The function assumes that all elements in the tuples are integers, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the problem statement and the provided comments, the function appears to meet all the specified requirements and behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
