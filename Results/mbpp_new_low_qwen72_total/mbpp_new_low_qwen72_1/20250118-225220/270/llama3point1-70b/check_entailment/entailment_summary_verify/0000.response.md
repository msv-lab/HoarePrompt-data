Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly computes the cumulative sum of all values present in the given list of tuples. Let's break down the function and the provided function summary to validate this claim:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `tuples` as input.
   - It uses a generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` to iterate over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`.
   - For each tuple `t`, `sum(t)` computes the sum of the integers in that tuple.
   - The outer `sum` function then sums up these intermediate results to produce the final cumulative sum.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If `tuples` is an empty list, the generator expression will not produce any values, and `sum` will return 0, which is the expected behavior.
   - **Empty Tuples**: If any tuple within the list is empty, `sum(t)` will return 0 for that tuple, and it will not affect the final sum.
   - **Non-integer Elements**: The function summary explicitly states that the function assumes all elements within the tuples are integers. Therefore, the function is not designed to handle other data types, and this assumption is reasonable given the problem description.

3. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, including the handling of empty lists and empty tuples.
   - The summary also mentions that the function assumes all elements are integers, which aligns with the problem description and the implementation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality.
   - The original assessment accurately identifies that the function handles all potential inputs correctly, including edge cases like empty lists and empty tuples.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function `func_1` is correct.

Final: **True**
