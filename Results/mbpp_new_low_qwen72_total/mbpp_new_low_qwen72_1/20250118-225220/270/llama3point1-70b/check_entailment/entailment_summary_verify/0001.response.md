Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all values in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple. This intermediate sum is then added to the overall cumulative sum. 

The function summary confirms that:
- The function takes a list of tuples as input.
- Each tuple contains integers.
- The function returns the sum of all integers in the tuples.
- If the list is empty, the function returns 0.
- If any tuple within the list is empty, it contributes 0 to the final sum.

Given this information, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. The use of a generator expression is efficient and avoids creating unnecessary intermediate lists, which is beneficial for large inputs. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and empty tuples as described in the function summary.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.

Final: **True**
