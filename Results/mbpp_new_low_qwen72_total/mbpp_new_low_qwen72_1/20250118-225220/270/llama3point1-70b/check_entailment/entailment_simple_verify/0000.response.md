Reasoning: 

The provided function `func_1` is designed to compute the cumulative sum of all the values present in a list of tuples. The function uses a nested generator expression to achieve this:

1. The outer `sum` function accumulates the total sum.
2. The inner `sum(t) for t in tuples` computes the sum of elements in each individual tuple `t`.

This approach ensures that every integer in each tuple is included in the final sum. The annotations confirm that the input `tuples` is a list of tuples containing integers, and the function correctly processes this input to produce the desired output.

The original assessment states that the function is correct because:
- It uses a generator expression to efficiently sum the elements.
- It correctly handles the requirement to sum all values across all tuples.
- There are no obvious edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements. There are no evident issues or edge cases that the function fails to handle correctly.

Final: **True**
