You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the cumulative sum of all the values that are present in the given tuple list.

- Program: 
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum((sum(t) for t in tuples))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return sum(sum(t) for t in tuples)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers contained in the tuples within the list 'tuples'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to compute the cumulative sum of all values in a list of tuples. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each tuple in the list and sum the elements of each tuple. This intermediate sum is then added to the overall cumulative sum. 

Given the problem description, the function correctly sums up all the values in the tuples. The use of a generator expression ensures that the function is memory efficient, as it does not create an intermediate list of sums.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

End of Original Assessment
