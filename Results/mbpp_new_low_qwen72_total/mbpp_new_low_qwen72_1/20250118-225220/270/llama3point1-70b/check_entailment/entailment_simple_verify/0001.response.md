Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the cumulative sum of all values present in the given list of tuples. The generator expression `(sum(t) for t in tuples)` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples`, calculates the sum of the elements in each tuple, and then these individual sums are summed up by the outer `sum` function. This approach is both efficient and concise, and it matches the problem description perfectly.

The annotated code confirms that:
1. `tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains integers.
2. The function returns the sum of all integers contained in the tuples within the list `tuples`.

These points align with the intended functionality and the original assessment. Therefore, there is no reason to overturn the original assessment.

Final: **True**
