You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

- Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return round(wind_chill_index)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a real number representing temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) and returns the rounded value of this calculation. The function ensures that the wind chill index is always returned as an integer. If `velocity` is zero, the function simplifies to returning a value based solely on the temperature, as the wind speed component of the formula becomes negligible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the rounding requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the wind chill index should be rounded to the next integer, but the `round()` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer. For example, `func_1(40, 20)` returns 19, which is correct, but if the calculated wind chill index were 18.5, `round(18.5)` would return 18 instead of 19. To meet the requirement, the function should use `math.ceil()` to always round up to the next integer.
