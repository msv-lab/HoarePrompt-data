Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly implements the wind chill index formula as described. The formula used is:

\[ \text{Wind Chill Index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

This formula is applied correctly within the function. The function also rounds the result to the nearest integer, which is appropriate for the problem's requirement to round to the next integer. However, the rounding method used (`round()`) rounds to the nearest integer, not necessarily to the next integer. For example, `round(5.2)` will round to 5, not 6. To ensure rounding to the next integer, the function should use `math.ceil()` instead of `round()`.

Additionally, the test cases provided seem to match the expected behavior of the function, but they do not explicitly test edge cases such as very low temperatures or zero velocity.

Given the above points, the function is mostly correct, but it does not strictly adhere to the requirement of rounding to the next integer.

Correctness: **False**
