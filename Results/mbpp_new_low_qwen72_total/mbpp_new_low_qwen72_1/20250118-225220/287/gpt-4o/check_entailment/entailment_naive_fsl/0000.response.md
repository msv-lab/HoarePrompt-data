Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the rounding requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the wind chill index should be rounded to the next integer, but the `round()` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer. For example, `func_1(40, 20)` returns 19, which is correct, but if the calculated wind chill index were 18.5, `round(18.5)` would return 18 instead of 19. To meet the requirement, the function should use `math.ceil()` to always round up to the next integer.
