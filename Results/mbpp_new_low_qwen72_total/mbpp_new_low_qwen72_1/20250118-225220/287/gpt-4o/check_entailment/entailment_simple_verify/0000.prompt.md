You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

- Program: 
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return round(wind_chill_index)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

#State of the program right berfore the function call: velocity is a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h, and temperature is a real number representing temperature in Celsius.
def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = (13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 +
    0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16)
    return round(wind_chill_index)
    #The program returns the rounded value of `wind_chill_index`, which is calculated as \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \), where `velocity` is a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h, and `temperature` is a real number representing temperature in Celsius.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the rounding requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the wind chill index should be rounded to the next integer, but the `round()` function in Python rounds to the nearest integer. For example, `func_1(40, 20)` returns 19, which is correct, but if the calculated wind chill index were 18.5, `round(18.5)` would return 18 instead of 19. To meet the requirement, the function should use `math.ceil()` to always round up to the next integer.
