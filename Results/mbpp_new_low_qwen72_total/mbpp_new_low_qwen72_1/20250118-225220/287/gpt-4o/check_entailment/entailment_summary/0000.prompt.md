Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to calculate the wind chill index rounded to the next integer given the wind velocity in km/h and a temperature in celsius.

# Program:
assert func_1(120, 35) == 40
assert func_1(40, 20) == 19
assert func_1(10, 8) == 6

def func_1(velocity, temperature):
    wind_chill_index = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * velocity ** 0.16 + 0.3965 * temperature * velocity ** 0.16
    return round(wind_chill_index)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a real number representing temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) and returns the rounded value of this calculation. The function ensures that the wind chill index is always returned as an integer. If `velocity` is zero, the function simplifies to returning a value based solely on the temperature, as the wind speed component of the formula becomes negligible.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
