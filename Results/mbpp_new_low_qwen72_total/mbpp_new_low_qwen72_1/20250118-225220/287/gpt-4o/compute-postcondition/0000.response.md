The code calculates the `wind_chill_index` using the formula provided. The values of `velocity` and `temperature` are used in the calculation, but their values remain unchanged. The new variable `wind_chill_index` is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{wind\_chill\_index} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**velocity is a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h, temperature is a real number representing temperature in Celsius, wind_chill_index is \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \)**
