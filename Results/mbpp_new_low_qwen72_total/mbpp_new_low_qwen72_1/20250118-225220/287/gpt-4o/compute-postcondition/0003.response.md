Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a real number representing temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) and returns the rounded value of this calculation. The function ensures that the wind chill index is always returned as an integer. If `velocity` is zero, the function simplifies to returning a value based solely on the temperature, as the wind speed component of the formula becomes negligible. **

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Zero Velocity**: If `velocity` is zero, the wind chill index calculation simplifies to \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} \), effectively reducing the influence of wind speed.
- **Negative Temperature**: The function handles negative temperatures correctly, as the formula accounts for both positive and negative values of `temperature`.
- **Very High Velocity**: For very high values of `velocity`, the term \( \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) will still be a finite number, ensuring that the calculation remains valid.
- **Non-integer Inputs**: The function can handle floating-point inputs for both `velocity` and `temperature`, and the result is always rounded to the nearest integer before being returned.
