The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `velocity` (a non-negative real number representing wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (a real number representing temperature in Celsius). It calculates the wind chill index using the formula \( 13.12 + 0.6215 \times \text{temperature} - 11.37 \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times \text{temperature} \times \text{velocity}^{0.16} \) and returns the rounded value of this calculation. The function ensures that the wind chill index is always returned as an integer. If `velocity` is zero, the function simplifies to returning a value based solely on the temperature, as the wind speed component of the formula becomes negligible.
