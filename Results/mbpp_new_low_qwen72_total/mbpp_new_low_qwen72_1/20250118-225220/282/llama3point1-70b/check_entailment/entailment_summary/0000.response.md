Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to replace spaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation has a logical flaw. It first replaces all spaces with underscores, then it replaces all underscores (including those that were originally spaces) with spaces, and finally, it replaces all spaces (which now include the original underscores) back to underscores. This means that any underscores that were originally in the string will be temporarily converted to spaces and then back to underscores, which is redundant and does not achieve the intended goal of swapping spaces and underscores.

To correctly implement the desired functionality, the function should perform a single pass through the string, replacing spaces with underscores and underscores with spaces. The current implementation fails to do this and instead results in all spaces being replaced by underscores, while any original underscores are left unchanged (after the redundant conversions).

Correctness: **False**
