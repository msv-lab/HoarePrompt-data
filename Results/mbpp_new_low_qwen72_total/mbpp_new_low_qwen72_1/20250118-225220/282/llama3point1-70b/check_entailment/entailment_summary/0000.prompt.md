Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.

# Program:
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    s = s.replace(' ', '_')
    s = s.replace('_', ' ')
    s = s.replace(' ', '_')
    return s





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string where all spaces in `s` are replaced by underscores. However, due to a logical error in the code, the function does not correctly handle multiple consecutive spaces or other characters that might be intended to be replaced. Specifically, the function will replace all spaces with underscores, but it will also inadvertently replace any underscores that were already present in the original string back to spaces and then again to underscores. This means that if the input string contains underscores, they will be converted to spaces and then back to underscores, which is redundant and unnecessary. The final state of the program is that the returned string will have all original spaces and any existing underscores replaced by underscores.
