Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the replacement of underscores and spaces as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function replaces spaces with underscores, then replaces those underscores back to spaces, and finally replaces spaces back to underscores again. This means that any initial underscores in the string will be converted to spaces and then back to underscores, but any initial spaces will be converted to underscores and then back to spaces, effectively leaving the original string unchanged. 

For example, if the input string is `"Hello World"`, the output will be `"Hello_World"`, which is correct. However, if the input string is `"Hello_World"`, the output will be `"Hello World"`, which is incorrect according to the problem description, as it should remain `"Hello_World"`.

To correct this, the function should only perform the two replacements once:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    s = s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
    return s
```

This would ensure that the function correctly swaps spaces and underscores as required.
