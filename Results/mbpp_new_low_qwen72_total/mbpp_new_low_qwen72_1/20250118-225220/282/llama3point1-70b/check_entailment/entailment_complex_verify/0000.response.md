### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(s: str) -> str:
       s = s.replace(' ', '_')
       s = s.replace('_', ' ')
       s = s.replace(' ', '_')
       return s
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The first `s.replace(' ', '_')` replaces all spaces with underscores.
   - The second `s.replace('_', ' ')` replaces all underscores (including those just added) back to spaces.
   - The third `s.replace(' ', '_')` replaces all spaces (including those just restored) back to underscores.

4. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - If the input string contains spaces, they will be replaced with underscores.
   - If the input string contains underscores, they will be replaced with spaces and then back to underscores.
   - The net effect is that any initial underscores in the string will be converted to underscores, and any initial spaces will be converted to underscores and then back to spaces, effectively leaving the original string unchanged.

5. **Example Cases**:
   - Input: `"Hello World"` → Output: `"Hello_World"` (Correct)
   - Input: `"Hello_World"` → Output: `"Hello World"` (Incorrect, should be `"Hello_World"`)

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function does not correctly handle the replacement of underscores and spaces as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the issue with the function's logic and provides a corrected version of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The function does not correctly swap spaces and underscores as required by the problem statement. The provided example cases demonstrate the incorrect behavior of the function.

Final: **False**
