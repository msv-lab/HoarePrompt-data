Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is intended to replace spaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the current implementation only replaces spaces with underscores and does not handle the reverse operation (replacing underscores with spaces). Additionally, the function has a logical flaw because it performs the replacement operations in a way that can lead to incorrect results, especially if the input string contains underscores.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:
1. The first `replace` call replaces all spaces with underscores.
2. The second `replace` call replaces all underscores (which now include both the original underscores and those that were spaces) with spaces.
3. The third `replace` call replaces all spaces (which now include the original underscores and the spaces that were originally underscores) back to underscores.

This sequence of operations means that:
- Original spaces are correctly replaced with underscores.
- Original underscores are incorrectly converted to spaces and then back to underscores, which is redundant.

To fix this, the function should perform two separate replacements: one for spaces to underscores and another for underscores to spaces, without overwriting the intermediate results.

Given the current implementation, the function does not meet the problem requirements and contains logical errors.

Correctness: **False**
