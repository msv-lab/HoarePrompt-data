Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to replace whitespaces with underscores and vice versa. However, the way it is implemented will not achieve the desired result. The first `replace` call replaces all spaces with underscores, which is correct for replacing spaces. However, the second `replace` call then replaces all underscores (including those that were originally spaces) with spaces, effectively undoing the first step. The third `replace` call then replaces all spaces (which now include the original underscores) back to underscores. This means that any original underscores will be replaced with spaces and then back to underscores, while any original spaces will be replaced with underscores and then back to spaces, and finally back to underscores. Therefore, the final result will be that all original spaces and underscores will be replaced with underscores, which is not the intended behavior.

Correctness: **False**
