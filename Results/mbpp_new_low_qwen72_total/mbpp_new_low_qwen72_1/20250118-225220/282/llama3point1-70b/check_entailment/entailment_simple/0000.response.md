Reasoning:  
The program aims to replace spaces with underscores and underscores with spaces in the given string `s`. However, the implementation in the provided program does not achieve this goal correctly. The sequence of operations in the function `func_1` is flawed:

1. The first `replace` call replaces all spaces with underscores.
2. The second `replace` call replaces all underscores (which were originally spaces) back to spaces, effectively undoing the first replacement.
3. The third `replace` call again replaces all spaces with underscores, but this time it only affects the original underscores that were not changed by the second step.

This means that the final result will only replace the original underscores with spaces, and not the spaces with underscores as intended. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
