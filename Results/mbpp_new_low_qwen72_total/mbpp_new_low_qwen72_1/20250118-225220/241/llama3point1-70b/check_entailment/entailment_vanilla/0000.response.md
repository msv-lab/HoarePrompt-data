Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` checks if `sub_list` is a sublist of `main_list` by converting both lists into strings and then checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works correctly for most cases where the elements in the lists are simple types like integers or single characters, and it efficiently leverages the substring search capability of Python strings.

However, this method has limitations:
1. It may fail if the elements in the lists are complex objects or contain multiple characters, as the string conversion might not preserve the structure needed to accurately determine sublists.
2. It assumes that the elements in the lists can be converted to strings without losing information necessary to identify them as distinct elements.

Given the problem description, which does not specify any constraints on the type of elements in the lists, this method is generally correct for simple use cases. However, for a more robust solution, a different approach that iterates through the lists and checks for the presence of the sublist in the main list would be more appropriate.

For the purpose of this evaluation, assuming the simplest case (e.g., lists of integers or single characters), the provided function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
