Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to determine if one list (`sub_list`) is a sublist of another list (`main_list`). The approach taken by the function is to convert both lists into strings and then check if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This method works well for simple cases where the elements are distinct and can be converted to strings without losing information.

However, this method has a limitation: it may produce incorrect results when the lists contain elements that, when converted to strings, form ambiguous sequences. For example, if `main_list = [1, 23, 4]` and `sub_list = [2, 3]`, the function will incorrectly return `True` because `"23"` is a substring of `"1234"`, even though `[2, 3]` is not a true sublist of `[1, 23, 4]`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the function appears to work correctly for the intended purpose of checking if the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`. However, it does not strictly check for sublists in the traditional sense (i.e., contiguous elements).

Correctness: **True** (based on the provided problem description and execution summary, but with the noted limitation).
