Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

# Program:
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_list` and `sub_list`, both of which are expected to be lists. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` (formed by converting each element to a string and joining them without separators) is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and non-string elements by converting all elements to strings before comparison. If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is not a list, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned boolean value.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
