Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
