Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` takes two lists, `main_list` and `sub_list`, and checks if `sub_list` is a sublist of `main_list`. It does this by converting both lists into strings and checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`.

This approach works correctly for many cases where the elements of the lists are simple and do not contain complex structures that could lead to false positives when converted to strings. For example, it will work correctly for lists like `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3]`.

However, this method can fail in certain edge cases, such as when the lists contain elements that, when converted to strings, might result in false matches. For example, if `main_list = [1, 11, 111]` and `sub_list = [11, 1]`, the function will incorrectly return `True` because the string `"111"` contains `"11"` and `"1"`, even though `[11, 1]` is not a sublist of `[1, 11, 111]`.

Given the problem statement and the provided implementation, the function is generally correct for simple cases but may not be robust enough for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
