Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program converts both lists to strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for simple cases but fails in scenarios where the elements of the lists are not single-digit numbers or single-character strings. For example:

- `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [12, 3]` would incorrectly return `True` because the string `"123"` is a substring of `"1234"`.
- `main_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` and `sub_list = ['ab', 'c']` would also incorrectly return `True` because the string `"abc"` is a substring of `"abcd"`.

These cases demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle all potential inputs and thus is incorrect.
