You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether a list is sublist of another or not.

- Program:
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_list` and `sub_list`, both of which are expected to be lists. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` (formed by converting each element to a string and joining them without separators) is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and non-string elements by converting all elements to strings before comparison. If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is not a list, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned boolean value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program converts both lists to strings and checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach works for simple cases but fails in scenarios where the elements of the lists are not single-digit numbers or single-character strings. For example:

- `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [12, 3]` would incorrectly return `True` because the string `"123"` is a substring of `"1234"`.
- `main_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` and `sub_list = ['ab', 'c']` would also incorrectly return `True` because the string `"abc"` is a substring of `"abcd"`.

These cases demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle all potential inputs and thus is incorrect.
