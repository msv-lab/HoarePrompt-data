Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function converts both `main_list` and `sub_list` into strings and then checks if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. This approach can lead to incorrect results in cases where the elements of the lists are multi-digit numbers or multi-character strings. 

For example:
- In the case where `main_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `sub_list = [12, 3]`, the function will convert these lists to the strings `"1234"` and `"123"`, respectively, and will incorrectly return `True` because `"123"` is indeed a substring of `"1234"`.
- Similarly, for `main_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` and `sub_list = ['ab', 'c']`, the function will convert these to `"abcd"` and `"abc"`, and again incorrectly return `True`.

These examples show that the function does not accurately determine whether `sub_list` is a true sublist of `main_list` in all cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
