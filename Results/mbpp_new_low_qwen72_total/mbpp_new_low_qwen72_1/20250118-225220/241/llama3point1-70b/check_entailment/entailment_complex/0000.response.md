Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to check if one list (`sub_list`) is a sublist of another list (`main_list`). The approach taken by the function is to convert both lists into their string representations by concatenating the stringified versions of their elements, and then checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`.

This method works well for simple cases where the elements of the lists are unique and do not contain complex structures that might result in misleading string representations. For example, it correctly identifies that `[1, 2]` is a sublist of `[0, 1, 2, 3]` because `"12"` is a substring of `"0123"`. However, it can fail in cases where the elements themselves are not unique or when the order of elements creates overlapping string patterns. For instance, it would incorrectly identify `[1, 10]` as a sublist of `[1, 10, 100]` because `"110"` is a substring of `"110100"`, even though `[1, 10]` is not actually a contiguous sublist of `[1, 10, 100]`.

Despite these limitations, the function meets the basic requirement of checking if the string representation of `sub_list` is a substring of the string representation of `main_list`. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the intended use case, the function is considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
