#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_list and sub_list are lists.
def func_1(main_list, sub_list):
    return ''.join(map(str, sub_list)) in ''.join(map(str, main_list))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_list` and `sub_list`, both of which are expected to be lists. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the concatenated string representation of `sub_list` (formed by converting each element to a string and joining them without separators) is found within the concatenated string representation of `main_list`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and non-string elements by converting all elements to strings before comparison. If either `main_list` or `sub_list` is not a list, the behavior is undefined. After the function executes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned boolean value.
