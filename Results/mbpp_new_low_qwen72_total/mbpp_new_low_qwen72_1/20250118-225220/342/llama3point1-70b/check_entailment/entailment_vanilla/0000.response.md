Reasoning:  
The function `func_1(nums)` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The approach used in the function is to use generator expressions with the `next` function to find the first even and the first odd numbers in the list. If an even or odd number is not found, `None` is returned by the `next` function. However, the multiplication of `even * odd` will result in `None` if either `even` or `odd` is `None`, which could lead to a TypeError if the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. To handle this correctly, the function should check if both `even` and `odd` are not `None` before performing the multiplication.

Given the current implementation, if the list contains at least one even and one odd number, the function will work correctly. However, if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, or is empty, the function will raise a TypeError due to attempting to multiply `None` with an integer.

Therefore, the function is not fully correct because it does not handle cases where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number.

Correctness: **False**
