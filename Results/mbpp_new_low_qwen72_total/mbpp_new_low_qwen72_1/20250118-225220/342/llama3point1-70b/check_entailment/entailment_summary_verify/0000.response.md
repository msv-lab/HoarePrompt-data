### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function and its behavior based on the provided problem description, program code, and function summary.

1. **Function Behavior:**
   - The function `func_1` uses two generator expressions to find the first even and the first odd number in the list `nums`.
   - `even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)` finds the first even number in the list. If no even number is found, it returns `None`.
   - `odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)` finds the first odd number in the list. If no odd number is found, it returns `None`.
   - The function then returns the product of `even` and `odd`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Even Numbers:** If the list contains only even numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`), `odd` will be `None`, and the function will attempt to return `even * None`, which will raise a `TypeError`.
   - **All Odd Numbers:** If the list contains only odd numbers (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]`), `even` will be `None`, and the function will attempt to return `None * odd`, which will raise a `TypeError`.
   - **Empty List:** If the list is empty (e.g., `[]`), both `even` and `odd` will be `None`, and the function will attempt to return `None * None`, which will raise a `TypeError`.

3. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary states that if either an even or an odd number does not exist in the list, the function returns `None`. However, this is not true because the function attempts to multiply `None` with an integer, which results in a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function does not handle cases where the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, leading to a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
