You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)

odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd
    #The program returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list `nums`, or `None` if either an even or odd number does not exist.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func_1(nums)` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The approach used in the function is to use generator expressions with the `next` function to find the first even and the first odd numbers in the list. If an even or odd number is not found, `None` is returned by the `next` function. However, the multiplication of `even * odd` will result in `None` if either `even` or `odd` is `None`, which could lead to a TypeError if the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. To handle this correctly, the function should check if both `even` and `odd` are not `None` before performing the multiplication.

Given the current implementation, if the list contains at least one even and one odd number, the function will work correctly. However, if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, or is empty, the function will raise a TypeError due to attempting to multiply `None` with an integer.

Therefore, the function is not fully correct because it does not handle cases where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number.

Correctness: **False**
