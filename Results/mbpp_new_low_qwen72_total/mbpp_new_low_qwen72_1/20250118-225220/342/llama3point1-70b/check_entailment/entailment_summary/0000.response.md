Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is appropriate:

1. It uses a generator expression with `next()` to find the first even number (`even`) and the first odd number (`odd`) in the list. If no such number exists, it defaults to `None`.
2. The function then multiplies these two numbers. If either `even` or `odd` is `None`, the multiplication will result in `None` (since any number multiplied by `None` results in `None`).

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected:
- It returns the product of the first even and first odd number when both are present.
- It returns `None` if either an even or an odd number is not found in the list.
- It returns `None` if the list is empty.

Given this, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
