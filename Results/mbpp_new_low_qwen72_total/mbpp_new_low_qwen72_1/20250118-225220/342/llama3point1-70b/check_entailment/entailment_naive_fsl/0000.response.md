Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6]` (all even numbers) or `[1, 3, 5]` (all odd numbers), the function will attempt to multiply `None` with an integer, which will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case.
