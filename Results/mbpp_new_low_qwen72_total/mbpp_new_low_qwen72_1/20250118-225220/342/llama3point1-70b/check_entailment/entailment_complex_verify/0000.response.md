Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` will indeed raise a `TypeError` if the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers because it attempts to multiply `None` with an integer. This is a valid concern that affects the correctness of the program. The annotations provided confirm that the function aims to return the product of the first even and the first odd number, but they do not address the issue of handling cases where one or both of these numbers are not present in the list.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and can fail with a `TypeError`.

Final: **False**
