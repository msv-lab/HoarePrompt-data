You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)

odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    return even * odd
    #The program returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list `nums`, or `None` if either an even or odd number does not exist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If either an even or an odd number does not exist in the list, the function returns `None`. If the list is empty, the function also returns `None` since no numbers are present to determine even or odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6]` (all even numbers) or `[1, 3, 5]` (all odd numbers), the function will attempt to multiply `None` with an integer, which will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case.
