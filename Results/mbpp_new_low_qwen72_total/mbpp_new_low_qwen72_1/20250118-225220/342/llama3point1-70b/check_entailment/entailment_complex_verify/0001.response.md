Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the function `func_1(nums)`. Specifically, the function attempts to multiply `even` and `odd` without checking if they are `None`. If either `even` or `odd` is `None`, the multiplication will indeed raise a `TypeError`.

However, the annotated code provides a more detailed understanding of the function's behavior. It correctly states that the function returns `None` if either an even or odd number does not exist in the list. This implies that the function should handle the case where `even` or `odd` is `None` by returning `None` instead of attempting the multiplication.

To properly address the issue, the function should include a check to ensure that both `even` and `odd` are not `None` before performing the multiplication. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    even = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0), None)
    if even is not None and odd is not None:
        return even * odd
    return None
```

Given the original implementation, the function will indeed raise a `TypeError` if the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying this flaw.

Final: **False**
