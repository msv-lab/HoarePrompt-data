Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in a given list of integers. The implementation uses generator expressions to find the first even and the first odd number in the list. If either an even or an odd number is not found, the function returns `None`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning `None` as well, since `next` with a default value of `None` will return `None` if no matching element is found.

The comments correctly describe the behavior of the function, and the logic implemented matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
