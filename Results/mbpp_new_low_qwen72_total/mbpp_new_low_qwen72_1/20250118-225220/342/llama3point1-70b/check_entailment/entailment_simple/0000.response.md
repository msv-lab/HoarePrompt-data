Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd number in the given list `nums`. The logic used in the function is correct:

1. It uses a generator expression with `next()` to find the first even number (`even`) in the list. If no even number is found, it sets `even` to `None`.
2. Similarly, it uses another generator expression with `next()` to find the first odd number (`odd`) in the list. If no odd number is found, it sets `odd` to `None`.
3. The function then returns the product of `even` and `odd`. If either `even` or `odd` is `None`, the product will be `None`.

This logic correctly handles the cases where there might be no even or odd numbers in the list, returning `None` in such scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
