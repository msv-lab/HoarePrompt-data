The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if there is at least one even number and one odd number in the list, the function returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number found in the list. If either an even number or an odd number does not exist in the list, the function returns `None`.
