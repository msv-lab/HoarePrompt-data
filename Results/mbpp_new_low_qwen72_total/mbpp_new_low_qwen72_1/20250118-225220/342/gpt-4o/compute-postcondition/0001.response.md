The only object in the loop head is the variable `lst`, so this is the only one that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variables `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized to `None` and do not affect the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute the first time, the list `lst` must have at least one integer, and `num` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `first_odd` is None, `first_even` is None, `num` is the first integer in the list**
