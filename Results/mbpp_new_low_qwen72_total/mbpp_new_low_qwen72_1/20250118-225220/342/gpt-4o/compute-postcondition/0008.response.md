Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. `first_odd` is not `None` and `first_even` is not `None`. If `num` is an even number and `first_even` was initially `None`, then `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged.***
