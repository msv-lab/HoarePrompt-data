Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`. If the list contains no odd numbers or no even numbers, the function returns `None`. The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None` and updates them to the first odd and even numbers found, respectively. The loop terminates early as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are set. If the list is empty, both `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, resulting in a return value of `None`. **
