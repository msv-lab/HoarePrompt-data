The code snippet `first_even = num` assigns the value of `num` to `first_even`. Given that `num` is an even number, `first_even` will now hold this even value. Since `num` is an even number, the conditions for setting `first_odd` (which require `num` to be odd) are not met, so `first_odd` remains `None`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list and is an even number, `first_odd` is None, `first_even` is the even number `num`.**
