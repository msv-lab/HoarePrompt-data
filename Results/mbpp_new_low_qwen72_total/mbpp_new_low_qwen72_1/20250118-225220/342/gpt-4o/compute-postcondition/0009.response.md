The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the state of any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer.
- `num` is the first integer in the list.
- `first_odd` is not `None`.
- `first_even` is not `None`.
- If `num` is an even number and `first_even` was initially `None`, then `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `first_odd` is not `None`, `first_even` is not `None`, and if `num` is an even number and `first_even` was initially `None`, then `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged.**
