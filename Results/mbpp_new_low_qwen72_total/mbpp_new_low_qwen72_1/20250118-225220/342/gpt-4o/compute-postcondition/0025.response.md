Output State: **After the loop finishes, `first_odd` will hold the first odd number encountered in `lst`, and `first_even` will hold the first even number encountered in `lst`. Both `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized as `None` and are only updated once when their respective conditions are met. The loop stops executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are no longer `None`. If the list `lst` contains no odd numbers, `first_odd` will remain `None`; similarly, if the list contains no even numbers, `first_even` will remain `None`.**
