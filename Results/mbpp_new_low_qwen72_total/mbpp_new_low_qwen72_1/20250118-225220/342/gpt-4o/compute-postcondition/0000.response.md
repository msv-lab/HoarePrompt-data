The provided code initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None`. These variables are intended to store the first odd and even numbers found in the list `lst`, respectively. However, the code snippet does not contain any logic to iterate over `lst` or assign values to `first_odd` and `first_even`. Therefore, these variables remain `None` after the code execution.

Output State: **lst is a list of integers, first_odd is None, first_even is None**
