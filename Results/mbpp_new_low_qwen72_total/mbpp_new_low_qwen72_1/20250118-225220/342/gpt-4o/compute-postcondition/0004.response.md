Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is an odd number and `first_odd` is initially None, then `first_odd` is set to `num` and `first_even` remains None. Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged.***
