Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: lst is a list of integers, first_odd is None, first_even is None
Code of the loop:
for num in lst:
    if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
        first_odd = num
    if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
        first_even = num
    if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
        break


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not `None` and `first_even` is not `None`, and if `num` is an even number and `first_even` was initially `None`, then `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains `None`. Otherwise, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged. If `first_odd` is `None` or `first_even` is `None`, `first_odd` and `first_even` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`lst` is a list of integers with at least two integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, then `first_even` remains unchanged and `first_odd` also remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `num` is odd or `first_even` is already set, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `first_even` and `first_odd` unchanged. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
