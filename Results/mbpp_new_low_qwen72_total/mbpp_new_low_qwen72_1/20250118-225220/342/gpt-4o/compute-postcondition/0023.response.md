The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within, but does not change the values of any variables. The initial state conditions about the list `lst`, `num`, `first_even`, and `first_odd` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers, `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
