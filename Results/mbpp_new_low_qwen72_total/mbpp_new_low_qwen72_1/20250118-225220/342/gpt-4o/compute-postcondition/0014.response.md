`first_even` is assigned the value of `num`. The value of `num` is the second integer in the list `lst`. The state of `first_odd` remains unchanged, which means it is still `None` if it was `None` and `num` is odd, or it retains its original value otherwise.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least two integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `first_odd` is unchanged, `first_even` is `num`**
