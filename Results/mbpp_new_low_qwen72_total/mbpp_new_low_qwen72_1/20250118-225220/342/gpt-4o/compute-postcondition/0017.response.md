Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least two integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, then `first_even` remains unchanged and `first_odd` also remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `num` is odd or `first_even` is already set, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.***
