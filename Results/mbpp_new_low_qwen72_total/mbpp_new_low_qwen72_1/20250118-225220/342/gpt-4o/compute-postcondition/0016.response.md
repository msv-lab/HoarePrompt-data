The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop) or the nearest enclosing `if` statement if used within one. However, since there is no loop or conditional block mentioned in the context provided, the `break` statement would result in a syntax error if executed. Assuming this is part of a larger context where a loop or conditional block is present, the variables and their states remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional block is exited.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least two integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `first_even` is None or its previous value, `first_odd` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
