Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least two integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. If `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `first_odd` remains unchanged and `first_even` is not modified.***
