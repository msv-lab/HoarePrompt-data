The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least three integers, and `num` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, then `first_even` remains unchanged and `first_odd` also remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. If `num` is odd or `first_even` is already set, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.**
