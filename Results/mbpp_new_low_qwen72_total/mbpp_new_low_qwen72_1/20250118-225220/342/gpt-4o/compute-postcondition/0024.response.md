Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `first_odd` and `first_even` are both not None, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `first_even` and `first_odd` unchanged. If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.***
