The code snippet provided is:

```
first_even = num
```

Based on the initial state:

- `lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers.
- `num` is the third integer in the list.
- If `first_odd` is None and `num` is odd, `first_odd` is set to `num`.
- If `first_odd` is not None and `first_even` is not None, then `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, if `first_even` is None and `num` is even, `first_even` is set to `num` and `first_odd` remains unchanged.
- If `num` is odd or `first_even` is already set, `first_even` and `first_odd` remain unchanged.

Given the code snippet `first_even = num`, this line will execute only if `first_even` is None and `num` is even. If `first_even` is already set or `num` is odd, this line will not change `first_even`.

Since the code snippet is provided without context about the current state of `first_even` and `num`, we need to consider the possible scenarios:

1. If `first_even` is None and `num` is even:
   - `first_even` will be set to `num`.

2. If `first_even` is not None or `num` is odd:
   - `first_even` will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, let's assume the most general case where `first_even` could be None and `num` could be even. Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least three integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `first_odd` remains unchanged, `first_even` is set to `num` if it was None and `num` is even, otherwise `first_even` remains unchanged.**
