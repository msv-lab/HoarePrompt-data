Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in a given list. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, are initialized to `None`.
2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list:
   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the current number is odd, it sets `first_odd` to this number.
   - If `first_even` is `None` and the current number is even, it sets `first_even` to this number.
   - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been found, it breaks out of the loop.
3. **Return**: The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.

### Evaluation of Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]`
   - First odd number: `1`
   - First even number: `4`
   - Product: `1 * 4 = 4`
   - Expected result: `4`
   - Actual result: `4`
   - **Correct**.

2. **Test Case 2**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
   - First odd number: `1`
   - First even number: `2`
   - Product: `1 * 2 = 2`
   - Expected result: `2`
   - Actual result: `2`
   - **Correct**.

3. **Test Case 3**: `[1, 5, 7, 9, 10]`
   - First odd number: `1`
   - First even number: `10`
   - Product: `1 * 10 = 10`
   - Expected result: `10`
   - Actual result: `10`
   - **Correct**.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: If the list is empty, both `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, and the function will attempt to return `None * None`, which will raise a `TypeError`. However, since the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume the list is non-empty.
- **List with Only Odd Numbers**: If the list contains only odd numbers, `first_even` will remain `None`, and the function will attempt to return `first_odd * None`, which will raise a `TypeError`.
- **List with Only Even Numbers**: If the list contains only even numbers, `first_odd` will remain `None`, and the function will attempt to return `None * first_even`, which will raise a `TypeError`.

Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs (i.e., the list contains at least one even and one odd number), these edge cases are not considered.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function correctly identifies the first odd and even numbers in the list and returns their product. The test cases provided confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
