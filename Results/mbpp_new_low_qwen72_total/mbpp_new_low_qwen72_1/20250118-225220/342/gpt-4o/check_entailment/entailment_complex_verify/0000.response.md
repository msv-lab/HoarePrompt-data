Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers. In such cases, one of the variables (`first_odd` or `first_even`) will remain `None`, and the multiplication operation will raise a `TypeError` because Python does not support multiplying `None` with an integer. The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the function but does not address this critical edge case. Therefore, the function is incorrect due to its failure to handle these edge cases.

Final: **False**
