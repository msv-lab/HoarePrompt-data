Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, `first_odd` will hold the first odd number encountered in `lst`, and `first_even` will hold the first even number encountered in `lst`. Both `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized as `None` and are only updated once when their respective conditions are met. The loop stops executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are no longer `None`. If the list `lst` contains no odd numbers, `first_odd` will remain `None`; similarly, if the list contains no even numbers, `first_even` will remain `None`.
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`, or `None` if either the first odd or the first even number is not found in `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`. If the list contains no odd numbers or no even numbers, the function returns `None`. The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None` and updates them to the first odd and even numbers found, respectively. The loop terminates early as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are set. If the list is empty, both `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, resulting in a return value of `None`.
