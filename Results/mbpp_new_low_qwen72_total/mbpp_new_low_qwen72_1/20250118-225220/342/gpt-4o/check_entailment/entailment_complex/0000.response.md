Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. The implementation correctly initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None` and updates these variables when the first odd and even numbers are encountered, respectively. The loop breaks early once both values are found, which is efficient. However, there is a potential issue with the return statement. If the list contains only odd numbers or only even numbers, one of the variables (`first_odd` or `first_even`) will remain `None`. Multiplying `None` with an integer results in a `TypeError`, which is not handled in the current implementation.

To fix this, the function should check if both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None` before returning their product. If either is `None`, the function should return `None`.

Given the current implementation, the function will raise an error in cases where the list contains only odd or only even numbers, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
