You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

- Program:
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 5, 7, 9, 10]) == 10

def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    return first_odd * first_even



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`. If the list contains no odd numbers or no even numbers, the function returns `None`. The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None` and updates them to the first odd and even numbers found, respectively. The loop terminates early as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are set. If the list is empty, both `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, resulting in a return value of `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains no odd or no even numbers. For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (which contains only even numbers) or `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (which contains only odd numbers), the function will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will result in a `TypeError`. This violates the requirement to find the product of the first even and odd number in the list, as the function fails to handle these edge cases correctly.
