Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to find the product of the first even and the first odd numbers in the given list. The logic implemented in the function is straightforward:

1. Initialize `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None`.
2. Iterate through the list:
   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the current number is odd, set `first_odd` to this number.
   - If `first_even` is `None` and the current number is even, set `first_even` to this number.
   - If both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been found, break out of the loop.
3. Return the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:
- For `[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `4`. Their product is `1 * 4 = 4`.
- For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `2`. Their product is `1 * 2 = 2`.
- For `[1, 5, 7, 9, 10]`, the first odd number is `1` and the first even number is `10`. Their product is `1 * 10 = 10`.

All test cases match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
