Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the first even and odd numbers in the list and returns their product. The function initializes `first_odd` and `first_even` to `None` and updates these variables when it encounters the first odd and even numbers, respectively. The function also breaks out of the loop as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are set, which optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary iterations. The test cases provided in the assertion statements cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple even and odd numbers, lists with only one even or odd number, and lists with both even and odd numbers. All test cases pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected.

However, the execution summary mentions that if the list contains no odd numbers or no even numbers, the function should return `None`. This is not explicitly handled in the provided code. If the list does not contain an even or an odd number, the function will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will raise a `TypeError`. To handle this case correctly, the function should check if both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None` before returning their product.

Given the current implementation, the function will raise an error if the list does not contain both an even and an odd number. Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
