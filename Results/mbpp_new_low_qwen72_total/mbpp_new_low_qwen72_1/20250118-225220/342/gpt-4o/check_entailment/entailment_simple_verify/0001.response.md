Reasoning: 

The original assessment is generally accurate but does not account for a potential issue where the list might not contain an odd or an even number. In such cases, the function will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will raise a `TypeError`. This is a critical flaw that needs to be addressed to ensure the function behaves correctly under all valid input conditions.

To verify this, let's consider a few additional test cases:
- For `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, there are no odd numbers. The function will return `None * 2`, which raises a `TypeError`.
- For `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, there are no even numbers. The function will return `1 * None`, which also raises a `TypeError`.

Given these scenarios, the function is not fully correct as it does not handle cases where one or both of the required numbers (first even or first odd) are missing from the list.

To fix this, the function should check if both `first_odd` and `first_even` are not `None` before returning their product. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None
    first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
    if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
        return first_odd * first_even
    else:
        return None
```

With this correction, the function will return `None` if either the first odd or the first even number is not found in the list, avoiding the `TypeError`.

Final: **False**
