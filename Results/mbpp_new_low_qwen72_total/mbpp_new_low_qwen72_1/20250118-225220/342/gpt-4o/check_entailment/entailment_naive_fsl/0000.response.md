Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains no odd or no even numbers. For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (which contains only even numbers) or `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (which contains only odd numbers), the function will attempt to multiply `None` by a number, which will result in a `TypeError`. This violates the requirement to find the product of the first even and odd number in the list, as the function fails to handle these edge cases correctly.
