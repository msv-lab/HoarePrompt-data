### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized to `None`. This ensures that they will only be updated once when the first odd and even numbers are encountered, respectively.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates through each number in the list `lst`.
   - If `first_odd` is still `None` and the current number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), `first_odd` is updated to this number.
   - Similarly, if `first_even` is still `None` and the current number is even (`num % 2 == 0`), `first_even` is updated to this number.
   - The loop breaks as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` have been set to non-`None` values, ensuring that the loop does not continue unnecessarily.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the product of `first_odd` and `first_even`.
   - If either `first_odd` or `first_even` remains `None` (i.e., if the list does not contain an odd or even number), the product will involve a multiplication with `None`, which would result in a `TypeError`. However, since the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume that the list will always contain at least one odd and one even number.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the first even and first odd numbers in the list and returns their product. The logic is sound and the assertions provided in the problem description are satisfied.

### Correctness:
**True**
