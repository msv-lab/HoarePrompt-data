#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    first_odd = None

first_even = None
    for num in lst:
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        
        if first_odd is not None and first_even is not None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, `first_odd` will hold the first odd number encountered in `lst`, and `first_even` will hold the first even number encountered in `lst`. Both `first_odd` and `first_even` are initialized as `None` and are only updated once when their respective conditions are met. The loop stops executing as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are no longer `None`. If the list `lst` contains no odd numbers, `first_odd` will remain `None`; similarly, if the list contains no even numbers, `first_even` will remain `None`.
    return first_odd * first_even
    #The program returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`, or `None` if either the first odd or the first even number is not found in `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the product of the first odd number and the first even number encountered in `lst`. If the list contains no odd numbers or no even numbers, the function returns `None`. The function initializes two variables, `first_odd` and `first_even`, to `None` and updates them to the first odd and even numbers found, respectively. The loop terminates early as soon as both `first_odd` and `first_even` are set. If the list is empty, both `first_odd` and `first_even` will remain `None`, resulting in a return value of `None`.
