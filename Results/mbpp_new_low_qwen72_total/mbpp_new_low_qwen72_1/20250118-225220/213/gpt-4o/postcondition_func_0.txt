The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum product of a subsequence of `arr` where the subsequence is formed by elements that are strictly increasing. If the input list `arr` is empty, the function returns 0. For non-empty lists, the function computes the maximum product of a subsequence ending at each index `i` in `arr`, where the subsequence is formed using elements less than `arr[i]` up to that index. If no such subsequence exists, the value at `max_products[i]` is `arr[i]`. The final result is the maximum value from the list `max_products`. Edge cases include handling an empty list and ensuring that the subsequence is strictly increasing. The function does not handle negative numbers or zero in a special way, and the product calculation assumes that the elements are positive or that the product of negative numbers will be handled correctly.
