Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the second element of `max_products` is `max(max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[1])`, and the rest are 0, with `i` being 1 and `j` being 1. If `arr[j] >= arr[i]`, the second element of `max_products` remains 0, and the rest are 0, with `i` being 1 and `j` being 1.***
