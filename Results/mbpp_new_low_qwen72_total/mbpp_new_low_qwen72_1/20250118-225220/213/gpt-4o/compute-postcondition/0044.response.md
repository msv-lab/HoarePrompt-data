Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where each element `max_products[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the maximum product of a subsequence ending at `arr[i]` that can be formed using elements `arr[j]` for `j` from 0 to `i-1` such that `arr[j] < arr[i]`, and if no such `j` exists, `max_products[i]` is `arr[i]`. The loop finishes after `n-1` iterations, with `i` being `n-1` and `j` being `i-1` if the inner loop executes, otherwise `j` is not defined in the final state.**
