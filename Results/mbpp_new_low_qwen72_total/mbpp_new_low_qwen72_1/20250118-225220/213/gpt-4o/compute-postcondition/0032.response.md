The code snippet updates the `max_products` list at index `i` (which is 3) with the value of `arr[i]` (which is also 3).

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`.
  - The rest are 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

After executing the code:
- `max_products[3]` is updated to `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `arr[3]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1.**
