Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3], max(max_products[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]) * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3])`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3.**

Explanation:
- **Constants**: `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain constant throughout the loop.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 2 (since `i` is 3), updating `max_products[3]` based on the condition `if arr[j] < arr[3]`.
- **Final Values**:
  - After the first iteration (`j=0`): If `arr[0] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3])`.
  - After the second iteration (`j=1`): If `arr[1] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3])`.
  - After the third iteration (`j=2`): If `arr[2] < arr[3]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max(max_products[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]) * arr[3])`.

Thus, the final value of `max_products[3]` after all iterations is the maximum of all possible products involving `arr[3]` and previous elements in `arr` and `max_products`. The rest of the elements in `max_products` remain as initially defined.
