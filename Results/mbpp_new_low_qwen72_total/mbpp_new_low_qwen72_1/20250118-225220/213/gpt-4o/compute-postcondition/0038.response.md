The code snippet updates the value of `max_products[i]` using the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` with specific initial values for the first four elements and the rest being 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `max_products[3]` is `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`.
   - `max_products[1]` is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])` updates `max_products[3]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[1]` and `arr[3]`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(max_products[3], max_products[1] * arr[3])`.

Given the initial state, let's denote:
- `arr[0]` as `a0`
- `arr[1]` as `a1`
- `arr[2]` as `a2`
- `arr[3]` as `a3`

The initial values of `max_products` are:
- `max_products[0] = a0`
- `max_products[1] = max(a1, a0 * a1)` if `a0 < a1`, otherwise `a1`
- `max_products[2] = max(a2, max(max_products[0] * a2, max_products[1] * a2))` if `arr[j] < a2` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise `a2`
- `max_products[3] = max(a3, a0 * a3)` if `arr[j] < a3` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise `a3`

After the code execution, `max_products[3]` is updated to:
- `max_products[3] = max(max(a3, a0 * a3), max(a1, a0 * a1) * a3)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 3.**
