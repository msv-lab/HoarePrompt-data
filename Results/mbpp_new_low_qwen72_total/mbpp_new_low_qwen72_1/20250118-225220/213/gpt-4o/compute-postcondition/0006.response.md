The code assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `max_products[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `max_products[1]` is now equal to `arr[1]`. The other elements in `max_products` remain unchanged, with the first element being `arr[0]` and the rest being 0. The states of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[1]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1**
