Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, the third element of `max_products` is `max(max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2]), max_products[1] * arr[2])`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, the third element remains as `max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2])` if `arr[0] < arr[2]`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1.***
