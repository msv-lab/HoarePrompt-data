The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` by taking the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. Therefore, `max_products[1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[j] < arr[i]`) and `max_products[0] * arr[1]`.

Let's break this down:

- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_products[1]` is initially `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[j] < arr[i]`.
- `max_products[1]` will now be updated to `max(max_products[1], max_products[0] * arr[1])`.

Since `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`, the new value of `max_products[1]` will be `max(max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]), arr[0] * arr[1])`.

Simplifying this:
- If `arr[1] > arr[0] * arr[1]`, then `max_products[1]` remains `arr[1]`.
- If `arr[1] <= arr[0] * arr[1]`, then `max_products[1]` will be `arr[0] * arr[1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `max_products[1]` will be `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
