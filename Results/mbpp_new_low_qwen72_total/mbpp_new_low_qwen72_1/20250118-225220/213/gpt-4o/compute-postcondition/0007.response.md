To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[1]`, and the rest are 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i)` will execute based on the value of `i`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is 1.
3. **Range of `j`**: Since `i` is 1, `range(i)` will produce a range from 0 to 0 (inclusive), which means the loop will execute once with `j` being 0.

### Required State for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0.
- Given `i` is 1, the loop will execute exactly once.

### Final State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[1]`, and the rest are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` will be 0 during the first execution of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `arr[1]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
