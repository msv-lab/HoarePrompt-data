Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, and the third element is `arr[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2, and `j` will start at 0. Additionally, the current value of `arr[j]` is less than the current value of `arr[i]`.***
