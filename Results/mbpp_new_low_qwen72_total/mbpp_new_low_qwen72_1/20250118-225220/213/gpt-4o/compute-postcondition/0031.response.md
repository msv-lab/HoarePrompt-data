The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` at each step), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, and the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1**
