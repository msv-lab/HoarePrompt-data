Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `max(max_products[3], max_products[2] * arr[3])`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3.***
