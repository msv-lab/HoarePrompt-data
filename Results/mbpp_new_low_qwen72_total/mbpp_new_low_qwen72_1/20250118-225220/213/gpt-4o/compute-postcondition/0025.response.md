The given code updates the `max_products` list at index `i` (which is 2) by calculating the maximum between the current value at `max_products[2]` and the product of `max_products[j]` (which is 1) and `arr[i]` (which is also 2).

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2.
   - `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
     - The first element is `arr[0]`.
     - The second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.
     - The third element is `max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2])` if `arr[0] < arr[2]`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`.
     - The rest are 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])` is executed.
   - `i` is 2, so we are updating `max_products[2]`.
   - `j` is 1, so we are using `max_products[1]`.
   - `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`.

3. **Calculations**:
   - `max_products[2]` is initially `max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2])` if `arr[0] < arr[2]`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`.
   - `max_products[1]` is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.
   - We calculate `max_products[1] * arr[2]`.
   - We then update `max_products[2]` to be the maximum of its current value and the calculated product.

4. **Updated State**:
   - `max_products[2]` is now `max(max_products[2], max_products[1] * arr[2])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2]), max_products[1] * arr[2])`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**.
