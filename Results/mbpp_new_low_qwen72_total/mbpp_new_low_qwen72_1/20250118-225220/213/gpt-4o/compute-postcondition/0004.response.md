The provided code initializes a list `max_products` with `n` elements, all set to 0, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `arr`. Then, it sets the first element of `max_products` to the first element of `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, and `n` is greater than 0

After executing the code:
- `max_products` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
- The first element of `max_products` is updated to the value of the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the rest are 0**.
