The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `i`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `j` is already at the maximum value within the range of `i` (which is 2), the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented.

However, since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `j`), and the loop condition is based on `i`, we can increment `i` by 1 to allow the loop to run one more time. Therefore, `i` becomes 3, and `j` resets to 0 for the new iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is determined as described in the initial state, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, and `j` is 0.**
