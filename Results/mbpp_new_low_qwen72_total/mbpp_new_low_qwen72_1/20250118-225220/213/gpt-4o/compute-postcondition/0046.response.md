The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. The function evaluates the maximum product of a subsequence ending at each index `i` in `arr`, where the subsequence is formed using elements less than `arr[i]` up to that index. If no such subsequence exists, the value at `max_products[i]` is `arr[i]`. The function has two cases for its return value:

- **Case_1**: The program returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The program returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return either 0 (Case_1) or the maximum value from the list `max_products`, which contains the maximum product of a subsequence ending at each index `i` in `arr`, where the subsequence is formed using elements less than `arr[i]` up to that index. If no such subsequence exists, the value at `max_products[i]` is `arr[i]`.
