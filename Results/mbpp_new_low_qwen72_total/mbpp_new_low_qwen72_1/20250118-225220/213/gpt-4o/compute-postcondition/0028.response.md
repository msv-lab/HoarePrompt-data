The code updates the value of `max_products[i]` by calculating the maximum between its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.
  - The third element is determined similarly.
  - The rest are 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 0.

The code snippet:
```
max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])
```

Impact:
- `max_products[i]` (which is `max_products[3]`) is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and the product of `max_products[j]` (which is `max_products[0]` or `arr[0]`) and `arr[i]` (which is `arr[3]`).

Calculation:
- `max_products[3]` is initially 0.
- `max_products[0]` is `arr[0]`.
- `arr[3]` is the fourth element of `arr`.

Thus, `max_products[3]` is updated to:
- `max(0, arr[0] * arr[3])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is determined similarly, `max_products[3]` is `max(0, arr[0] * arr[3])`, the rest are 0, `i` is 3, and `j` is 0.**
