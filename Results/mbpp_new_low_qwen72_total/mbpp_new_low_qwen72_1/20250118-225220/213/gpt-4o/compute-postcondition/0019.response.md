The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `max_products[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `max_products[2]` is set to `arr[2]`.

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, and the rest are 0.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code:
- `max_products[2]` is now `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, and the third element is `arr[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2.**
