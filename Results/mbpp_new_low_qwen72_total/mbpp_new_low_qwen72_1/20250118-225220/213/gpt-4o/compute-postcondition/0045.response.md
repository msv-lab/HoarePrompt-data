Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `max_products`, which contains the maximum product of a subsequence ending at each index `i` in `arr`, where the subsequence is formed using elements less than `arr[i]` up to that index. If no such subsequence exists, the value at `max_products[i]` is `arr[i]`.**
