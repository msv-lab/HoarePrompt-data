To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the conditions that must be met for the loop to start its first iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `i`.
   - The loop variable `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`.

2. **Conditions for Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(i)` must contain at least one value.
   - This means `i` must be greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is 3, the loop will indeed execute.

### Final State:
The state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `i` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will start at 0 (the first value in `range(i)`).

Therefore, the final state is:
**`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `arr[3]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 3.**
