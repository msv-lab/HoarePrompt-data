Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is determined similarly, and the rest are 0. If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, then `max_products[3]` is updated to `max(0, arr[0] * arr[3])`. Otherwise, the state of `max_products` remains unchanged. `i` is 3, and `j` is 0.***
