To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where:
  - The first element is `arr[0]`.
  - The second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`.
  - The third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`.
  - The fourth element is `max(max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`.
  - The rest are 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 3.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `j` and `i`.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- `j` will be 2, and `i` remains 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 3.
- `j` is incremented to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3]), max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1]) * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]` for any `j` in `0` to `2`, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3**.
