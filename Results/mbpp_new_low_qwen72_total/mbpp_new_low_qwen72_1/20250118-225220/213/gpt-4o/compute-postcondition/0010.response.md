Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[j] < arr[i]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.***
