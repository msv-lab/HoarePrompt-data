To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0.
- `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the rest are 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
3. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0.
   - `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the rest are 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Range Check**: The loop will execute if `1 < n`, meaning `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once.
- **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the first iteration, `i` is set to 1 by the `range(1, n)` function.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`).
- `i` is 1.
- The state of `arr` and `max_products` should remain as described in the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 1, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]` and the rest are 0, `i` is 1**
