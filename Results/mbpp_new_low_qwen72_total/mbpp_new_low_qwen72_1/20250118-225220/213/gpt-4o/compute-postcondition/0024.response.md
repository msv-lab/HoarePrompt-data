The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` will start at 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `i` is 2, the condition `j < i` (1 < 2) is still true, so the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 2, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, and the third element is `max(arr[2], arr[0] * arr[2])` if `arr[0] < arr[2]`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**
