The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `i`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 3, `max_products` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0]`, the second element is `max(arr[1], arr[0] * arr[1])` if `arr[0] < arr[1]`, otherwise it remains `arr[1]`, the third element is `max(arr[2], max(max_products[0] * arr[2], max_products[1] * arr[2]))` if `arr[j] < arr[2]` for any `j` in `0` to `1`, otherwise it remains `arr[2]`, the fourth element is `max(arr[3], arr[0] * arr[3])` if `arr[j] < arr[3]`, otherwise it remains `arr[3]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 3**
