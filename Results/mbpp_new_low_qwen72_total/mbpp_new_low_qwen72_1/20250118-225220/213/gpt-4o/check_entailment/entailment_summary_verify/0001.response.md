Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the function `func_1` and its approach to solving the problem. Here is a detailed analysis to verify the correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `max_products` with zeros and sets `max_products[0]` to `arr[0]`. This initialization is correct because the maximum product of a subsequence ending at the first element is the element itself.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each element of the array starting from the second element (`i` from 1 to `n-1`).
   - The inner loop iterates over all previous elements (`j` from 0 to `i-1`). If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, it means the subsequence can be extended by including `arr[i]`.
   - The program updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`. This ensures that `max_products[i]` always holds the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After filling the `max_products` array, the function returns the maximum value from this array. This value represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the input array.

The provided test cases are indeed correct and cover different scenarios:
- `[3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]` should yield `3000` (subsequence: [3, 100, 150]).
- `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]` should yield `50265600` (subsequence: [4, 42, 55, 68, 80]).
- `[10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]` should yield `2460` (subsequence: [10, 22, 33, 50, 60]).

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, confirming that the function handles the problem as described.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
