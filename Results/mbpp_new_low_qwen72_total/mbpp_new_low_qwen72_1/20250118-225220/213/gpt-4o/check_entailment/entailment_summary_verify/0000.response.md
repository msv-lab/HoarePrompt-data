### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence in the array. This means we need to identify subsequences where each element is greater than the previous one and compute the product of these subsequences to find the maximum product.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `max_products` with the same length as the input array `arr`. Each element in `max_products` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at that index.
   - The first element of `max_products` is set to the first element of `arr` because a single-element subsequence is trivially increasing.
   - The function then iterates through the array starting from the second element. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if they form an increasing subsequence (`arr[j] < arr[i]`). If they do, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value in `max_products`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Array**: The function correctly returns 0 for an empty array, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - **Single Element Array**: For an array with a single element, the function correctly returns that element itself.
   - **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function does not handle negative numbers or zero specially. However, since the problem does not specify any constraints on the sign of the elements, the function's behavior is acceptable. The product of negative numbers will be handled correctly as long as the subsequence is strictly increasing.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are:
     - `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000`: The increasing subsequence `[3, 100, 150]` has a product of `3 * 100 * 150 = 45000`, but the maximum product of any increasing subsequence is `3 * 100 * 5 = 1500` and `3 * 100 * 6 = 1800`, which is not the expected output. This suggests a potential issue.
     - `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80]) == 50265600`: The increasing subsequence `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]` has a product of `4 * 42 * 55 * 68 * 80 = 50265600`, which is correct.
     - `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]) == 2460`: The increasing subsequence `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]` has a product of `10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 21780000`, which is not the expected output. This suggests another potential issue.

5. **Re-evaluation**:
   - The function logic appears to be correct in terms of identifying increasing subsequences and computing their products.
   - However, the test cases provided do not match the expected outputs. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the expected results.
   - Given the function's logic and the provided function summary, the function should correctly identify and compute the maximum product of an increasing subsequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the re-evaluation and the provided function summary, the function logic appears to be correct, but the test cases provided do not match the expected outputs. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate due to the mismatch in the test cases.

Final: **False**
