Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing sublist of the array. The function initializes an array `max_products` where each element represents the maximum product that can be achieved up to that index, considering only increasing sublists. It iterates through the array, updating the `max_products` for each index by checking all previous elements to see if they form an increasing sequence. The final result is the maximum value in the `max_products` array. The test cases provided in the problem description also pass, indicating that the function works correctly for those inputs. After reviewing the logic and edge cases, such as empty arrays and arrays with negative numbers, the function seems to handle these scenarios appropriately, making it correct for all potential cases.
