Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the given list `arr`. The implementation uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum product that can be achieved ending at each position in the list. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `n` to the length of `arr`.
   - It checks if `n` is 0, and if so, returns 0. This handles the edge case of an empty list.
   - It initializes `max_products` to a list of zeros with the same length as `arr`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `max_products[0]` is set to `arr[0]`, as the maximum product of a subsequence ending at the first element is the element itself.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element.
   - The inner loop iterates over all previous elements to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element.
   - If a previous element `arr[j]` is less than the current element `arr[i]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After the loops, the function returns the maximum value from `max_products`, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the list.

The test cases provided in the comments (`assert` statements) are consistent with the expected behavior of the function. The function correctly handles the edge case of an empty list and computes the maximum product of an increasing subsequence for non-empty lists.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
