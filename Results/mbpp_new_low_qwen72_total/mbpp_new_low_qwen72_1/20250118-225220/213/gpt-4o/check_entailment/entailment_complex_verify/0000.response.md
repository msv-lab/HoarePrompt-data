Reasoning: 

The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence of an array. The approach used is dynamic programming, where `max_products[i]` stores the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

### Key Points in the Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_products` is initialized to `[0] * n`, where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`.
   - `max_products[0]` is set to `arr[0]` because the maximum product of a subsequence ending at the first element is the element itself.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, updating `max_products[i]` for each `i`.
   - Initially, `max_products[i]` is set to `arr[i]` to handle the case where no previous element forms an increasing subsequence with `arr[i]`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop iterates from `0` to `i-1`, checking if `arr[j] < arr[i]` to ensure the subsequence is increasing.
   - If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, it updates `max_products[i]` to the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the maximum value from the `max_products` list, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness**: The original assessment states that the function is correct. This is supported by the following observations:
  - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem.
  - The initialization and update steps correctly handle the conditions for forming an increasing subsequence.
  - The test cases provided in the problem description pass, which indicates that the function works correctly for those specific inputs.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty Array**: The function correctly returns `0` for an empty array.
  - **Negative Numbers**: The function does not handle negative numbers differently, but the product calculation is correct as long as the subsequence is increasing. Negative numbers can still form valid increasing subsequences.
  - **Zero Values**: Zero values are treated like any other number, and the function correctly handles them as part of the subsequence.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in an array. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible increasing subsequences are considered, and the maximum product is computed accurately.

Final: **True**
