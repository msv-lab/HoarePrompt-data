Reasoning:  
The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence within the input array. The approach taken is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum product ending at each index. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to the length of the input array `arr`.
   - If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty array cannot form any product.
   - `max_products` is initialized as a list of zeros with the same length as `arr`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `max_products[0]` is set to `arr[0]` because the maximum product of a subsequence ending at the first element is the element itself.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` starting from the second element (index 1), the algorithm iterates over all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, it means `arr[i]` can extend the subsequence ending at `arr[j]`.
   - The maximum product ending at `arr[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After the loops, `max_products` contains the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at each index.
   - The function returns the maximum value from `max_products`, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.

The provided test cases are:
- `func_1([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])` should return 3000.
- `func_1([4, 42, 55, 68, 80])` should return 50265600.
- `func_1([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60])` should return 2460.

Let's verify these test cases:
- For `[3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]`, the increasing subsequences are `[3, 100, 150]` with a product of 3 * 100 * 150 = 45000 and `[3, 4, 5, 6]` with a product of 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 360. The maximum product is 45000, but the expected result is 3000, which seems incorrect.
- For `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]`, the increasing subsequence is `[4, 42, 55, 68, 80]` with a product of 4 * 42 * 55 * 68 * 80 = 50265600, which matches the expected result.
- For `[10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]`, the increasing subsequences are `[10, 22, 33, 50, 60]` with a product of 10 * 22 * 33 * 50 * 60 = 21780000 and `[9, 21, 41, 60]` with a product of 9 * 21 * 41 * 60 = 476280. The maximum product is 21780000, but the expected result is 2460, which seems incorrect.

Given the discrepancies in the test cases, the provided solution does not match the expected results for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
