Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of a strictly increasing subsequence in the given list `arr`. The implementation uses dynamic programming to build up a list `max_products` where each element at index `i` represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_products` with the same length as `arr`, setting each element initially to the corresponding element in `arr`. This ensures that if no increasing subsequence is found for an element, it defaults to itself.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: The outer loop iterates through each element in `arr`, starting from the second element. For each element `arr[i]`, the inner loop checks all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`). If `arr[j]` is less than `arr[i]`, it means that `arr[j]` can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`. The function then updates `max_products[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_products[j]` and `arr[i]`.

3. **Result Calculation**: After filling the `max_products` list, the function returns the maximum value from this list, which represents the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in `arr`.

The provided test cases and the execution summary confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list and ensures that the subsequence is strictly increasing.

Therefore, the function appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
