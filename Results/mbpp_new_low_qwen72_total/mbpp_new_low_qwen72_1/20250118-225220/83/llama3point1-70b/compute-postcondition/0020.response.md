Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the first `n - 2` elements of `arr` are reversed, and `max_index` is updated to the index of the maximum element in the new `arr[:n-2]`, while `arr[size:]` remains unchanged. If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, and `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`.***
