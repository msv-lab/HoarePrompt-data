The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist from the start of `arr` up to and including the element at `max_index`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `size` is `n - 1`.
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`.

After executing the code:
- The sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.
- The rest of the list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.**
