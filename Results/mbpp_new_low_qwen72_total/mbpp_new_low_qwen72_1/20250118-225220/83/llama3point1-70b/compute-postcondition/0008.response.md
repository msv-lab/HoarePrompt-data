Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:n]` is reversed, and the new `max_index` becomes `size - 1 - max_index`. If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:n]` remains unchanged, and `max_index` retains its original value.***
