The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist of `arr` from the start up to and including the element at `max_index`. This means that the elements from the start of the list up to the maximum element (inclusive) will be reversed in their positions.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements
- `n` is greater than 0
- `size` is `n`
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n]`
- The current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`
- The current value of `max_index` is not equal to 0

After executing the code, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` will be reversed. The rest of the list remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `size`, and `max_index` are not altered by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements where the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n]`, the current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, and the current value of `max_index` is not equal to 0**
