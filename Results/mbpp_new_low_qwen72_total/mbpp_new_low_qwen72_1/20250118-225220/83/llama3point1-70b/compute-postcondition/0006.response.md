Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n]`, and the current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.***
