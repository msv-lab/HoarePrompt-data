The code updates the `max_index` to the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`. Given that `size` is `n - 1`, this means `max_index` is now the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:n-1]`.

Since `max_index` was already defined as the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`, the value of `max_index` does not actually change. However, the assignment confirms its correctness.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`**.
