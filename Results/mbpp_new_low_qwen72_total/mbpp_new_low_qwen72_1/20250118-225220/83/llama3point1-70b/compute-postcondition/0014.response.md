Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `arr[:n-1]` is reversed, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the new `arr[:n-1]`. If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged.***
