To determine the final output state after the loop has completed its execution, we need to follow the provided steps and analyze the behavior of the loop over multiple iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `size` from `n` down to `1`.
   - In each iteration, it finds the index of the maximum element in the first `size` elements of `arr`.
   - If the maximum element is not already at the end of the current segment (`size - 1`), it performs one or two reversals to move the maximum element to the end of the segment.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**:
     - `n` remains constant as it is the length of the array.
     - `arr` is modified within the loop but its length remains `n`.
   - **Changing Variables**:
     - `size` decreases from `n` to `1` in each iteration.
     - `max_index` changes based on the maximum element in the current segment of `arr`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration of the loop ensures that the maximum element in the first `size` elements is moved to the position `size - 1`.
   - This process continues until `size` reaches `1`, ensuring that the largest element in the entire array is moved to the last position, the second largest to the second last, and so on.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After each iteration, the segment `arr[:size]` is partially sorted such that the largest element in this segment is moved to the end.
   - By the time `size` reaches `1`, the entire array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Final Output State

- **Variables**:
  - `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - `n` remains the same as the initial length of `arr`.
  - `size` will be `0` after the loop finishes, but since `size` is only used within the loop, it is not relevant in the final state outside the loop.

- **Conditions**:
  - The loop will execute as long as `size` is greater than `0`.
  - If `n` is `0`, the loop will not execute at all, and `arr` will remain an empty list.

### Conclusion

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `size` is `0` (though `size` is not relevant in the final state).**
