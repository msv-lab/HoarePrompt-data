The code snippet `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the sublist `arr[:size]`, where `size` is `n - 1`. This means the first `n - 1` elements of the list `arr` are reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `size` is `n - 1`.
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-1]`.

If `max_index` is not 0, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet, the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, and the rest of the list remains the same. The value of `max_index` may change because the order of elements in `arr[:size]` has been altered.

Output State: **`arr[:n-1]` is reversed, `arr[n-1:]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the new `arr[:n-1]`.**
