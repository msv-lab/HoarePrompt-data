The only object in the loop head is the variable `size`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `size` by 1 each time. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `size` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `size` is `n`.
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `size` must be decremented by 1, so `size` is now `n - 1`.

The other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `max_index`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n - 1]`.**
