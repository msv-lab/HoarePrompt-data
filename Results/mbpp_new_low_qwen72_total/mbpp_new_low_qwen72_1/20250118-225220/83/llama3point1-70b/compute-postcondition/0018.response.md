Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, and `max_index` is updated to `n - 3`. If `max_index` is equal to 0, `arr` remains unchanged.***
