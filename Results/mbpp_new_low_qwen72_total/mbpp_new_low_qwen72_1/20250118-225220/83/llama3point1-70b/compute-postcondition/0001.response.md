The only variables in the loop head are `size` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the initial value of `n` and the range definition. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `1`.

Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, and `n` is the length of `arr`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`, and `size` will be initialized to `n` when the loop starts.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
