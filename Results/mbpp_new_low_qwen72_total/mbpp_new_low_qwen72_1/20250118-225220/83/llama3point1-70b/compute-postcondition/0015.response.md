The only objects in the loop head are the variable `size` and the range parameters `n` and `0`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing `size` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `size` was `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `arr[:n-2]` is reversed, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the new `arr[:n-2]`. If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged.**
