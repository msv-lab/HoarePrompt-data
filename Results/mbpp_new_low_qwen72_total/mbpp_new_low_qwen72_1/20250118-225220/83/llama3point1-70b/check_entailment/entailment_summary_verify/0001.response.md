Reasoning:

The original assessment is largely accurate, but let's delve deeper into the function's behavior to ensure there are no hidden issues or edge cases that might cause problems.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Outer Loop (`for size in range(n, 0, -1)`):**
   - This loop iterates over the list from the last element to the first, effectively reducing the size of the unsorted portion of the list by one in each iteration.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element (`max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`):**
   - This line finds the index of the maximum element in the current unsorted portion of the list (`arr[:size]`).

3. **Condition Check (`if max_index != size - 1`):**
   - This condition checks if the maximum element is not already at the end of the current unsorted portion. If it is, no action is needed.

4. **Reversing Sublists:**
   - If the maximum element is not at the start of the array (`if max_index != 0`), it reverses the portion of the array up to and including the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`). This brings the maximum element to the front of the current unsorted portion.
   - It then reverses the entire current unsorted portion (`arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`), moving the maximum element to the end of the unsorted portion.

### Edge Cases and Test Cases

- **Empty List:**
  - `func_1([])` should return `[]`.
  - **Test:** `assert func_1([]) == []`
  - **Result:** Passes

- **Single Element List:**
  - `func_1([1])` should return `[1]`.
  - **Test:** `assert func_1([1]) == [1]`
  - **Result:** Passes

- **List with Multiple Elements:**
  - `func_1([3, 1, 2])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - **Test:** `assert func_1([3, 1, 2]) == [1, 2, 3]`
  - **Result:** Passes

- **List with Descending Order:**
  - `func_1([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - **Test:** `assert func_1([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - **Result:** Passes

- **List with Duplicates:**
  - `func_1([3, 1, 2, 3, 1])` should return `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.
  - **Test:** `assert func_1([3, 1, 2, 3, 1]) == [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`
  - **Result:** Passes

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` indeed sorts the list in non-decreasing order using a unique approach involving sublist reversals. The original assessment correctly identified the algorithm and verified its correctness through several test cases. The function handles all edge cases and typical use cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
