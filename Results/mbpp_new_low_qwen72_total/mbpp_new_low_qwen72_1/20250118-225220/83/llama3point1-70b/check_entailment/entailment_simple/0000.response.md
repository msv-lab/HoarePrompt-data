Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` attempts to sort a list `arr` using a variation of the selection sort algorithm, but with a twist: instead of swapping the maximum element directly with the last unsorted element, it performs a series of reversals to move the maximum element to its correct position.

Let's break down the function step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(arr)`: This initializes `n` with the length of the list `arr`.
   - The `for` loop iterates from `n` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means that `size` will take values from `n` down to `1`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`: This finds the index of the maximum element in the first `size` elements of the list.

3. **Reversal Operations**:
   - If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` (i.e., the maximum element is not already in its correct position):
     - If `max_index` is not `0`:
       - `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`: This reverses the sublist from the start of the list up to and including `max_index`. This moves the maximum element to the start of this sublist.
     - `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`: This reverses the sublist from the start of the list up to and including `size - 1`. This moves the maximum element to the end of this sublist, which is its correct position.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the `for` loop completes, the list `arr` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function returns `arr`.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a few points:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.
- The reversal operations ensure that the maximum element is moved to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.
- The loop continues until all elements are in their correct positions, ensuring the list is sorted.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly sort the list as intended.

Correctness: **True**
