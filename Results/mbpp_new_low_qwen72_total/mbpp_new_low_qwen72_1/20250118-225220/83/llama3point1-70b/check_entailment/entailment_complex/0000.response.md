### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to sort a list of comparable elements in non-decreasing order. It uses a variant of the selection sort algorithm, where it repeatedly finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the end of the unsorted portion.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates from the length of the list down to 1, effectively reducing the size of the unsorted portion of the list.
   - **Finding Maximum**: In each iteration, the function finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion (`max_index`).
   - **Swapping Elements**: If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion, the function performs swaps by reversing sublists:
     - If `max_index` is not 0, it reverses the sublist from the start to `max_index + 1` to bring the maximum element to the front.
     - It then reverses the entire unsorted portion (`arr[:size]`) to move the maximum element to the end of the unsorted portion.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is correctly sorted.
   - **Single Element List**: If the input list has only one element, the function will return the list as-is, which is also correctly sorted.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the for loop completes, the list `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function returns the sorted list `arr`.

5. **Comments**:
   - The comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, including before and after the for loop.
   - The final comment confirms that the function returns a sorted list in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly sorts a list of comparable elements in non-decreasing order using a variant of the selection sort algorithm. The comments accurately reflect the state of the program and the functionality of the function.

Correctness: **True**
