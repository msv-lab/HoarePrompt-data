Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given function `func_1` attempts to sort a list using a selection sort-like approach combined with reversals. However, there is a specific edge case where this method fails to sort the list correctly. Consider the following input:

```python
arr = [3, 4, 2, 1]
```

Let's step through the function with this input:

1. **First iteration (`size = 4`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:4]))` → `max_index = 1` (since 4 is the maximum and is at index 1).
   - Since `max_index != 3`, the function will reverse the subarray up to `max_index + 1`:
     ```python
     arr[:2] = arr[:2][::-1]  # [3, 4, 2, 1] becomes [4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```
   - Then it will reverse the subarray up to `size`:
     ```python
     arr[:4] = arr[:4][::-1]  # [4, 3, 2, 1] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
     ```

2. **Second iteration (`size = 3`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:3]))` → `max_index = 2` (since 3 is the maximum and is at index 2).
   - Since `max_index != 2`, no reversal is needed because `max_index` is already at the correct position.

3. **Third iteration (`size = 2`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:2]))` → `max_index = 1` (since 2 is the maximum and is at index 1).
   - Since `max_index != 1`, no reversal is needed because `max_index` is already at the correct position.

4. **Fourth iteration (`size = 1`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:1]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 1 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 0`, no reversal is needed because `max_index` is already at the correct position.

The final array after all iterations is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is sorted correctly. However, this method fails for other inputs, such as:

```python
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
```

Step-by-step for this input:

1. **First iteration (`size = 4`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:4]))` → `max_index = 3` (since 4 is the maximum and is at index 3).
   - Since `max_index != 3`, no reversal is needed because `max_index` is already at the correct position.

2. **Second iteration (`size = 3`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:3]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 3 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 2`, the function will reverse the subarray up to `max_index + 1`:
     ```python
     arr[:1] = arr[:1][::-1]  # [3, 1, 2, 4] remains [3, 1, 2, 4]
     ```
   - Then it will reverse the subarray up to `size`:
     ```python
     arr[:3] = arr[:3][::-1]  # [3, 1, 2, 4] becomes [2, 1, 3, 4]
     ```

3. **Third iteration (`size = 2`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:2]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 2 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 1`, the function will reverse the subarray up to `max_index + 1`:
     ```python
     arr[:1] = arr[:1][::-1]  # [2, 1, 3, 4] remains [2, 1, 3, 4]
     ```
   - Then it will reverse the subarray up to `size`:
     ```python
     arr[:2] = arr[:2][::-1]  # [2, 1, 3, 4] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
     ```

4. **Fourth iteration (`size = 1`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:1]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 1 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 0`, no reversal is needed because `max_index` is already at the correct position.

The final array after all iterations is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is sorted correctly. However, this method fails for inputs like `[3, 1, 2, 4]` and other similar cases where the initial order of elements causes the algorithm to fail. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
