Reasoning: 

The original assessment identifies a potential issue with the sorting algorithm used in `func_1`. The function indeed uses a variant of selection sort combined with sublist reversals to move the maximum element to the end of the unsorted portion of the list. However, the original assessment's conclusion that the function fails for certain inputs, such as `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the function step-by-step for the input `[3, 1, 2, 4]`:

1. **First iteration (`size = 4`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:4]))` → `max_index = 3` (since 4 is the maximum and is at index 3).
   - Since `max_index == 3`, no action is taken, and the array remains `[3, 1, 2, 4]`.

2. **Second iteration (`size = 3`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:3]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 3 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 2`, the function will reverse the subarray up to `max_index + 1`:
     ```python
     arr[:1] = arr[:1][::-1]  # [3, 1, 2, 4] remains [3, 1, 2, 4]
     ```
   - Then it will reverse the subarray up to `size`:
     ```python
     arr[:3] = arr[:3][::-1]  # [3, 1, 2, 4] becomes [2, 1, 3, 4]
     ```

3. **Third iteration (`size = 2`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:2]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 2 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index != 1`, the function will reverse the subarray up to `max_index + 1`:
     ```python
     arr[:1] = arr[:1][::-1]  # [2, 1, 3, 4] remains [2, 1, 3, 4]
     ```
   - Then it will reverse the subarray up to `size`:
     ```python
     arr[:2] = arr[:2][::-1]  # [2, 1, 3, 4] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
     ```

4. **Fourth iteration (`size = 1`)**:
   - `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:1]))` → `max_index = 0` (since 1 is the maximum and is at index 0).
   - Since `max_index == 0`, no action is taken, and the array remains `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

After all iterations, the array `[3, 1, 2, 4]` is correctly sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Given this detailed step-by-step evaluation, the function `func_1` appears to work correctly for the provided test cases and the general problem of sorting a list. The original assessment incorrectly identified a failure case, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

Final: **True**
