Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` implements a sorting algorithm that is a variant of selection sort. It works by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the end of the unsorted portion. This is achieved by reversing sublists rather than swapping elements directly. The function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element, which are already sorted.

The key steps in the function are:
1. Iterate over the list from the end to the beginning.
2. For each iteration, find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.
3. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the unsorted portion, reverse the sublist up to and including the maximum element to bring it to the front.
4. Reverse the entire unsorted portion to move the maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.
5. Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.

Based on the execution summary, the function correctly sorts the list in non-decreasing order and modifies the original list in place. The algorithm is efficient enough for small to moderately sized lists and correctly handles all edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
