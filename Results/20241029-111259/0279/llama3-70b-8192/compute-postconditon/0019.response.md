Output State: **`max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; if `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited. Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `2 * max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `2 * min_speed`.**
