`speeds` is assigned a list of `t` zeros, where `t` is an input integer. The states of `v1`, `v2`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros**.
