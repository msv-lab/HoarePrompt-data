`t` and `d` are assigned new values from input. The previous constraints on `t` (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) and `d` (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10) are replaced by the new input values. The states of `v1` and `v2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers**
