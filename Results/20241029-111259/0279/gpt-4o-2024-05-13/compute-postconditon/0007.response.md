`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, and `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `i` is 2. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, and `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `i` is 2**.
