According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `t` is greater than 2. Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue executing, `t` must be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 3**
