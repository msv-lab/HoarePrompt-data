Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[3]` is `min(speeds[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)`, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 3**.
