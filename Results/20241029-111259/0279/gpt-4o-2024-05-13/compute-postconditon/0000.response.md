`v1` and `v2` are reassigned values based on the input, which are obtained as two integers from `input().split()`. The initial constraints on `v_1` and `v_2` are not retained after reassignment, so the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**
