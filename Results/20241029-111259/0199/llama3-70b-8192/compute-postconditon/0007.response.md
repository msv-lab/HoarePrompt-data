`high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The previous value of `high` was the minimum element in `v`, and `mid` was `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `high` is updated to `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is an input list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `mid` and each element `x` in `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is an input list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `mid` and each element `x` in `v`**.
