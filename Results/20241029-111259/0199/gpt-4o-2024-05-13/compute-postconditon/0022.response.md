The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The states of `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1; `a` and `b` are integers with `a` updated to `a - b` if `a` > `b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b - a`**
