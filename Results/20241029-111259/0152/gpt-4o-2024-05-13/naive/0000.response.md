RESULT: **Correct**

The function `min_time_to_prepare_potions` correctly calculates the minimum time needed to prepare at least `n` potions considering the constraints and spell effects described. It evaluates the impact of using each type of spell individually and in combination, keeping track of the minimum time required. The logic aligns with the problem description, considering all constraints and possibilities for using the spells within the given mana points limit.
