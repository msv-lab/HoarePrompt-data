The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than 0; `remaining_manapoints` is `s` minus `b[i]` where `i` is a negative index; `j` is `k + 2` and `k` is less than -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
