`s` is assigned the value `int(data[4])`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is `int(data[0])`, `m` is `int(data[1])`, `k` is `int(data[2])`, `x` is `int(data[3])`, `s` is `int(data[4])`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[0])`, `m` is `int(data[1])`, `k` is `int(data[2])`, `x` is `int(data[3])`, `s` is `int(data[4])`**
