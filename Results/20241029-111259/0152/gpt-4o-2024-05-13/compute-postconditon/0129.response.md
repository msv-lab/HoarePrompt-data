`x` is assigned the integer value of the fourth element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[3])`. The states of other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `int(data[0])`, `m` is `int(data[1])`, `k` is `int(data[2])`, `x` is `int(data[3])`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[0])`, `m` is `int(data[1])`, `k` is `int(data[2])`, `x` is `int(data[3])`**
