According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, and `i` is increased by 1. However, since `i` starts as non-negative (`i` is initialized to `k`, which is non-negative), the condition `i < 0` will not be satisfied unless `i` is explicitly set to a negative value.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is negative. Therefore, we can set `i` to a negative value.

State: **`i` is less than 0**
