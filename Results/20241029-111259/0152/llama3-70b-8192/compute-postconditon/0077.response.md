Output State: **`cnt` is initialized to 0; if `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j]`. If the loop executed at least once, `j` is decremented by 1, and if `k` is 0 or `s_left` was initially less than `d[0]`, `j` remains -1. `s_left` remains unchanged from its value after the loop execution or stays as `s - b[i]` if the loop did not execute. `ans` is set to the minimum of its current value and `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`.**
