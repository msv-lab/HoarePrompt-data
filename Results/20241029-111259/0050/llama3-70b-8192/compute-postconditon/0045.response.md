To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided examples:

1. The loop condition is `while i < 0`, meaning the loop will only execute if `i` is initially less than 0.
2. Inside the loop, if `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is incremented by `shares * b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop breaks.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each loop iteration.

Now, let's establish the output state step by step:

- If `i` is initially greater than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute at all. Thus, all variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i`) will remain unchanged.
- If `i` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute. 
  - During each iteration, if `shares` is greater than 0, `r` will be updated, and `shares` will be set to 0. 
  - If `shares` is not greater than 0 at any time during the loop, the loop will break.
  - `i` will be incremented by 1 after each loop iteration.

Considering these observations, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **If `i` is initially less than 0 and `shares` is greater than 0, `r` will be incremented by `shares * b[i]`, `shares` will be set to 0, and `i` will be incremented until it is greater than or equal to 0 or `shares` becomes 0. If `i` is initially greater than or equal to 0 or `shares` is not greater than 0, all variables remain unchanged, and the loop does not execute.**
