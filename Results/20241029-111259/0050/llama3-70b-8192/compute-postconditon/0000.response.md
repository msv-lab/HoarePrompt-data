`n`, `m`, and `r` are reassigned values from the input provided split into three integers. The original constraints remain the same, but the specific values are determined by the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 1000.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers each between 1 and 1000.**
