According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to remain less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than 0**
