`s[i]` accesses the element at index `i` in list `s`. The value of `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]`. Since `i` is less than 0, `s[i]` accesses an element from the end of `s`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are needed for calculation, but they remain unchanged except for `shares`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0; `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` are unchanged; `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`. 

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0; `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` are unchanged; `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`**.
