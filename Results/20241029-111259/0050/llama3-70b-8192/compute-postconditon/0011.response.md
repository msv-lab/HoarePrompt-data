The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1; `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are unchanged**
