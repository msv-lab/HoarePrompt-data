`left_count[i]` is assigned the value of `left_count[i] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `right_count[0]` is 1; `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
