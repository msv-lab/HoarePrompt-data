Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` is greater than 0. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` hold true, then `bottom_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged.***
