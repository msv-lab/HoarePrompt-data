Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input as specified: the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas in various directions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Sofa Representation**:
   - Each sofa is represented as a tuple of coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of the two cells covered by the sofa. This representation is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa within the same row or column.
   - It correctly iterates over all sofas except the given one and updates the counts based on their relative positions.
   - The function ensures that no undefined behavior occurs even if the `sofas` list is empty by handling only non-self comparisons.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program iterates over each sofa and uses `func_1` to get the counts of sofas in various directions.
   - If the calculated counts match the given counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`), it prints the index of the sofa and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no matching sofa is found, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.
  - It ensures that the counts are calculated relative to the position of the given sofa, which is crucial for determining the correct sofa based on the provided conditions.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the input list of sofas might be empty, but since it explicitly excludes the current sofa from counting, it avoids undefined behavior.
  - It correctly checks if the counts match the required conditions for each sofa.

Given the detailed implementation and the verification of each step, the program adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all valid inputs. Thus, the program is correct.
