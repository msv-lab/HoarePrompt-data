`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is such that `i = j + 1`, and the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The condition `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` does not change the fact that `right_count[i]` could be incremented, but since it is not specified whether this condition is met, we only know that `left_count[i]` has been incremented.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
