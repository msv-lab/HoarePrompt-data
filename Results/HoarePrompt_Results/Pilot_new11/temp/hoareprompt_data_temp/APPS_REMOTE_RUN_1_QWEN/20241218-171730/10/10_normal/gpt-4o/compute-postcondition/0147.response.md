`top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `bottom_count[i]` is determined by the condition `if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j`, which may or may not be true. Since the condition is not met (as stated in the precondition), `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
