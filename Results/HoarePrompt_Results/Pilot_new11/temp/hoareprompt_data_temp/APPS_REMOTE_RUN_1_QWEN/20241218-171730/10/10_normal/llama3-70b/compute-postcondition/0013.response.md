`bottom` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `bottom` is 0, so after executing `bottom += 1`, the value of `bottom` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` must have at least one tuple. `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1. `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`.**
