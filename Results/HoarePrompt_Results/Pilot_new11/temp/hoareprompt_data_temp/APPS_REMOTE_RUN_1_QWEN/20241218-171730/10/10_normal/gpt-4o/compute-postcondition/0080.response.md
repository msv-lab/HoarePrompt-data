Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` is greater than 0. If the condition `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` holds true, both `top_count[0]` and `bottom_count[0]` are 1 more than their original values. Otherwise, the values of `top_count[0]` and `bottom_count[0]` remain unchanged.***
