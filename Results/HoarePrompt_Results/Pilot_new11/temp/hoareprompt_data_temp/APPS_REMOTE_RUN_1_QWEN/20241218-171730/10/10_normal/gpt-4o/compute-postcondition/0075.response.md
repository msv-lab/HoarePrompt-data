Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` is greater than 0; `x1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`. If `(x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j)` holds true, then `right_count[0]` is 1, `left_count[0]` is 1; otherwise, `right_count[0]` remains unchanged.**
