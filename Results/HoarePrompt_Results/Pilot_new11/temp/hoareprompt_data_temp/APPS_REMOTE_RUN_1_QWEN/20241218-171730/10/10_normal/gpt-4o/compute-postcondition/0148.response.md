Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1 and `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs in both `top_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]`.***
