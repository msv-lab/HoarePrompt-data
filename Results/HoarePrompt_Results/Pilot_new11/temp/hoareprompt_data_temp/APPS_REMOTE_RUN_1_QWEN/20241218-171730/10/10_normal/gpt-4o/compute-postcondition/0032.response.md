`bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0, so `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`; `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`; `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
