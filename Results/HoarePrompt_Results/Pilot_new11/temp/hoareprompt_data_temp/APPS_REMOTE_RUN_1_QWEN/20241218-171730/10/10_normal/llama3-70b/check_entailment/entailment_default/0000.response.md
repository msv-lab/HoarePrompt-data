Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly count the number of sofas in the specified directions. Specifically, the function `func_1` only considers sofas that share the same row or column as the current sofa, but it fails to consider sofas that are directly to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current sofa without sharing the same row or column. For example, if a sofa is at (1, 1) and there is another sofa at (2, 1), the code will not count this as a sofa to the right because they are not in the same row. Similarly, it will not count a sofa at (1, 2) as a sofa above because they are not in the same column.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the current implementation will not correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom. It will fail to identify that the second sofa is to the left of the first sofa, leading to incorrect counts.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
