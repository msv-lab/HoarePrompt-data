Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` equals `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the values from the tuple `sofas[j]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` is 1 and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
