Postcondition: ***`sofas` must have at least one tuple. The values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are determined based on the condition `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]`. If the condition is true, `left` is set to 1, and `right` remains 0. Otherwise, `left` remains 0, and `right` is set to 1. The values of `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged at 0. The current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. Additionally, the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s`. Now, the condition `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]` is true, so `left` is set to 1 and `right` remains 0.***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and specifies the changes due to the if condition being met.
