The code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` unpacks the tuple `sofas[j]` into the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since the initial state specifies that `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element, `x2_j` is the third element, and `y2_j` is the fourth element, the unpacking simply reassigns these elements to the corresponding variables.

Given that the condition `i == j` is false, the else part executes, and the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are reassigned from the elements of `sofas[j]`.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`**
