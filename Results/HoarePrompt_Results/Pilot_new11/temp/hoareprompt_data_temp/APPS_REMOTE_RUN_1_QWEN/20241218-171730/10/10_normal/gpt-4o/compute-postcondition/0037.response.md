Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples.
   - `i` is 0 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`.
   - `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`.
   - `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`.
   - `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `d-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.

4. **Relevant Values for Next Iteration**: 
   - Since `j` becomes 1, we need to look at the second tuple in the list `sofas`.
   - `x1_j` will now be the first element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `y1_j` will now be the second element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `x2_j` will now be the third element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `y2_j` will now be the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.

5. **Other States**: 
   - The values of `i`, `sofas`, `top_count[0]`, and `bottom_count[0]` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop over `j`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
- `j` should be 1.
- `x1_j` should be the first element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y1_j` should be the second element of `sofas[1]`.
- `x2_j` should be the third element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y2_j` should be the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.

State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.**
