The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The initial state indicates that `d` is at least 1, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers. The variable `sofas` is a list containing tuples, but its contents are not altered by this code.

Since the input values are not specified, we'll represent them generically as input integers. The output state will reflect the updated values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, while `d` remains at least 1 and `sofas` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and possibly more.**
