The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` equals `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the values from the tuple `sofas[j+1]`**
