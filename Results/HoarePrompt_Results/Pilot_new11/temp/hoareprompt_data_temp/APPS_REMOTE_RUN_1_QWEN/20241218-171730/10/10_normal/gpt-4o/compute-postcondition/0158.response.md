`target_sofa` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The value of `i` is `d`, so `target_sofa` becomes `d + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `d`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `left_count[i]` is 0, `right_count[i]` is 0, `top_count[i]` is 0, `bottom_count[i]` is 0, `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries, `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries, `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries, `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries, `target_sofa` is `d + 1`.**
