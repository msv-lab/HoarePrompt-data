Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples.
   - `i` is 0 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`.
   - `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.
   - If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `top_count[0]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `d-1`.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Condition:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `d`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` is not relevant here as we are only concerned with the next value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `j`.

**State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `top_count[0]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
