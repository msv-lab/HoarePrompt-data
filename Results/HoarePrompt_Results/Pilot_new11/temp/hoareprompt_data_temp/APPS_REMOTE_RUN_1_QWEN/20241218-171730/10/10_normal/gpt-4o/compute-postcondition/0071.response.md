Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` is greater than 0. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
