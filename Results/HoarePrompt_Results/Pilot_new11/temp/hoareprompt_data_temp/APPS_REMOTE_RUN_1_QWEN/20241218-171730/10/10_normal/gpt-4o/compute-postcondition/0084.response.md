The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since the condition `i == j` is true, all the variables retain their original values as specified in the precondition. Therefore, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are updated to the corresponding elements of `sofas[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `d` is greater than 0.**
