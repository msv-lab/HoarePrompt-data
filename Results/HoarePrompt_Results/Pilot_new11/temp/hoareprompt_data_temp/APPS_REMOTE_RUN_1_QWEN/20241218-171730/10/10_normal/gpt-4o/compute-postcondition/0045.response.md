The code `bottom_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `bottom_count[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, this means `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`
- `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`
- `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`
- `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`
- `bottom_count[0]` is increased by 1

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `bottom_count[0]` is increased by 1**
