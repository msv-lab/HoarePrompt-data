The value of `i` is 0, and the value of `right_count[i]` (which is `right_count[0]`) is 1 or 2. The code increments `right_count[i]` by 1, so `right_count[0]` will be 2 or 3. The values of `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 2`, `right_count[0]` is 2 or 3, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 2]`**
