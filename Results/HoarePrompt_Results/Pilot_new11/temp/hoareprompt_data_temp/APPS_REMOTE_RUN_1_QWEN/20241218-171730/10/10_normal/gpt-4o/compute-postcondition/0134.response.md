Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` equals `j`. `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 and `left_count[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
