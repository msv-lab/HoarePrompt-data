Postcondition: ***`left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 2, and `bottom` is either 1 or 2. This is determined by whether the condition `sofa[0][1] > s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]` is met. If the condition is true and `bottom` was initially 1, then `bottom` becomes 2. Otherwise, `bottom` remains as its initial value (either 1 or 2).***
