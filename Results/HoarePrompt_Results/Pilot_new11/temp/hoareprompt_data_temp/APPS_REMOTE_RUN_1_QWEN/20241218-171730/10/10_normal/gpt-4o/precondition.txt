d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; the coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) of each sofa are integers such that 1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m, and the cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have a common side; no cell is covered by more than one sofa; cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, and cnt_b are integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.
