The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. Therefore, the variables `i`, `j`, and `right_count` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 2`, `right_count[0]` is 1 or 2**
