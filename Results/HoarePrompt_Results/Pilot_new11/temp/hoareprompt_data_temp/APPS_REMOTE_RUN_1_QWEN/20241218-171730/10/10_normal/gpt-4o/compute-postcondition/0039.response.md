Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`. Since the condition `i == j` evaluates to false, none of the actions within the if or else blocks are executed, so the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
