Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is the original value of `right_count[i]` plus 1. Otherwise, the value of `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
