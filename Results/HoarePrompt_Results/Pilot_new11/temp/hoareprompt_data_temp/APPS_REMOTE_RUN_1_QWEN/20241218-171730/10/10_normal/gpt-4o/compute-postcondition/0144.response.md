Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs in `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remains as it was before the if statement execution.***
