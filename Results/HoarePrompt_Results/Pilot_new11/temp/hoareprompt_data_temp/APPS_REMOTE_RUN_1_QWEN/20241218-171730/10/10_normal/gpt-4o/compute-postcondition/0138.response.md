The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`**
