Output State: **`i` is `d - 1`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `right_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` for each `j` where `i != j`, `left_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` for each `j` where `i != j`, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` for each `j` where `i != j`, `top_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` for each `j` where `i != j`, and `d` is a positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `d` times, iterating over each index `j` from 0 to `d-1`.
- For each iteration, if `i` is not equal to `j`, the conditions are checked and counts are updated accordingly.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `d - 1` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues until `i` reaches `d - 1`.
- The counts `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` will reflect the number of times the respective conditions were met for each `j` where `i != j`.
