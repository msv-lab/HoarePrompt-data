The code appends a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers, and `d` is at least 2. After appending, the length of the `sofas` list increases by one, but the individual values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The value of `d` is also unaffected.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer; `sofas` is now a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and possibly more, depending on previous operations.**
