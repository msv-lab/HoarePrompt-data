Postcondition: ***`left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 2, and `bottom` is 2 if initially `bottom` was 1, otherwise `bottom` remains 1. This holds true if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`. If the condition is not met, `left` remains 1 and `top` remains 2, with `bottom` either being 1 or 2 as initially specified.***
