According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `d-1`. The loop body modifies the counts (`left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`) based on the conditions involving `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` from the tuple `sofas[j]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `i` is an integer
- `j` is an integer
- `i` equals `j`
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the values from the tuple `sofas[j]`
- If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Since `i` equals `j`, `i` also needs to be incremented by 1.
- The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will come from the next tuple in the list `sofas`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the new states will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `j` is incremented by 1

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` equals `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the values from the tuple `sofas[j+1]`**
