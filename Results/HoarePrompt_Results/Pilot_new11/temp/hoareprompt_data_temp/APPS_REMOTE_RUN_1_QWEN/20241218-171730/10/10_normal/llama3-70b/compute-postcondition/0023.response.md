The code `bottom += 1` increments the value of `bottom` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains 0 (since the condition `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]` was not met).
- `top` remains 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise it is 1 more than its previous value (which is 0, so it becomes 1).
- `bottom` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1 greater than its previous value**.
