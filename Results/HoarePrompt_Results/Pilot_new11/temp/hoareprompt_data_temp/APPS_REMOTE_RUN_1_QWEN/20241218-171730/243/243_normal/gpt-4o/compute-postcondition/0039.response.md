`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is `mid`**
