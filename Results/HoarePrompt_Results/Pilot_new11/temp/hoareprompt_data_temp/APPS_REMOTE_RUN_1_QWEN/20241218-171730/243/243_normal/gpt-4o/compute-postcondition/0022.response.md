To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition `func_1(right) == m`. Let's break down the state and analyze what needs to be adjusted:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
   - `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)
   - `result` is an empty list
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\)

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute if `func_1(right) == m`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\)
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   To make `func_1(right) == m` true, `func_1(right)` must return `m`. Since `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\), we need to ensure that the function `func_1` evaluated at this point returns `m`.

Given the current values, no direct adjustment to the state of `right` or any other variables is necessary because `right` is already set as \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\). The function `func_1` must be designed to return `m` when evaluated at this point.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the function `func_1` and its behavior, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `func_1(right)` returns `m`. Therefore, the state remains as described, but we need to confirm that the function `func_1` is correctly implemented to satisfy this condition.

Thus, the state right before the loop should remain as described without any changes:

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is 0; `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\)**

The function `func_1` must be correctly implemented to ensure `func_1(right) == m`.
