The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state where `left` is equal to `mid - 2`, after this operation, `left` will be equal to `mid - 3`.

The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\).
- `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`.
- `left` must be adjusted to `mid - 1` such that `func_1(mid - 1) == m`.

After decrementing `left` by 1, the new value of `left` is `mid - 3`. Therefore, the loop condition `func_1(left) == m` will now check if `func_1(mid - 3) == m`.

The updated state is:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\).
- `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`.
- `left` is now equal to `mid - 3` with `func_1(mid - 3) == m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`, and `left` is equal to `mid - 3` with `func_1(mid - 3) == m`.**
