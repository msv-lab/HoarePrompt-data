`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The function `func_1` is called with `mid` as its argument, and `mid` is calculated as \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\). The values of the other variables (`low`, `high`, `m`, `mid`, and `result`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
