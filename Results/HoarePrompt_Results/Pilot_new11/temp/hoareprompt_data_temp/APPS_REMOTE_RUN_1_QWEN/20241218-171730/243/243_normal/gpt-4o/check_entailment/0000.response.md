Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the range of numbers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the case where the number of trailing zeroes is exactly \( m \). Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Trailing Zeroes Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) using the formula based on the number of factors of 5 in \( n! \).

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. However, there are issues with how the binary search is implemented and the range is determined:
   - The binary search is set up with `low = 0` and `high = 5 * (m + 1)`, which might not always cover the full range of \( n \).
   - The logic for updating `low` and `high` and the final range determination is flawed. For example, if `zeroes` is equal to \( m \), the code attempts to find the range `[left, right)` where both `func_1(left)` and `func_1(right)` equal \( m \), but this does not guarantee that the range includes all valid \( n \).

3. **Potential Case Analysis**:
   - Consider \( m = 1 \). The correct answer should include all \( n \geq 5 \) since \( 5! = 120 \) (ends with 1 zero), \( 6! = 720 \) (ends with 1 zero), and so on. However, the current implementation may miss some valid \( n \) because of the binary search range and update logic.
   - For \( m = 5 \), the correct output should be `0` since no \( n \) exists such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 zeroes. The current implementation might incorrectly return some values due to the flawed binary search logic.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
