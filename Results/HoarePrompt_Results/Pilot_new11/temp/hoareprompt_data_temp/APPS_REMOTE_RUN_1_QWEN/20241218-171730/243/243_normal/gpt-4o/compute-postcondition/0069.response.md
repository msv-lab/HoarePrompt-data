The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`, and `left` must be equal to `mid - 1`. After decrementing `left` by 1, the new value of `left` will be `mid - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\); `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`; `left` is equal to `mid - 2`.
Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\); `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`; `left` is equal to `mid - 2`**
