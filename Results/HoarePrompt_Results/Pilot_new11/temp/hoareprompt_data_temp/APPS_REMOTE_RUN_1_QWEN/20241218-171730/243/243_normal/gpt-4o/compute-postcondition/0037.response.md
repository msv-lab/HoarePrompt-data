The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + (mid - 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `mid` is the integer value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
