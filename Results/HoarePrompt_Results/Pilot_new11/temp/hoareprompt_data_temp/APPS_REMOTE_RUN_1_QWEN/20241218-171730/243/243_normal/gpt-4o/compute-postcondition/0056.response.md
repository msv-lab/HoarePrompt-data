The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is in. However, since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the provided code snippet, the variables `low`, `high`, `left`, `right`, `func_1(right)`, and `result` remain unchanged. The value of `m` also remains the same because no operation affecting `m` is performed.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
