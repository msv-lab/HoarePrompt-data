`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. This calculation finds the midpoint between `low` and `high`. The values of `m`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. 

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`.**
