`right` is initially `mid + 2` and now it is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `right` becomes `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `left`, and `func_1(right)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 3` and must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.**
