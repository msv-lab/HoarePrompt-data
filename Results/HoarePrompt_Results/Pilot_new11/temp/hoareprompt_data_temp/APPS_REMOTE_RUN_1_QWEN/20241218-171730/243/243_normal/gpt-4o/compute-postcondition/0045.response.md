The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given that `left` was previously defined as `mid - 2`, and no new values for `mid` or `left` have been introduced in the current code snippet, the only change is that `left` is now one less than its previous value. The conditions `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low <= high`, and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - 3`; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`**
