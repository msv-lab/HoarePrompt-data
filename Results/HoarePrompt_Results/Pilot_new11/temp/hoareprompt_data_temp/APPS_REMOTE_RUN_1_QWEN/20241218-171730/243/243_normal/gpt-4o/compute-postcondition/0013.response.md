The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. The value of `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\).

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}`.**
