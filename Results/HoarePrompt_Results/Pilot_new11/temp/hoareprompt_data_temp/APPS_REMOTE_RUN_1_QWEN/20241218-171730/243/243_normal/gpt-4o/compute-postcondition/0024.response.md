To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\).
- Loop condition: `while func_1(right) == m:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `right`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must still be equal to `m`.
   - We need to find the new value of `right` such that `func_1(new_right) == m`.

4. **Adjustment Needed**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value returned by `func_1(right)`, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` remains `m` in the next iteration.
   - Without knowing the exact definition of `func_1`, we can only infer that the current `right` must satisfy the condition `func_1(right) == m`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `right` to a value that satisfies the same condition.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the current value of `right` already satisfies the condition, no change is needed to `right` itself for the loop to continue.
   - However, we must ensure that the condition `func_1(right) == m` holds true in the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
Since the current value of `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\) and this value satisfies the condition `func_1(right) == m`, no further adjustments to `right` are necessary.

Thus, the state does not need to be modified beyond what is already given.

### Final Answer:
State: **`right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\)**
