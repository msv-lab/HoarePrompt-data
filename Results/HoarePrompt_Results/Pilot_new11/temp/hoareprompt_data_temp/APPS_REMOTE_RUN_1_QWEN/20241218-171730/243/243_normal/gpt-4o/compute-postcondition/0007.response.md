`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\), so `low` becomes \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\); `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
