Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find all numbers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. According to the output hints for `func_2`, the function should use binary search to find the smallest number `mid` such that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`. However, the current implementation has an issue where it still returns an empty list even if it cannot find a valid `mid`.

To illustrate, consider the following:

1. **Case where no valid `mid` is found**: If `m` is too large such that no `n` exists for which `func_1(n)` equals `m`, the function should return `0` as specified in the problem description. However, the current implementation returns an empty list, which does not match the expected output.

For example, if `m = 5`, the function should return `0` because there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. The provided code would incorrectly return an empty list.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
