`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The function `func_1` is called with `mid` as an argument, and `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, and the state of the function `func_1` are affected. The output state includes the new assignment and the unchanged preconditions.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**
