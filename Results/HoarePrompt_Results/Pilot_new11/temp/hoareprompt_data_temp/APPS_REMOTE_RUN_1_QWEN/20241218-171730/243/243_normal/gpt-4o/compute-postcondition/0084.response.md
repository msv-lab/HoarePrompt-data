Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` define the search range for `m`; `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\). Otherwise, `mid` is the final value after ensuring that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, and `left` and `right` define a range such that `func_1(left)` and `func_1(right)` both equal `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.***
