Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
   - `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\)
   - `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`
   - `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`
   - `right` is `mid + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while func_1(right) == m:`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `right` is `mid + 1`
   - Therefore, `func_1(mid + 1)` must be equal to `m` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `func_1(mid)` is already equal to `m`, we need to adjust `mid` such that `func_1(mid + 1)` is also equal to `m`.
   - This means `mid` should be incremented by 1, making `right` equal to `mid + 1` and ensuring that `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`.

Given these steps, we need to ensure that `mid` is such that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.

**Final State:**
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`
- `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`
- `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`
- `right` is `mid + 1`

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`, `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1`**
