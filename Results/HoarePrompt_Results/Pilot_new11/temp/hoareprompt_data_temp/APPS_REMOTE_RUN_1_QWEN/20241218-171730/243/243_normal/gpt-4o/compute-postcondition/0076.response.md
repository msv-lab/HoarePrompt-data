Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State Analysis
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`
- `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`
- `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`
- `right` is `mid + 2`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while func_1(right) == m:`

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current Value of `right`:**
   - Given `right` is `mid + 2`, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m` for the loop to continue.

2. **Ensuring the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must still be equal to `m`.
   - Since `right` is set to `mid + 2`, we need to verify if `func_1(mid + 2)` is equal to `m`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The only state that directly affects the loop condition `func_1(right) == m` is `right`.
   - We need to ensure that `right` is correctly set to `mid + 2` and that `func_1(right)` remains `m`.

4. **Other States:**
   - `m`, `mid`, `left`, and `func_1(mid + 1)` are already correctly set according to the problem description and do not need adjustment for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `right` to `mid + 2` and ensure that `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`.

### Final Answer
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`, `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `right` must be `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`**
