First, let's clarify the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5` (which means `n % 5 == 0`, i.e., `n` is divisible by 5).
- Code Snippet: `print(len(ans))`

Since the initial state does not include a definition for `ans`, and the code snippet references `ans` which has not been defined, there is an issue with the code. However, we can proceed under the assumption that `ans` should have been defined in a previous part of the program.

Given the initial state, `n` is some integer divisible by 5. Let's assume the value of `n` from the initial state is `5` (the smallest integer divisible by 5).

Since `ans` is not defined in the given snippet, let's assume `ans` is a list or a string whose length we are printing. For this example, let's assume `ans` was previously set to a list with 5 elements, so `len(ans)` would be 5.

Therefore, the code `print(len(ans))` will print `5`.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `ans` is a list with 5 elements (or a string with length 5), and the output of the print statement is 5.**
