The code `right = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `right`. The previous values of `low`, `high`, `left`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is also unchanged because it is not redefined in this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 1`; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.**
