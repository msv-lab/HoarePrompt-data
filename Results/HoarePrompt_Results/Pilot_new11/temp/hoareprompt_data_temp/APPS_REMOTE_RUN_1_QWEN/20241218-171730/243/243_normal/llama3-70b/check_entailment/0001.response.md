Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where \( m = 5 \). According to the problem description, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes. 

For \( m = 5 \), the factorial of \( n \) ending with exactly 5 zeroes should be checked. However, the current implementation does not correctly determine when to stop appending values to the list `ans` or when to break out of the loop. This results in an incorrect output for some inputs.

For instance, when \( m = 5 \), the program should output `0` because no \( n \) exists such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 zeroes. However, the provided code does not handle this edge case properly, leading to an incorrect output.
