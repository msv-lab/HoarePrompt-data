Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are defined such that `func_1(left) == m` and `func_1(right) == m`, and `mid` is the final value of `mid` when `func_1(mid) == m`. If no such `mid` exists, `result` remains an empty list.**
