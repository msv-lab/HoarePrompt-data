`n` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is 1, so after executing `n += 1`, `n` becomes 2. The other variables (`m`, `count`, `n // 5`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 2; `ans` is `[1]`; and `n // 5` is 0.**
