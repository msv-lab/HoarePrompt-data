To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue:

The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`.
- `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\).

For the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

Currently:
- `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\).
- We need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`.

If `func_1(left)` equals `m`, then the loop will continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m` for the next iteration.

Since `left` is defined as \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\), and assuming `func_1` returns a deterministic value based on `left`, we don't need to change any other states directly related to the loop condition. The only thing that needs adjustment is to ensure that the loop continues based on the condition.

Thus, no additional states need to be adjusted beyond ensuring the loop condition remains valid.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\) and `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`**
