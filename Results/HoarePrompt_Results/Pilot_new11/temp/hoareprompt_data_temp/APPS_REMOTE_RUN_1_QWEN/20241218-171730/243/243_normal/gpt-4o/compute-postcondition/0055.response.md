The code initializes the variable `result` to a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. The values of `left` and `right` are defined in terms of `mid` and `k`. Since the exact values of `mid` and `k` are not given, we can express the updated values of the variables in terms of these.

From the initial state, we know:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
- `left` is `mid - k`.
- `right` is `mid + k + 1` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

After executing the line `result = list(range(left + 1, right))`, the value of `result` is updated to a list of integers starting from `left + 1` and ending at `right - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
