To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

### Given Information:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
- `left` is `mid - 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true. This implies that `func_1(mid - 1)` must return the value `m`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Value of `left`:**
   - The current value of `left` is `mid - 1`.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `func_1(mid - 1)` returns `m`.

3. **Ensuring the Condition is True:**
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(mid - 1)` is indeed `m` before proceeding to the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted is the function result `func_1(mid - 1)` to ensure it equals `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `left` is `mid - 1`, and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`**.
