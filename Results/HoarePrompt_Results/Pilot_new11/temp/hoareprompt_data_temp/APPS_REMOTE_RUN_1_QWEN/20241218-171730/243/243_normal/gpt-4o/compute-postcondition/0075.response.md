The code snippet `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. According to the initial state, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `right` becomes `mid + 2`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `mid`, `func_1(mid + 1)`, `left`, and `func_1(left)`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`; `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + 2`**
