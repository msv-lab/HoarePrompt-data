Postcondition: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\); if `zeroes > m`, then `low` is updated to `mid - 1`; otherwise, `mid` is the final value after incrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
