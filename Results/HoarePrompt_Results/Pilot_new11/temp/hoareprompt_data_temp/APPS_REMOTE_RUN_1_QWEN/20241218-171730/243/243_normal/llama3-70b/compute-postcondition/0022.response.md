Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list; and if `n // 5 ** count < m`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the if condition is not met.***
