The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that would cause a change in the variables, the values of the variables remain the same. The `break` statement does not affect the values of `m`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, or `result`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is the final value after incrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
