The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. Given the initial conditions:
- `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
- `right` is `mid + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.

The list `result` is created with elements starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the `result` variable now holds this range.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is the final value after incrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
