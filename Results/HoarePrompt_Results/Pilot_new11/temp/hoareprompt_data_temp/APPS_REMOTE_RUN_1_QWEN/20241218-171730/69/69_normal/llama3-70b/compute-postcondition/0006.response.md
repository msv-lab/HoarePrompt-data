`uy` is assigned the value of itself plus 1. The initial value of `uy` is not specified, so let's denote it as an unknown value, say `uy_initial`. After executing the line `uy += 1`, the value of `uy` becomes `uy_initial + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'U', `uy` is `uy_initial + 1`**
