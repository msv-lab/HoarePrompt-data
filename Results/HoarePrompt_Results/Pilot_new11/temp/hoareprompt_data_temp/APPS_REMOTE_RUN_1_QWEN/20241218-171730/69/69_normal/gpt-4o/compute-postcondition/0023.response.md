Postcondition: ***`final_x` is 0 if it was -1, and 1 otherwise; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.***
