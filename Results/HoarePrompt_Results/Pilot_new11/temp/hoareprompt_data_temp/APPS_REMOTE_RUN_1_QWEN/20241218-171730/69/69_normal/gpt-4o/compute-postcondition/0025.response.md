Postcondition: ***`final_x` is either -2, 0, or 1, depending on the operation. If the next operation is 'D', `final_y` is -1; otherwise, `final_y` is 0. `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining. `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.***
