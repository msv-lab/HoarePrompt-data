Postcondition: ***`final_x` is either -1 or 1, depending on whether the operation in `operations` is 'L' or 'R', respectively. `final_y` is -1 if the operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise. `operations` is a non-empty string, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.***
