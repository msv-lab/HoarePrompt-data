The value of `final_x` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `final_x` is either -1 or 1. If `final_x` was initially 1, it will now be 0. If `final_x` was initially -1, it will remain -1. The other variables (`final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1 (if it was initially 1) or -2 (if it was initially -1); `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
