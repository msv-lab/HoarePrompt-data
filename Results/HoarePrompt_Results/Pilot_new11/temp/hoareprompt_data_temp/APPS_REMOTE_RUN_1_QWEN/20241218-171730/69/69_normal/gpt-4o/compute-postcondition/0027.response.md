Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `final_x` is either -2, -1, 0, or 1 depending on the previous operation.
   - `final_y` is either -1 (if the next operation is 'D') or 0 (otherwise).
   - `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.
   - `x` and `y` are integers within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 2 \cdot 10^5]\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the `operations` string.

3. **Next Operation:**
   - We need to determine the new values of `final_x` and `final_y` based on the next character in `operations`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since we don't know the exact value of the next operation (`op`), we consider both possible cases:
     - If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` changes to -1.
     - Otherwise, `final_y` remains 0.

5. **Loop Continuation:**
   - For the loop to continue, `operations` must have at least one character remaining. After processing the current operation, there will still be at least one character left.

Given these considerations, let's adjust the states:

- `final_x` remains unchanged because the operation does not affect its value directly.
- `final_y` changes based on the next operation.
- `operations` loses one character but still has at least one character remaining.
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop body.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop body.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`final_x` is either -2, -1, 0, or 1 depending on the previous operation, `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise, `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
