The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. Given that `current_y` was initially updated from the operation 'U', it is now increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is set to `float('inf')`, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is incremented by 1, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`.**
