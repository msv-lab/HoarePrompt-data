`final_x` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `-1`. The values of `final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, `operations` must be a non-empty string, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, the operation `op` is equal to 'L'**
