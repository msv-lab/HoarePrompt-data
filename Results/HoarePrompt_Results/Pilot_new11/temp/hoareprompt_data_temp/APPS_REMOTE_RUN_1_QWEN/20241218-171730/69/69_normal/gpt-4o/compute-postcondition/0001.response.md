The code `final_y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `final_y`. This does not affect the values of `final_x`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, or `n`.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
