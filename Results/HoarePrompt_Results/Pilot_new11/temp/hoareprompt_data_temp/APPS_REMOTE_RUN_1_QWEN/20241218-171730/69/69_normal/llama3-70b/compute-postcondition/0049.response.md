`dy` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `y - uy` (since `dy` was initially `y - uy`) to `y - uy + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy + 1`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, `op` is the current operation in `ops`, and the index of the current operation in `ops` is 0, where `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0**
