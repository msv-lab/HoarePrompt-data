State: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, `op` is the current operation in `ops`, and the index of the current operation in `ops` is 0**

### Explanation:
1. **`dx` is `x - ux`:** This is given as the initial state.
2. **`dy` is `y - uy`:** This is given as the initial state.
3. **`ops` is a non-empty string:** The loop will only execute if `ops` contains at least one character (i.e., it's non-empty).
4. **`ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`:** This is given as the initial state but will be updated within the loop.
5. **`uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`:** This is given as the initial state but will be updated within the loop.
6. **`res` is `0`:** This is given as the initial state and will be updated within the loop.
7. **`op` is the current operation in `ops`:** This variable is initialized to the first operation in `ops` before the loop starts.
8. **The index of the current operation in `ops` is 0:** This indicates that the loop will start with the first operation in `ops`.

These adjustments ensure that the loop can begin executing, as they cover the necessary initial conditions for the loop to proceed.
