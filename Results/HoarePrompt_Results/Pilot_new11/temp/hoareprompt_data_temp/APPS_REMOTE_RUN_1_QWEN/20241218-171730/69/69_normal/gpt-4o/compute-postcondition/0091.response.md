Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map` is updated based on the value of `operations[i]`, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. If `target_pos` is not in `position_map`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
