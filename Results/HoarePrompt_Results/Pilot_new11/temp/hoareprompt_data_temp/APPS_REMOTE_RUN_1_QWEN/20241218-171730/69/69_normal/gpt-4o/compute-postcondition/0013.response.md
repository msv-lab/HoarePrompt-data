The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. Given the initial state where `final_x` is 0, after this operation, `final_x` will be 1. The values of `final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, `operations` must be a non-empty string, and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, the operation `op` is 'R'.**
