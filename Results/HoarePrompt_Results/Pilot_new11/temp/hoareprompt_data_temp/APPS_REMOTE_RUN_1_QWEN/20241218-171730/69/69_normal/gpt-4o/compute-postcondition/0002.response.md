According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `operations`. The loop will execute as long as the string `operations` is not empty. Therefore, the key variable to adjust for the loop to execute is `operations`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `final_x` is 0
   - `final_y` is 0
   - `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'
   - `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if and only if `operations` is non-empty (i.e., its length `n` is greater than 0).

3. **Variables Adjusted**:
   - The value of `final_x` and `final_y` do not directly affect the loop's execution; they are updated inside the loop based on the operations.
   - The string `operations` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `operations` to ensure it has a length greater than 0.

**State:**
- **`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5**.

To explicitly state what needs adjustment:
- `operations` must be a non-empty string.

Final State:
**`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `operations` must be a non-empty string, and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5**.
