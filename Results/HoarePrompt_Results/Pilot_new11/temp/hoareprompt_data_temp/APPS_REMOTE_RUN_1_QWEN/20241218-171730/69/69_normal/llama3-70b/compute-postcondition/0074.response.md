`dy` is incremented by 1. Initially, `dy` is 1, so after the increment, `dy` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `res` is 6, `ops` is `['R', 'L']`, `ux` is 10, `uy` is 10, `op` is 'U'.

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `res` is 6, `ops` is `['R', 'L']`, `ux` is 10, `uy` is 10, `op` is 'U'**
