`final_y` is decremented by 1. Given that `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' and 0 otherwise, subtracting 1 from `final_y` when it is currently 0 will change its value to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1 or 1 depending on whether the next operation in `operations` is 'L' or 'R', respectively, `final_y` is -1, `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
