Postcondition: **`final_x` is an integer, either -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, depending on the operation `op`. `final_y` is -2 if the next operation is 'D', otherwise it is -1. `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining. `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. If `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is set to -2. If `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is set to either -3, -2, -1, or 0. If `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is set to either -1, 0, 1, or 2. Otherwise, the values of `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.**
