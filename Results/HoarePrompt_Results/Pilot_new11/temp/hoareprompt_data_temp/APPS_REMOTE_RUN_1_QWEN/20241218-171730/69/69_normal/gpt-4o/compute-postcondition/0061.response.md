Postcondition: ***`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is set to `float('inf')`, `current_x` and `current_y` are adjusted based on the value of `operations[i]`: if `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1; if `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decremented by 1; if `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decremented by 1; if `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1; `position_map` remains `{(0, 0): -1}`.***
