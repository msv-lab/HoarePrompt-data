Postcondition: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, `ux` is updated to `x - dx`, `uy` is updated to `y - dy`, `res` is the count of invalid operations.**
