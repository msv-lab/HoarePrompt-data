The code snippet prints `-1`. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, and the print statement outputs `-1`.**
