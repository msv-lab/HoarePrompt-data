Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are adjusted based on `operations[0]`. `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} depending on the value of `operations[i]`. `target_pos` remains as `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`. If `operations[i]` is 'U', `current_y` is incremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'D', `current_y` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', `current_x` is updated to 2 and `position_map` is updated to {(0, 0): -1, (2, current_y): 1}. If `operations[i]` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', no changes occur.***
