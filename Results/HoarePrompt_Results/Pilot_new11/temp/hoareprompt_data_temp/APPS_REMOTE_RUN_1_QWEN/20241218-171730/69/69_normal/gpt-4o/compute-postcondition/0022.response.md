The initial state indicates that `final_x` is either -1 or 1 depending on the next operation in `operations`, and `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise. The code `final_x += 1` increments `final_x` by 1. Since `final_x` can only be -1 or 1, adding 1 to it will change its value from -1 to 0 if it was -1, and it will become 2 if it was 1. However, since the range of `final_x` is specified as -1 or 1, `final_x` cannot be 2. Therefore, `final_x` will be 0 if it was -1.

The other variables (`final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0 if it was -1, and 1 otherwise; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
