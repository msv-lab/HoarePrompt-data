The code `current_y -= 1` decreases the value of `current_y` by 1. Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `current_y`. The value of `i`, `min_length`, `position_map`, and `(current_x, current_y)` are updated accordingly.

- `i` remains 2.
- `min_length` remains updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`.
- `position_map` includes the entries `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}` or `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1}`, and now includes `{(current_x, current_y): 2}`. Since `current_y` is decreased by 1, the entry in `position_map` for `(current_x, current_y)` changes from `2` to `1` if the previous value was `1`, or remains `2` if the previous value was `2`.
- `(current_x, current_y)` is updated to `(current_x, current_y - 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` includes either `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1}` or `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 2): 1}` depending on the value of `operations[1]`, and now includes `{(current_x, current_y - 1): 2}`; `(current_x, current_y - 1)` is added to `position_map` with the value `2`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` includes either `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1}` or `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 2): 1}` depending on the value of `operations[1]`, and now includes `{(current_x, current_y - 1): 2}`; `(current_x, current_y - 1)` is added to `position_map` with the value `2`.**
