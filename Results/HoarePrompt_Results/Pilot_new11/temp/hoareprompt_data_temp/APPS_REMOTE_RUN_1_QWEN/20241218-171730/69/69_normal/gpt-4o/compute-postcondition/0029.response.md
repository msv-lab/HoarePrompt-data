`final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise. Decrementing -1 results in -2, and decrementing 0 results in -1. Therefore, the new value of `final_y` depends on the next operation being 'D' or not.

- If the next operation is 'D', then `final_y` is -2.
- If the next operation is not 'D', then `final_y` is -1.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`final_x` is either -2, -1, 0, or 1 depending on the previous operation, `final_y` is -2 if the next operation is 'D' or -1 otherwise, `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
