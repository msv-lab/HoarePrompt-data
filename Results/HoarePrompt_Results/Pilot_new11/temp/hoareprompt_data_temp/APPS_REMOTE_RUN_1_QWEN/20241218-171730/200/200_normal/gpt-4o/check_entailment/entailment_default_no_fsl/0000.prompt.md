You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list `v` of `n` integers. It first sorts the list `v` in ascending order. Then, it checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is less than `s`. If it is, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it initializes `min_keg_volume` to the smallest element in `v` and calculates the remaining kvass needed (`remaining_kvass`). It iterates through the list `v`, adjusting `min_keg_volume` based on the difference between the current element and `min_keg_volume`, until `remaining_kvass` is zero or the loop exits. If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than zero after the loop, it further reduces `min_keg_volume` by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\). Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the sum of `v` is less than `s` by printing `-1`.
- The function correctly sorts the list `v` before processing.
- The function correctly updates `min_keg_volume` during the iteration, ensuring it is always the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `remaining_kvass` is zero before the loop ends due to elements in `v` being larger than `min_keg_volume`. This means the function may incorrectly reduce `min_keg_volume` even when `remaining_kvass` is zero, which should be a terminal condition for the loop.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\).
- `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
- `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.
- `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.
- `min_keg_volume` is the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass after adjustments.
- `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
