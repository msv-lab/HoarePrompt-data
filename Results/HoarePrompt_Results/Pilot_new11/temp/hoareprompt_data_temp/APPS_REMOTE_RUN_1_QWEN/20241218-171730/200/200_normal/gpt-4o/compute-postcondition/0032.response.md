Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition of the if statement, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
