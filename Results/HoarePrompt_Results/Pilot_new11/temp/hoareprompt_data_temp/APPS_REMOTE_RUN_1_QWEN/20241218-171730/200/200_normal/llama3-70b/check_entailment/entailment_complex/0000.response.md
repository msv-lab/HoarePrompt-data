Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `s`, and the list `v` as per the problem description. The constraints for `n`, `s`, and `v` are checked and respected.

2. **Sorting the List**: The list `v` is sorted, ensuring that the subsequent binary search can operate optimally.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum amount of kvass (`low`) in the least keg such that the total amount of kvass taken from all kegs sums up to at least `s`. This is achieved through the `while low < high` loop where `mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`.

4. **Sum Calculation**: For each `mid`, the program calculates the total amount of kvass that can be taken from the kegs using `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)`. If this total is less than `s`, it updates `low` to `mid`; otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.

5. **Final Check and Output**: After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the minimum amount taken from each keg equals `s`. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to achieve the desired amount. Otherwise, it prints `low`, which is the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, the program accurately performs the necessary steps to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
