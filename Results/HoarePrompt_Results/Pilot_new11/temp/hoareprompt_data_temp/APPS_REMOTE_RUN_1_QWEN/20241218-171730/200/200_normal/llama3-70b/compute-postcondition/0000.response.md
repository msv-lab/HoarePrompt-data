The code reads two integers \( n \) and \( s \) from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to variables `n` and `s`. It also reads a list of \( n \) integers from the input, but these integers are not assigned to any variables in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is that `n` and `s` have been assigned their respective input values, and the list of integers remains unassigned but ready to be read if needed. The precondition that the input consists of two integers \( n \) and \( s \) and a list of \( n \) integers remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, and a list of `n` integers is ready to be read.**
