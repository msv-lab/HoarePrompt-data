`n, s` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `s` are now determined by the input, and the value of `v` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^{12}, `v` is a list of `n` integers where 1 â‰¤ `v_i` â‰¤ 10^9 for each `i` in range `n`.**
