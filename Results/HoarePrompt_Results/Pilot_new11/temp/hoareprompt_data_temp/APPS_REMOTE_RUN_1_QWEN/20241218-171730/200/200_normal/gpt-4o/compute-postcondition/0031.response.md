The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block directly indicated in the provided code snippet, the impact of the `break` statement is to exit whatever block it is within. Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement does not modify any variables but rather breaks out of a control structure, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition of the if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
