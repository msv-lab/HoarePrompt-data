Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. It first sorts the list `v`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the smallest value `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `low` exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `low`. The function ensures that the inputs `n`, `s`, and `v` satisfy the given constraints: \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), and \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will terminate with an error, though this is not explicitly handled within the provided code.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `v` contains only one element, the function will still perform the binary search but may not correctly handle the edge case where the single element is smaller than `s`.
- If `s` is larger than the sum of all elements in `v`, the function will print `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly check for violations of the constraints before performing the binary search, which could lead to undefined behavior if the constraints are not met.
