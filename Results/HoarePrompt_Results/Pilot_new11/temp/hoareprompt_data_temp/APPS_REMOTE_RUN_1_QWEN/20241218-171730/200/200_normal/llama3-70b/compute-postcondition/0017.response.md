Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is either 0 or (`\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2`, `high` is either `\text{min}(v)` or `(\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, then no change is made to `total`, `low`, and `high`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` are adjusted according to the value of `total` relative to `s`***.
