Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, and `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`, and `volumes` remains unchanged.***
