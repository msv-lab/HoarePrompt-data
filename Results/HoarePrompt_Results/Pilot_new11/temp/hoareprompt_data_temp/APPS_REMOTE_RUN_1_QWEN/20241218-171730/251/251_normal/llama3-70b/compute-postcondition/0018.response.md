Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 0, `dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, `n` is greater than 1, all other elements in `dp` are 0.0, and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition that `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` for some `j`.***
