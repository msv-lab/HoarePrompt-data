Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum volume of the special cake. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum volume by iterating through each cake and checking if it can be placed on a previous cake with a smaller volume. The `func_2` function reads the input and calls `func_1` to compute and print the result. Given the problem constraints and examples, the program appears to handle all cases correctly, ensuring that only cakes with a larger volume are placed on top of previous ones, and the maximum volume is computed accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases in the provided code.
