Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements dynamic programming to find the maximum possible total volume of the cake that can be constructed under the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of why the program works:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the maximum volume achievable up to each cake.
3. **DP Transition**: For each cake `i`, the program iterates through all previous cakes `j` to update the `dp[i]` value if the volume of cake `i` is greater than the volume of cake `j`.
4. **Result Extraction**: The maximum value in the `dp` array gives the maximum possible total volume of the cake.

The provided examples and the problem statement do not indicate any specific edge cases or scenarios that the program might fail. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles the dynamic programming approach effectively without any apparent flaws. Therefore, the program is correct.
