Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum volume of a subset of cakes such that no two cakes overlap in terms of volume, but the problem requires finding the maximum volume by stacking cakes such that the volume of the upper cake is strictly greater than the volume of the lower cake. The current implementation does not account for this strict volume condition.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```

The optimal solution would be to stack the cakes with volumes \( \pi \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 = \pi \), \( \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2 = 8\pi \), and \( \pi \cdot 3^2 \cdot 3 = 27\pi \) respectively, resulting in a total volume of \( \pi + 8\pi + 27\pi = 36\pi \).

However, the current implementation treats the volumes as if they are independent, and it does not ensure that the volume of the cake being placed is strictly greater than the volume of the cake below it. Thus, the function will not correctly identify the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking the cakes according to the given constraints.

To fix this, the implementation needs to be modified to maintain a sorted list of volumes and dynamically check if the current volume is strictly greater than the previous one.
