According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` exists. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

Let's analyze the state step by step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
2. The loop will continue if `i` is within the range of the new iteration, i.e., `0 <= j < i`.
3. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 2.
4. `j` must still exist as it did in the previous iteration.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` exists**
