The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of simple cakes, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively. The function returns the maximum value from the list or array 'dp'.
