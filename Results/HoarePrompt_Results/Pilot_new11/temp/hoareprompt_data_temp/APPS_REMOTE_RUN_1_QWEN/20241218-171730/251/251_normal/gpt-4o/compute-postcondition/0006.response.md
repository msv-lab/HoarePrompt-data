Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes` from standard input, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. The function assumes that the input format is correct and that the list `cakes` has the correct structure (i.e., each element is a tuple containing exactly two integers). If the input does not conform to this structure, the behavior is undefined.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `n` is less than 0, the behavior is undefined because the function expects a non-negative integer.
- If the input does not match the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of integers), the function will fail because the list comprehension will raise a `IndexError`.

**Missing functionality:**
- There is no explicit error handling for invalid input formats or values. If the input is malformed, the function may crash or produce incorrect results without any indication of failure.
