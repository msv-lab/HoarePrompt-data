Postcondition: ***`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` ranges from 0 to 1, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[0][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[0][2]` must hold true for `j = 0`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[1][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[1][2]` must hold true for `j = 1`, and `dp[3]` is updated to `max(dp[3], dp[j] + cakes[3][0])` for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.***
