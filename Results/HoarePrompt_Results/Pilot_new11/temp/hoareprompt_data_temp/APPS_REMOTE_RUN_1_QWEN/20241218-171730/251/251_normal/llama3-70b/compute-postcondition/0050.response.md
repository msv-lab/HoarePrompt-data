Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
   - The conditions `cakes[3][1] < cakes[0][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[0][2]` must hold true for `j = 0`.
   - The conditions `cakes[3][1] < cakes[1][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[1][2]` must hold true for `j = 1`.
   - `dp[3]` is updated to `max(dp[3], dp[j] + cakes[3][0])` for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 1.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `j = 0`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[0][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[0][2]` must hold true.
   - For `j = 1`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[1][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[1][2]` must hold true.
   - `dp[3]` is updated to `max(dp[3], dp[j] + cakes[3][0])` if the respective condition holds true.

4. **Current Iteration (End)**:
   - Since `i` is 3 and the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 1`, the loop has already executed both iterations for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

5. **Next Iteration (Start)**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` remains 3.
   - The loop will run again, but since it's a for-loop iterating over `range(i)`, it will start from `j = 0` again.

Given that the loop will start from `j = 0` again in the next iteration, we need to ensure that the initial conditions for `j = 0` and `j = 1` are maintained. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `dp[2]` remains as the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`.
- `i` remains 3.
- `j` starts from 0 again.
- The conditions for `j = 0` and `j = 1` must still hold true.

Since the loop just started and the conditions for the next iteration are the same as the end of the previous iteration, the states remain the same.

**State: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` starts from 0, and the conditions for `j = 0` and `j = 1` must still hold true.**
