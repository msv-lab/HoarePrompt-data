State before the loop starts: `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, `n` must be greater than 1, all other elements in `dp` are 0.0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`.
2. Given that `i` is 1, the loop range `range(i)` translates to `range(1)`, meaning the loop will not execute because there are no values for `j` that satisfy `0 <= j < 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0. This way, the loop can proceed with valid iterations.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, `n` must be greater than 1, all other elements in `dp` are 0.0**
