According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `i` (exclusive). For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python starts from 0 and goes up to but not including the upper limit. The state of `dp` and `volumes` remains unchanged, so we don't need to adjust them. We only need to ensure that `i` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is the maximum possible value of the subproblem solution considering the volumes of the cakes up to index `i-1` and `dp[0]` is now `volumes[0]`, `volumes` remains unchanged**
