Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` (where `j` is such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i-2]`), `volumes` remains unchanged. If `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` is true, `dp[i]` is updated accordingly; otherwise, no change is made to `dp[i]`.***
