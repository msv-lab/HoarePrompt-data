According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. For the loop to execute again, the list `marks` must still contain at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `marks` must be a non-empty list,
- `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`,
- `x_found` is set to True,
- `y_found` is set to True.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `marks` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that the next `mark` from the `marks` list is considered in the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element.**
