Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True.***

Note: The variable `x` is not mentioned in the if condition, so its value remains unchanged from the precondition. The postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition specified in the if statement.
