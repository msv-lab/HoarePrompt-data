The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current context (if it was inside a loop or switch). However, since no such context is provided in the initial state, the `break` statement does not alter the state of any variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True.**
