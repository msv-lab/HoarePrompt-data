Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition inside the if-else block.***

Explanation:
- If `mark + x + y in marks_set` or `mark + x - y in marks_set` or `mark - x + y in marks_set` holds true, then `new_marks` will contain `mark + x`.
- Otherwise, if none of the above conditions hold true, then `new_marks` will contain `mark - x`.

Since the condition `not x_found` is true initially and does not change within the if-else block, `x_found` remains `False` after the block executes. Similarly, `y_found` remains `False`. Therefore, the overall postcondition reflects the state of `new_marks` being updated to either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition, while keeping `n`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found` unchanged.
