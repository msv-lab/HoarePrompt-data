Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True.*** 

Explanation: Since the `else` part is empty, the `if` part directly determines the postcondition. Therefore, the postcondition remains as the condition specified in the `if` part without any additional changes.
