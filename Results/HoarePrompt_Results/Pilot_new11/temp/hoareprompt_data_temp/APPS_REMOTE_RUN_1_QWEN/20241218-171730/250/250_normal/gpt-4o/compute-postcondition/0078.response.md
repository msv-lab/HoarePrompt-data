The code `print(new_marks.pop())` pops and prints the last element of the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is a set, popping an element from it removes and returns that element. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and `new_marks` is the set containing all elements except the last one. The last element of `new_marks` has been printed.**
