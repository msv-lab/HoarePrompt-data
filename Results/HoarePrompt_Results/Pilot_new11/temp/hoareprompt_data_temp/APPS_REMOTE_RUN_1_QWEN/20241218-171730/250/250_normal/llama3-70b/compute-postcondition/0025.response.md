The code sets `need_x` to `True`. The value of `need_x` is now explicitly set to `True`, and the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` being true for some `j` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the index `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, `n` is the length of the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
