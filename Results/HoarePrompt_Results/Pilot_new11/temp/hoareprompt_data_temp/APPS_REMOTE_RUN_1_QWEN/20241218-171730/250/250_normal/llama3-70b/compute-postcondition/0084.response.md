Postcondition: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list. If the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` is true, then `additional_marks` includes `i + j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
