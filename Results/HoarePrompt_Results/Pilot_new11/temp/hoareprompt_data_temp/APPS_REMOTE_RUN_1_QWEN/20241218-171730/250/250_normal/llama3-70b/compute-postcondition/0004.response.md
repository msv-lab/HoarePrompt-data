Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The bounds of the loop are defined by `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - We are given that `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop `for j in range(i, n)` will iterate over values of `j` starting from `i` up to but not including `n`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `j` in the range `[i, n)`. This means `i` should be less than `n`.
   - Additionally, since `j` starts from `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid starting point.

5. **Combine the Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (given).
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to have at least one iteration.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0, we need to adjust the state to include these conditions.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`**
