State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is 5, `n` is 10.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
2. This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n-1`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5 and `n` is 10.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
5. Since `i` is currently 5 and `n` is 10, the loop can still execute once more because `5 < 10` is true.
6. After this next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 6.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 6 and `n` remains 10.

State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10**
