`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` is not checked or changed, so its state remains as it was before.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is 10, `need_y` is `True`.**
