Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` remains the same unless `marks[j_end + 1] - marks[i] == y`, in which case `need_y` is `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then `need_x` is `True`; otherwise, `need_x` remains `True`.***
