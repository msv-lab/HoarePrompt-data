Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition inside the if-else block.*** 

This postcondition maintains the initial state of the variables as described in the precondition and specifies that `new_marks` will contain elements derived from the elements of `marks` based on the condition within the if statement, while ensuring that `x_found` remains `False` and `y_found` remains `False`.
