The code sets the variable `need_x` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `marks`, `i`, `j`, or `x`. Therefore, the only change is in the new variable `need_x`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices into the list `marks`, `need_x` is `True`, and `x` is equal to `marks[j] - marks[i]`.**
