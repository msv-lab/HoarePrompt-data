Postcondition: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list. The loop executes since `additional_marks` is non-empty and contains an element `j` such that \(i + j \leq l\) and \(i + j\) is not already in `marks`.**
