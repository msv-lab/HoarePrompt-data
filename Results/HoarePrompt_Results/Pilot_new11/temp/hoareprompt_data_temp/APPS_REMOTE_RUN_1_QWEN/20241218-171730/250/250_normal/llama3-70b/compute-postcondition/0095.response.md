The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`. According to the initial state, `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, and `j` is the first element in the `additional_marks` list. The condition \(i + j \leq l\) and \(i + j\) is not in `marks` is satisfied. After appending, `additional_marks` will contain all its previous elements plus the new sum of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and `j`; `i` is the next element in the `marks` list; `j` is the first element in the `additional_marks` list.**
