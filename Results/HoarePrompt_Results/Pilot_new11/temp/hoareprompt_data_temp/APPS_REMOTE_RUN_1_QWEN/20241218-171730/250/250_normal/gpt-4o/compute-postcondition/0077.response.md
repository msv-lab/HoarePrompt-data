The code `print(1)` simply prints the number 1 to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`.**
