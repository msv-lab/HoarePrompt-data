Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` is 10
   - `j` is 10
   - `need_x` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. Otherwise, `need_x` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i` to `n`. This means the loop condition is `i <= j < n`.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6, `n` is 10, and `j` is 10.
   - Since `j` is 10 and the loop runs until `j` is less than `n` (which is 10), the loop will stop here because `j` is already equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j = 11`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains the same as it does not change within the loop: `i` is still 6.
   - `n` remains the same: `n` is still 10.
   - `j` is incremented by 1: `j` becomes 11.
   - `need_x` remains unchanged as the loop condition is not met (`j` equals `n`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is 11, and `need_x` remains unchanged**.
