Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `marks` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is the same index as before.
   - `j` is `i + 2`.
   - `need_x` is `True`.
   - `need_y` is `True`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `j = i` to `j < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 2`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1 (since it starts from `i` and increments by default).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 3`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains the same as before.
   - `j` will now be `i + 3`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True` unless they are modified inside the loop body, but no such modification is specified.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 3` to allow further iterations.

6. **Final State:**
   - `marks` remains the same.
   - `i` is the same.
   - `j` is `i + 3`.
   - `need_x` is `True`.
   - `need_y` is `True`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same index as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 3`**.
