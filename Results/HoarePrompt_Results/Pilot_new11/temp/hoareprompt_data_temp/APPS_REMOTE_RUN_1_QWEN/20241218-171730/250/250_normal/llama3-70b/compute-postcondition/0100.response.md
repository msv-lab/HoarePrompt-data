Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`).
- If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, then `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`.
- Otherwise, the list remains unchanged.

### For Loop
```python
for j in additional_marks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.
2. **State Before the Loop Starts**: We need to determine the state just before the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Adjusting the State
- **List `additional_marks`**: Since the loop is iterating over each element `j` in `additional_marks`, the list itself does not change within the loop. Therefore, we keep `additional_marks` as it is.
- **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` will take the value of the next element in `additional_marks` during each iteration. Therefore, `j` will be the next element in `additional_marks`.

### Conclusion
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be the next element in `additional_marks`. Thus, we need to update the state to reflect this.

### Final State
State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`). `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**.

To be more precise:
- `additional_marks` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`). `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**.
