The code `n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for these variables are:

- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `l` is an integer such that `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`
- `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`

After executing the code, these initial conditions are no longer valid because the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now set to the values read from the input. However, the precondition that `x < y` remains true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `l` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `y` is an integer read from input, and `x < y`.**
