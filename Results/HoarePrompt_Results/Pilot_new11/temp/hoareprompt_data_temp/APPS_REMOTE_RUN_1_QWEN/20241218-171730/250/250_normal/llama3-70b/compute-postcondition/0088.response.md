According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `additional_marks`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` that satisfy the condition \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.
- `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `additional_marks` still contains at least one element that satisfies the conditions, and `i` becomes the next element in the `marks` list.

Let's denote the next element in `additional_marks` as `j_new`. Since `additional_marks` was non-empty, it still must be non-empty, and `j_new` must satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and not already be present in `marks`.

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and now includes the new element \(i + j_new\) if \(i + j_new\) satisfies the conditions. `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**

To be more specific, let's assume the next element in `additional_marks` is `j_new` (the first element in the list if it is non-empty). Then:

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and now includes the new element \(i + j_new\) if \(i + j_new\) satisfies the conditions. `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**

This ensures that the loop can continue as long as there are valid elements in `additional_marks` and `i` progresses through the `marks` list.
