The code assigns `False` to both `need_x` and `need_y`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, or `marks`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `l` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `y` is an integer read from input, and `x < y`; `marks` is a set of integers from the input; `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
