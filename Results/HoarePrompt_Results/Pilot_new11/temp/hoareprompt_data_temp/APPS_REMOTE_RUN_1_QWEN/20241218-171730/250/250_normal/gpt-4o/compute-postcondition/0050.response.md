Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - y` and possibly other elements, and none of `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` are in `marks_set`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` are in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. Otherwise, `new_marks` contains `mark - y` and possibly other elements from the original `new_marks` set.***
