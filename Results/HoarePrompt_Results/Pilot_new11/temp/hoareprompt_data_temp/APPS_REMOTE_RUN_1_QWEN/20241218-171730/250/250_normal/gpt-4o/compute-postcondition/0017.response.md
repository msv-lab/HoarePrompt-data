Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element. If `mark + x` is in `marks_set`, then either `x_found` or `y_found` (or both) may change, and `marks` has at least one element removed. If `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then the same conditions apply.***
