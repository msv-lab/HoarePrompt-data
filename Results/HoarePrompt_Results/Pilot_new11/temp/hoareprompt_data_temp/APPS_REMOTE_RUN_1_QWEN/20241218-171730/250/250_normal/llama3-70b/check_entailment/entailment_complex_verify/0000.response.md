Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases to ensure the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both distances \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, the logic for determining additional marks is flawed. The program only checks if \(x\) or \(y\) can be added directly without considering whether a combination of existing marks and these values can form the required distances. Additionally, the program incorrectly appends sums \(i + j\) to `additional_marks` without ensuring that these sums are necessary or minimal. 

For example, given the input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```
The program incorrectly outputs:
```
1
20
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
1
230
```
This demonstrates that the program does not always find the minimum number of additional marks required. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
