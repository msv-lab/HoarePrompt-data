Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) and checks for the presence of two specific integers \(x\) and \(y\) within the sequence or their possible transformations. Based on the presence or absence of these integers and their transformations, the function prints one of three outcomes:

1. If both \(x\) and \(y\) are found in the sequence or can be derived from the sequence, the function prints `0`.
2. If \(x\) is not found but \(y\) is, the function prints the number `1` followed by the value of \(x\).
3. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) is found but \(y\) can be derived from the sequence using \(x\), the function prints the number `1` followed by the value of \(y\).
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be derived from the sequence, the function prints the number `2` followed by the values of both \(x\) and \(y\).

The function does not accept any parameters and operates internally on the input sequence and the values of \(x\) and \(y\).**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is provided as a list of integers via the `input()` function. If the input is not correctly formatted, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function also assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) are provided as integers via the `input()` function. If non-integer inputs are provided for \(x\) or \(y\), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
- The function does not handle cases where the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is not strictly increasing or does not satisfy the given constraints (i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\)). If these constraints are violated, the function's behavior is undefined.**
