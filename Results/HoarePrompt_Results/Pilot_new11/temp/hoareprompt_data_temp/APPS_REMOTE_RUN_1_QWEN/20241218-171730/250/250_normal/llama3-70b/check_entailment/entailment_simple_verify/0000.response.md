Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program does not always find the minimum number of additional marks needed. Specifically, the program fails to correctly handle cases where adding one mark can satisfy both distance requirements, as demonstrated by the provided counterexample:

For the input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The correct output should be:
```
1
230
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
20
```

This is incorrect because adding a mark at 20 cm does not help in measuring both 185 cm and 230 cm. The correct additional mark to add is 230 cm. The program incorrectly appends the sum `i + j` to `additional_marks` without ensuring that the additional mark can actually help in measuring both required distances. Therefore, the program does not always provide the minimum number of additional marks needed.
