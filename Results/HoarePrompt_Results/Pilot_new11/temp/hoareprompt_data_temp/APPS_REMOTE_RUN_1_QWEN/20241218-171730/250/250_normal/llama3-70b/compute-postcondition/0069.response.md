According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. The loop will execute if `additional_marks` is a non-empty list. Given that `marks` is a non-empty list of integers before the loop starts, we need to focus on ensuring `additional_marks` meets the necessary condition for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will iterate over each element in `additional_marks`.
2. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must be a non-empty list.

Since the initial state does not provide information about `additional_marks`, we need to adjust the state to ensure it is a non-empty list.

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list**
