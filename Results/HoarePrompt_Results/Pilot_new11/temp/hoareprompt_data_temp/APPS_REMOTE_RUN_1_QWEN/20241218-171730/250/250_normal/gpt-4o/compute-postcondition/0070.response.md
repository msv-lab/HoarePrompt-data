The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mark` and `y`, we will use the general form.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `marks` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the next `mark` in `marks`.

After executing the code, `new_marks` will include the value `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the next `mark` in `marks` and now includes `mark + y`.**
