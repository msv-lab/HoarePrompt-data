Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether new marks are needed to measure both `x` and `y` distances is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

According to the problem description, we need to check if the ruler can measure both `x` (185) and `y` (230) distances. The current implementation tries to find pairs of marks that can directly measure these distances. However, it fails to consider the case where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured directly but can be measured by adding a single new mark.

In this specific case, the program incorrectly prints `1` and `230`, suggesting that adding a 230 cm mark would suffice. However, adding a 20 cm mark would also allow measuring both 185 and 230 cm distances. The program fails to consider this alternative solution.

A correct approach would involve checking if either `x` or `y` can be formed by any combination of existing marks plus a potential new mark. The current implementation does not cover this scenario properly.
