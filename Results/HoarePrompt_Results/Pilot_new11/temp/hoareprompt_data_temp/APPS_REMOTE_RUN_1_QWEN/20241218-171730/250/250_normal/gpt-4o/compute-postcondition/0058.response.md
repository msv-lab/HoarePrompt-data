Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` contains either `mark - x` if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, or remains unchanged.***
