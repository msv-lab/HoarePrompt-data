Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices into the list `marks`. `need_x` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `need_y` remains `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, then `need_y` is unchanged.***
