Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty).
   - `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`.
   - `x_found` is `False`.
   - `y_found` is `False`.
   - `new_marks` is a set.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `mark` in `marks`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - For each `mark` in `marks`, the loop checks if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`.
   - If any of these conditions are true, then `mark + y` is added to `new_marks`.
   - Otherwise, `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`, and potentially other elements from the original `new_marks` set.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since we are iterating through the `marks` list, the next `mark` to be processed will be the next element in the list.
   - All other states (`n`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, which it does not in this case.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:

- The current `mark` will be replaced by the next element in the `marks` list.
- `x_found` and `y_found` will still be `False` unless they are updated within the loop body, but since no such update is mentioned, they remain `False`.
- `new_marks` will retain its current value and potentially grow as the loop processes more `marks`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set. The current `mark` will be replaced by the next element in the `marks` list.**
