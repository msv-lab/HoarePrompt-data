Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1`. For each iteration, it pushes a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` into the heap.
- If `m` is at least 0, the loop will execute at least once.
- After all iterations, the heap will contain tuples for all `0 ≤ y < n` because the loop continues until `y` reaches `n-1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `y` is less than `n`, the final state of the heap will include all possible tuples generated during the iterations, which are `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < n`.
