The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the heap. The new tuple is constructed with the following elements:
- The first element is `-coverage(x, y)`. Given that `x` is `x_end + 1` and `y` is 2, this becomes `-coverage(x_end + 1, 2)`.
- The second element is `x`, which is `x_end + 1`.
- The third element is `y`, which is 2.

The heap initially contains the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)`. After pushing the new tuple, the heap will contain two tuples: `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` and `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 2), x_end + 1, 2)`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 0, `x` is `x_end + 1`, and `y` is 2.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 0, heap now includes the tuples `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` and `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 2), x_end + 1, 2)`, `x` is `x_end + 1`, `y` is 2**
