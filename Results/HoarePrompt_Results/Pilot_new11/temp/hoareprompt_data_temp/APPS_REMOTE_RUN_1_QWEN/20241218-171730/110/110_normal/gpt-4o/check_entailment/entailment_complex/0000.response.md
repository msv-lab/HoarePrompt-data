Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. The key issue lies in how the `coverage` function and the overall approach to calculating the maximum expected value are handled.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Coverage Calculation**:
   - The `coverage` function correctly calculates the number of possible scoop-net positions covering a cell `(x, y)`. However, this calculation alone does not ensure that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized.
   - The `coverage` function returns a value that indicates how many positions the scoop-net can be placed such that it covers the cell `(x, y)`. This is necessary but not sufficient for determining the optimal placement of fishes.

2. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is populated with the negative coverage values for each cell `(x, y)`. The idea is to prioritize cells with higher coverage, but the subsequent logic of popping `k` elements from the heap and simply summing up the coverage values is flawed.
   - By only summing up the coverage values without considering the distribution of cells, the code does not ensure that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized. It merely sums the coverage values of the top `k` cells, which does not necessarily yield the highest expected value.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The final step in the `func_1` function calculates the total coverage and divides it by the total number of possible positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This approach assumes that the sum of the coverage values directly translates to the expected value, which is not true.
   - To maximize the expected value, one needs to strategically place the fishes such that the average number of fishes caught is maximized. Simply summing the coverage values without considering the optimal distribution of cells is insufficient.

### Example Case:
Consider a simple example where `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`:
- The pond is a 3x3 grid.
- The scoop-net is a 2x2 square.
- The optimal placement would be to place one fish in each of the cells `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 1)`. This ensures that the scoop-net, when placed in any position, will catch at least 2 fishes on average.

However, the current implementation will simply place the fishes in the cells with the highest coverage, which might not necessarily be the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
