The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple into the heap. The tuple consists of `-coverage(x, y)` and the values of `x` and `y`. Since the initial state only mentions that `m` must be at least 1, we don't have specific values for `x`, `y`, or `coverage(x, y)`. The heap is updated, but the exact values within the heap are not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, `heap` contains a tuple of (`-coverage(x, y)`, `x`, `y`)**
