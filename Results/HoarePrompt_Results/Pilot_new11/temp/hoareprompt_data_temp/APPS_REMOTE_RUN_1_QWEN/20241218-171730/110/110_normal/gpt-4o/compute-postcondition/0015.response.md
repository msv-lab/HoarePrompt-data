The code pushes a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` onto the heap. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state and are not assigned any values within the code snippet, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `x` and `y` are integers and that the heap was initially containing the tuples `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` and `(-coverage(x, 2), x, 2)`. After executing the code, the heap will contain one more tuple.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `n` is at least 0, `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`, `(-coverage(x, 2), x, 2)`, and `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`**
