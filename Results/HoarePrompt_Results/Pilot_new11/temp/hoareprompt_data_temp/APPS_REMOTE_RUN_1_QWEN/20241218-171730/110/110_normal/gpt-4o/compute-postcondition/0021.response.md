The code pushes a tuple into the heap, specifically `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Given the initial state:

- `m` is at least 0
- `n` is at least 0
- `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 â‰¤ y < m` and `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 0), x_end + 1, 0)`
- `x` is `x_end + 1`
- `y` is 1

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` will push the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` into the heap. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `m` is at least 0
- `n` is at least 0
- `heap` now includes the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` in addition to its previous contents
- `x` is `x_end + 1`
- `y` is 1

Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` now includes the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` in addition to its previous contents, `x` is `x_end + 1`, `y` is 1**
