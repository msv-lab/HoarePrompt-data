You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the minimum number of cells that can be occupied by the fishes such that the scoop-net can be placed in any of the possible positions and catch at least one fish, but it does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```

The correct solution should place the fishes in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized. One optimal placement would be to place the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). This way, no matter where the scoop-net is placed (with its bottom-left corner in any of the four possible positions), it will always catch exactly 2 fishes on average.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the answer as follows:
- \( ans = \min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)) \)
- For the given input, \( ans = \min(3, (3 - 2 + 1) * (3 - 2 + 1)) = \min(3, 4) = 3 \)

This result is then printed as the expected number of caught fishes, which is incorrect because the expected value should be 2.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( r \), and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 \), \( 1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m) \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq \min(n \times m, 10^5) \). It then calculates the minimum value between \( k \) and \( (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1) \), stores this value in the variable `ans`, and prints the ratio of `ans` to \( (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1) \). The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the result to the standard output. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) or \( m \) is equal to \( r \) or when \( k \) equals \( (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1) \).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
