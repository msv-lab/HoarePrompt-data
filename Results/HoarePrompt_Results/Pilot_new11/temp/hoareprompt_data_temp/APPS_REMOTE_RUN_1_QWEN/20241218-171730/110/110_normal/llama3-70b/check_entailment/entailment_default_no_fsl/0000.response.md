Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires placing \( k \) fishes in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized. However, the current implementation simply calculates the minimum value between \( k \) and \( (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1) \), and then prints the ratio of this value to \( (n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1) \). This approach does not account for the optimal placement of the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 3 2 3`
- Expected output: The maximum expected number of caught fishes is 2.0, achieved by placing the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).
- Actual output of the provided code: `1.0` (since \(\min(3, (3-2+1) \times (3-2+1)) = \min(3, 4) = 3\) and the ratio is \(3 / 4 = 0.75\), which is not rounded or formatted correctly).

The code does not handle the optimal placement logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
