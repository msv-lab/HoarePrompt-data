The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns the three elements of that tuple to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. This affects the `heap` by removing the smallest element. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `m` is at least 0
- `n` is at least 0
- `heap` contains tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)`, excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`
- `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`
- `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0
- `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap
- `x` is the first index of the smallest tuple
- `y` is the second index of the smallest tuple

After executing the code, the new values of the variables are:
- `cov`, `x`, and `y` are now the values of the smallest tuple removed from `heap`
- `heap` no longer contains the smallest tuple

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `m` is at least 0
- `n` is at least 0
- `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`; `heap` does not include the tuple `(cov, x, y)` that was just popped
- `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`
- `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0
- `cov` is now the first element of the tuple popped from `heap`
- `x` is now the second element of the tuple popped from `heap`
- `y` is now the third element of the tuple popped from `heap`

Output State: **`m` is at least 0; `n` is at least 0; `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`; `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`; `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0; `cov` is the first element of the tuple popped from `heap`; `x` is the second element of the tuple popped from `heap`; `y` is the third element of the tuple popped from `heap`**
