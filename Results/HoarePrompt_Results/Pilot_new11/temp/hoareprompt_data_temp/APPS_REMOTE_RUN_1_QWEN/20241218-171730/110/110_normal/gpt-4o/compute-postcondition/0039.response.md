The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. These parameters are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5). The function calculates the total coverage divided by total positions, where total positions is (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and return the result of total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_positions is (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).
