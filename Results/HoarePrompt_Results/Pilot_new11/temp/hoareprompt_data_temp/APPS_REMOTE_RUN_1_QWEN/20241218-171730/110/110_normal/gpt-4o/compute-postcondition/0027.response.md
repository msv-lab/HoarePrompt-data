According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `m` must be at least 0 (already given).
- `n` must be at least 0 (already given).
- `heap` must be a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` (already given).
- `total_coverage` is 0 (already given).

To ensure the loop can execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n`, `total_coverage` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
