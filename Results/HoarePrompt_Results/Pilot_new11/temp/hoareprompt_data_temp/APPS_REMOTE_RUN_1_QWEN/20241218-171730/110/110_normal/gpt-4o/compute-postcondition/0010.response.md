Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `m` is exactly `n`.
   - `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`, and `x` is `1`.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `y` is within the range `[0, m)`.
   - Since `m` is exactly `n`, the loop will execute as long as `0 ≤ y < n`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means we need to check if `m` (or equivalently `n`) is greater than or equal to `0` and less than some upper limit that allows the loop to run.
   - Given that `m` is exactly `n`, and the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`, we need `m` to be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

5. **List the Adjusted States:**
   - `m` (which is `n`) must be greater than or equal to `1`.
   - `heap` must contain tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for each `y` in the range `[0, m-1)`.

Given these considerations, the final answer is:

**State: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, heap is a list containing tuples of the form (-coverage(1, y), 1, y) for each y in the range [0, m-1)**
