Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. The function `func_1` uses a greedy approach to select the top `k` cells with the highest coverage, but it does not consider the optimal placement of the cells to ensure the highest expected value. 

The `coverage` function calculates the number of possible scoop-net positions that cover a specific cell `(x, y)`, but the main function `func_1` does not utilize this information correctly to place the fishes. Instead, it simply selects the `k` cells with the highest individual coverage, which does not guarantee the maximum expected number of caught fishes. 

To achieve the correct solution, the algorithm should aim to distribute the fishes in such a way that the overlap of scoop-net positions is maximized. A better approach would be to calculate the expected number of caught fishes for different placements and choose the configuration that gives the highest expected value. The current implementation does not account for this optimization.
