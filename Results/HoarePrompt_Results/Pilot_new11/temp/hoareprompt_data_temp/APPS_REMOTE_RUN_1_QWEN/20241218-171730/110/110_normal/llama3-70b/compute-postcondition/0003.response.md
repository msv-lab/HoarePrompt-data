The function `func` does not accept any parameters as the parameter list is empty (`def func():`). Given the constraints, the function is expected to handle integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` internally, but these are not passed as arguments to the function.

Since no specific output or behavior is described for the function, based solely on the provided information, the functionality of the function can be stated as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns an unspecified value based on internal processing of integers n, m, r, and k, which are constrained as specified.**
