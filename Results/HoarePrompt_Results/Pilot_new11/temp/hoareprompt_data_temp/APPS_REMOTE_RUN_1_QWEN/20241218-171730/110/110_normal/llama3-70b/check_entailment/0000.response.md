Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the expected number of caught fishes by placing \(k\) fishes in the pond such that the average number of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is placed randomly.

The program calculates `ans` as the minimum of \(k\) and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), which represents the number of valid positions for the scoop-net. However, this does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Instead, the optimal strategy is to place the fishes in such a way that they cover the maximum possible area when the scoop-net is placed randomly.

To achieve this, we should place the fishes in the center of the pond as much as possible, ensuring that each position of the scoop-net captures at least one fish. The program fails to implement this logic, leading to an incorrect solution. For example, in the given input `(3, 3, 2, 3)`, the program outputs `2.0000000000`, but the correct expected value is `2.5000000000` if the fishes are optimally placed in the central positions.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem and returns an incorrect result for at least one potential case.
