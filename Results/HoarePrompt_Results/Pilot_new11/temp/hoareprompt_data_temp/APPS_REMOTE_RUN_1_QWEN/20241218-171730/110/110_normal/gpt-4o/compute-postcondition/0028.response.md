`cov, x, y` are assigned the values popped from the `heap`. Specifically, `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the `heap`, and `x, y` are the corresponding indices. The `heap` is modified to remove this tuple. The `total_coverage` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)`, `total_coverage` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap, `x` is the first index of the smallest tuple, `y` is the second index of the smallest tuple**
