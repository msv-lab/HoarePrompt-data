The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `s` and `x` are mentioned but are not part of the function's signature. The function returns a value based on certain conditions involving `s` and `x`.

Given the constraints: `s` and `x` are integers such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`.

Since the function signature only includes `func()` without any parameters, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the conditions involving `s` and `x` where `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`.**
