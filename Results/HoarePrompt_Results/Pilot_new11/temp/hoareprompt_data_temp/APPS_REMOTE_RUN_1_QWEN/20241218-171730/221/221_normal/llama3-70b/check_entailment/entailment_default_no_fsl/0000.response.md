Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when \( x \) is 0 correctly. According to the problem description, if \( x \) is 0, there should be exactly one solution, which is \( (a, b) = (\frac{s}{2}, \frac{s}{2}) \) if \( s \) is even. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results for inputs where \( s \) is even and \( x \) is 0. For example, for the input `4 0`, the expected output is `1`, but the provided code will output `0`.
