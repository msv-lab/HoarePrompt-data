Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and does not return anything. It performs bitwise XOR operations on the variable `b` using `a` and `x`. Specifically, it first sets `a` to the result of `b ^ x`, then sets `b` to the result of `a ^ x`. After the function concludes, `a` and `b` are updated based on these operations, but the function itself does not return any values. Given the initial constraints `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`, the function manipulates `a` and `b` within these bounds without affecting `s`. There are no return postconditions mentioned, and the function does not directly modify `s`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function does not use the variable `s` at all, which might be a missing or unnecessary part of the function based on the provided annotations.
- The function does not have any checks to ensure that `b` and `x` are within the specified ranges (i.e., `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`). However, since the function does not directly involve `s`, these checks are not applicable to the given operations on `a` and `b`.
