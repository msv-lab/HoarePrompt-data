The code `b = a ^ x` assigns the value of the bitwise XOR of `a` and `x` to `b`. The value of `a` is defined as `b` XORed with `x`, which means `a = b ^ x`. By applying the XOR operation again, we get `b = (b ^ x) ^ x`. Since XORing a value with itself results in 0, this simplifies to `b = b ^ x ^ x = b ^ 0 = b`. Therefore, `b` remains unchanged.

The states of `s` and `x` are not affected by the given code. Hence, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12, `a` is the result of `b` XORed with `x`, `b` is unchanged**
