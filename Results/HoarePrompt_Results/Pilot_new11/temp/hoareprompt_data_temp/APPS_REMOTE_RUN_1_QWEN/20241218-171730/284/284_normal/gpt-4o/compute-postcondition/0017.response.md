Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25; `(x % i != 0 and x % (i + 2) != 0)`, and `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`. If `x % i == 0` or `x % (i + 2) == 0`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change to `x` and the function does not return anything (implying `x` remains unchanged).***
