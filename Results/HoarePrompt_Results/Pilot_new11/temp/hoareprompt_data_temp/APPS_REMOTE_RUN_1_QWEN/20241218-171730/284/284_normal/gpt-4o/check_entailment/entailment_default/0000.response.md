Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to find a counterexample \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. However, there is a logical issue in the main loop where the function `func_1` is used to check for primality. The function `func_1` is designed to check if a number is prime, but the loop structure and the condition `if not func_1(n * m + 1):` are correct for finding a non-prime number.

However, the issue lies in the fact that the loop starts from \( m = 1 \) and goes up to \( m = 1000 \). While this is guaranteed to find a suitable \( m \) due to the problem statement's guarantee, the code can potentially miss a smaller \( m \) that satisfies the condition if the loop starts from a higher value. The provided solution is correct in terms of logic but does not explicitly address whether a smaller \( m \) could be found if the loop started earlier.

To ensure the correctness, we should verify that the code will always find a valid \( m \) within the given constraints. Given the problem guarantees that such an \( m \) exists within the specified range, the code will indeed find a valid \( m \).

However, the key point is that the problem description requires checking for every potential case, and the code is structured to ensure that it will find a valid \( m \) without explicitly handling all edge cases. Therefore, based on the provided information and the structure of the code, the correctness is confirmed as long as the input constraints are respected.

Since the code logically follows the problem description and guarantees finding a valid \( m \), the primary issue is more about the scope of the loop rather than the logic itself. Hence, the code is correct in its intended purpose.
