Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses the helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, the program prints \( m \) and breaks the loop. Given that the problem guarantees an answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). The output hints confirm that `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers, thus supporting the correctness of the overall program.
