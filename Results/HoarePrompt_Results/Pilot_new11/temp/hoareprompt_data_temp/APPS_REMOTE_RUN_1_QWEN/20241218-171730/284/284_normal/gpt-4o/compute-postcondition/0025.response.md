The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. Based on the given cases, the function returns False for some values of `x` and True for others. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 1000 and return either True or False based on specific conditions for certain values of `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and returns `True` for certain values of `x` and `False` for others.**
