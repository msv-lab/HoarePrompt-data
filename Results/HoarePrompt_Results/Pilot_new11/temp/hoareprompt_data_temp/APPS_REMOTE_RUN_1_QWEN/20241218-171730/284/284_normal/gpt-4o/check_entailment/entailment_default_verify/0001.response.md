Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection and based on the provided output hints, there are issues with the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to check for primality but seems to have some limitations in handling certain composite numbers. 

For instance, the function correctly identifies numbers like 1, 2, and 3, and correctly determines that numbers divisible by 2 or 3 are not prime. However, the function may fail to correctly identify other composite numbers, especially those that are not divisible by 2 or 3 but are still not prime. Examples like 25 and 35, which are composite, would pass the function's checks and incorrectly be identified as prime.

Given the problem description and the need to find a counterexample for any `n`, the function `func_1` must accurately identify composite numbers. Since the provided function does not handle all composite numbers correctly, it cannot guarantee that the program will always find a valid `m` for any given `n`. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this finding.
