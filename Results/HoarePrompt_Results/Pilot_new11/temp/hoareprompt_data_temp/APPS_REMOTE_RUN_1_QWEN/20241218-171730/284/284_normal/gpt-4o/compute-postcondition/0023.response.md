Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and for all integers i where \( i \equiv 5 \mod 6 \) and \( i^2 \leq x \), \( x \% i \neq 0 \) and \( x \% (i + 2) \neq 0 \); i is incremented to a value greater than or equal to the square root of x, and the function does not return anything (implying x remains unchanged).**
