The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial condition that `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and `(x % i != 0 and x % (i + 2) != 0)` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and the unchanged conditions of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and (x % i != 0 and x % (i + 2) != 0); `i` is increased by 6**
