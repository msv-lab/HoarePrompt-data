To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition under which the loop continues: `i * i <= x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25.
   - `(x % i != 0 and x % (i + 2) != 0)` indicates that `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`.
   - `i` is increased by 6 after each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i * i <= x`.

3. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i_current` is increased by 6.
   - For the loop to continue, the next value of `i` (let's call it `i_next`) should satisfy `i_next * i_next <= x`.

4. **Calculating `i_next`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 6, `i_next = i_current + 6`.
   - We need to check if `(i_current + 6) * (i_current + 6) <= x`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` must still satisfy the loop condition.
   - This means `(i_current + 6) * (i_current + 6) <= x`.

### Adjusted State:
- The value of `i` needs to be increased by 6 from its current value.
- Ensure that the new value of `i` satisfies the loop condition `i * i <= x`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25; `(x % i != 0 and x % (i + 2) != 0)`; `i` must be such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`**
