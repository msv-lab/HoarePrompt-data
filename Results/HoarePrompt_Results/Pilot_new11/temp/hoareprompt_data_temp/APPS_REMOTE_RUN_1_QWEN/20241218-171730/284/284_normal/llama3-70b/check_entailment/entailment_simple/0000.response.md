Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the value of `n` in the hypothesis \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

2. **Iterating Over Possible Values of `m`**: The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive). For each value of `m`, it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function `func_1` checks if a given number is prime.
   - If the number is less than 2, it returns `False`.
   - For numbers greater than or equal to 2, it performs a trial division up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

4. **Finding a Counterexample**: The main part of the program checks each value of `m` to see if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. As soon as it finds such an `m`, it prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Guaranteed Solution Existence**: The problem guarantees that there exists at least one `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Therefore, the loop will always find a suitable `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies a value of `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
