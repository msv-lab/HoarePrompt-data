The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the conditions on `n`, `b`, and the calculation for `c` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`, `b` is `b_current - 1`, and the new value of `c` is \(\frac{n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456}{1234}\)**
