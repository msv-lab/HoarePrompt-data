`a` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `a` is `a + 1`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is updated to `n - a * house_cost`. The value of `remaining_after_cars` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`; `a` is `a + 1`**
