The code `exit()` is used to exit the current scope or program. In this case, it will terminate the current operations and end the execution. Since the code does not affect any variables and simply exits, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` remains 0, `a` remains \(a_{\text{initial}} + 2\), `b` is now \(b_{\text{final}} + (k + 3)\), `c` remains \(\left(n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 2) \cdot 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + k + 1) \cdot 123456\right) // 1234\)**
