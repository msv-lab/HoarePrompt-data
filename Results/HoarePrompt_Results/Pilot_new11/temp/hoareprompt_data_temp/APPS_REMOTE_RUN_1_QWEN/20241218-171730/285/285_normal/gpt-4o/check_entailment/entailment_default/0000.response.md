Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1` iterates through all possible combinations of spending on houses, cars, and computers, and checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the code handles all potential cases correctly. It checks all possible combinations of spending on houses, cars, and computers, ensuring that the remaining amount is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer if a valid combination exists. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, considering all necessary scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
