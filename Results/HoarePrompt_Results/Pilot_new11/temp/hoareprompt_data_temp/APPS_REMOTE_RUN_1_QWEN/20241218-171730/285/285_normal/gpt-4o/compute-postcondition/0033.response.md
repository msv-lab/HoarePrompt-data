Postcondition: ***`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken and the same conditions as the precondition are maintained.***
