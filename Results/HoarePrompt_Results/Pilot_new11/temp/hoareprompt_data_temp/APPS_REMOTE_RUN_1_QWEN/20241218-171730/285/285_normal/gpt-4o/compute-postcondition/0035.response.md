To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop iterates over `a` from `0` to `n // house_cost`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
- The function checks if there exists any `b` such that `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.

For the loop to continue, `a` (which represents the number of houses bought) must be less than `n // house_cost + 1`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the value of `a` at the end of the previous iteration**: Let's say `a` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `a` should be less than `n // house_cost + 1`. If `a` was `k`, then for the next iteration, `a` would be `k + 1`.
3. **Adjust the state variables**:
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `remaining_after_cars` will be recalculated based on the new value of `a` (i.e., `k + 1`).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (k + 1) * car_cost`, where `k` is the value of `a` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the given information, we express it symbolically. However, if we assume `k` is the value of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the state becomes:

State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`, and `a` is incremented by 1**.
