The code assigns the value `1234567` to the variable `house_cost`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the assignment operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `house_cost` and retains the information about `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
