Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The logic iterates over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of houses, cars, and computers respectively) and checks if the total cost matches `n`.

From the annotations:
- Before the function call, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- During the iteration, `a` represents the number of houses, and `remaining_after_houses` represents the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.
- In the inner loop, `b` represents the number of cars, and `remaining_after_cars` represents the remaining coins after buying `b` cars.
- The condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:` ensures that the remaining coins can be perfectly divided by the cost of a computer, indicating that the total cost matches `n`.

Since the program systematically checks all possible combinations and the logic is sound, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to spend all of Kolya's initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
