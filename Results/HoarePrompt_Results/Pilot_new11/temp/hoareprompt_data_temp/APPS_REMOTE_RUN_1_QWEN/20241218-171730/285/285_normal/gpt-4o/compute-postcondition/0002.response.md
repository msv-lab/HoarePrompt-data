The code `computer_cost = 1234` assigns the value `1234` to the variable `computer_cost`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `house_cost`, or `car_cost`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234**
