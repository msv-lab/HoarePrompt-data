The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output, but not in the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567`, `a` is `a_initial + 1`, `b` is `b_final + 1`, and `c` is \((n - (a_initial + 1) * 1234567 - (b_final + 1) * 123456) // 1234', the console outputs 'YES'**
