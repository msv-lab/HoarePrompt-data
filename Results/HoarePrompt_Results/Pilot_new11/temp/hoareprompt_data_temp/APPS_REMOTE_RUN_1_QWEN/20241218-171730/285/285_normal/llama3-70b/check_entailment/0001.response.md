Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints to check if there exists a combination such that `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`. 

The logic used in the nested loops ensures that all possible values of `a` and `b` are checked, and for each valid pair, `c` is calculated and verified. If a valid combination is found, the program prints "YES" and exits. If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the structure of the code, it appears that the program correctly checks all necessary cases to determine if it's possible to spend all initial game-coins using only houses, cars, and computers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
