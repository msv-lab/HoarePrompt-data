Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `total` is not specified.
- `n` is as it was before.
- `house_cost` is as it was before.
- `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0.
- `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)`.

### For Loop:
The loop iterates over `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is within the range `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is the value it had before (let's call this value `b_prev`).

2. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop will execute again, `b` will increase by 1, making it `b_prev + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `b_prev + 1` is still within the range `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - If `b_prev + 1` exceeds `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, the loop will stop executing.

3. **States to Adjust:**
   - `b` should be adjusted to `b_prev + 1`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` will be recalculated as `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged unless the loop condition changes.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `b_prev + 1`, and `remaining_after_cars` should be recalculated accordingly. 

Thus, the updated states are:
- `total` is not specified.
- `n` is as it was before.
- `house_cost` is as it was before.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0.
- `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)`.

State: **`total` is not specified, `n` is as it was before, `house_cost` is as it was before, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0, and `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)`**.
