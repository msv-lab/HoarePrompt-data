To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the for loop:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a = n // house_cost`
   - `n` is as it was before
   - `house_cost` is as it was before
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - (n // house_cost) * house_cost`

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Requirements for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs based on the value of `remaining_after_houses`.
   - `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, and the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` evaluates to at least 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `remaining_after_houses`**:
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - (n // house_cost) * house_cost`
   - For `remaining_after_houses` to be positive, `n` should be greater than `(n // house_cost) * house_cost`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1 >= 1`.
   - This simplifies to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost >= 0`, which is always true if `remaining_after_houses > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The key condition for the loop to execute is that `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is positive.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is not specified, `n` is as it was before, `house_cost` is as it was before, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0**
