Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a = a + 1`
- `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`

### Loop Details:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` was incremented by 1.

2. **Update the Values:**
   - `a` was updated to `a + 1`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` was calculated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, where `b` was the value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since `b` was incremented by 1, the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration will be the previous value of `b` plus 1.
   - `remaining_after_cars` needs to be recalculated for the new `b`.

3. **New Value Calculation:**
   - New `b` value: `b_new = b_old + 1`.
   - New `remaining_after_cars` value: `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 1) * car_cost`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b_new` must be within this range.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
- `a` remains unchanged from the previous iteration: `a = a + 1`.
- `remaining_after_cars` needs to be recalculated for `b` incremented by 1: `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 1) * car_cost`.
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` remains unchanged since it depends only on `remaining_after_cars`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is `a + 1`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_old + 1) * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`**
