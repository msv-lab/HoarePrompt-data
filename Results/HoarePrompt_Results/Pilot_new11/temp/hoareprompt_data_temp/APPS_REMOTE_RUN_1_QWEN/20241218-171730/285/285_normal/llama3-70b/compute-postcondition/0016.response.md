The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without changing any variables or performing any operations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`, `b` is `b_current`, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, print('YES') has been executed**
