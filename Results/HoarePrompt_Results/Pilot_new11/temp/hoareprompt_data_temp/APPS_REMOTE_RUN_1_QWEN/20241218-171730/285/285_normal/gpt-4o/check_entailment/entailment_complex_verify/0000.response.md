Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies the behavior of the program, which aligns with the intended functionality. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: Kolya needs to check if his initial score `n` can be exactly spent by buying houses, cars, and computers.
2. **Code Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) that can be bought within the budget `n`.
   - For each combination, it checks if the remaining coins after buying `a` houses and `b` cars can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`).
   - If such a combination is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it returns 'NO'.
3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, showing how the values evolve during the execution of the loops.
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the logic described in the problem description and the original assessment.

Given that the code iterates over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if the remaining coins can be perfectly divided by the cost of a computer, the program correctly determines if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
