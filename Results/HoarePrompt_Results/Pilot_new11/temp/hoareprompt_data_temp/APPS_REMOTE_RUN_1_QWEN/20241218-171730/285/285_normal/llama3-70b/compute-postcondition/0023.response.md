The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variable values. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567`, `a` is `a_initial + 1`, `b` is `b_final`, `c` is \((n - (a_initial + 1) * 1234567 - b_final * 123456) // 1234\), and the equation \(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234\) equals `n`. Printed output: 'YES'**
