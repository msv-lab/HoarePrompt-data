Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The logic iterates over all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of houses, cars, and computers respectively) and checks if the total cost matches `n`. 

Hereâ€™s a brief walkthrough of the logic:
- It starts by iterating over all possible values of `a` (number of houses).
- For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.
- Then, it iterates over all possible values of `b` (number of cars) using the remaining coins.
- Finally, it checks if the remaining coins after buying `b` cars can be perfectly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`).

This approach ensures that all potential combinations are checked, and since the constraints are manageable (up to `n // house_cost + 1` iterations for `a` and similarly for `b`), the solution will correctly determine if a valid combination exists.
