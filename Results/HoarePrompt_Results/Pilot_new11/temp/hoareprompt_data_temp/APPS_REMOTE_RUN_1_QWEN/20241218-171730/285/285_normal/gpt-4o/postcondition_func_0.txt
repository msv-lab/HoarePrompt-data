Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates through possible combinations of spending `n` units on houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, after exhausting all combinations, it returns 'NO'. The function considers all possible ways to spend up to `n` units on houses and cars before checking if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly divisible by the cost of a house, car, or computer, or when no valid combination is found.
