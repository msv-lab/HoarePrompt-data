The `exit()` function call terminates the program without executing any further code. This means that no variables are updated or affected by the given code snippet. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is \(a_{\text{initial}} + 2\), `b` is \(b_{\text{final}} + (k + 2)\), `c` is \(\left(n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 2) \cdot 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + k + 1) \cdot 123456\right) // 1234\)**
