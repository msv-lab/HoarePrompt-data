Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`.
- `a` is `a + 1`.

### For Loop:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0. This means that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least 0.
2. **Interpreting `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`**:
   - `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is the integer division of `remaining_after_houses` by `car_cost`.
   - For this value to be at least 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

### Adjusted States:
- Since `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost` for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is at least `car_cost`.
- We also need to ensure that the initial values of `remaining_after_cars` and `a` are consistent with their definitions and that `a` is properly incremented.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_cars` should be defined as `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`, where `a` is incremented to `a + 1` initially.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`, and `a` is `a + 1`**
