Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop. The final value of `current_cost` is the sum of `t - 1 - a[0]` for each `length` in `a` where `length < t - 1`, and `length - (t + 1)` for each `length` in `a` where `length > t + 1`. The current value of `current_cost` is lower than `min_cost`, and `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `a` retain their updated values as per the loop execution.**
