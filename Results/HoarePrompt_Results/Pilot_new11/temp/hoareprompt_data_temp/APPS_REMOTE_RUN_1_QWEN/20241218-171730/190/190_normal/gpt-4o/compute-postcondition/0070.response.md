The code snippet updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. Here, `length` is the current length of the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, its length `length` is at least 2. The value of `t` is not specified, but it will be used in the calculation.

Let's denote the length of the list `a` as `length` and the value of `t` as `t`.

- Initially, `current_cost` is adjusted by `t - 1 - length`.
- The value of `current_cost` changes by `t - 1 - length`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements; `current_cost` is adjusted by `t - 1 - length`**
