According to the code, the loop iterates backward from `mid - 1` to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid - 1` and `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid))` for each `x` in `sticks`. The value of `min_cost` and `min_t` remains unchanged if the current `cost` is less than `min_cost`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the initial value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1 from `mid - 1` to `mid - 2`.

State: **`i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`**
