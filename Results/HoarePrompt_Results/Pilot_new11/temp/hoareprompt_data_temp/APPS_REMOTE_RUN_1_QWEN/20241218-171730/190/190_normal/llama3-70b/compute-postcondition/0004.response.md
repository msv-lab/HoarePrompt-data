The code calculates the cost as the sum of absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`. Since `mid` is the median of the sorted list `sticks`, the cost is minimized when using `mid`. However, the actual value of `cost` depends on the specific values in `sticks`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers
- `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`

After executing the code, `cost` is updated to the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and `mid`. The values of `n`, `sticks`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`.**
