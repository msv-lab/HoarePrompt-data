Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal \( t \) value when the median itself is one of the elements in the list. For instance, in the example provided:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be:
```
3 0
```

However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly. It only considers the immediate neighbors of the median value, which leads to an incorrect cost calculation. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the optimal \( t \) value is not directly adjacent to the median, such as when the median itself is the optimal choice. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is justified.
