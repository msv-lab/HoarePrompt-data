`best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The previous value of `t` is `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `min_cost` is `current_cost`
- `best_t` is `t`
- `t` is `n + 1`
- `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given
- `length` is the last element in the list `a`

Since `best_t` is now assigned the value of `t`, the updated value of `best_t` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `min_cost` is `current_cost`, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 1`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, `length` is the last element in the list `a`**
