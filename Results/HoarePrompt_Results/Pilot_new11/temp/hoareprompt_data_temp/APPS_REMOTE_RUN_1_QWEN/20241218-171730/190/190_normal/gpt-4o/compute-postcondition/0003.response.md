The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `best_t`. The initial value of `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `min_cost` is set to infinity. The assignment does not affect `a` or `min_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `min_cost` is infinity; `best_t` is -1**
