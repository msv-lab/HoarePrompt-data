Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling the Median Value Directly**: The code considers only values around the median (`mid - 1` and `mid + 1`) but does not explicitly handle the case where the median value itself is one of the elements in the list. This could potentially lead to incorrect cost calculations because the cost of moving elements to the exact median value should also be considered.

2. **Edge Case with Duplicate Values**: If the list contains duplicate values at the median, the current implementation might not correctly calculate the minimum cost. For example, if the list is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` and the median is `2`, the code will consider the cost of moving elements to `1` and `3` but might miss the fact that moving elements to `2` could also be cheaper due to the presence of duplicates.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 0
```

However, the provided code might not handle this case correctly because it only checks values around the median without considering the exact median value itself.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to a **False** correctness evaluation.
