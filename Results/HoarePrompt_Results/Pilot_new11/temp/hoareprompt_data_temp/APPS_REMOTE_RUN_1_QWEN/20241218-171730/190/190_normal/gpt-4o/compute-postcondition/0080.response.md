The code `print(best_t, min_cost)` simply prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` which were determined during the loop execution. The variables `t`, `current_cost`, and `a` are not directly modified by this print statement, so they retain their final values from the loop.

Given the initial state and the fact that `print` only outputs the values without changing them, the output of the print statement is the current values of `best_t` and `min_cost`.

Output State: **`best_t` is the value when `min_cost` was last updated, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `t` is 101, `current_cost` retains its final value, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers.**
