Postcondition: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is updated to the new minimum cost found, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`. The current value of `cost` is lower than `min_cost`**
