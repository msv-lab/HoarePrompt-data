The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0**
