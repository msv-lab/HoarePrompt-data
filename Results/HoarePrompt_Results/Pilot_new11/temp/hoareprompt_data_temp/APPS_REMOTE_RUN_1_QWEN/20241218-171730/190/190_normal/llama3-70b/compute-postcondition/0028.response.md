The line `min_cost = cost` assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. Since `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`, and the current value of `cost` is lower than `min_cost`, this assignment updates `min_cost` to this lower value.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `min_t`, `sticks`, `t`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current lower value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
