The code `min_t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`. The value of `i` is `mid + 1`, so `min_t` is now also `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `min_t` is `mid + 1`, `min_cost` is the current lower value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
