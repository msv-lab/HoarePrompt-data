Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost and the value of \( t \) for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
Since all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of each other, the optimal \( t \) would be the median (which is 2.5, but we can choose 2 or 3 since we are looking for an integer), and the cost would be 0.

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. It calculates the median as `sticks[n // 2]`, which would be 2 for this input, and then tries to minimize the cost by considering only the values around the median. This approach fails to recognize that choosing \( t = 3 \) results in a cost of 0, which is the minimum possible cost.

The program only considers the immediate neighbors of the median value, and thus it might miss the optimal solution. For the given input, the correct output should be:
```
3 0
```

But the program outputs a non-zero cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
