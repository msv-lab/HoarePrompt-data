According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is within the range from `mid + 1` to `100`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `i` is `mid + 2`
- `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost
- `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers
- `t` is equal to `mid`
- `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `mid + 3`.

Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `101`, `i` being `mid + 3` will satisfy the condition as long as `mid + 3 < 101`.

Additionally, `min_t` and `min_cost` should be checked to ensure they are updated correctly based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
