Postcondition: ***`i` is `mid - 1` and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for each x in sticks. If the current `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` remains unchanged and `min_t` remains `i`. Since there is no else part, the conditions and values remain as they are after the if statement executes.***
