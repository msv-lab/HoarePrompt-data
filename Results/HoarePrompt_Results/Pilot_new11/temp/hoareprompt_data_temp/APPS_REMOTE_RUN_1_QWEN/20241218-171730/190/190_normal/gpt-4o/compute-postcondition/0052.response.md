The code sets `best_t` to the value of `t`. The value of `t` is `n + 2`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `best_t`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the current value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is `n + 2`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop.**
