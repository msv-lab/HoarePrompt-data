`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. The length of the list `a` is stored in the variable `length`. The initial condition for `a` is that it is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and its length satisfies one of the following conditions: `len(a) < t - 2`, `len(a) > t + 2`, or `len(a) <= t`. The value of `length` is updated to `len(a)`, and `current_cost` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element; `length` is `len(a)`; `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`**
