Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program attempts to find the optimal \( t \) and minimum cost by considering the median value and its immediate neighbors. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee finding the global minimum cost. 

Specifically, the program only considers the values immediately around the median and does not explore all possible values of \( t \) between 1 and 100. For instance, in the input provided:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
The median value is 2.5, and the program considers \( t = 2 \) and \( t = 3 \). While \( t = 3 \) would result in a cost of 0, the program might not reach this conclusion because it stops considering \( t \) values once it finds a better option within the immediate neighbors of the median. 

The annotated version confirms that the program only checks the immediate neighbors of the median and does not exhaustively search the entire range of possible \( t \) values from 1 to 100. Therefore, the program may miss the optimal solution, as demonstrated by the example input where the correct output should be:
```
3 0
```
but the program outputs a non-zero cost. Thus, the original assessment is correct, and the program is not guaranteed to find the minimum cost and the correct value of \( t \) for all cases.
