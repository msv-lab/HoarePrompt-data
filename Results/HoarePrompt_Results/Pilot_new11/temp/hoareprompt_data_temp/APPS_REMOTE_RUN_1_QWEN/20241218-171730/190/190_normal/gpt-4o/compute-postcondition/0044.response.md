According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution.
- `best_t` is `n + 1`.
- `t` is `n + 2`.
- `length` is the next value from the list `a`.

The loop updates `current_cost` based on the condition:
- If `length < t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated by `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`.
- If `length >= t - 1`, `current_cost` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `length` needs to be the next value from the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list and we've just used one element, there must be at least one more element left in the list. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `a` is a non-empty list, so it has at least one more element.
2. `length` is the current element from the list `a`.
3. For the loop to continue, `length` must be set to the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element.
- `min_cost` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `best_t` remains `n + 1`.
- `t` remains `n + 2`.
- `length` is now the next value from the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `length` is the next value from the list `a`.**
