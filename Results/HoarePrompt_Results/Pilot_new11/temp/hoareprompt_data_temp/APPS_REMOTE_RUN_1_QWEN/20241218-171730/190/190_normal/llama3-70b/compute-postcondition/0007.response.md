The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `t`. Since `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_t` is also equal to `mid`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still equal to `mid`. All other variables (`n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `cost`, and `min_cost`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`.**
