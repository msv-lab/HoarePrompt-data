Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `length` is the next value from the list `a`. If `length > t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to the old value of `current_cost` plus `length - (t + 1)`. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur in this case.***
