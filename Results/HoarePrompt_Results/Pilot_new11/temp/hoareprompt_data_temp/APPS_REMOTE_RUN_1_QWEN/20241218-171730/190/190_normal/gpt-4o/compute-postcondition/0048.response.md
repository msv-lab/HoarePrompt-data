Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`. If `length < t - 1`, `current_cost` is the original value plus `n + 1 - a[0]`. If `length >= t - 1`, and specifically if `length > t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to it. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
