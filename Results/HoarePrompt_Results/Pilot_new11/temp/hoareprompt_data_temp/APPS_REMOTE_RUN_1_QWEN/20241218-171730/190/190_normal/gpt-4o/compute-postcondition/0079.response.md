Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, `best_t` is the value of `t` when `min_cost` is updated, `t` is 101, and `current_cost` is the cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given for each element in `a`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is updated to the corresponding value of `t`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `best_t` retain their final updated values, and `current_cost` retains its final value.**
