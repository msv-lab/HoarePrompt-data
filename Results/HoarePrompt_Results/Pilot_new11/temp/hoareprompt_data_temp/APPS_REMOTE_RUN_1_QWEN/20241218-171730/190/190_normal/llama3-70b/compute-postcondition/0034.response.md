The code `min_t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`. This means that `min_t` now holds the same value as `i`, which was initially `mid + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `min_t` is `mid + 2`, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
