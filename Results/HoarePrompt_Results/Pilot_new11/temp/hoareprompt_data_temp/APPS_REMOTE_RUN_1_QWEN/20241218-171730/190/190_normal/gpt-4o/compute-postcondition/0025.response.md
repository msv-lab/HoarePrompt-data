Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is `current_cost`, `best_t` is `t`, `t` is `n + 1`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`.***
