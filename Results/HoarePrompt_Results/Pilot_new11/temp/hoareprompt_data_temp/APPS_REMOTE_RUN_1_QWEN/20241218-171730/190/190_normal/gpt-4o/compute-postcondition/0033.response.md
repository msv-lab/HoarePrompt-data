The code updates `current_cost` by adding the difference between `t - 1` and the length of the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a non-empty list
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution
- `best_t` is `n + 1`
- `t` is `n + 2`
- `current_cost` is 0
- The length of `a` is less than `t - 1`

Let's denote the length of `a` as `len(a)`. Since `len(a)` is less than `t - 1` and `t` is `n + 2`, we know `len(a) < n + 1`.

Now, `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - len(a)` to its current value, which is 0. So, `current_cost` becomes `t - 1 - len(a)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is a non-empty list
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution
- `best_t` is `n + 1`
- `t` is `n + 2`
- `current_cost` is `t - 1 - len(a)`
- The length of `a` is less than `n + 1`

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is `t - 1 - len(a)`, and the length of `a` is less than `n + 1`**
