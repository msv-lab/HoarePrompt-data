Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the original value of `current_cost` plus `length - (n + 3)`, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`. This is true whether the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` or not.**
