Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` is updated to `t`, and `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `current_cost` retain their initial values.***
