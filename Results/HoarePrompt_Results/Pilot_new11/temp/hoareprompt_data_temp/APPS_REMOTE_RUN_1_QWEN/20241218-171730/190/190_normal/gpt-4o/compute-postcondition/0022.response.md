Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is `new_length - 4` if the second element of `a` is less than 0 and the new `length` is greater than 2, otherwise `current_cost` is `2 * a[1] + new_length - 6` where `new_length` is the next element in the list `a`.***
