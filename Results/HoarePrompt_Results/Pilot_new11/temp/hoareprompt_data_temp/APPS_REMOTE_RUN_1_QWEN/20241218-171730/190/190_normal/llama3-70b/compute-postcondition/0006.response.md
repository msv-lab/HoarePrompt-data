The code `min_cost = cost` assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. The value of `min_cost` is set to the current value of `cost`, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
