`current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is the length of the list `a`, which is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and `t` is `n + 2`, we know that `length` is at least `n + 3`. Therefore, the updated value of `current_cost` is the original value plus `length - (t + 1)`, which simplifies to `length - (n + 3)`.

The states of the other variables (`a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `current_cost`) are updated accordingly. The precondition that the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` is also still valid, although the specific length is not provided in the initial state, we know it is greater than `n + 3`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the original value of `current_cost` plus `length - (n + 3)`, and the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`.**
