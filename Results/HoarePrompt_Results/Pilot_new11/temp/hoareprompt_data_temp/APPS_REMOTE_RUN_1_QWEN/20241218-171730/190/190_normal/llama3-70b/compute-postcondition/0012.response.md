The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial values of `i` and `min_cost` are `mid - 1` and `cost` respectively, and the condition that `cost` is less than `min_cost` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `mid - 1`, `min_cost` is `cost`, `min_t` is `i`, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 1`, `min_cost` is `cost`, `min_t` is `i`, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.**
