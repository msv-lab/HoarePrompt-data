Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `length`: This variable is taken from the list `a` in each iteration.
   - `a`: The list of integers.
   - `min_cost`: The minimum cost found so far.
   - `best_t`: The value of `t` that gives the minimum cost.
   - `t`: The current value being tested (initially set to 1).
   - `current_cost`: The cost calculated based on the current `t` and `length`.
   - `length`: The second element of the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The loop condition is implicitly defined by the range of `length` as it comes from `a`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `min_cost` is infinity.
   - `best_t` is -1.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `current_cost` is \(-2\) if `length < t - 1`, otherwise `current_cost` is \(2 \times \text{second\_element\_of\_a} - 4\).
   - `length` is the second element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `t` is 1, we need to calculate the `current_cost` for the next `length` in the list `a`.
   - After processing the current `length`, `t` remains 1 unless updated within the loop body, but since no update is mentioned, `t` stays 1.
   - The `length` for the next iteration will be the next element in the list `a`.

5. **Update the `current_cost` Calculation:**
   - If `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` remains \(-2\).
   - If `length >= t - 1`, then `current_cost` is \(2 \times \text{second\_element\_of\_a} - 4\).

6. **Determine the New State:**
   - The next `length` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `t` remains 1.
   - `current_cost` needs to be recalculated based on the new `length`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `min_cost` is infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 1.
- `current_cost` is \(-2\) if the new `length` is less than \(1 - 1 = 0\), otherwise `current_cost` is \(2 \times \text{second\_element\_of\_a} - 4\).
- The new `length` is the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is \(-2\) if the new `length` is less than 0, otherwise `current_cost` is \(2 \times \text{second\_element\_of\_a} - 4\), and the new `length` is the next element in the list `a`.**
