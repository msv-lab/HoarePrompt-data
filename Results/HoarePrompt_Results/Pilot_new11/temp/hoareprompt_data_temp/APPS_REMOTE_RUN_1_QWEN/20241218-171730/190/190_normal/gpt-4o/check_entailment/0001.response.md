Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal value of \( t \) and the minimum cost to make all stick lengths almost good for \( t \). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Range of \( t \)**: The program iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100, which covers the entire range of possible stick lengths as specified in the problem.

2. **Cost Calculation**: For each value of \( t \), the program calculates the cost of changing each stick's length to be almost good for \( t \). This is done by checking if the stick length is less than \( t - 1 \) or greater than \( t + 1 \) and adding the necessary adjustments to the cost.

3. **Tracking Minimum Cost**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of \( t \) throughout the iteration.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value of \( t \) and the minimum cost as required.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There is no apparent edge case or scenario where the program fails to meet the requirements as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
