`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given the initial values, `length` is the next value from the list `a`, `t` is `n + 2`, and `best_t` is `n + 1`. Since `t` and `length` are not defined in the initial state, we will use their given expressions.

The code updates `current_cost` but does not change the values of `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, or `t`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is updated by `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`**
