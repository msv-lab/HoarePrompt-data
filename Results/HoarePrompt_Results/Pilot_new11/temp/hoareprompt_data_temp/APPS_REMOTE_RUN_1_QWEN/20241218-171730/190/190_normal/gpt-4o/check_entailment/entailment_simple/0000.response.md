Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here’s a detailed explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of sticks \( n \) and the lengths of the sticks \( a \).
   - It ensures that \( n \) is within the specified range (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1000) and each \( a_i \) is within the specified range (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 100).

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_cost` and `best_t` are initialized appropriately. `min_cost` is set to infinity to ensure any calculated cost will be lower, and `best_t` is initialized to -1 to store the optimal value of \( t \).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100.
   - For each value of \( t \), it calculates the cost of transforming all sticks to be almost good for \( t \). This is done by iterating through each stick length and computing the cost based on whether the stick needs to be shortened or lengthened.
   - The formula used to calculate the cost for each stick is:
     - If the stick length \( a_i \) is less than \( t - 1 \), the cost is \( t - 1 - a_i \).
     - If the stick length \( a_i \) is greater than \( t + 1 \), the cost is \( a_i - (t + 1) \).

4. **Updating the Best Solution**:
   - If the current calculated cost is lower than the previously recorded minimum cost (`min_cost`), the program updates both `min_cost` and `best_t` to the current values.

5. **Output**:
   - After completing the loop, the program prints the optimal value of \( t \) and the minimum cost.

### Why It Is Correct:
- The program correctly handles all constraints and conditions specified in the problem description.
- It considers all possible values of \( t \) and calculates the cost for each.
- It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of \( t \).
- The output format matches the requirement, printing the optimal \( t \) and the minimum cost.

Since the program adheres to the logic and requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
