The variable `t` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`. The other variables (`n`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `cost`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`**
