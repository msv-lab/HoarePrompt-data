The code sets `min_cost` to the value of the `cost` variable. This means that the value of `min_cost` is now the same as the current value of `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
