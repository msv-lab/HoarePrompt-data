The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function calculates the minimum value of the expression 2 + 2a + 2b, where a is an integer in the range [1, floor(sqrt(n))], and b is the ceiling of n divided by a. It then returns the value of `min_segments_needed`, which corresponds to the minimum calculated value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the minimum value of 2 + 2a + 2b, where a and b are determined as described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and returns the minimum value of 2 + 2a + 2b, where a is an integer in the range [1, floor(sqrt(n))], and b is the ceiling of n divided by a.**
