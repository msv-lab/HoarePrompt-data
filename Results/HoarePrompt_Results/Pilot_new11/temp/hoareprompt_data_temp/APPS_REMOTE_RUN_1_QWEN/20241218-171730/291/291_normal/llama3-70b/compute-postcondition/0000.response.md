`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The previous value of `n` (an integer between 1 and \(10^9\)) is replaced by the integer input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
