The code calculates the bit length of `n`, subtracts 1 from it, multiplies the result by 2, and then adds 2. It prints the final value. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), the bit length of `n` (denoted as `n.bit_length()`) ranges from 1 to 30.

Let's denote the bit length of `n` as `b`. So, `b = n.bit_length()` and `1 ≤ b ≤ 30`.

The expression `2 * (b - 1) + 2` simplifies to `2b`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`, which is a value between 2 and 62.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; the output of the print statement is 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2**
