Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of segments needed based on a different formula than what is required by the problem description.

According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. This means that for each new square added, the minimum number of additional segments needed is 2 (one vertical and one horizontal). However, the current implementation tries to minimize the number of segments needed for drawing multiple squares in a more complex manner, which is not aligned with the actual requirements.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw 1 square, the minimum number of segments needed is 2 (as described in the examples). But the current implementation calculates a much higher number, which is incorrect. For instance, when `n = 1`, the program outputs 2, which is correct, but for larger values like `n = 2`, it outputs 3 instead of 2, and for `n = 4`, it outputs 4 instead of 4.

The correct approach would be to directly calculate the number of segments needed as `2 * n` because each square requires 2 new segments that don't need to be drawn with a ruler. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
print(2 * n)
```

This simple calculation ensures that the program correctly handles all cases according to the problem description.
