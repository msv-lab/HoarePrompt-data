Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` does not match the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, for `n = 2`, the expected output is `3`, but the program outputs `4`. This discrepancy indicates that the program's logic is flawed and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of False is justified.
