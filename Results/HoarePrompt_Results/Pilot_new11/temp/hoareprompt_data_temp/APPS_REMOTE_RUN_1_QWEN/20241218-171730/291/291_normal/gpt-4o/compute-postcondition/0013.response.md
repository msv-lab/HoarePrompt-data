Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) and \(b = \left\lceil \frac{n}{a} \right\rceil\); `a` is the last value of `a` within the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) that produced the minimum `segments_needed`; `b` is the corresponding value of \(\left\lceil \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \right\rceil\); `segments_needed` is the final minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
- For each `a`, it calculates `b` using the formula \(\left\lceil \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \right\rceil\).
- It then computes `segments_needed` as \(2(a + b)\).
- The loop updates `min_segments_needed` with the minimum value of `segments_needed` found during its iterations.
- After the loop completes, `min_segments_needed` will hold the smallest value of \(2(a + b)\) found for any valid `a`.
- The value of `a` that led to the minimum `segments_needed` will be the last value of `a` within the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\).
- Similarly, the corresponding value of `b` will be the value calculated for that specific `a`.
