You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy involves drawing the minimum number of initial segments with a ruler, which should be either the number of columns or rows needed to cover all squares. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

For example, consider \( n = 4 \):

- If Sofia needs to draw 4 squares, the most efficient way is to draw 2 vertical and 2 horizontal segments initially, totaling 4 segments. This is because the optimal solution would involve drawing 2 vertical and 2 horizontal segments, which are used to guide the drawing of the remaining segments.

However, the current program calculates something different:

```python
n = 4
print(func_1(n))
```

This would output `4`, which is incorrect because the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is actually `4` (2 vertical and 2 horizontal).

The correct approach should directly calculate the number of initial vertical and horizontal segments required to cover all squares. The optimal solution is simply \( 2 \times \max(\text{number of rows}, \text{number of columns}) \).

A corrected version of the function could look like this:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

def func_1(n):
    side_length = int(math.sqrt(n))
    if side_length * side_length == n:
        return 2 * side_length
    else:
        return 2 * (side_length + 1)

result = func_1(n)
print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of segments drawn with a ruler is minimized by considering the dimensions of the grid needed to accommodate all squares.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\), and \(b\) is the ceiling of \(n\) divided by \(a\). The function iterates through all possible values of \(a\) in the specified range, computes \(b\) for each \(a\), and calculates the corresponding \(2 + 2a + 2b\). It keeps track of the minimum value found during this process. If `n` is exactly a perfect square, the function will consider both the integer and the next integer for \(a\) to ensure the minimum value is correctly identified. The function returns the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\), which corresponds to the optimal values of \(a\) and \(b\) that achieve this minimum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
