The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since no specific condition or output is provided, we can only describe the parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
