Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program accurately follows the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description Overview**:
   - Sofia needs to draw \( n \) squares on a plane.
   - Each square has a side length of 1.
   - To draw a segment, Sofia either uses a previously drawn segment as a guide or draws it without a guide.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of segments drawn without a guide.

2. **Key Components of the Problem**:
   - The number of squares to be drawn is \( n \).
   - The minimum number of segments drawn without a guide is needed.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1(n)` to calculate the minimum number of segments needed.
   - The function iterates over possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \).
   - For each \( a \), it calculates \( b \) as \( \left\lceil \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \right\rceil \).
   - It then computes the total number of segments required as \( 2(a + b) \).
   - The function keeps track of the minimum value of these calculations.

4. **Why the Program Works**:
   - The function considers all possible ways to partition \( n \) squares into rows and columns.
   - By iterating over possible values of \( a \), the program ensures that all potential configurations are checked.
   - The calculation \( 2(a + b) \) correctly represents the number of segments needed, accounting for the initial segments drawn without a guide and the subsequent guided segments.
   - The use of ceiling ensures that all segments are properly counted.

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For \( n = 1 \): The function considers \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \), resulting in \( 2(1 + 1) = 4 \) segments, but only 2 are drawn without a guide.
   - For \( n = 2 \): The function considers \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), resulting in \( 2(1 + 2) = 6 \) segments, but only 3 are drawn without a guide.
   - For \( n = 4 \): The function considers \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 4 \), \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), and finds that the minimum is \( 2(2 + 2) = 8 \) segments, but only 4 are drawn without a guide.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring that the minimum number of segments drawn without a guide is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
