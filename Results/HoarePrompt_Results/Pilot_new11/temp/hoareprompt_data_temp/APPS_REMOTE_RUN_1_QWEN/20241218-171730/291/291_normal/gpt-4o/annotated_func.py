def func_1(n):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) and \(b = \left\lceil \frac{n}{a} \right\rceil\); `a` is the last value of `a` within the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) that produced the minimum `segments_needed`; `b` is the corresponding value of \(\left\lceil \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \right\rceil\); `segments_needed` is the final minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\).
    return min_segments_needed
    #`The program returns min_segments_needed which is the minimum value of 2 + 2a + 2b where a is an integer in the range [1, floor(sqrt(n))], and b is the ceiling of n divided by a; and a and b correspond to the values that produce this minimum`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\), and \(b\) is the ceiling of \(n\) divided by \(a\). The function iterates through all possible values of \(a\) in the specified range, computes \(b\) for each \(a\), and calculates the corresponding \(2 + 2a + 2b\). It keeps track of the minimum value found during this process. If `n` is exactly a perfect square, the function will consider both the integer and the next integer for \(a\) to ensure the minimum value is correctly identified. The function returns the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\), which corresponds to the optimal values of \(a\) and \(b\) that achieve this minimum.
