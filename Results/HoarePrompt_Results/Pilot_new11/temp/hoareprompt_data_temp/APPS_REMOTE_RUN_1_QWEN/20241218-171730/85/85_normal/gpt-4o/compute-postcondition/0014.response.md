The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition involving the integer `n` within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we can infer that the function might return a specific value or perform an operation based on the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the integer `n` within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
