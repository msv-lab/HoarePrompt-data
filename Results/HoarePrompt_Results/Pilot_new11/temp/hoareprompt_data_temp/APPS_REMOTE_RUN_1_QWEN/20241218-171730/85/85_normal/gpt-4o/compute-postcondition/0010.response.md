The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Since `n` must end in 9, it can be expressed as `10k + 9` for some integer `k`. After performing the operation, `n` will be `k`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `k` (where `n` originally was `10k + 9`), `max_9s` is 3**
