`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and this constraint still applies. However, since the actual value of `n` is now taken from user input, the exact value is not specified here but it remains within the given range.

Output State: **2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
