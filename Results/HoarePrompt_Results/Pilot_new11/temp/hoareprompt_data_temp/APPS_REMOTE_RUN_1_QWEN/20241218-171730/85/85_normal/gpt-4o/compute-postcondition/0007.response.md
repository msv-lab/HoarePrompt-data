`n` is divided by 10 using integer division, which removes the last digit from `n`. Since `n` ends in 8, after performing `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` will no longer end in 8. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer obtained by removing the last digit (which was 8) from the original value of `n`, `max_9s` is 2**
