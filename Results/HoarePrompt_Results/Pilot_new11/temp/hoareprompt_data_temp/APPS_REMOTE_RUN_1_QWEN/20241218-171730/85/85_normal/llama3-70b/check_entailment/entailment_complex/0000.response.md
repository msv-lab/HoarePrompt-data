Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, Polycarp wants to find pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, the current implementation checks if the sum of each pair \( (i, n-i) \) is divisible by the last non-zero digit of the sum, which is not the same as ending with the maximum possible number of nines.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following:

1. **Example with \( n = 7 \):**
   - The shovels cost 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 burles.
   - The pairs that should be counted are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5) because:
     - \( 2 + 7 = 9 \) (ends with one 9)
     - \( 3 + 6 = 9 \) (ends with one 9)
     - \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) (ends with one 9)

2. **Current Program Logic:**
   - The program checks if \( (i + (n - i)) \% 10^{(\text{len}(str(i + (n - i))) - 1)} == 0 \).
   - For \( n = 7 \):
     - \( 1 + 6 = 7 \) (7 % 10^1 = 7 % 10 = 7, not 0)
     - \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) (7 % 10^1 = 7 % 10 = 7, not 0)
     - \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) (7 % 10^1 = 7 % 10 = 7, not 0)

The program incorrectly counts pairs where the sum is divisible by 10, instead of checking for the maximum number of trailing nines.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve finding the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum \( i + (n - i) \). This can be achieved by converting the sum to a string and counting the trailing '9's.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        total_cost = i + (n - i)
        str_total = str(total_cost)
        while str_total.endswith('9'):
            max_nines += 1
            str_total = str_total[:-1]
    
    print(max_nines)
```

This corrected version checks each pair to see how many trailing nines the sum has, and accumulates the count of such pairs. This ensures the program meets the requirement of finding pairs whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.
