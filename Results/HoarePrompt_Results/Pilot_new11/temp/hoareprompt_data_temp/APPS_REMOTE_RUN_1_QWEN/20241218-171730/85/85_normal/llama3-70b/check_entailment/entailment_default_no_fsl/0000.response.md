Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code checks if the sum of `i` and `n-i` is divisible by the last non-zero digit of the sum, which is not the same as checking if the sum ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. The correct output should be `3` because the pairs `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, and `(4, 5)` have sums ending with a nine (`49`, `49`, `29` respectively). However, the code will not identify these pairs correctly because it uses the last non-zero digit instead of the trailing nines.

To fix this, the code should check if the sum of `i` and `n-i` ends with the maximum number of nines. This can be done by repeatedly subtracting 10 from the sum until it no longer ends in 9, and then checking if the result is zero. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    max_nines = 0
    # Find the maximum number of trailing nines
    while n >= 10:
        n //= 10
        max_nines += 1
    
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        total = i + (n - i)
        # Remove trailing zeros to count nines
        while total % 10 == 9:
            total //= 10
        if total == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version finds the maximum number of trailing nines and then checks each pair to see if their sum has that many trailing nines.
