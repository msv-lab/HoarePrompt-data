Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \), removes those trailing 9s, and calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. Specifically, it computes the product of the remaining part of \( n \) plus one and the count of trailing 9s. Finally, it prints this computed value. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value explicitly; however, the printed value can be considered its output.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n \) is 999...9 (a number consisting only of 9s), the function will correctly count all the 9s and compute the value as \((\text{remaining part of } n + 1) \times (\text{count of 9s})\).
- If \( n \) has no trailing 9s, the function will compute the value as \((\text{remaining part of } n + 1) \times 0\), which is just \(\text{remaining part of } n + 1\).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values or numbers outside the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). In practice, this would likely result in a runtime error or an incorrect behavior, but the function itself does not explicitly validate these conditions.
