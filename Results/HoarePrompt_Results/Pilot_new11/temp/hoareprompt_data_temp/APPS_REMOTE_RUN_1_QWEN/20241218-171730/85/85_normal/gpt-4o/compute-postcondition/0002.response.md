According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; max_9s` is 0.

For the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to be true, `n + 1` must end in 0, meaning `n` must end in 9. Therefore, `n` must be such that when incremented by 1, it becomes a multiple of 10.

Given that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, the only way for `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to hold true is if `n` ends in 9. Hence, we need to adjust the state so that `n` ends in 9.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, specifically `n` must end in 9; `max_9s` is 0**
