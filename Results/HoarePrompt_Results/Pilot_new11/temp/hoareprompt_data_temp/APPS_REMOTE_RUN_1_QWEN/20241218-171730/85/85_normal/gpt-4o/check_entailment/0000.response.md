Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines, but it fails to consider all cases correctly.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program calculates `max_9s` as the number of trailing zeros in `(n + 1)`.
2. It then calculates the number of valid pairs as `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

However, this logic has a flaw. Consider the case where `n = 50`. According to the problem statement, the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs should be calculated. The correct approach would be to find pairs such that their sum ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For `n = 50`, the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs is 2 (for the pair (49, 50)). The program, however, calculates `(50 + 1) * 1 = 51`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Find the largest `k` such that `10^k <= n`.
2. For each `i` from `1` to `k`, calculate the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` ends with `99...9` (k nines).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        k += 1
        n //= 10
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        max_a = min(n, 10**i - 1)
        min_b = 10**i - (n - max_a)
        result += max(0, min_b - max_a + 1)
    
    print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.
