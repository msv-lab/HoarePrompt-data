Postcondition: ***`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm\). If \(k < n - 1\), the output is `k + 1 1`. Otherwise, `full_rows` is an integer such that \(0 \leq full_rows < m - 1\) and \(full_rows \geq 1\), `remaining_steps` is \(k \% (m - 1)\), `row` is \(n - full_rows\), and `col` is determined as follows: if `full_rows % 2 == 0`, then `col` is \(2 + (k \% (m - 1))\); otherwise, `col` is \(m - remaining_steps\).***
