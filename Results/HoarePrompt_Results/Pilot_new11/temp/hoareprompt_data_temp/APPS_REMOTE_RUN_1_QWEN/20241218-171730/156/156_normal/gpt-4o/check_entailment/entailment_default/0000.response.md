Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement Lara's path through the dungeon. According to the problem description, Lara's path involves moving down to the bottom-left corner and then moving in a snake-like fashion, always ending up in cell (1, 2) for valid \(n\) and \(m\). However, the code does not correctly simulate this path.

For example, consider the input \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 7\):

- The path should be: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2).
- According to the code, it calculates the row and column indices based on the number of steps \(k\), but it does not correctly simulate the snake-like movement.

Let's verify the code's behavior for \(k = 7\):
- \(k = 7\) means she has made 7 moves.
- The first \(n - 1 = 3\) moves are downward, bringing her to (4, 1).
- The next moves follow the snake pattern: (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2).

However, the code returns (3, 2) instead of (2, 2). This discrepancy indicates that the code is not correctly simulating the snake-like movement after reaching the bottom-left corner.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
