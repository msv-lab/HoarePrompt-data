The code `k %= n * 2 - 2` updates the value of `k` to be `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. Since `n` and `m` are even and positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), `n * 2 - 2` is an even number and is equal to \(2n - 2\).

Given the precondition that `0 \leq k < n \cdot m`, the new value of `k` will still satisfy this condition, but it will be adjusted to be within the range \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\) due to the modulo operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\)**
