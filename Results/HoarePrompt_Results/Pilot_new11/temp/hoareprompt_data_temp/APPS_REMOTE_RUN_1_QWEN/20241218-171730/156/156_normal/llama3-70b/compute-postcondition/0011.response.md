The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function presumably works with the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` which are described as follows:

- `n` and `m` are even and positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\).

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the provided snippet, we can infer the function might return something based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but works with variables `n`, `m`, and `k` where `n` and `m` are even and positive integers within the range \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and `k` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\).**
