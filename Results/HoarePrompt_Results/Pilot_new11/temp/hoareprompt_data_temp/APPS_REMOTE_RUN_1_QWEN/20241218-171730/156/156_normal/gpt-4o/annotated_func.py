#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even and odd positive integers respectively, such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.

    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)

        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm - (n - 1)\) and \(k \geq n - 1\), `full_rows` is an integer such that \(0 \leq full_rows < m - 1\) and \(full_rows \geq 1\), `remaining_steps` is \(k \% (m - 1)\), `row` is \(n - full\_rows\), and `col` is determined as follows: if `full_rows % 2 == 0`, then `col` is \(2 + (k \% (m - 1))\); otherwise, `col` is \(m - remaining_steps\).
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm\). If \(k < n - 1\), the output is `k + 1 1`. Otherwise, `full_rows` is an integer such that \(0 \leq full_rows < m - 1\) and \(full_rows \geq 1\), `remaining_steps` is \(k \% (m - 1)\), `row` is \(n - full_rows\), and `col` is determined as follows: if `full_rows % 2 == 0`, then `col` is \(2 + (k \% (m - 1))\); otherwise, `col` is \(m - remaining_steps\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (an odd positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)). It returns a pair of integers representing the row and column indices. Specifically, if \(k < n - 1\), it prints `k + 1 1`. Otherwise, it calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on the value of `k` and computes the row and column indices. If `full_rows` is even, the column index is \(2 + (k \% (m - 1))\); if `full_rows` is odd, the column index is \(m - (k \% (m - 1))\). The row index is determined as \(n - full_rows\). The function covers all possible values of `k` within its defined range, including edge cases where `k` is very close to \(n \cdot m\).
