The code calculates `remaining_steps` which is the remainder when `k` is divided by `m - 1`. The value of `k` is given in terms of `n`, `m`, and `full_rows`. We need to express `remaining_steps` in terms of the known variables.

Given:
- `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`
- `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`

Since `k` is defined as `full_rows * (m - 1) + remaining_steps`, and `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`, the `remaining_steps` is simply the remainder of `k` when divided by `m - 1`.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm - (n - 1)\) and \(k \geq n - 1\); `full_rows` is \(k // (m - 1)\); `remaining_steps` is \(k \% (m - 1)\).**
