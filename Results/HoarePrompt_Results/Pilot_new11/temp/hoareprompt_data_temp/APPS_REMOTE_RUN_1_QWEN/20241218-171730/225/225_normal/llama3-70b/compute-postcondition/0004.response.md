The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `last_vowel`. The previous value of `last_vowel` was undefined (or could have been any value), but now it is explicitly set to `-1`. The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `max_jump`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is 0; `last_vowel` is -1.**
