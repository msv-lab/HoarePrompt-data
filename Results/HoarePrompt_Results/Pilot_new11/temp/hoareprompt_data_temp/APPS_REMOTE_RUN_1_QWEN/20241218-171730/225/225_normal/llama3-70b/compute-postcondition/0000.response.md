`s` is assigned the value of the input string. Since the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and its length does not exceed 100, and it can only contain the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', the variable `s` now holds this input string.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100.**
