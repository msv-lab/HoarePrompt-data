The code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `prev_pos` are affected by this operation.

- `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`.
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.

Therefore, after executing the code:

- `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `i - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is updated to `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`; `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`; `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.**
