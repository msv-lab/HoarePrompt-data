The code initializes a string `vowels` with the value `'AEIOUY'`. This assignment does not affect the value of `s`, which is the input string. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `vowels` with the specific value `'AEIOUY'`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'**
