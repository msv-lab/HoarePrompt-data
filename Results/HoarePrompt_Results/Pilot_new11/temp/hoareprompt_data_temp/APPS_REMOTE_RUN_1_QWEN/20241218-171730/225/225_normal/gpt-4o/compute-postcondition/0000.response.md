The code initializes a set `vowels` containing the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. The string `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels; `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
