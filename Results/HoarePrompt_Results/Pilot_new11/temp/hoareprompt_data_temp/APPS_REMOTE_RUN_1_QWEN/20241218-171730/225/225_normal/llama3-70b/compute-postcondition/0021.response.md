The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is the index of a vowel in the string `s`, and `last_vowel` is updated to `i + 1`. The value of `max_jump` is updated based on the current value of `max_jump` and `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel and `i` is the new `last_vowel`; `last_vowel` is equal to `i + 1`; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`.**
