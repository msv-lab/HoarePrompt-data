Let's break down the given scenario step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `max_jump` is 0.
   - `last_vowel` is -1.

2. **For Loop**: 
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

4. **Variables in the Loop**:
   - Inside the loop, we will be accessing elements of `s` using index `i`.
   - We will be checking if the character at index `i` is a vowel (i.e., if it exists in `vowels`).
   - We will be updating `max_jump` based on certain conditions.
   - We will be updating `last_vowel` to the current index `i` if the current character is a vowel.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]` for the loop to execute properly.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**`total` is 0, `s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1**. 

However, since `total` was not part of the initial state and does not affect the loop's execution, we can omit it from the final answer. Thus, the adjusted states are:

**State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1**.
