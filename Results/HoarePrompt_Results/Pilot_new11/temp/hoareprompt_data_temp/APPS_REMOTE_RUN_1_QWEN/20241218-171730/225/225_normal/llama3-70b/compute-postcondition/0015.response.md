The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel, and `max_jump` remains unchanged. Since the exact value of `max_jump` is not specified in the initial state, we denote it as `max_jump`.

The impact of the code on the program is that `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, `i`, `last_vowel`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel and `i` is `i + 1`; `last_vowel` remains unchanged; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`.**
