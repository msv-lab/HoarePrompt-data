Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the maximum jump required. Specifically, the program calculates the jump length as `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which does not correctly handle the requirement to jump to the next vowel. Instead, the correct approach is to calculate the maximum distance between consecutive vowels, including the initial position before the first vowel and the position after the last vowel.

For example, consider the input string `ABABBBACFEYUKOTT`. The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `3` because the maximum jump required is from the first 'A' to the second 'A', and then from the second 'A' to the 'Y'. Here is a breakdown of the jumps:

- From position 0 (before first 'A') to position 3 (first 'A'): 3 steps
- From position 3 (first 'A') to position 12 (second 'A'): 9 steps
- From position 12 (second 'A') to position 15 (after last 'T'): 3 steps

The maximum of these jumps is 9, but since we only need to calculate the jumps between consecutive vowels, the correct jumps are 3 and 3, making the maximum jump required 3.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.
