The code sets `prev_pos` to the current value of `i`. This does not change the value of `max_jump`, but updates `prev_pos` to be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `i` is the index of a vowel in `s`; `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`; `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.**
