Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. The function calculates the maximum jump length possible by considering the distances between consecutive vowels in the string. A "jump" is defined as moving from one vowel to another vowel, where the distance is halved and then incremented by 1. If the string ends with a consonant ('Y'), the remaining distance from the last vowel to the end of the string is also considered as a jump. The function returns the maximum jump length found. If no vowels are present in the string, the function returns 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the string consists solely of vowels, the function will correctly calculate the maximum jump length based on the distances between them.
- If the string ends with a consonant ('Y'), the function will correctly include this distance in the calculation of the maximum jump.
- If no vowels are present in the string, the function will return 0, as indicated by the initial condition where `max_jump` is set to 0 when no vowels are found.
