The code initializes `max_jump` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `vowels`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is 0.**
