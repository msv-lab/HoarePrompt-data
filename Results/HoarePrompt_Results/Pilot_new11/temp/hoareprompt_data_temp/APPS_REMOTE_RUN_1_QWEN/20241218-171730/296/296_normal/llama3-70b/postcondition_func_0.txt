The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from the user. It then checks if `n` is equal to 2. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n`, and finally sets `n` to 2. The function does not return anything but modifies the value of `n` to 2 if `n` was not 2 initially.
