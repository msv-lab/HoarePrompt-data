The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The function returns either 'NO' in Case_1 and Case_2, or 'YES' followed by the length of the 'divisors' list (denoted as `k`), and then each tuple in the 'fractions' list formatted as '1 d' where 'd' is a divisor of 'n' from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), along with its corresponding quotient.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 'NO' in certain cases, or 'YES' along with specific formatted strings if certain conditions related to divisors and quotients are met.
