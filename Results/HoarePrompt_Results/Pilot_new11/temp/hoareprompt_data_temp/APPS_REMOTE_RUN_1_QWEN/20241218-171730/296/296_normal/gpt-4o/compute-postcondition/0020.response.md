Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients. If `i` is not equal to `n // (i_end + 2)`, the list `divisors` remains unchanged.***
