The code initializes a list of tuples named `fractions` where each tuple contains `(1, d)` for every `d` in the list `divisors`. The list `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates. Since the code does not modify `n`, `k`, or `divisors` themselves, only the creation of the `fractions` list impacts the state.

The `fractions` list will contain tuples where the first element is always `1` and the second element is each divisor `d` from `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates; `k` is the length of the `divisors` list; `fractions` is a list of tuples \([(1, d) \text{ for } d \text{ in } divisors]\).**
