The code initializes an empty list called `divisors`. This does not affect the value of `n`, so the only change is that `divisors` is now an empty list. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list**
