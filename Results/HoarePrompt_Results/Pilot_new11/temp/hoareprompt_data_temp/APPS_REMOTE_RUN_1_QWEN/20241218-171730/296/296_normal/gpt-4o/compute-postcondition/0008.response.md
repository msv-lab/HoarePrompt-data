The code appends `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Here, `i` is a divisor of `n` and ranges from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The condition `n // i` is not equal to `i` ensures that each divisor and its corresponding quotient (if different) are added only once.

Let's denote the divisors of `n` as \(d_1, d_2, ..., d_k\) where \(d_i < \sqrt{n}\) and \(n // d_i > \sqrt{n}\). Since `i` is a divisor of `n` and `i != n // i`, each pair \((i, n // i)\) will be included in `divisors`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\).
- `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, excluding the case where `n // i == i`.

After executing `divisors.append(n // i)`, the updated list `divisors` will include all divisors from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and their corresponding quotients (if they are different).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and their corresponding quotients (if they are different), ensuring no duplicate entries.**
