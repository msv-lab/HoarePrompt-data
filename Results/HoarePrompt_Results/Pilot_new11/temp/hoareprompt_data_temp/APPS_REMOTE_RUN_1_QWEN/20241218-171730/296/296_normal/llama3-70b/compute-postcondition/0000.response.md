The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user. However, since no specific input value is given in the prompt, we keep the range constraint.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range [2, 10^9]**
