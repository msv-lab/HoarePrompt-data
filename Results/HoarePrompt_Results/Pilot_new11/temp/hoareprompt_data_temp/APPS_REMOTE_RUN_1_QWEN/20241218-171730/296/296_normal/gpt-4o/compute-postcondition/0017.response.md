The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `i_end + 1`, and the loop continues as long as `i_end + 1 <= \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1`. Since `i` is updated in the loop and its new value is appended to `divisors`, the new value of `i` after this operation will be `i_end + 2`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\), `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, and `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
