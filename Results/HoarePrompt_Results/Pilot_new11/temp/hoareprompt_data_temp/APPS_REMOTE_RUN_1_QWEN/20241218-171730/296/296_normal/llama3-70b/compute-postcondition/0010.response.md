The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the positive integer `n` within the range 2 to \(10^9\).

However, since no specific behavior or output conditions are provided in the problem statement other than the range of `n`, we can only describe the range of the potential input.
