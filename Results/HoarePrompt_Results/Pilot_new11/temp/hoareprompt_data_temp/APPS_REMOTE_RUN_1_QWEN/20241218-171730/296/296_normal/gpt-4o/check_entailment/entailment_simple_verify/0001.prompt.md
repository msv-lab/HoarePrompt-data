You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the sum of the fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

For \(n = 4\), the program would generate fractions with denominators 2 and 2 (since 2 is the only divisor of 4 other than 4 itself):

- Fractions generated: \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\)

However, \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\), which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\).

Therefore, the program does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\), making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is greater than 2
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates. The list `divisors` is not empty
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string starting with 'YES', followed by the length of the 'divisors' list (denoted as k), and then each tuple in the 'fractions' list formatted as '1 d' where 'd' is a divisor of 'n' from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), along with its corresponding quotient


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
