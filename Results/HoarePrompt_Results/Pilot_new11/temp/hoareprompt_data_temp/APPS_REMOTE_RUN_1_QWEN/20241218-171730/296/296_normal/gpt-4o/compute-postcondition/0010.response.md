Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\). `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates. If `n % i == 0` for any `i` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\), then the corresponding quotient is also added to `divisors`. Otherwise, no new elements are added to `divisors`.***
