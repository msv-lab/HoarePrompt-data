Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\). `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates. After the if-else block executes, `divisors` will contain exactly these elements.***
