You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4
3

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output
1

Input
1
2
3
4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence from the given strings. Specifically, the condition `if cnt3 > cnt1:` is insufficient to ensure that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. This condition only checks if there are more `")("` sequences than `"()"` sequences, but it does not account for the balance of opening and closing parentheses.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
3
4
```

In this case, `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 2`, `cnt3 = 3`, and `cnt4 = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to arrange these strings to form a regular bracket sequence. However, the program incorrectly prints `0` because `cnt3 > cnt1`.

A correct solution would involve checking the overall balance of parentheses. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    
    # Calculate the total number of '(' and ')'
    open_count = cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 // 2
    close_count = cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 // 2
    
    # Check if the total number of '(' equals the total number of ')'
    if open_count != close_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Check if there are enough "()" to pair with remaining parentheses
        if cnt3 > cnt1:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)

func()
```

This corrected program first calculates the total number of opening and closing parentheses and checks if they are equal. It also ensures that the number of `")("` sequences does not exceed the number of `"()"` sequences.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers from the user, each representing the counts of the string patterns "(((、“", “()”, and “)("” respectively. It then compares the count of ")((“ (`cnt3`) with the count of "(((、“ (`cnt1`). If the count of ")((“ is greater than the count of "(((、“, it prints 0 to the console. Otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output based on the comparison result. There are no additional actions performed beyond printing 0 or 1 to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
