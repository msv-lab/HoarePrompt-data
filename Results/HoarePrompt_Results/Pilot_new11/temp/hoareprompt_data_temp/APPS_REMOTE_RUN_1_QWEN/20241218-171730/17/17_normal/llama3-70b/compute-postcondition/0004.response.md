The code simply prints `1` to the console, but this does not affect the values of the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. The only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer, and `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`; 1 is printed to the console**
