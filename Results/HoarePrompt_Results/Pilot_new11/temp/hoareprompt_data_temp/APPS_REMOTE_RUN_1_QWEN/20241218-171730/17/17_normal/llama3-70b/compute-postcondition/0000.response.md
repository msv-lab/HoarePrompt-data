The code reads four integers from input, each representing the count of different types of strings, and assigns them to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. These assignments replace the previous values of these variables. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer**
