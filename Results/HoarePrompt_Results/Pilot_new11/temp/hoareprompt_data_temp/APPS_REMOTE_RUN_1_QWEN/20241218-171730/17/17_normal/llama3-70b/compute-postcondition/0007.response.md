Functionality: **The function reads four integers from the user, each representing the counts of the string patterns "(((、“", “()”, and “)("” respectively. It then compares the count of ")((“ (`cnt3`) with the count of "(((、“ (`cnt1`). If the count of ")((“ is greater than the count of "(((、“, it prints 0 to the console. Otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output based on the comparison result. There are no additional actions performed beyond printing 0 or 1 to the console.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the input to ensure that the values provided are within the specified range (`0 ≤ cnt_i ≤ 10^9`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may behave unexpectedly.
- The function does not handle the case where the input is not properly formatted or if the input cannot be converted to integers. This could lead to a runtime error if non-integer values are entered.
- The function does not modify any variables other than those used for comparison, nor does it produce any output other than the printed result.
