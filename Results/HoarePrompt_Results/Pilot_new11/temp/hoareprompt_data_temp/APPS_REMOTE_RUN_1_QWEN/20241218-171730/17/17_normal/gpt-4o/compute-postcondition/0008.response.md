Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is an integer input from the user, `cnt4` is an integer input from the user. If the condition `(cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)` is true, no changes are made to `cnt2`, `cnt3`, or `cnt4`. Otherwise, either `cnt1 + cnt2` is not equal to `cnt3 + cnt4` or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`.***
