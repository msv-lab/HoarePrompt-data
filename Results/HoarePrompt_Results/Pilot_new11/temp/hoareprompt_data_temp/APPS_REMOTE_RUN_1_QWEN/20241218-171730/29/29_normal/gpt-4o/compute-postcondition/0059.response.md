`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is 3, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is 4, `n` must be at least 2, and `files_set` must contain "3".

Output State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is 4, `n` must be at least 2, and `files_set` must contain "3".**
