Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

### Given State
- `regulars` has at least one element.
- `i` is `(initial i) + 1`.
- `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`.

### While Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
- `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
- `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`

### Analysis
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure the conditions in the `while` loop are met.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - We don't know the initial value of `temp_counter`, but for the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
   - Similarly, we need to ensure that the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`.

Since we are asked to adjust the program state so that the loop can proceed, we need to ensure both conditions are satisfied. 

### Adjusted State
- `temp_counter` should be initialized such that it satisfies both conditions.
- Since `temp_counter` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, we assume it starts from some value that allows the loop to execute. 

Given that the loop is likely intended to start with `temp_counter` being `initial i + 1` and `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, let's assume `temp_counter` starts from a value that fits these conditions.

#### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. Ensure `temp_counter` is set to a value that satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
2. Ensure `temp_counter` is set to a value whose string representation is in `files_set`.

For simplicity, let's assume the initial value of `temp_counter` is set to `initial i + 1` (as per the given state).

### Final Answer
State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is (initial i) + 1, `target` is len(examples) + (initial i) + 2, `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 1` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`**
