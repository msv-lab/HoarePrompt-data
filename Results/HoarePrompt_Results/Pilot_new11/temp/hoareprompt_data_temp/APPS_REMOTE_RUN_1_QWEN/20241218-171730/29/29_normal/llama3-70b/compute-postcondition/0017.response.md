The code appends a formatted string to the `script` list. The string includes a tuple from the `files` list and an integer `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, the string appended will be `move {file} 1`, where `{file}` is a tuple from the `files` list.

The impact on the variables is as follows:
- `script` is updated with the new string.
- `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value.
- The `files`, `examples`, `regular`, and `i` variables retain their initial values and order, as no operations were performed on them within this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1 and must have at least one element, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is a list containing one element 'move {file} 1', `i` is 1**.
