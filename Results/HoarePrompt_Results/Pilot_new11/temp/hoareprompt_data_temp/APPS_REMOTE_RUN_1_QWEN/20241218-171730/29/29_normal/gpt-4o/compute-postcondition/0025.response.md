`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `temp_counter` was previously set such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. After incrementing, the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, and `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`**
