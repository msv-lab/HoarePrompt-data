The code appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is formatted using the `file` (which is a placeholder) and the value of `i`, which is 2. Since `file` is a placeholder and not defined in the current scope, it remains undefined. However, the structure of the script is updated.

The previous value of `script` was `['move {file} 1']`. After appending, it becomes `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`.

The values of other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, `regular`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1 and must have at least one element, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is a list containing two elements `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`, `i` is 2**
