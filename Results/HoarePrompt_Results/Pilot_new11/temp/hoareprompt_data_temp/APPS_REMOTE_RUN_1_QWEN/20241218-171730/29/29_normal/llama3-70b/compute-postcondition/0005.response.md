Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `name` is a string.
   - `type_` is a string.
   - `files` is a list containing tuples, including the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable used because the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1 since the loop runs `n` times.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be `n - 1`.
   - The `files` list remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The `name` and `type_` strings are not affected by the loop and remain the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` must now be \(n - 1\).
   - `name` and `type_` remain the same.
   - `files` remains the same list of tuples.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n - 1 \leq 10^5\), `name` is a string, `type_` is a string; `files` is a list containing tuples, including the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
