The code `target = len(examples) + i + 1` updates the value of `target`. Initially, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`. After executing the code, the value of `target` is updated to `len(examples) + i + 1`, but the value of `i` is also incremented by 1 in the initial state, so the new value of `i` is `(initial i) + 1`.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is (initial i) + 1, `target` is len(examples) + (initial i) + 2**
