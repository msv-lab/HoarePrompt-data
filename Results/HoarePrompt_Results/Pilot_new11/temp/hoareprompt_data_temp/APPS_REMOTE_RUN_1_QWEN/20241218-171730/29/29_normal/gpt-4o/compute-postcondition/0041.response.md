Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2"
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter` + 1
   - `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions under which the loop will continue.

- **Condition Analysis**:
  - The loop will continue if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
  - Since `temp_counter` is already incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `temp_counter` must still satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `temp_counter` remains within the range such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", this does not directly affect the loop continuation but ensures some condition about `examples` list which might be important contextually but is not strictly required for the loop logic.

Given the current state, no specific adjustment to the states is necessary as long as the loop condition holds true. However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to keep the condition valid.

**State**: **`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
