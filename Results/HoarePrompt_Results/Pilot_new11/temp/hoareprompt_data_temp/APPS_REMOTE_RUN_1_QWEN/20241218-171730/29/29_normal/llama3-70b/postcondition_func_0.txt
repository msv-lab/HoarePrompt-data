The function processes a series of filenames and their types (example or regular tests) and generates a script of moves for sorting these files into a specific order. First, it sorts the files by their type in descending order, prioritizing examples over regular tests. Then, it generates a move script to reorder the files according to their type and index. Finally, it prints the number of moves and the move commands. The function assumes that there is at least one file of each type and that the input adheres to the specified constraints. If no files of a certain type are present, the function will still execute as expected.
