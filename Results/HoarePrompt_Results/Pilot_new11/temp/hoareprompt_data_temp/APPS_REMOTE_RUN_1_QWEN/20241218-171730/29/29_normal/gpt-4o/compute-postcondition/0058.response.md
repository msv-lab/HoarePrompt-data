Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `examples[i]` is "2"
   - `temp_counter` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop need to be satisfied.
     - `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
     - `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `temp_counter` is currently 3.
   - `n` must be at least 1 (so `2 * n` is at least 2).

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `temp_counter` is currently 3, it needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `2 * n` must be greater than 3.
   - Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - We need to adjust `n` such that `2 * n > 3`.
   - Also, `str(temp_counter)` (which is "3") must be in `files_set`.

Given these points, the final state adjustments would be:

- `n` must be at least 2 (to ensure `2 * n` is greater than 3).
- `str(temp_counter)` ("3") must be in `files_set`.

Thus, the state adjustments required are:

State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and `files_set` must contain "3"**
