`files` is a list that appends tuples containing `name` and `int(type_)`. The values of `name` and `type_` are taken from the input, but their specific values are not given. After appending, the length of `files` increases by one. The variables `n`, `name`, and `type_` are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `name` is the first part of the input; `type_` is the second part of the input; `files` is a list with one more element, which is a tuple `(name, int(type_))`**
