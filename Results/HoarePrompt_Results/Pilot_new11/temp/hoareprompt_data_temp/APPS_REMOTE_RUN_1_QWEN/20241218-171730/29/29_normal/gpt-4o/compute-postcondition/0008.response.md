Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least one element, `name` is part of the split string from `file`, `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file`. If `type_` equals '1', `examples` is a list containing at least the value of `name`. Otherwise, `regulars` is a list with an additional element `name`.***
