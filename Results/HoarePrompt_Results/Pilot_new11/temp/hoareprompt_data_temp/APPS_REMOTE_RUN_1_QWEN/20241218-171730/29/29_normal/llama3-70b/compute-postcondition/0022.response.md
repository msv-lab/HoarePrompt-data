Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`, `i` is `len(examples)`**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- **`files`**: The list `files` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- **`examples`**: The list `examples` contains the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1. After the loop completes, `examples` will have all such elements.
- **`regular`**: The list `regular` contains the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0. This list remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- **`script`**: The `script` list contains a move command for each file in `examples`. Specifically, for each file `file` in `examples`, the move command `f'move {file} {i}'` is appended to `script`, where `i` is the index of the file in `examples` (starting from 1).
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is the length of the list `examples` after the loop completes, as the loop runs exactly `len(examples)` times.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `examples` is an empty list), then:
- **`script`**: Will be an empty list, `[]`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is as described above.
