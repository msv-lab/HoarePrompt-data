`examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. The value of `name` is the first part of `file`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and `files` must have at least two elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `files` has at least two elements, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`, `examples` is a list with its last element being `name`**
