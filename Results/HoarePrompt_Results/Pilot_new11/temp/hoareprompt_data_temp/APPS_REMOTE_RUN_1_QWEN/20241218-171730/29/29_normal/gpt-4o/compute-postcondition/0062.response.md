The code `examples[i] = str(temp_counter)` updates the value of `examples[i]` to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. Given that `temp_counter` is calculated as `2 * n + 2` and `n` is at least 1, the value of `temp_counter` is at least 4. Therefore, `examples[i]` is updated to the string `"4"`.

The other variables (`i`, `temp_counter`, `n`, and `moves`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "4", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'` and `'move 2 {2 * n + 2}'`.**
