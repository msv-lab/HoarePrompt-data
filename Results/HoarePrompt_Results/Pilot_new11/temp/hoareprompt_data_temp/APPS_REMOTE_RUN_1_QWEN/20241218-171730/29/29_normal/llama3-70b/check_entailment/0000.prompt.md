You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
