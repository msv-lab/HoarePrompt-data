`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 1`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is (initial i) + 1, `target` is len(examples) + (initial i) + 2, `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 2` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`**
