Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `files`, where each element in `files` is a string representing a file with the format "name_i type_i". It returns a list of move commands required to place each file in its correct position. Specifically, files with type "1" (example tests) are placed in positions 1 through `n`, and files with type "0" (regular tests) are placed in positions `n+1` through `2*n`. The function ensures that each file's name matches its position index after reordering, using temporary move commands to achieve this. If a file's name does not match its intended position, the function uses the smallest available index to temporarily place the file and then moves it to its correct position. Potential edge cases include when a file's name is already in the correct position, or when no such position exists, requiring the use of a temporary index. The function handles these cases by ensuring every file ends up in its correct position with the minimum number of move commands.**
