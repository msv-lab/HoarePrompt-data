`examples.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the list `examples`. The value of `type_` remains unchanged and is still '1'. The value of `n` and `files` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `files` must have at least one element; `name` is part of the split string from `file`; `type_` is '1'; `examples` is now a list containing at least the value of `name`.**
