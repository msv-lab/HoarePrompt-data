To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
1. **examples**: A list of strings where `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all valid indices.
2. **temp_counter**: Equal to `2 * n + 1` (or the highest index used during the loop).
3. **files_set**: Contains the names of all files that are present in the `files` list.
4. **moves**: A list of strings indicating all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(len(regulars)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each index `i` from `0` to `len(regulars) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `regulars` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `regulars` is not empty. This means there should be at least one element in `regulars`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `regulars` has at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`regulars` must have at least one element**
