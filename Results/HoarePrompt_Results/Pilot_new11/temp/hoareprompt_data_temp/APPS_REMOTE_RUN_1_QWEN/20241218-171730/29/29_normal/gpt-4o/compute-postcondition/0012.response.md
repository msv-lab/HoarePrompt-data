`regulars` is appended with the value of `name`. The value of `name` is the first part of `file`. The conditions for `n` and `files` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `files` must have at least two elements; `name` is the first part of `file`; `type_` is the second part of `file`; `regulars` is updated to include `name`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `files` must have at least two elements; `name` is the first part of `file`; `type_` is the second part of `file`; `regulars` is updated to include `name`**
