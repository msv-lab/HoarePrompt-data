Postcondition: ***`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, and `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` contains the string 'move regulars[(initial i) + 1] temp_counter'. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above.***
