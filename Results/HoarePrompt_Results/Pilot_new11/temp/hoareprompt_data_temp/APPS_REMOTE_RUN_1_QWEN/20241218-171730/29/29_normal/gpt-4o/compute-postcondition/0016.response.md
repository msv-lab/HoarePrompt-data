`examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. Since `name` is the first part of the next file and `type_` is the second part, and if `type_ == '1'`, then `examples`'s last element would be set to `name`. However, since `type_` is not checked in this line of code, `name` is simply appended to `examples`.

The states of other variables (`n`, `files`, `name`, and `type_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `files` has at least one element, `name` is the first part of the next file, `type_` is the second part of the next file, `examples` includes the value of `name`**
