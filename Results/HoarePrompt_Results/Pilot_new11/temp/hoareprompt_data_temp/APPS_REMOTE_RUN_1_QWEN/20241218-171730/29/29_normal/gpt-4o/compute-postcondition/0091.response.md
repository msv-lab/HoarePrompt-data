`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`; `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.
