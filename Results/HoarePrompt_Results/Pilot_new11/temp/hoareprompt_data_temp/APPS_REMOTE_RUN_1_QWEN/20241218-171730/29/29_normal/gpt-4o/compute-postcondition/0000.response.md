The code initializes an empty list named `examples`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the `files` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, and `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file and has the format "name_i type_i", with `name_i` being a filename and `type_i` being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively; `examples` is an empty list**
