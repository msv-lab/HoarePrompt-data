`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is 1, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is 2, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 2, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body**
