Postcondition: **`regulars` has at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, `regulars[i]` is `"2 * n + 1"`, and `moves` now contains a new element `'move regulars[i] temp_counter'`**
