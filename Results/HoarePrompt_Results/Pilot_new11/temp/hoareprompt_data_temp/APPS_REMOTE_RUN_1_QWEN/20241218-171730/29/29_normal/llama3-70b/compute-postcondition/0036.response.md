The code `print(line)` simply prints the value of the variable `line`. Since the variable `line` has already been printed in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The variable `script` must have at least one more line, which also remains unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`line` has been printed, `script` must have at least one more line**
