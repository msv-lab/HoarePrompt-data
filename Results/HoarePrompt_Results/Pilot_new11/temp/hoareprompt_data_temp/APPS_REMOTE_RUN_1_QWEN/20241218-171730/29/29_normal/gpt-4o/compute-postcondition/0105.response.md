`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` must be adjusted to a value less than or equal to \(2 \times n\). Since `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\) and `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), these values remain unchanged. The precondition that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` also remains valid. Therefore, the updated state is that `temp_counter` is now one more than its previous value and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\), `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 1\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
