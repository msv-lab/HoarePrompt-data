Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when `n` is 1, which is explicitly disallowed by the problem description (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the ticket should not be considered lucky, and the function should return 'NO' immediately without entering the loop. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition, leading to incorrect behavior for tickets of length 1. 

To fix this, the function `func_1` should add a check at the beginning to return 'NO' if `n` is 1. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    if n == 1:
        return 'NO'
    
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    return 'NO'
```

With this addition, the function now correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, making the program follow the problem description for every potential case.
