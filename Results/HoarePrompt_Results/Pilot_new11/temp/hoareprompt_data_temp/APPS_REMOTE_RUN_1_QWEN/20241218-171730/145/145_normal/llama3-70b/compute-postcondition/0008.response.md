`curr_sum` is incremented by the current digit of `ticket`. Since the exact digit being added is not specified, let's denote the current digit as `digit`. The value of `digit` can be any digit from '0' to '9'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` is 0 plus the current digit, `segments` is 0**
