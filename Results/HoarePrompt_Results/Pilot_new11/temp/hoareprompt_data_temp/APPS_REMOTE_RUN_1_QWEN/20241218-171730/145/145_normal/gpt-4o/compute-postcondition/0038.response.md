Postcondition: ***`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 3, and `n` is the length of the ticket list. This holds true if and only if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`. Otherwise, the values remain as initially described in the precondition.***
