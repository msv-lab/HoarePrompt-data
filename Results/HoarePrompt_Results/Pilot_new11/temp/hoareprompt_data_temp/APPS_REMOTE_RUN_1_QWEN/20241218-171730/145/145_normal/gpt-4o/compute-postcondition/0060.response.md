The code `current_sum = 0` sets the variable `current_sum` to 0, while the other variables (`target_sum`, `segment_length`, `segment_count`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n - 1` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1` and is still less than `n`, and `n` is the length of the `ticket` list.**
