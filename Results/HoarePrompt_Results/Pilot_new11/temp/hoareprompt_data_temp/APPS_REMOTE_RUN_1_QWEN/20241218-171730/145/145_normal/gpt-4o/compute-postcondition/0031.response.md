The code `current_sum = 0` sets the variable `current_sum` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `current_sum`, which was equal to `target_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of the ticket list, and `current_sum` is equal to 0.**
