The code initializes `curr_sum` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ticket`, `total_sum`, or `target_sum`. Therefore, the only change is that `curr_sum` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), representing the golden ticket; `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`; `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, and the total sum of the digits in `ticket` is even; `curr_sum` is 0**
