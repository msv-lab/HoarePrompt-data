Postcondition: ***`current_sum` is the original value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`, `segment_count` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segment_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `current_sum` remains as the original value plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`.***
