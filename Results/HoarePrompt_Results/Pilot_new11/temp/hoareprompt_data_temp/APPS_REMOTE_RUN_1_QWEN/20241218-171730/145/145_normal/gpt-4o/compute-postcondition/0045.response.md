Postcondition: ***`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list. `segment_length` is `n`. `current_sum` is 0 because the loop did not execute (i.e., the `ticket` list is empty) or 0 if the last segment did not match `target_sum`. `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of elements equals `target_sum`. `i` is `n` (the length of the `ticket` list). `n` is the length of the `ticket` list. The current value of `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1.***
