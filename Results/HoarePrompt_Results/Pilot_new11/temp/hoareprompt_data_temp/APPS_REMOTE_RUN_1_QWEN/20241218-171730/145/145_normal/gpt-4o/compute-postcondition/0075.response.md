Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive). It attempts to partition the digits of `ticket` into segments of varying lengths such that the sum of the digits in each segment is equal to a predetermined target sum. The target sum is calculated based on the first segment of the specified length.

The function iterates through all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculating the target sum for each length. For each segment length, it calculates the current sum of the digits in the current segment and checks if it matches the target sum. If it does, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count. After processing all segments, if the current sum is zero and the segment count is greater than 1, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is 2, the function will only check the first segment of length 1, which is always valid since the target sum will be the same as the single digit in the segment.
- If `n` is 1, the function should not execute because the precondition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 is not met, but the function should handle this edge case by returning 'NO' immediately without entering the loop.
- The function assumes that the `segment_sum` function is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the sum of the digits in the specified segment.

After the function concludes, the program state is that it either returns 'YES' if there exists at least one valid way to partition the `ticket` string into segments with equal sums, or 'NO' otherwise.
