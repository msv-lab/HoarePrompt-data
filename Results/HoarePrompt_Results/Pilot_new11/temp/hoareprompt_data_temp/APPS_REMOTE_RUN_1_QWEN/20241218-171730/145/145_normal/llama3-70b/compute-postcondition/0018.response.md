Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`.
   - `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
   - `segments` is either increased by 1 if `curr_sum == target_sum`, or remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - In each iteration, the current digit is processed, and `curr_sum` (the sum of digits processed so far) is updated.
   - If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segments` is increased by 1.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`, the length of `ticket` remains the same.
   - `total_sum` remains unchanged because it is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, which does not change during the loop execution.
   - `target_sum` also remains unchanged as it is derived from `total_sum` at the beginning of the loop and does not depend on the loop iterations.
   - `segments` will be increased by 1 if the current `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's determine the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `ticket` remains a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits.
- `total_sum` remains the same.
- `target_sum` remains the same.
- `segments` may have increased by 1 if `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum` in the last iteration, or it remains unchanged.

Since we do not know the exact value of `curr_sum` from the previous iteration, we can only state that `segments` might have increased by 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.**
