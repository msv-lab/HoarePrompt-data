Postcondition: ***`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n - 1` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is `i_prev + 1` and is still less than `n`, and `n` is the length of the `ticket` list. This occurs if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`; otherwise, the original values of `current_sum`, `segment_count`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
