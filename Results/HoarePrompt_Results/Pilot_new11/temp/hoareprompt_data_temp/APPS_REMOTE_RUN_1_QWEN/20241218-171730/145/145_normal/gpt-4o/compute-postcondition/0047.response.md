Postcondition: **`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of elements equals `target_sum`, `i` is `n` (the length of the `ticket` list), `n` is the length of the `ticket` list, and either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is not greater than 1**
