The code sets `current_sum` to 0. Initially, `current_sum` is the original value plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`. After executing the code, `current_sum` will be 0, and the value of `ticket[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `ticket` and other variables remain unchanged**
