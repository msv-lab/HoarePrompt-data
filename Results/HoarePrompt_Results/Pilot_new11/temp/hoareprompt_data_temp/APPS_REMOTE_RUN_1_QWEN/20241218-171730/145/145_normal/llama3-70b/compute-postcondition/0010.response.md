`segments` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `segments` was 0, so after executing `segments += 1`, the value of `segments` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` equals target_sum, `segments` is 1**
