Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of divisors of a given number `num`, which is not related to the problem description. The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`. However, the program simply counts the number of divisors of `n` using a divisor counting algorithm.

For example, if the input is `7`, the program will output `4` because it finds that `7` has four divisors (`1, 7`). However, the correct answer should be `4` based on the given example, but the logic inside the program is incorrect for calculating the number of different weights of splits.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weights of these splits, counting the unique weights. The current implementation does not achieve this.
