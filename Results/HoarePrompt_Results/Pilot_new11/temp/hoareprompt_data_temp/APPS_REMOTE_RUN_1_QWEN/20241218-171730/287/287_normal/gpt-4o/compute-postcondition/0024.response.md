The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9. The function returns the count of distinct divisors of `num`, including 1 and `num` itself.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `num` within the specified range and return the count of its distinct divisors.
