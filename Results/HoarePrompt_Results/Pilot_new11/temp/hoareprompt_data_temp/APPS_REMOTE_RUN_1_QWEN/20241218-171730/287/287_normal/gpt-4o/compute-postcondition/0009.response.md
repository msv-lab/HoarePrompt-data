The value of `i` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of `num` and `count` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not affect them.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4; `count` is 2; `i` is 3.**
