Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of different weights of splits of \( n \) by iterating through numbers up to \( \sqrt{n} \) and checking if they are divisors of \( n \). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for all possible weights of splits.

For example, consider \( n = 9 \):

- The possible splits and their weights are:
  - [9] (weight 1)
  - [4, 4, 1] (weight 1)
  - [3, 3, 3] (weight 3)
  - [2, 2, 2, 3] (weight 1)
  - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (weight 9)

The program will only count the weights 1, 3, and 9, but it will miss the weight 2 from the split [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1].

To correctly solve this problem, we need to recognize that the maximum possible weight is \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \), and the minimum weight is 1. Therefore, the number of different weights is \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \).

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = n // 2
    print(res)
```

This program correctly calculates the number of different weights of splits for any given \( n \).
