Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is not meeting the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is counting the number of divisors of the input `num`, rather than finding the number of different weights of its splits. The logic within the function does not align with the task of generating splits and calculating their weights. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
