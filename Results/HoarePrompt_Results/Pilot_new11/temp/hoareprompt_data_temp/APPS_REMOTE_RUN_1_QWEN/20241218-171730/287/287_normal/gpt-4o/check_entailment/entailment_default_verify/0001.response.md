Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program calculates the number of distinct divisors of a given number `n`, which is not equivalent to finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. According to the problem description, the number of different weights of splits of `n` is simply `n` itself, as every integer from 1 to `n` can be a weight of some split of `n`. The output hints clarify that the function `func_1` is intended to count divisors, which does not align with the required solution. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
