Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the total number of divisors of an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)), with each divisor counted as 2, and subtracts the count of perfect square divisors (counted as -1). The function reads an integer `n` from the user, iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checks if they are divisors of `n`, and updates the result accordingly. If a perfect square divisor is found, it adjusts the result by subtracting 1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is a perfect square, one of its divisors (the square root) will be counted twice, so it is adjusted by -1 in the end.
- If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number and has only one divisor (itself), which is counted as 2 but then adjusted by -1, resulting in 1.
- If `n` is a prime number, it will have exactly two divisors (1 and itself), both counted as 2, resulting in a final result of 3.
