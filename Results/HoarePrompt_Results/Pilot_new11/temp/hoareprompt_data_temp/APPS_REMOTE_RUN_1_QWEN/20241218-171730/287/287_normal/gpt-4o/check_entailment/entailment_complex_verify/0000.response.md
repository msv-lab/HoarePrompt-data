Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the function `func_1` is attempting to count the number of distinct divisors of `num`, rather than finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The problem description requires generating all possible splits of `n` and then calculating the weights of these splits, counting the unique weights. However, the current implementation only counts the number of divisors of `n`, which does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
