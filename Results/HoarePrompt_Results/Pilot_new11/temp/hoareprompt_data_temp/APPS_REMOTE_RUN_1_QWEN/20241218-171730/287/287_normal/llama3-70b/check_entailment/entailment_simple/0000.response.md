Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same as finding the number of different weights of the splits of `n`.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The problem requires determining the number of different weights of all possible nonincreasing sequences (splits) of positive integers that sum up to `n`.
- The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
- For example, for `n = 7`, the valid splits and their weights are:
  - `[7]` with weight 1
  - `[3, 3, 1]` with weight 2
  - `[2, 2, 2, 1]` with weight 3
  - `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weight 7
- Therefore, the output for `n = 7` should be `4` because there are 4 distinct weights (1, 2, 3, 7).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to calculate the number of divisors of `n` by iterating from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5)` and counting pairs of divisors.
- It subtracts 1 for each perfect square divisor.
- This approach does not account for the number of different weights of the splits of `n`.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, one can observe that the number of different weights of splits of `n` is essentially `n`. This is because for any `n`, the weights of its splits range from `1` to `n`. Each integer from `1` to `n` can be a valid weight of some split of `n`.

Thus, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n)
```

This code directly prints `n`, which is the correct number of different weights of the splits of `n`.
