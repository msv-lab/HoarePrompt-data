Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4; `count` is 2; `i` is 2. If `num` is divisible by `i`, then `count` remains 2 and `i` remains 2. Since there is no else part, the values of `count` and `i` do not change regardless of whether the condition is true or false.***
