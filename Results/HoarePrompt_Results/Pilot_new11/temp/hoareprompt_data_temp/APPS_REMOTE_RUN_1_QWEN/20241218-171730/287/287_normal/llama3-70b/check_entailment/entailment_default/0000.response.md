Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The goal is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number \( n \). However, the current implementation calculates the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not related to the weights of the splits.

To clarify, the number of different weights of splits of \( n \) is essentially the number of distinct values that can be the first element of a non-increasing sequence whose elements sum up to \( n \). The possible weights range from 1 to \( n \), inclusive. Therefore, the number of different weights is simply \( n \).

The provided program does not account for this logic. It instead counts the number of divisors of \( n \) and makes adjustments for perfect squares, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements. Hence, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
