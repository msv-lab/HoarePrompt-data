Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the number of distinct divisors of a given number `num`, but the problem description requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The function `func_1` does not address the specific requirements of the problem. 

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of different weights of splits for a given `n`. The weights are essentially the possible counts of the first element in a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`. 

For any `n`, the possible weights range from 1 to `n` inclusive. This is because:
- A split can consist of a single element `n` (weight `n`).
- It can also consist of multiple elements all equal to 1 (weight 1).

Thus, the number of different weights is simply `n`.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
n = int(input())
print(n)
```

This code will correctly output the number of different weights for any given `n` based on the problem description.
