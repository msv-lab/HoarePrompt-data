Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to count the number of distinct divisors of a given number `num`, which is not what the problem description asks for. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. 

For example, for `n = 7`, the possible splits and their weights are:
- `[7]` with weight 1
- `[3, 3, 1]` with weight 2
- `[2, 2, 2, 1]` with weight 3
- `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weight 7

The code, however, simply counts the number of divisors of `n`, which is incorrect. It should generate all possible splits of `n` and then count the unique weights. The given implementation does not handle this logic at all.

To illustrate, let's consider the input `n = 7`. The correct output should be `4` because there are four different weights: 1, 2, 3, and 7. However, the provided code will incorrectly output the number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (1 and 7).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
