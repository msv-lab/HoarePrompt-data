Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to calculate the number of divisors of an integer `n`, but this approach does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`, not the number of divisors.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to understand that for any `n`, the possible weights of its splits range from 1 to `n`. This is because the smallest possible weight is 1 (when `n` itself is a split), and the largest possible weight is `n` (when the split consists of `n` ones).

For example:
- For `n = 7`, the weights are 1, 2, 3, 7.
- For `n = 8`, the weights are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.
- For `n = 9`, the weights are 1, 2, 3, 9.

The code does not account for this logic. Instead, it calculates the number of divisors of `n` and adjusts for perfect squares, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the solution for every potential case.
