`i` is incremented by 1. The original value of `i` is 3, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 4. The conditions for `count` remain unchanged since the value of `i` does not affect the condition `i == num // i`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the original conditions for `count`.

Output State: **`num` must be at least 16, `count` is either 4 or retains its original value (which is 2), and `i` is 4.**
