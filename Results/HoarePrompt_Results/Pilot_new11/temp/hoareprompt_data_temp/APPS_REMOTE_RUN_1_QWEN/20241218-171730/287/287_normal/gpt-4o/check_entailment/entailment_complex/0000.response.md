Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the provided program calculates the number of distinct divisors of \( n \).

To understand why the program is incorrect, let's break down the requirements and the actual implementation:

### Problem Requirements:
- Find the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).
- A split of \( n \) is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is \( n \).
- The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

### Example:
For \( n = 7 \):
- Possible splits and their weights:
  - \([7]\): weight = 1
  - \([3, 3, 1]\): weight = 2
  - \([2, 2, 2, 1]\): weight = 3
  - \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\): weight = 7
- Therefore, the weights are {1, 2, 3, 7}, and the number of different weights is 4.

### Program Implementation:
The program calculates the number of distinct divisors of \( n \). Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the logic:
```python
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count
```
- It iterates from 1 to the square root of \( num \).
- For each divisor \( i \), it counts \( i \) and \( num // i \) (if they are not equal).

### Why It Fails:
- The program does not generate all possible splits of \( n \).
- It does not calculate the weights of these splits.
- Instead, it simply counts the divisors of \( n \), which is not related to the weights of the splits.

### Conclusion:
Since the program calculates the number of divisors instead of the number of different weights of splits, it fails to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is **Incorrect**.
