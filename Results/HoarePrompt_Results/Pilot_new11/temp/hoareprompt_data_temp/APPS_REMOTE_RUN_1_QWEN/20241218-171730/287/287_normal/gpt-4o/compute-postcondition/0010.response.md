Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * i <= num`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4.
   - `count` is 2.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values**:
   - With `i` = 3, the condition `i * i <= num` becomes \(3 * 3 \leq num\) or \(9 \leq num\).
   - Since `num` is at least 4, it can satisfy \(9 \leq num\).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment.
   - After incrementing `i` by 1 (assuming `i` is incremented within the loop), `i` will be 4.
   - The new condition will be \(4 * 4 \leq num\) or \(16 \leq num\).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration (`i` = 4).
   - Therefore, `num` must be at least 16.

Given this analysis, the required states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`num` must be at least 16, `count` is 2, `i` is 3**.
