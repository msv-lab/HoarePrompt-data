The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. Since no assignment or calculation is performed in this line, the value of `res` remains unchanged from its previous state. The other variables (`n`) also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `res` is the total number of divisors of `n` (each counted as 2) minus the count of perfect square divisors (each counted as -1).**
