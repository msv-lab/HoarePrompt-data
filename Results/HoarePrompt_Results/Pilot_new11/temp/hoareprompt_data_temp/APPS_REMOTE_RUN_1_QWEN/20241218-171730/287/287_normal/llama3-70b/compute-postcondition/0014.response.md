Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `res` is 2 if it was initially 3, or `res` is 3 if it was initially 4.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `i` is `i_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be `i_prev + 2`.
   - This means `i_prev + 1 < int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which simplifies to `i_prev < int(n ** 0.5)`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from `i_prev + 1` to `i_prev + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The value of `res` does not change based on the loop condition itself; it stays as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- `n` is still within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9.
- `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
- `res` is either 2 (if initially 3) or 3 (if initially 4).

The final answer is:
**State: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `i` is i_prev + 2, `res` is 2 if res was initially 3 or `res` is 3 if res was initially 4.**
