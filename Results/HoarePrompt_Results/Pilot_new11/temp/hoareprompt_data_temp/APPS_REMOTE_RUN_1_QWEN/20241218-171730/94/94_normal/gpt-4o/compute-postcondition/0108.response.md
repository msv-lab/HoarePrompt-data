The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins all elements in the list `new_state` into a single string using the empty string `''` as a separator. This does not change the values of any variables except for `new_state_str`, which now contains the string representation of `new_state`.

Output State: **`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.**
