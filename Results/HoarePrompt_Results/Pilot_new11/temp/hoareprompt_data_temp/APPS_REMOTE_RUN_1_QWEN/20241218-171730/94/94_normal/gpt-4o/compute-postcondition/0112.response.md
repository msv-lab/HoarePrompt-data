Postcondition: ***`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` is true, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped, and `queue` includes the new state.***
