The code assigns the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col` to `new_pos`. Since `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, we can substitute these values into the equation.

Therefore, the new value of `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions` remain unchanged; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
