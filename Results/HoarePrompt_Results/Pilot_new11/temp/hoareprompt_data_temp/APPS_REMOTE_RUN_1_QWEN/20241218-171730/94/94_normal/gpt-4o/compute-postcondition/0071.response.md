The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins all elements in the list `new_state` into a single string using the `join` method. The value of `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped. Since `new_state` is updated to this new list, `new_state_str` will now be a string representation of this updated list.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` (which is `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped), `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `visited` remains consistent.**
