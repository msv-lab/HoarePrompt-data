The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` calculates the new position of the empty space by adding the values of `dr` (delta row) and `dc` (delta column) to the current positions of the empty space (`empty_row` and `empty_col`). The variables `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected, as do `current`, `new_state_str`, `new_state`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions`.

Since the exact values of `dr`, `dc`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are not specified, we will represent the new values of `new_row` and `new_col` as the sum of their respective components.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions` remain unchanged.**
