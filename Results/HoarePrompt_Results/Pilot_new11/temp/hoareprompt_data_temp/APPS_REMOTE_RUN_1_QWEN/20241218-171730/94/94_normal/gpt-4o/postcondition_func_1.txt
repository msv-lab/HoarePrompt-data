The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. It returns a set containing all unique puzzle states reachable from the starting state through valid moves.

The function accomplishes this by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It initializes a queue with the starting state and a set to keep track of visited states to ensure no state is processed more than once. It then iterates through each state in the queue, determining the position of the empty cell ('X') and generating new states by moving the empty cell in all possible directions (up, down, left, right). If a new state has not been visited before, it adds the new state to the visited set and appends it to the queue for further exploration.

Potential edge cases:
- If the initial state `start` is already a goal state (a solved puzzle), the function will still explore all possible moves but will only add the initial state to the visited set.
- If the initial state is not solvable (i.e., it leads to a dead end), the function will eventually terminate without adding any new states to the visited set after exploring all possible moves.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not explicitly check whether a generated state is a duplicate of a previously visited state in terms of its configuration. While the `visited` set ensures uniqueness, there might be cases where two different sequences of moves lead to the same state, which is not accounted for in the current implementation.

After the function concludes, the final state of the program is as follows:
- The function returns a set `visited` containing all unique puzzle states reachable from the starting state through valid moves. This set includes the starting state and all reachable states, ensuring no duplicates are present.
