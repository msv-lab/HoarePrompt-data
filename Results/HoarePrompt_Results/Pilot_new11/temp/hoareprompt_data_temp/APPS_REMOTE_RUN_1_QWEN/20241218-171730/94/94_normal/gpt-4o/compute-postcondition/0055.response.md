Postcondition: ***`queue` is a non-empty list. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `new_row` is either 0 or 1 and `new_col` is either 0 or 1, then `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`. `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. Otherwise, the list `queue` remains unchanged.***
