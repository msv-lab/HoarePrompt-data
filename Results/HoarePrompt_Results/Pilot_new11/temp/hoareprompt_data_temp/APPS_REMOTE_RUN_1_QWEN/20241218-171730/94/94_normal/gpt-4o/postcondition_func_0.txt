The function `func_1` accepts a string `puzzle` representing a 2x2 grid with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents an empty cell. It returns the first two characters of the string `puzzle`. This means it returns the top row of the 2x2 grid. The function handles the case where the string contains exactly one 'X', and ensures that exactly one occurrence of 'A', 'B', and 'C' is present. If the input string does not meet these conditions, the function's behavior is undefined.
