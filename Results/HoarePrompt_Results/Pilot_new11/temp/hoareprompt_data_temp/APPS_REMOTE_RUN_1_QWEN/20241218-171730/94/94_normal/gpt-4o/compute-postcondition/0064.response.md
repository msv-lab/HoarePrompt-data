Postcondition: ***`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is now a string created by concatenating the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`; otherwise, the state of the queue and other variables remains unchanged.***
