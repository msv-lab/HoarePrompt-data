The code adds `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This means that the string representation of the new state is now included in the set `visited`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is now included in the set `visited`; `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
