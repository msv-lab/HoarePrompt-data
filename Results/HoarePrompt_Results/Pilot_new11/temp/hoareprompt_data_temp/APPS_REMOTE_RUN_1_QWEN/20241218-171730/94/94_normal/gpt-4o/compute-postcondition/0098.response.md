The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of `new_state` into a string. Since `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, this operation does not change the state of `new_state` itself, but it creates a new string `new_state_str` from the elements of `new_state`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
