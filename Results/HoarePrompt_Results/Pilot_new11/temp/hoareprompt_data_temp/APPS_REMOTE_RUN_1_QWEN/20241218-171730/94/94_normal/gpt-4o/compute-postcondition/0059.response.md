The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the list `current`. The initial state of `queue`, `new_state_str`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions` remains unchanged. The `new_state` variable now holds a copy of the `current` list.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_state` is a copy of the list `current`**
