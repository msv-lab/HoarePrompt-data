The code swaps the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Values:**
   - `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.
   - `empty_pos` is the position of the empty space (determined previously).
   - `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.

2. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The line `new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]` performs the swap.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are swapped.
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

4. **Output State:**
   - `new_state` now has the swapped elements.
   - `new_state_str` is still a string created by joining elements of `new_state`.
   - `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected.
   - `current` remains unchanged.
   - `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged.
   - `new_state` is updated to reflect the swap.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining elements of `new_state`; `queue` contains the new state if it is not already in `visited`; `visited` contains the new state if it is not already in `visited`; `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed; `empty_row` is determined based on the new position; `empty_col` is determined based on the new position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
