According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing `start`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must contain at least one element. Since `queue` initially contains `start`, it already meets this condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.**
