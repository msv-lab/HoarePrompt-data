The code swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's go through this step by step:

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at the position `empty_pos` in the `new_state` list.
2. `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at the position `new_pos` in the `new_state` list.
3. The line `new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]` swaps these two values.

Since the exact values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are not specified, let's denote them as follows:
- `empty_pos` is a specific index in the `new_state` list.
- `new_pos` is another specific index in the `new_state` list.

After the swap, the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` will be swapped. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` remains consistent, `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `visited` remains consistent.**
