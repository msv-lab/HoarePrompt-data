Postcondition: ***`new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited`.***
