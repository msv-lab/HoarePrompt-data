The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This means that `new_state_str` is now included in the set `visited`. No other changes occur to the variables. Therefore, the output state includes the update to the `visited` set.

Output State: **`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` includes the new state (i.e., `visited.add(new_state_str)` has been executed); `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.**
