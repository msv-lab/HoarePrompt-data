The code initializes a queue using the `deque` function with the `start` string as its initial element. The `start` string is a precondition and remains unchanged. The `queue` is a new variable that holds the initial element `start`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing `start`.**
