The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the existing list `current`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a copy of `current`**
