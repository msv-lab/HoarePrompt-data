The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue`. This impacts the `queue` and assigns its leftmost element to `current`.

- The `queue` loses its leftmost element, which is now assigned to `current`.
- The value of `current` becomes the leftmost element of the original `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a list of unique states reachable from `start` with the leftmost element removed, `visited` is a set containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the leftmost element of the original `queue`, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, and `queue` must not be empty anymore since an element was popped.**
