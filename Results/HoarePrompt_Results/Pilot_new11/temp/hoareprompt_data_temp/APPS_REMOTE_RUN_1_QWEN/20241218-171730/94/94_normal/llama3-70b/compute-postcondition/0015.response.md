The code `x2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x2`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, and there's no explicit assignment or calculation for `i` within the given code snippet. The initial state defines `x2` as 4, and this value will only change if `i` is explicitly set to a different value.

Since the value of `i` is not provided and the code does not specify what `i` should be, the value of `x2` remains unchanged from its initial state unless `i` is explicitly set to a new value in a context not shown here. Given the initial state, `x2` remains 4.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is 4.**
