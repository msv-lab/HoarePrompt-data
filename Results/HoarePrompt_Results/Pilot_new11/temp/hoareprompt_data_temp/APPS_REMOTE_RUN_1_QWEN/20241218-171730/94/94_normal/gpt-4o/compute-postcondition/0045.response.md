The code assigns `new_row` the value of `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` the value of `empty_col + dc`. However, the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will include these new variables with their respective expressions.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, directions is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
