The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` searches for the index of the character 'X' in the list `current`. The value of `current` is the first element of the queue before it is modified by `popleft()`, and `queue` is the original queue minus its first element. However, the code does not modify any variable values directly; it only assigns the index of 'X' in `current` to the variable `empty_pos`.

Given this, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state except for the new variable `empty_pos` which is assigned the index of 'X' in `current`.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue (before popleft), `queue` is the original queue minus its first element, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`**
