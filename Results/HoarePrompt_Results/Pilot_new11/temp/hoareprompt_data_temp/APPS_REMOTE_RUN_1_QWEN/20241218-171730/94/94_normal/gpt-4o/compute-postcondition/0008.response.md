The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Since the initial values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` depend on `empty_pos`, which is not directly provided in the updated code, we will use the relationships given:

- `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, and 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3.
- `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, and 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3.

However, since `dr` and `dc` are not specified, we will represent `new_row` and `new_col` in terms of these values:

- If `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, `new_row` = 0 + dr and `new_col` = 0 + dc.
- If `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `new_row` = 1 + dr and `new_col` = 1 + dc.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col` in terms of `dr` and `dc`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` does not contain `start`, `visited` contains `start`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
