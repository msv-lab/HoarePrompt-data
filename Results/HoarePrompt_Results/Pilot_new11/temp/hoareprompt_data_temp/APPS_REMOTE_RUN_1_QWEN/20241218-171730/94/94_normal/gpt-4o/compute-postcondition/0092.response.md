Postcondition: ***`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` holds true, then `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the `new_state` list, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `new_state_str`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
