Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `queue` is a non-empty list containing elements.
   - `new_state_str` is a string created by concatenating the elements of `new_state`.
   - `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1.
   - `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `directions` remains unchanged as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
   - `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.
   - If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`. Otherwise, the state of the queue and other variables remains unchanged.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the loop condition changes based on the provided information.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute if there are still elements in the `queue` that need to be processed.

5. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `queue` must contain at least one element. Since `queue` is a non-empty list initially, it means there is at least one element left to process.

6. **Identify Variables to Update**:
   - `new_state_str`: Will be updated based on the new state created by swapping elements in `new_state`.
   - `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`: These values will change based on the direction being considered.
   - `directions`: Remains unchanged.
   - `new_state`: A new state is created by swapping elements in `current` based on `new_pos`.
   - `visited`: `new_state_str` is checked against `visited` and added if not already present.
   - `queue`: Updated if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.

Since the loop will continue as long as `queue` is not empty, and given that `queue` is non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to be explicitly stated is the continuation of the queue's non-emptiness.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the `queue` is non-empty, and all other variables are consistent with the conditions provided.

**State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, and the other variables (`new_state_str`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `directions`, `new_state`, `visited`) remain consistent with the conditions provided.**
