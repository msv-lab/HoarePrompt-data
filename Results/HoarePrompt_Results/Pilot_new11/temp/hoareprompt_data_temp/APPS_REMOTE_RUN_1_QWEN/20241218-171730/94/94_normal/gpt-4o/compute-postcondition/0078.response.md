The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the queue and assigns it to the variable `current`. Since `queue` must not be empty, it means there was at least one element in the queue before this operation. After executing the code, the queue will have one less element than before.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue (before popleft), `queue` is the original queue minus its first element**
