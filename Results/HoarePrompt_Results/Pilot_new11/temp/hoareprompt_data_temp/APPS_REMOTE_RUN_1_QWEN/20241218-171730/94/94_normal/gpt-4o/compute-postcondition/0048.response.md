The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list that is a copy of the `current` list. The `current` list's content is copied into `new_state`, but the original `current` list remains unchanged. Other variables (`queue`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a copy of `current`**
