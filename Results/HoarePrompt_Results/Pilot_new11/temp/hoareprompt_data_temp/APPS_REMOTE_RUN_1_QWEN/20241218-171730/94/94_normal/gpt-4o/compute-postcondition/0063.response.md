`queue` appends the value of `new_state_str` to its end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is now included in the set `visited`; `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.
