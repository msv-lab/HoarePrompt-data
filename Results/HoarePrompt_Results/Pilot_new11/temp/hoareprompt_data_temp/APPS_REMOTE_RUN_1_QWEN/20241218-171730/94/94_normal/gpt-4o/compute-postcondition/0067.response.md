The code assigns the new row and column values based on the current `empty_row` and `empty_col` plus the directional changes `dr` and `dc`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and the other variables (`new_state_str`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `directions`, `new_state`, `visited`) remain consistent with the conditions provided.**
