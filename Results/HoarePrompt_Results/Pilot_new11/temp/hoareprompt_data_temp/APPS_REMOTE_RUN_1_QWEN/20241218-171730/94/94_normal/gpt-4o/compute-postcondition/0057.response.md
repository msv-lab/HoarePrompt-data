The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` by adding `dr` to `empty_row` and `dc` to `empty_col`. Since `empty_row` and `empty_col` are assumed to be valid indices from the `queue` (which is a non-empty list), and `dr` and `dc` are either 0 or 1, the new values of `new_row` and `new_col` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, and `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1 after updating them as `new_row = empty_row + dr` and `new_col = empty_col + dc`; `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
