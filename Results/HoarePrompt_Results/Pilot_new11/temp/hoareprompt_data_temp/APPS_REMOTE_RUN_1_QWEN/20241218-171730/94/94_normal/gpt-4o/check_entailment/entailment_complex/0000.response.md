Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for the fact that the problem requires checking if two separate puzzles can reach the same configuration, not just if a single puzzle can reach a solved state. The function `func_2` only checks if a single puzzle can reach a solved state (where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are in their respective positions and 'X' is in the bottom-right corner). 

To properly solve the problem, the code needs to perform the BFS for both puzzles and check if the resulting sets of reachable configurations intersect. The current implementation only checks if a single puzzle can reach a solved state, which does not address the requirement of comparing the configurations of two puzzles.

For example, consider the following inputs:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

The first puzzle can be solved by moving 'A' down, but the second puzzle cannot be transformed into the first puzzle's solved state through any sequence of moves. Therefore, the program should output "NO", but the current code would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if each puzzle can reach a solved state independently.
