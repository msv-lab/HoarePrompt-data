Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are strings representing 2x2 grids of a sliding puzzle. It first identifies the index of the empty cell ('X') in both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Then, it swaps the contents of the cells at these indices between the two puzzles. Finally, it checks if sorting the characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` results in the same sequence. If they do, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers the case where both puzzles initially have the same configuration (including the empty cell), and it correctly handles the swap operation. However, it does not account for the scenario where the puzzles are identical but not initially swapped, in which case the function would still return `False` due to the sorting step.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are identical before the swap, the function will return `False` because the sorted versions of both puzzles will be the same, which does not satisfy the condition of being different after the swap.

**Summary of Final State:**
After the function concludes, the program will have checked whether the two puzzles, after swapping their empty cells, result in the same sorted sequence of characters. The function will return `True` only if the sorted sequences are identical, indicating that the puzzles are equivalent under the swap operation.
