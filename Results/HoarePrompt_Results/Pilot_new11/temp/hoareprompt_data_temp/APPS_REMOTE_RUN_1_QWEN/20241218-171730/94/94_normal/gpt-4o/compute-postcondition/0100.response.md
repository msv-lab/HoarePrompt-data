The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the string `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. This operation adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue` without changing the contents of `new_state_str` itself or any other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
