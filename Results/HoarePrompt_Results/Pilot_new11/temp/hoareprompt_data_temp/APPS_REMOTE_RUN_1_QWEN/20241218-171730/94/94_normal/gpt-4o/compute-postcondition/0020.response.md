The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Specifically, `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`, and `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`queue` contains the new state if it is not already in `visited`, `visited` contains the new state if it is not already in `visited`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is determined based on the new position, `empty_col` is determined based on the new position, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining elements of `new_state`.**
