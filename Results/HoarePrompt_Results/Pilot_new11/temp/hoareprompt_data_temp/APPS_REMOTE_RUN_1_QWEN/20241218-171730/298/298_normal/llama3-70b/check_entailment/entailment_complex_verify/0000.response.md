Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than what is required. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the extended Euclidean algorithm, but they are not used to find the coordinates of the points forming the triangle. Instead, the program checks if the area condition can be satisfied by checking the divisibility of \(nm\) by \(k\).

The key issue is that the program does not generate the coordinates of the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) that satisfy the condition of forming a triangle with the specified area. The conditions in the if-else statements are not correctly aligned with the requirements of the problem. For instance, the condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` does not ensure that the generated points form a valid triangle with the desired area. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
