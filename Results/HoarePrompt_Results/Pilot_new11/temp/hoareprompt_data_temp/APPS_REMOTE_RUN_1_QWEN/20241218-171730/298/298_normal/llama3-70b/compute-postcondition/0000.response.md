The function `func_2(a, b)` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, we will express the output state in terms of the function's return values.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `x` is returned by `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is returned by `func_2(a, b)`**
