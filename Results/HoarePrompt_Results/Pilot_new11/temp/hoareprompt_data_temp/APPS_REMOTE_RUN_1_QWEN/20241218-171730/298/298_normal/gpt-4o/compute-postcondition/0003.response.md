The code prints 'NO', but it does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k` (the current value of `area` is not an integer), and the output is 'NO'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k` (the current value of `area` is not an integer), and the output is 'NO'**
