Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b` where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop has been executed, `a` will hold the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0. The function returns `a`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the loop will terminate immediately with `a` being the non-zero value, which is the GCD of the original values since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the program returns `a`, which is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_original` and `b_original`. However, no initial values (`a_original` and `b_original`) are provided in the code, so it's assumed that the input values are the ones passed to the function. Therefore, the function correctly returns the GCD of the input values without needing to store the original inputs separately.
