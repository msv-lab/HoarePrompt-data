The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. The area is `n * m / k`. The current value of `area` is 0. The string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
