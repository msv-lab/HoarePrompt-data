The code `print(f'0 1')` simply prints the string '0 1' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n / 2', the console prints '0 1'**
