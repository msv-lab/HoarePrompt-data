The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function returns `a`, which is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_original` and `b_original`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.**
