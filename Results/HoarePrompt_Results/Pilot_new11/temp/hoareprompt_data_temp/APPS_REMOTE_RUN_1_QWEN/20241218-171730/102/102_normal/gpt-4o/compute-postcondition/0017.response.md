`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Here, `x` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `x` at the start of the current iteration. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Since `x` is updated to `k + 1`, and `k` is the original value of `x`, the value of `x` is now one more than its original value. The value of `y` is calculated based on the updated value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is the original value of `x` + 1, and `y` is `(n - (original value of x + 1) * a) // b`.**
