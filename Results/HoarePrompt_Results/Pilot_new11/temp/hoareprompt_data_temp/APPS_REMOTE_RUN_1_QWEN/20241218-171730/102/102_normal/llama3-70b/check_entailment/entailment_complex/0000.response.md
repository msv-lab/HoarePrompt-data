Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where `a` is zero, which is a critical edge case. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **Edge Case Handling for `a` Being Zero**:
   - When `a` is zero, the problem becomes trivial. If `n` is also zero, the solution is `x = 0` and `y = 0`. Otherwise, no solution exists because `x * a` will always be zero.
   - The current implementation does not handle this case. If `a` is zero and `n` is not zero, the program will attempt to perform division by zero (`y = (n - x * a) // b`) and will not produce the correct output.

2. **Handling of Other Cases**:
   - For non-zero `a`, the program iterates through possible values of `x` and checks if there exists a corresponding `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. This part of the logic works correctly as per the problem description.
   - The program prints 'NO' if no such `x` and `y` are found, which aligns with the requirement.

To fix the issue, you should add a check for `a` being zero at the beginning of the function. Here’s a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Check for the edge case where a is zero
    if a == 0:
        if n == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(0, 0)
        else:
            print('NO')
        return
    
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    
    print('NO')
```

With this addition, the program correctly handles all cases, including when `a` is zero, ensuring it always meets the problem description.
