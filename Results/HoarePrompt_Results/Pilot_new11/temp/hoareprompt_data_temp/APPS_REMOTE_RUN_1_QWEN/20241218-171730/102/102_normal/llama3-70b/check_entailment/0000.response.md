Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to spend exactly `n` burles by buying some number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It iterates through possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and calculates the corresponding `y` (number of Bars bars) needed to reach `n`. If it finds a combination that satisfies `x * a + y * b = n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such combination is found, it prints "NO".

The program handles the constraints and examples provided appropriately and works for all potential cases within the given range. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
