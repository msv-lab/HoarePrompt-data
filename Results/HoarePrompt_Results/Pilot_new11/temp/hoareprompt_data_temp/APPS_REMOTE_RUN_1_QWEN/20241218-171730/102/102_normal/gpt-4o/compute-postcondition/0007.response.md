The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. According to the precondition, `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, and `y` is the integer result of `(n - x * a) // b`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not explicitly defined in the code provided. The values of `x` and `y` are derived from the initial conditions, but they are not changed by this code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is a non-negative integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, `y` is the integer result of `(n - x * a) // b, and the printed value is 'YES'**
