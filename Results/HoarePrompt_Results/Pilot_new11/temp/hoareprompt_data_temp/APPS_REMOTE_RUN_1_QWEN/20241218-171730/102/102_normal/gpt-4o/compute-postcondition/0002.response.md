`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `b` now holds the integer input from the user. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input**
