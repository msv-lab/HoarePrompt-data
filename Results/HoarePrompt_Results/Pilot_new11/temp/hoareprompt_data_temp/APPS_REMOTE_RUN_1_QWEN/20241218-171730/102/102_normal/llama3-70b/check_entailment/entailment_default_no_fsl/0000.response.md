Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when `a` is zero. Specifically, if `a` is zero, the code will attempt to perform a division by zero, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case when `b` is zero, making the problem unsolvable if `n % a` is not divisible by `b`.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
7
0
3
```

The expected output should be "NO" because it's impossible to spend exactly 7 burles if the cost of Ber-Cola is 0 burles. However, the current implementation will attempt to divide by zero, leading to an error.

A corrected version of the code should include checks for these edge cases:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Check if a is zero
    if a == 0:
        if n % b == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(n // b, 0)
            exit()
        else:
            print('NO')
            exit()

    # Check if b is zero
    if b == 0:
        if n % a == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(n // a, 0)
            exit()
        else:
            print('NO')
            exit()

    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
    print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the edge cases where `a` or `b` is zero, preventing division by zero errors and correctly identifying whether it is possible to spend exactly `n` burles.
