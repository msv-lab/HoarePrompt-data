Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `a` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error if `a` is zero and `n % a != 0`. Additionally, the program does not check if `n` is divisible by `a` when `b` is zero, which would make the problem unsolvable. To handle these edge cases, the program should include additional checks to ensure it does not attempt to divide by zero and correctly handles scenarios where `b` is zero. Here is an example of how to fix the issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    if a == 0:
        if n % b == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(n // b, 0)
        else:
            print('NO')
        return
    
    if b == 0:
        if n % a == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(n // a, 0)
        else:
            print('NO')
        return
    
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This revised version of the program includes checks for `a` and `b` being zero, ensuring it handles all edge cases correctly.
