The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated before the print statement, but the print statement itself does not change the values of `x` or `y`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and the values of `x` and `y` which are already determined before the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is a variable used in the calculation, and printed text is 'YES'; `x` and `y` are printed.**
