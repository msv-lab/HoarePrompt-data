The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values but simply prints 'YES'. Therefore, the values of the variables `y`, `n`, `a`, `x`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `x` and `b` are unspecified, and the current value of `n` satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b == n; print('YES') has been executed**
