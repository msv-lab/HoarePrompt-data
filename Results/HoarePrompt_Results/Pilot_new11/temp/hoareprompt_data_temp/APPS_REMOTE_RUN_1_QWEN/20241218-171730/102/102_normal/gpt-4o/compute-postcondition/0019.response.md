The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. Based on the initial state:

- `x` is the original value of `x + 1`
- `y` is \((n - (\text{original value of } x + 1) * a) // b\)

After executing the print statement, the values of `x` and `y` will be printed, but their values will not change. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the original value of `x + 1`, `y` is \((n - (\text{original value of } x + 1) * a) // b\), `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is an integer**
