The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. However, the initial values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed, but we know that these values will be printed. The variables `op[0]` and `op[1]` themselves do not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **The values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed.**
