The given code snippet does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state. It simply assigns the value 1 to four elements in matrix `B` located at positions `[i][j]`, `[i][j+1]`, `[i+1][j]`, and `[i+1][j+1]`. The initial conditions state that these same positions in matrix `A` had the values 1. This means that after executing the code, the values of these elements in `B` are set to 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `operations` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `m` is at least 2; `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `A` that satisfied the condition and was flipped in `B`; the value of `B[i][j]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
