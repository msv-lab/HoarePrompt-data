Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `m` is at least 2
   - `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`
   - `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `j` is within the range `[0, m)`
   - `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **State Changes:**
   - `j` starts at `0` and will be incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1`.

4. **Constraints for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` must still be within the range `[0, m)`.
   - Since `m` is at least 2, `j = 1` is within this range.
   - The condition `A[i][j] == B[i][j]` must hold true for the next value of `j`.

5. **Adjusted States for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `total` remains `0` since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains `0` since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains at least 2 since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `m` remains at least 2 since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `A` and `B` remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop.
   - `operations` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` changes to `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 1**
