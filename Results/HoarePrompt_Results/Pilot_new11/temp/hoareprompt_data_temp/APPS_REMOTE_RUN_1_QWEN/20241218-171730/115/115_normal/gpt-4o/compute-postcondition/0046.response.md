Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1 if the conditions are met during any iteration; otherwise, they remain unchanged. `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) where the conditions were met. `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged and are either 0 or 1 based on their initial state.**
