`ops` is appended with the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that there exists at least one valid index `j` such that the conditions `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1` are met. Therefore, `j + 1` is also valid.

The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, j + 1)` where `j` is a valid index satisfying the given conditions, and there exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`.**
