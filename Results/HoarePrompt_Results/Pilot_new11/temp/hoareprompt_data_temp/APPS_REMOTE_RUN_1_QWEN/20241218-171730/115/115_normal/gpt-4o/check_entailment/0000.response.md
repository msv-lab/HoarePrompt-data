Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the required operations can always transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \), but it does not check for certain conditions that would make this transformation impossible.

### Issue Identification:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Valid Operations:**
   - The program checks if the submatrix \( B_{i, j}, B_{i, j+1}, B_{i+1, j}, B_{i+1, j+1} \) needs to be set to 1 if all corresponding elements in matrix \( A \) are 1. However, this logic does not account for scenarios where setting such a submatrix might result in invalid transitions or where it's impossible to match \( A \) with \( B \) through the allowed operations.

2. **No Check for Impossibility:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if it's impossible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) using the allowed operations. For instance, consider the following input:
     ```
     3 3
     1 0 1
     1 0 1
     0 0 0
     ```
   - In this case, no sequence of operations can transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) because the bottom-right corner of \( A \) is 0, and the only way to set four elements to 1 is to have them already 1 initially or after some operations, which is not possible here.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output `-1` correctly, indicating it's impossible to make \( B \) equal to \( A \). However, for other inputs where making \( B \) equal to \( A \) is possible, the program does not generate the correct sequence of operations.

Given the lack of comprehensive checking for the possibility of transformation, the program cannot be considered fully correct for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
