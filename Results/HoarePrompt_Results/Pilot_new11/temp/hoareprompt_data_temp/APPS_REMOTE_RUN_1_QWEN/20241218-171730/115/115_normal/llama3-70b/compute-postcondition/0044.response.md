The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, and `j`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same information as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3 (i.e., `n >= 3`), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise, and the current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1**
