Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `operations` is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `B` that was flipped.
   - The condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` determines if the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to `operations`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.
   - In each iteration, the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to `operations`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m - 2`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `m - 2`.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `j` is now `m - 2`.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `operations` will either contain the same elements as before or include an additional tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the condition is met.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `B` that was flipped, and `j` is `m - 2`.**
