The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not include a loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list. The condition `A[0][j] == 1` and `A[0][j + 1] == 1` and `A[1][j] == 1` and `A[1][j + 1] == 1` holds true for some valid indices `j` within the bounds of the matrix.**
