The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. Here, `n` and `m` represent the dimensions of a 2D list `A`, which contains only 0s and 1s. The function iterates through `A` to find 2x2 submatrices where all four elements are 1. If such a submatrix is found, it flips the values in the corresponding positions in a new 2D list `B`, setting them to 1. After processing all possible 2x2 submatrices, the function compares `A` and `B`. If they differ, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function prints the number of operations performed and then prints the coordinates of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices that were flipped. The function always returns -1 in all cases as per the provided return postconditions.
