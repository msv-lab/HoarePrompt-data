According to the code, the loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-2`. This means that the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`
- The loop does not execute further if no valid index `j` satisfies the condition in any row `i` or `i + 1` and column `j` or `j + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- Since `i` is now 1, the loop can continue as long as `i < n-1`. Therefore, `n` must still be a non-negative integer with at least 3.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`**
