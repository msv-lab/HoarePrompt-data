`operations` is appended with the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\). Since `i` is `n - 2` and `j` is `j + 1`, the tuple added to `operations` will be \((n - 1, j + 1)\). The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `m` is at least 2; \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1; \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple \((n - 1, j + 1)\); `j` is `j + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `m` is at least 2; \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1; \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple \((n - 1, j + 1)\); `j` is `j + 1`.**
