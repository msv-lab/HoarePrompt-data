Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1; `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the condition is met. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
