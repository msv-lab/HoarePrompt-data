The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are `n - 1` and `m - 1` respectively. Therefore, the tuple appended to `operations` will be `((n - 1) + 1, (m - 1) + 1)`, which simplifies to `(n, m)`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is \( n - 1 \); `m` is at least 2; `j` is \( m - 1 \); `B[i][j]` is `1`; `B[i][j + 1]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is `1`; `operations` is a list containing the element `(n, m)`**
