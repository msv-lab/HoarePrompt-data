Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped. Each tuple in `operations` is of the form `(row, col)` where `row` and `col` are the row and column indices of the top-left corner of the flipped 2x2 submatrix in `A`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(m - 1)`, meaning it checks for 2x2 submatrices in `A` starting from the top-right corner and moving leftward.
- If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is met, the corresponding 2x2 submatrix in `B` is flipped (all elements are set to 1) and the index `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to `operations`.
- After all iterations, `i` will remain `n - 1` because the loop only changes `j`, and `j` starts at `m - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`, at which point the loop terminates.
- `m` remains at least 2 because the loop condition `range(m - 1)` ensures that `m - 1` is a non-negative integer.
- `operations` will contain all the indices of 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped during the loop iterations, based on the condition being met in `A`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the final state will reflect all the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped, as recorded in the `operations` list.
