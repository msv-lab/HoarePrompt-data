Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `B` that was flipped. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, then the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to `operations`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
