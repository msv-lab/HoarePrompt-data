Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
   - `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
   - `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, 4)\)
   - `j` is 3

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \(m-2\). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than \(m-1\).

3. **Current State of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - Since the condition \(j < m-1\) must hold true, `m` must be greater than 5 (since `j` is now 4 and the maximum value for `j` would be \(m-1 - 1 = m-2\)).

5. **Other States Remain Unchanged:**
   - `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(m > 5\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, 4)\), `j` is 4**
