Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that certain conditions involving `A` are met, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` initially, and if the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the program continues with the subsequent code. If not, no change is made to the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `ops` remains as initially specified.***
