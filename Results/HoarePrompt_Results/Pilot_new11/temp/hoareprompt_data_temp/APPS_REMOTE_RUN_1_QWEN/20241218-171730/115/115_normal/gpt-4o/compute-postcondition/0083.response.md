Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
- For each column `j`, the loop checks if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`. If this condition is met, the function returns -1 immediately.
- If the condition is not met for any `j` in the range `[0, m)`, the loop completes its iteration and the function does not return anything, meaning that `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, m)`.

Since the loop checks every element in column `j` from `0` to `m-1`, and if any mismatch is found, it returns -1, the final state of the variables is such that if the loop completes without returning -1, all elements in column `i` from `A` match the corresponding elements in `B`. Therefore, the final output state is that `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, m)`.
