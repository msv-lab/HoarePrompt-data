Functionality: **The function processes a binary matrix \(A\) of dimensions \(n \times m\), where \(2 \le n, m \le 50\), and identifies positions where there are adjacent '1's in either a vertical or horizontal direction. Specifically, it finds all cells \((i+1, j+1)\) where any of the cells \((i, j)\), \((i+1, j)\), \((i, j+1)\), or \((i+1, j+1)\) contain a '1'. It collects these positions into a list `ops` and prints the length of this list followed by the positions themselves. If the list `ops` contains more than 2500 elements, the function outputs `-1` instead. After processing, the function ends without returning any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no cells satisfy the condition for being added to `ops`, the list `ops` will be empty, and the function will output `0`.
- If the matrix is completely filled with '1's, the function may encounter up to \( (n-1) \times (m-1) \) cells that meet the condition. Since the maximum size of the matrix is \(50 \times 50\), the number of cells meeting the condition could be up to \(49 \times 49 = 2401\), which is within the limit of 2500. Thus, in this scenario, the function would output the count of such cells and their coordinates.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not modify the original matrix `A`. It only processes and prints information about the matrix.
