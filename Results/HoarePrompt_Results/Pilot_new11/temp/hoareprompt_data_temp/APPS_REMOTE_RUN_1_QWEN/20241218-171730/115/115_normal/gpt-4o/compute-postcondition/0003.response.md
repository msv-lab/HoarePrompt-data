Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts**: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for j in range(m - 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than 0 (since `range(x)` produces values from 0 to x-1).
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 1, but more importantly, since the loop runs `m - 1` times, `m` must be at least 2.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - The loop variable `j` is used within the loop body, but its initial value and increment are managed by the `range()` function itself.
   - We need to ensure that `m` meets the requirement for the loop to execute properly.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is at least 2 (not directly related to the loop condition, but included for completeness).
   - `i` is 0 (not directly related to the loop condition, but included for completeness).

### Required Adjustments:
- Since the loop requires `m - 1` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure `m` is at least 2.
- The initial value of `j` is not explicitly set, but it starts from 0 as per the default behavior of `range(m - 1)`.

### Final State:
- `n` is at least 2 (no change needed, as it already satisfies the requirement).
- `i` is 0 (no change needed, as it already satisfies the requirement).
- `m` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final state after considering the loop execution requirements is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2**
