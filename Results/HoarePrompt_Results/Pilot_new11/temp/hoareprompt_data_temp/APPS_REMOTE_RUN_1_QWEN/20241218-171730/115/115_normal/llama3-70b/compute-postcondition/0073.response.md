The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is based on the constraints that $n$ and $m$ are integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and $A$ is a matrix of integers where each element is either $0$ or $1$. However, since the function definition itself does not show any parameter list, we can only state the conditions under which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function operates on a matrix A of integers (either 0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, but does not accept any parameters and has no return value based on the given function signature.**
