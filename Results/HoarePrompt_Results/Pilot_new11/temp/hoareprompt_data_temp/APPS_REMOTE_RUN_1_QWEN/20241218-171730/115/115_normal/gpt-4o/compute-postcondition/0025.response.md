The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial values of `i` and `j`, we can determine the specific values to append.

From the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m - 2`

So, the tuple appended to `operations` is `(i + 1, j + 1) = ((n - 1) + 1, (m - 2) + 1) = (n, m - 1)`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m - 2`, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `operations` is a list containing the element `(n, m - 1)`**
