The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It then creates a matrix `A` of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1. The initial values of `n` and `m` are within the range 2 to 50, and `A` is populated with input values. After executing this code, the initial constraints on `n` and `m` still apply, and the matrix `A` is updated with the new input values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \le n, m \le 50\); A is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and the matrix `A` is populated with the input values.**
