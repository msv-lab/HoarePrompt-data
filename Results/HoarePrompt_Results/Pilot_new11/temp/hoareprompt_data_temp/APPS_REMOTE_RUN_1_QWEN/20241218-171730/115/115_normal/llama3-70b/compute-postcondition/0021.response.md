Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, and the loop does not execute further if no valid index `j` satisfies the condition in any row `i` or `i + 1` and column `j` or `j + 1`.**
