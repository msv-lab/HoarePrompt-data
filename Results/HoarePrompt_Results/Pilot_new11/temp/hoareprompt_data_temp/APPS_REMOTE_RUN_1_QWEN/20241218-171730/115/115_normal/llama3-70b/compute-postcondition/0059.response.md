Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-2`. For each `j`, it checks if any of the following conditions are met:
1. \(A[i][j] == 1\)
2. \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\)
3. \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\)
4. \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\)

If any of these conditions are met, the loop continues without appending a new tuple to `ops`. If none of these conditions are met, the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) is appended to `ops`.

### Initial Conditions
- `i` is fixed at 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3.
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\).
- `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is initially a list containing all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied.
- `j` is in the range \([0, m - 2]\).

### Final State After All Iterations
After the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `j` goes from 0 to `m-2`), the only variables that change are `ops`. `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `j` remain unchanged unless the loop modifies them, which it does not.

### Determining `ops`
Since the loop appends \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to `ops` if any of the specified conditions are met, the final `ops` will be a list of all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied during the entire iteration range of `j`.

### Final Output State
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3.
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\).
- `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied during the entire iteration range of `j`.
- `j` is in the range \([0, m - 2]\) and remains unchanged unless the loop modifies it, which it does not.

### Conclusion
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied during the entire iteration range of `j`, and `j` is in the range \([0, m - 2]\).**
