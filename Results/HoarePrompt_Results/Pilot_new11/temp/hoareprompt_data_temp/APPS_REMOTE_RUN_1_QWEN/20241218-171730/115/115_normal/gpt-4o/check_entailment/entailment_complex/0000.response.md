Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Reading and Matrix Initialization**: 
   - The program reads the input and initializes matrix `A` correctly from the input data. It handles the reading and parsing of the input as expected.

2. **Operations Execution**:
   - The program checks for 2x2 submatrices in `A` where all elements are 1. For each such submatrix, it flips the corresponding positions in matrix `B` to 1. This matches the requirement of setting specific 2x2 submatrices to all 1s.

3. **Validation**:
   - After the operations, the program validates whether matrix `B` is equal to matrix `A`. If they are not equal, it returns `-1`. This ensures that the program adheres to the condition of making `B` equal to `A`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the validation passes, the program prints the number of operations and the coordinates of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices that were flipped. This aligns with the output format specified in the problem statement.

The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description. The function `func_1` processes the input as required, performs the necessary operations, and outputs the result in the correct format. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement under the given assumptions about valid input. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
