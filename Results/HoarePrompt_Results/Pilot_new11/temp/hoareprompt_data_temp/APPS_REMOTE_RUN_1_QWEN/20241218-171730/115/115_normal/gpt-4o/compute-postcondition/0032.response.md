Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-2` because `range(n - 1)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, it needs to be incremented to `n - 2` for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` should be set to `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as `n` itself is a constant in the loop condition.
   - `m` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `m` in the loop condition.
   - `operations` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this list.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `n - 2`.
- `n` must still be at least 2.
- `m` must still be at least 2.
- `operations` remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped.**
