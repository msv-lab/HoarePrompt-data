According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is `n`.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n - 1` for the next iteration.

However, we need to consider the constraints and potential changes to the other variables:
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `operations` remains a list of tuples representing 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 from its current value of `n`, making it `n - 1`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `A` that satisfied the condition and was flipped in `B`.**
