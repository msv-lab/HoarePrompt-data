Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - \( i \) is 2
  - \( n \) is a non-negative integer with at least 3
  - \( m \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le m \le 50 \)
  - \( A \) is a matrix of size \( n \times m \) where each element is either 0 or 1
  - \( ops \) contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \( A[i][j] == 1 \), \( A[i + 1][j] == 1 \), \( A[i][j + 1] == 1 \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 \) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, j + 1)\) if any of these conditions hold.
  - \( j \) is in the range \([0, m - 2]\) and remains unchanged otherwise.
  - No other changes occur if none of the specified conditions are met.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable \( j \) ranges from 0 to \( m - 2 \).
- Each iteration of the loop increments \( j \) by 1.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \( j \) is currently 2 (since it was incremented from its initial value of 0).

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) needs to be 3.
- Since the loop increments \( j \) by 1 each time, the only thing that needs to change is \( j \).

### Other Variables:
- \( i \) remains unchanged and still is 2.
- \( n \) remains unchanged and still is a non-negative integer with at least 3.
- \( m \) remains unchanged and still is an integer such that \( 2 \le m \le 50 \).
- \( A \) remains unchanged and still is a matrix of size \( n \times m \) with elements either 0 or 1.
- \( ops \) remains unchanged and still contains the specified tuples based on the conditions described.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, j + 1)\) if any of these conditions hold, `j` is 3**.
