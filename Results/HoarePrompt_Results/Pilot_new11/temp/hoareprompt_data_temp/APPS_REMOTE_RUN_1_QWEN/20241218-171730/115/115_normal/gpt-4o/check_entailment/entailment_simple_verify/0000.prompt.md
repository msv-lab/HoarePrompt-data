You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input

1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

-1

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the required operations can always transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \), but it does not check for certain conditions that would make this transformation impossible.

### Issue Identification:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Valid Operations:**
   - The program checks if the submatrix \( B_{i, j}, B_{i, j+1}, B_{i+1, j}, B_{i+1, j+1} \) needs to be set to 1 if all corresponding elements in matrix \( A \) are 1. However, this logic does not account for scenarios where setting such a submatrix might result in invalid transitions or where it's impossible to match \( A \) with \( B \) through the allowed operations.

2. **No Check for Impossibility:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if it's impossible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) using the allowed operations. For instance, consider the following input:
     ```
     3 3
     1 0 1
     1 0 1
     0 0 0
     ```
   - In this case, no sequence of operations can transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) because the bottom-right corner of \( A \) is 0, and the only way to set four elements to 1 is to have them already 1 initially or after some operations, which is not possible here.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output `-1` correctly, indicating it's impossible to make \( B \) equal to \( A \). However, for other inputs where making \( B \) equal to \( A \) is possible, the program does not generate the correct sequence of operations.

Given the lack of comprehensive checking for the possibility of transformation, the program cannot be considered fully correct for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
