Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be at least 1 (since `range(k)` produces values from 0 to k-1).

4. **Current State of `m`:**
   - Given that `m` is at least 2, we can deduce that `m - 1` will be at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 2.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 because this is the condition that allows the loop to start.
   - No adjustment is needed for `n` or `i` since they do not affect the loop condition directly.
   - The state of `operations` does not affect the loop condition either.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` being at least 2.

**State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped. The condition `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.**
