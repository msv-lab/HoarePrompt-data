Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied for every valid index `j` in the range `[0, m - 2]` during the entire iteration range of `i`, and `j` is in the range \([0, m - 2]\).**

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` because `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n - 2`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The inner loop runs from `0` to `m - 2` because `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `m - 2`.
- The loop adds tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops` if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied.
- Since both loops run completely, all possible valid indices `i` and `j` are checked, and `ops` contains all such tuples.

This final state means that `ops` will contain all positions `(i + 1, j + 1)` where any of the specified conditions are met for the entire matrix.
