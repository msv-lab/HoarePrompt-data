The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. This means that the existing condition for `ops` being `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 2)]` if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true does not apply anymore because the code directly modifies `ops` by appending a new tuple.

Therefore, the updated state of `ops` is now `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 2), (i + 1, j + 1)]`.

Output State: **`A` is the original array, `ops` is `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 2), (i + 1, j + 1)]`**
