Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, plus the new tuple `(3, j + 1)` if any of these conditions hold. `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise. No other changes occur if none of the specified conditions are met.***
