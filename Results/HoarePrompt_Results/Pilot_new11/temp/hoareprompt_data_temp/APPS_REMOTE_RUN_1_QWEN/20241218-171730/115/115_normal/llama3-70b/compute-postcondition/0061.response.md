Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied for every valid index `j` in the range `[0, m - 2]` during the entire iteration range of `i`, and `j` is in the range \([0, m - 2]\). The length of `ops` is greater than 2500.***
