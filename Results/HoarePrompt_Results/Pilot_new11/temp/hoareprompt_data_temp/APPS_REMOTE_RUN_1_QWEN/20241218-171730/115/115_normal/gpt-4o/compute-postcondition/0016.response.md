Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `A` that satisfied the condition and was flipped in `B`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The initial state provides that `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `m` must be at least 2.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-2`. For each iteration, it checks if the 2x2 submatrix starting at `A[i][j]` and ending at `A[i+1][j+1]` contains only `1`s. If this condition is met, the corresponding positions in `B` are set to `1`, and the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` are appended to the `operations` list.
- **Final State**: After all possible iterations of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n` (since the loop increments `i` inside its body), meaning the loop will have checked all rows up to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes.

- **Variable Values**:
  - `i`: Will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
  - `m`: Remains at least 2 because the loop only depends on `m` being at least 2 to start.
  - `operations`: Will be a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` of all 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition during the loop's execution.

Thus, the final output state captures the conditions under which the loop terminates and the resulting state of the `operations` list.
