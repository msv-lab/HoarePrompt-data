Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for each position (i, j) where (i+1, j+1) is in `operations`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n-1` times and for `m-1` times in each iteration.
- The loop checks for a 2x2 submatrix in `A` with the elements at positions `(i, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)` all being 1.
- If the condition is met, the corresponding positions in `B` are set to 1 and the position `(i+1, j+1)` is added to the `operations` list.
- After the loop finishes, `n` and `m` remain at their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
- `A` remains unchanged in terms of its content unless modified outside the loop.
- `operations` contains the coordinates of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices that met the condition.
- `B` will have the specified positions set to 1 if the condition was met during the loop execution, otherwise, those positions will remain 0.
