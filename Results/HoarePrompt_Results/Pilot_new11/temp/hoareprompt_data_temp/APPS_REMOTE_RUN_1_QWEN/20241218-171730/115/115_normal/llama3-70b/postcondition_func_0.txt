The function processes a binary matrix \(A\) of dimensions \(n \times m\), where \(2 \le n, m \le 50\), and identifies positions where there are adjacent '1's in either a vertical or horizontal direction. Specifically, it finds all cells \((i+1, j+1)\) where any of the cells \((i, j)\), \((i+1, j)\), \((i, j+1)\), or \((i+1, j+1)\) contain a '1'. It collects these positions into a list `ops` and prints the length of this list followed by the positions themselves. If the list `ops` contains more than 2500 elements, the function outputs `-1` instead. After processing, the function ends without returning any value.
