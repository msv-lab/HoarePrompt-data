The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and calculates the resulting latitude. It ensures that the latitude remains within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If at any point the latitude goes out of this range or if the final latitude is exactly -90 and the last movement was not North, or if the final latitude is exactly 90 and the last movement was not South, the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of movements, and `n` pairs of integers and directions as input. It does not return any value.
