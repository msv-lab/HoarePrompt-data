The value of `curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The initial value of `curr_lat` is `-90`. Since `t` is an integer, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `-90 + t / 111.195`. The values of `n`, `output`, `dir`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is `-90 + t / 111.195`, the output is 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'; `t` is an integer**
