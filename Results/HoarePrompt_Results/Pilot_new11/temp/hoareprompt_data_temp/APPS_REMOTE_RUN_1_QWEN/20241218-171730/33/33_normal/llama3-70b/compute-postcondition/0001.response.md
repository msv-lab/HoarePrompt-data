The code initializes `curr_lat` to 90. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t_i`, or `dir_i`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; for each `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `curr_lat` is 90**
