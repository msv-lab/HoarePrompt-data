The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' and does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions remain unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` becomes 90 + t / 111.195. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` becomes 90 - t / 111.195. The values of `t` and `dir` remain unchanged. The current value of `curr_lat` is out of the range [-90, 90] and no new values are assigned.**
