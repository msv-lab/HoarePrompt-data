Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code uses the approximate conversion factor of 111.195 kilometers per degree latitude, which is not relevant to the problem statement. The problem states that the distance between the North Pole and the South Pole is exactly 20,000 kilometers, meaning moving north or south by any distance should keep the latitude within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees without needing to convert distances to degrees.

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Distance Conversion**: The code uses a conversion factor of 111.195 kilometers per degree, which is not mentioned in the problem statement and is not necessary for solving the problem.

2. **Invalid Movements at Poles**: The code checks for invalid movements at the poles but does not account for the exact condition that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South, and if he is at the South Pole, he can only move North. This check is not strictly enforced.

Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate these issues:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  ```
  Input:
  5
  7500 South
  10000 East
  3500 North
  4444 West
  4000 North

  Expected Output:
  YES
  ```

  The code would process this correctly because it keeps track of the latitude changes correctly.

- **Test Case 2**:
  ```
  Input:
  2
  15000 South
  4000 East

  Expected Output:
  NO
  ```

  The code would incorrectly output "YES" because it does not properly enforce the rule that Limak can only move North from the South Pole and vice versa.

- **Test Case 3**:
  ```
  Input:
  5
  20000 South
  1000 North
  1000000 West
  9000 North
  10000 North

  Expected Output:
  YES
  ```

  The code would process this correctly.

Given these observations, the code fails to correctly implement the rules for movement at the poles and does not strictly adhere to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
