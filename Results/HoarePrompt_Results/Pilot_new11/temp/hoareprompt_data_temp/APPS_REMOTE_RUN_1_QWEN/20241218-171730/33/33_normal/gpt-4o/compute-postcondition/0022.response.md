Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true if the condition `dir in ('West', 'East')` is met. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
