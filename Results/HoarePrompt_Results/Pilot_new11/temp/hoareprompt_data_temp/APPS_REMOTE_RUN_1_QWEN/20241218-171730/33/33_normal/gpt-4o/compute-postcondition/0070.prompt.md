You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each i in range 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to `n`, `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to `n`, `position` is a non-negative integer within the range [0, 20000] or 0 if the loop did not execute, and `valid` is `True` if the loop did not terminate due to invalid movements, otherwise `valid` is `False`.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to `n`, `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to `n`, `position` is a non-negative integer within the range [0, 20000], `valid` is `False` since the condition `position != 0` is met and the if part of the if-else block is executed.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to `n`, `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to `n`, `position` is a non-negative integer within the range [0, 20000], `valid` is `True` since the condition `position != 0` is met, and the console prints 'YES' if the if part is executed, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `n` movements, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and for each movement, it considers a distance `t_i` between 1 and \(10^6\) and a direction `dir_i` which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
