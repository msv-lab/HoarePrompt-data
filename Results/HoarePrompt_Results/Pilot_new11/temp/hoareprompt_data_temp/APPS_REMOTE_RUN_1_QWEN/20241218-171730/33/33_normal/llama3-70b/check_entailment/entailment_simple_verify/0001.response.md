Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Although the annotated version provides additional clarity, the issue remains the same: the program does not correctly enforce the rule that if Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North. The current implementation allows Limak to move South again after reaching the South Pole, which violates the given conditions.

The annotated version highlights that the program checks the conditions at each step but does not prevent further South movements once the South Pole is reached. This means that even though the program might print 'YES' at the end if `curr_lat` is exactly 90, it does not guarantee that Limak cannot move South after reaching the South Pole during the journey. Therefore, the program does not fully satisfy the problem requirements.
