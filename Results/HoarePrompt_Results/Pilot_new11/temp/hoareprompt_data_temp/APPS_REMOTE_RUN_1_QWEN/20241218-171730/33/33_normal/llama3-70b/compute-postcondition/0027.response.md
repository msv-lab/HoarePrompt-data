`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by a space. The previous values of `curr_lat` and `output` remain unchanged. Since the input is not specified, we can only say that `t` is the first part of the input and `dir` is the second part of the input.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is -90, the output is 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'; `t` is the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input**
