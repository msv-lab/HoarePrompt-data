The code subtracts `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. Since `t` is unchanged, the value of `t` remains the same. The value of `curr_lat` changes to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `output`, and `dir`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0; `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90 and is now equal to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`; the output remains 'NO'; `dir` is the second part of the input string; the value of `t` remains unchanged**
