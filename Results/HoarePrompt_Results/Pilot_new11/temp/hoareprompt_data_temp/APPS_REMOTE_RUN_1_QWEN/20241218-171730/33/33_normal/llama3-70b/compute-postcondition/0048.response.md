The `continue` statement in this context does not change the values of any variables or the output condition. It simply skips to the next iteration of a loop, but since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0; `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90; the output remains 'NO'; `dir` is the second part of the input string; the value of `t` remains unchanged**
