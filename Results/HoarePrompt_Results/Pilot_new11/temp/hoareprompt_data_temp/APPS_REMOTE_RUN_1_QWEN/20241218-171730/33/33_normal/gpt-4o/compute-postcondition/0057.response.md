Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is an integer from the input conversion, `dir` is the second part of the input from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is `False`. If `dir` equals 'North', `position` is updated to `position - t`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
