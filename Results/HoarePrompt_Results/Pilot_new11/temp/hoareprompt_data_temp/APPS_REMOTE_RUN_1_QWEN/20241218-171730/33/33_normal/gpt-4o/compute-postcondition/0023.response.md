Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t` and `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` is set to either 0 or 20000, and `valid` is set to `False`. If `dir` does not match 'South', 'West', or 'East', the original conditions for `position` and `valid` remain unchanged.***
