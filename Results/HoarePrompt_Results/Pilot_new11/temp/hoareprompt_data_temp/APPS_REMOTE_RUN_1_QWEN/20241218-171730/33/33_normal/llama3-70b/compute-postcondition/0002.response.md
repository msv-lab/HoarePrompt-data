According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` determines the number of iterations in the loop, if `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Let's break down the states needed:

1. The variable `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.
2. The current value of `curr_lat` is given as 90, but this value does not directly affect the loop's execution condition. However, we should ensure that `curr_lat` remains unchanged within the loop, unless the loop body changes it.
3. The values of `t_i` and `dir_i` are not relevant to the loop's execution condition since they are iterated over within the loop.

Therefore, the critical adjustment is ensuring that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90**
