The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since the function does not assign any new values to the variables, all the variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` remains within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', `dir` is the second part of the input string, the value of `t` remains unchanged.**
