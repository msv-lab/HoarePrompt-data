`t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string. The input is expected to be split into two parts: `t` (the first part) and `dir` (the second part). Since the exact input is not specified, we can only state that `t` and `dir` are assigned the respective parts of the input string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', and the direction `dir` is now the second part of the input string.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0; `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90; the output remains 'NO'; `dir` is the second part of the input string**
