The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is -90, the output is 'NO', the direction `dir` is not 'South', and `curr_lat` is equal to 90**
