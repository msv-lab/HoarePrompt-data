The code simply prints 'NO' and does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions of `n` being at least 1 and `curr_lat` being -90 (which is within the valid range) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is -90, print output is 'NO'**
