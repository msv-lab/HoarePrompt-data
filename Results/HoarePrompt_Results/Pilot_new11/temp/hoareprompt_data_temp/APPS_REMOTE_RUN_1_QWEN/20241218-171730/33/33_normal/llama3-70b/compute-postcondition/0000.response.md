`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t_i` and `dir_i` for `i` from 1 to `n` remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; for each `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East".
