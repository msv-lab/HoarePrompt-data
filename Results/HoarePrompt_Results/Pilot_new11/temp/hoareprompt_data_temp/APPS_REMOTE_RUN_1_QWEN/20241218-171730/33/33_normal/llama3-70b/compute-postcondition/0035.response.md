The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately without executing any further statements. It does not assign any new values to the variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is either `-90 + t / 111.195` (if `dir == 'North'`) or `-90 - t / 111.195` or `-90` (if `dir != 'North'`), the output is 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'; `t` is an integer.**
