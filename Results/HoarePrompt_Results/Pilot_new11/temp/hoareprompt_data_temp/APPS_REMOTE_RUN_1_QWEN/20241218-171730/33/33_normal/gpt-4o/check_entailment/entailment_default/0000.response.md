Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. The code does not enforce the restriction that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South. The code allows Limak to move in any direction from the North Pole as long as the position does not exceed the bounds of the sphere (0 to 20000 kilometers).

2. Similarly, the code does not enforce the restriction that if Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North. The code allows Limak to move in any direction from the South Pole as long as the position does not exceed the bounds of the sphere.

3. The code does not ensure that the journey ends on the North Pole. It only checks the final position after all movements, but it does not enforce that the final position must be exactly 0 kilometers from the North Pole.

To illustrate these issues, consider the following inputs:

- For the input:
  ```
  2
  15000 South
  4000 East
  ```
  The code will print "YES" even though the journey does not end on the North Pole.

- For the input:
  ```
  1
  20000 North
  ```
  The code will print "NO" even though the journey is valid as it starts and ends at the North Pole, but the intermediate movement is not restricted.

These examples show that the code does not correctly enforce the given conditions, hence the correctness is **False**.
