Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks the conditions specified in the problem description. It keeps track of the current latitude (`curr_lat`), ensuring that:

1. If Limak is on the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is on the South Pole (-90 degrees latitude), he can only move North.
3. The journey ends on the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).

The program uses the conversion factor `111.195` kilometers per degree to adjust the latitude based on the movement direction. It also checks for invalid moves and prints "NO" immediately if such a move is detected. Finally, after processing all movements, it checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees, printing "YES" if so, and "NO" otherwise.

Since the program handles all the conditions and potential edge cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
