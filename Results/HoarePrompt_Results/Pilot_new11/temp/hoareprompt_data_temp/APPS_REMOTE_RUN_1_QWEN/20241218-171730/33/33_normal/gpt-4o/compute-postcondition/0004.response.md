The code `t, dir = input().split()` takes a single line of input from the user and splits it into two parts based on whitespace. These two parts are then assigned to the variables `t` and `dir` respectively. The initial state of `n` being between 1 and 50 is not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state includes the new variables `t` and `dir` along with the unchanged variable `n`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is a string, `dir` is a string**
