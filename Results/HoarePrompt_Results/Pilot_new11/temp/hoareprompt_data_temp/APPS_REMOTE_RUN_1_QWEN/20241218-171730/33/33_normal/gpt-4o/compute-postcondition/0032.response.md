Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is False. If `position - t < 0`, then `valid` is set to False. Otherwise, `valid` remains True.***
