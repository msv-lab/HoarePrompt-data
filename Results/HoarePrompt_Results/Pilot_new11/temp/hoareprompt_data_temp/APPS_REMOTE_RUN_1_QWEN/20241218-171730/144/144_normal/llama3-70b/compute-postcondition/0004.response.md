According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must contain at least one element because the `for` loop will stop when there are no more elements to iterate over.

Let's break down the requirements:
- The variable `n` is an input integer, indicating the length of the list `arr`.
- The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `mex` (minimum excluded number) is initialized to 1, but this variable itself does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `arr` must have at least one element.**
