The code `print(mex)` simply prints the value of `mex`. Since the value of `mex` does not change within this line of code, it only outputs the current value of `mex` without altering any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, and `mex` is printed.**
