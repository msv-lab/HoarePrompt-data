`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The first line of the input is read and converted to an integer `n`. The second line of input, which contains the array elements, remains unchanged for now. Therefore, the output state is: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array; `n` is an input integer.
