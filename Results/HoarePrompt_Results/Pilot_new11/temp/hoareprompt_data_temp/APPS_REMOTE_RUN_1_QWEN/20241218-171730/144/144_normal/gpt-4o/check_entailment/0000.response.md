Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are greater than or equal to the current `mex` value correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
5
4 4 4 4 4
```

According to the problem description, Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its current value. Therefore, after applying the operations, the array could be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, making the `mex` value `2`. However, the program will incorrectly output `6` because it increments `mex` until it finds an element in the sorted array that is greater than `mex`, which in this case is `4` (the smallest element in the sorted array). This leads to an incorrect result.
