According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is not empty. Additionally, we need to consider the initial state of the variable `num`, which will be set to the first element of `a` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `mex` is 1.

For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is non-empty. Since `num` will be assigned the first element of `a` during the first iteration, we do not need to explicitly state the initial value of `num` unless additional context requires it.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` must be a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mex` is 1**
