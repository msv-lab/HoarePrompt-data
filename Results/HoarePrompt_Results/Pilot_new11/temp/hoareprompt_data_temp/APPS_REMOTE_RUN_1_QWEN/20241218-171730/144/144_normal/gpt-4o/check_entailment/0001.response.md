Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest element in the array is greater than or equal to the mex value that has already been incremented. Specifically, consider the input:

```
3
2 2 2
```

In this case, the initial mex is 1. After sorting, the loop will check each element and increment mex as long as `num >= mex`. Since all elements are 2, the loop will increment mex to 3. However, the correct mex value should be 3 because we can decrease each element to 1, making the array [1, 1, 1], and the mex of this array is 2. Thus, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible mex in this scenario.
