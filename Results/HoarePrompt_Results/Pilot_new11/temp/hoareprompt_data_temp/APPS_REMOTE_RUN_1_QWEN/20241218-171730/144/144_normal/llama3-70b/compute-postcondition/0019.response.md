The code `break` is executed, which does not affect the values of the variables `arr`, `num`, and `mex`. The loop or conditional block that contains this `break` statement is exited, but no variables are modified.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list (i.e., `arr[i+1]`), `mex` remains unchanged if `num` does not equal `mex`, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
