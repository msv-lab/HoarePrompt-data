The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the `break` statement here does not have any effect on the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and the number `num` is greater than the minimum element in `arr`.**
