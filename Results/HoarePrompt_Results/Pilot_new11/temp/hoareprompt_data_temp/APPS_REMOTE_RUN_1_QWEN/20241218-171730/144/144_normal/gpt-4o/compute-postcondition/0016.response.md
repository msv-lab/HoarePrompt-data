The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but reads input from the standard input stream. Specifically, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) on the first line, representing the number of elements in the array, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array. Based on the input, the function does not return a value but processes the array. However, since the problem statement only provides the function signature and output description without specifying the exact return type or behavior, we will focus on the input and expected output behavior.

Given the lack of specific return details, the primary task described seems to be processing the array. Therefore, we will consider the function's primary output to be the processed state of the array.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array, and processes the array.**
