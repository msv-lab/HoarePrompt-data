Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and the number `num` is greater than the minimum element in `arr`. Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition remains the same as the if part: `num` is greater than the minimum element in `arr`.**
