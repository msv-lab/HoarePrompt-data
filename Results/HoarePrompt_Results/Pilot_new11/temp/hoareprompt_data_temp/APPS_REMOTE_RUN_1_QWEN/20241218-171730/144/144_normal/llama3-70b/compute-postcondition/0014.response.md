The code `break` does not affect any variable values and merely exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block containing this `break` statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside, but no variables are updated.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
