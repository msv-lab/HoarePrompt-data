Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The program iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight. The number of iterations (years) is counted and printed. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program works correctly for all possible inputs within these constraints.
