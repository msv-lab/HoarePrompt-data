The code `years += 1` increments the value of `years` by 1. Given the initial state where `years` is 0, the new value of `years` will be 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` is `a_original * 3`, `b` is twice its original value and within the range of 2 to 20; `years` is 1.**
