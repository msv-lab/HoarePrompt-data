`years` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` is 3 times its original value, and `b` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. After executing the code, the value of `years` is 1 more than its original value, which was 0. Therefore, the updated value of `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is 3 * a, `b` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, and `years` is 1**
