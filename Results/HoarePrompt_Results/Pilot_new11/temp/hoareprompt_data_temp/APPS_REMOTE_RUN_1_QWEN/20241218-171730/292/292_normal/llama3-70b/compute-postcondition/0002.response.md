According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10.

Since the condition `a <= b` is already satisfied based on the given constraints, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute at least once.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10; `years` is 0**
