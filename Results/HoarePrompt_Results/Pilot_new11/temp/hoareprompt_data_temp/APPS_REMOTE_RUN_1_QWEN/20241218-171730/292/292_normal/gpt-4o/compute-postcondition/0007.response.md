The initial state is such that `a` is `a_original * 3` and this value is less than or equal to 20, and `b` is twice its original value and within the range of 2 to 20. The code snippet `a *= 3` multiplies the current value of `a` by 3.

Given the initial conditions:
- \( a \leq 20 \)
- \( b \) is within the range of 2 to 20 and is twice its original value

Let's calculate the new value of `a`:
- Since `a` is initially `a_original * 3`, multiplying it by 3 gives \( a = (a_original * 3) * 3 = a_original * 9 \).

Since \( a \leq 20 \) and \( a = a_original * 9 \), we can determine the maximum value for `a_original`:
- \( a_original * 9 \leq 20 \)
- Therefore, \( a_original \leq \frac{20}{9} \approx 2.22 \)

Since `a_original * 3` must also be an integer (as implied by typical integer operations in Python without further context), the possible values for `a_original` are integers up to 2. Hence, `a_original` can be 1 or 2.

If `a_original` is 1:
- \( a = 1 * 9 = 9 \)
- \( b \) remains unchanged, so \( b \) is twice its original value, which is within the range of 2 to 20.

If `a_original` is 2:
- \( a = 2 * 9 = 18 \)
- \( b \) remains unchanged, so \( b \) is twice its original value, which is within the range of 2 to 20.

In both cases, the value of `b` remains unchanged and is within the specified range.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is 9 or 18, `b` is twice its original value and within the range of 2 to 20**
