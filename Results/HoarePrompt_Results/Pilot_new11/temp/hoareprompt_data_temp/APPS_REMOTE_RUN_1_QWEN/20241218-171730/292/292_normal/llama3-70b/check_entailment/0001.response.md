Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the loop will terminate within a reasonable number of iterations, ensuring the solution is both accurate and efficient. All provided examples and logical scenarios align with the expected behavior of the program.
