`years` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `years` is 2, so after the increment, `years` becomes 3. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 27 or 54; `b` is at least 36; `years` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is 27 or 54; `b` is at least 36; `years` is 3**
