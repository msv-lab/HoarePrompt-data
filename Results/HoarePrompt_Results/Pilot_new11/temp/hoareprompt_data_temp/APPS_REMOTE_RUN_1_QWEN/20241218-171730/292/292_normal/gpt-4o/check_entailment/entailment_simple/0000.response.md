Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes two variables `a` and `b` by taking input from the user. These variables represent the current weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The constraints 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10 are respected.

2. **Loop Logic**: 
   - A variable `years` is initialized to 0 to count the number of years.
   - A while loop runs as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - `a` is tripled (`a *= 3`).
     - `b` is doubled (`b *= 2`).
     - The `years` counter is incremented by 1 (`years += 1`).

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. At this point, the value of `years` is printed, which represents the number of years after which Limak’s weight surpasses Bob’s weight.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

Given these points, the program accurately simulates the growth of Limak and Bob’s weights according to the specified rules and prints the correct number of years. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
