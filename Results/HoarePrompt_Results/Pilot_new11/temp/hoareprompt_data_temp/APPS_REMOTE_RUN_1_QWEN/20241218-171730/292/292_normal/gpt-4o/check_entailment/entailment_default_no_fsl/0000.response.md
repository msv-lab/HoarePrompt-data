Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and produces the correct output for each example provided in the problem description.
