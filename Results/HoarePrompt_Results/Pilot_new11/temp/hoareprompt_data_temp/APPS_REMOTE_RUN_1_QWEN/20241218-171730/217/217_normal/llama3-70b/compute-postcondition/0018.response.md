Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `b` is 0.
- `c` is 0.
- The loop iterates over the list `a` using `i` as the index.

Loop code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        b += a[i]
    else:
        c += a[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `b = 0`
   - `c = 0`
   - `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - Since `i % 2 == 0` is true (`0 % 2 == 0`), `b` is updated to `b + a[0]`.
   - `b = a[0]`, `c = 0`.

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - Since `i % 2 == 0` is false (`1 % 2 != 0`), `c` is updated to `c + a[1]`.
   - `b = a[0]`, `c = a[1]`.

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - Since `i % 2 == 0` is true (`2 % 2 == 0`), `b` is updated to `b + a[2]`.
   - `b = a[0] + a[2]`, `c = a[1]`.

5. **Fourth Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - Since `i % 2 == 0` is false (`3 % 2 != 0`), `c` is updated to `c + a[3]`.
   - `b = a[0] + a[2]`, `c = a[1] + a[3]`.

Continuing this pattern...

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, `i` will have gone through all indices from 0 to `n-1`. The loop will add elements from `a` to `b` if the index is even and to `c` if the index is odd.

- If `n` is even, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index).
- If `n` is odd, `i` will also be `n-1` (the last index).

So, the final values of `b` and `c` will be the sums of the elements in `a` based on whether their index is even or odd, respectively.

### Output State

**Output State:**
- `b` is the sum of all elements in `a` at even indices.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `a` at odd indices.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Output State: **`b` is the sum of all elements in `a` at even indices, `c` is the sum of all elements in `a` at odd indices, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).**
