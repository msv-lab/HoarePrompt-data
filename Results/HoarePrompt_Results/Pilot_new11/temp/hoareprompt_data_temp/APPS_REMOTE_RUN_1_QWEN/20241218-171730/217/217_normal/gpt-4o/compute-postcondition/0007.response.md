Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers from the user. It then calculates the difference between the sum of positive integers and the sum of negative integers in the list. If \( n \) is within the range 1 to 100, it prints the calculated difference. If \( n \) is outside this range, the program will raise an error because the input validation is not explicitly handled in the given code. Additionally, the function does not handle non-integer inputs for the list elements, which would lead to a `ValueError`.**

This summary covers the actual operations performed by the code, including the missing input validation and handling of non-integer values.
