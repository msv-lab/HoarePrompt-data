The code `result = B - C` calculates the difference between the values of `B` and `C`. Given the initial state, `B` is 6 and `C` is 0, so `result` will be assigned the value of 6 - 0, which is 6. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 2, 3], `B` is 6, `C` is 0, `result` is 6**
