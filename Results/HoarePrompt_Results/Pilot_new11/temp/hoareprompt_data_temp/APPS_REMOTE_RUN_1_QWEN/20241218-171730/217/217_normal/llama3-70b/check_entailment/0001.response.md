Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct result. Specifically, the logic used to partition the array into sequences `b` and `c` by sorting the array and then assigning elements alternately to `b` and `c` does not guarantee the maximum possible value of `B - C`. This approach fails to consider all possible partitions that could yield a higher difference.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-5 10 -3 7
```

The program's output would be:
```
0
```
because after sorting, it assigns `-5` and `-3` to `b`, and `10` and `7` to `c`, resulting in `B = -8` and `C = 17`, so `B - C = -25`.

However, the correct solution is to assign `10` and `7` to `b`, and `-5` and `-3` to `c`, which gives `B = 17` and `C = -8`, resulting in `B - C = 25`.

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal partition, making it incorrect.
