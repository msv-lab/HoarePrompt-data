State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0.

According to the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To ensure the loop can execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The variable `n` must be at least 1 because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.
2. The variable `i` should start from 0, as `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must start from 0.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself and can remain as stated.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
