Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `x` consists of multiple '9's followed by a smaller leading digit. For instance, if the input is `521`, the program should output `499` because `499` has a higher digit sum than `521`. However, the current implementation only reduces the leading digit to '9' and sets all other digits to '9', which may not always yield the correct result.

The specific issue is that the program does not correctly adjust the number to maximize both the digit sum and maintain the order relative to the original number. It simply changes the leading digit to '9' and sets all other digits to '9' without considering whether this change maintains the condition of being the largest possible number with the highest digit sum.
