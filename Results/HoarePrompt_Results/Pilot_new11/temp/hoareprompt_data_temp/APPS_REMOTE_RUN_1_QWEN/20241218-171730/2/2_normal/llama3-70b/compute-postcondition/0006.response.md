`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. Since the current value of `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, the new value of `max_sum` will be equal to the current value of `digit_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `i` is its original value, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`**
