The code initializes `max_sum` to 0. This does not affect the value of `x`. Therefore, the output state remains with `x` being the integer value of the input string, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and `max_sum` being 0.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18; `max_sum` is 0**
