The code `t.sort()` sorts the list `t` in ascending order. Since `t` initially contains the integers `[n, k, M]`, after sorting, `t` will contain these integers in sorted order. The variables `n`, `k`, and `M` themselves do not change, only their order in the list `t` changes.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `M` are the integers read from the input; `t` is now a list containing `[n, k, M]` sorted in ascending order.**
