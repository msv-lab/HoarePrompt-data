Postcondition: ***`t` is `[n, k, M]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element is 0 except `dp[1][j]` which is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `M`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`***
