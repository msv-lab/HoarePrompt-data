According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `complete_tasks` in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new state of `max_points` and `subtasks_solved` before the loop can execute again.

Here are the steps to determine the updated state:

1. **Update `subtasks_solved`:**
   - The value of `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`.
   
2. **Update `max_points`:**
   - `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

Given that the loop is iterating over `complete_tasks` and we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, we can summarize the required adjustments:

- `max_points` will be updated based on the new value of `subtasks_solved`.
- `subtasks_solved` will be updated based on the new value of `complete_tasks`.

Let's formalize this into the output state:

State: **`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks + 1`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.**

This ensures that all relevant variables are correctly adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.
