Postcondition: ***`t` is `[n, k, M]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element is 0 except `dp[1][j]` which is 1 for `j >= n`, and `dp[2][3]` is 0. If `j >= t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` for each valid `i` and `j`. Since there is no else part, no further changes occur when `j < t[i - 1]`.***
