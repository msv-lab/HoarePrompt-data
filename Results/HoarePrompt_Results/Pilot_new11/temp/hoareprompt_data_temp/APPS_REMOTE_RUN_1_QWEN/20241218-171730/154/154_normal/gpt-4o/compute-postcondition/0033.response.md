The code `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)` updates the value of `points` to be `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(1 \leq complete_tasks \leq n\); `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of `initial_subtasks_solved` and \((n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k\); `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`; `total_time_per_task` remains as per its initial condition; `time_used` is updated to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points` is now `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` remains as per its initial condition; `num_processed` remains as per its initial condition; if `time_used > M`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
