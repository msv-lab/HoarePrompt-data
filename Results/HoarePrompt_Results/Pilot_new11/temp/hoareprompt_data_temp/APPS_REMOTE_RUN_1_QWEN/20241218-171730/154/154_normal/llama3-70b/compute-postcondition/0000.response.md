The code `n, k, M = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `M`. The values of these variables are now specific integers based on the input, but the exact values are not known yet.

The output state will reflect that `n`, `k`, and `M` are now assigned the values read from the input, and the precondition that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), and \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) still holds true.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `M` are integers assigned the values read from the input, and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9.**
