Postcondition: ***`t` is `[n, k, M]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element is 0 except `dp[1][j]` which is 1 for `j >= n`. If `j >= t[0]`, `dp[2][3]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `dp[2][3]` remains 0. `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than 0, and `j` is 3.***
