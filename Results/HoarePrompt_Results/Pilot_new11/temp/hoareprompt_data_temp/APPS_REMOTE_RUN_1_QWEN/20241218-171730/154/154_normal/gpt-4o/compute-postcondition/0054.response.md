The code updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. The value of `subtasks_solved` is defined as the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. The output state should reflect this update.

Let's break down the impact:

- `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t`) are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.**
