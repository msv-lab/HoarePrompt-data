`time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. This means that `time_used` now holds the value of the product of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks + 1`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.**
