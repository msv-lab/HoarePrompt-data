The code `remaining_time = M - time_used` assigns the value of `M - time_used` to the variable `remaining_time`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `max_points`, and `points` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `max_points` is 0, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`**
