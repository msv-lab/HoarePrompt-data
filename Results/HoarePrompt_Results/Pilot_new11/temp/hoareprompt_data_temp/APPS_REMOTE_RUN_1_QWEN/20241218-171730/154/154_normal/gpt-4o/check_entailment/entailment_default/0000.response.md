Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `M` is zero. According to the problem description, if Polycarp has zero minutes, he cannot complete any tasks or subtasks, so the output should be 0. However, the current implementation calculates the maximum points without checking if `M` is zero. As a result, it will return a non-zero value even when `M` is zero, which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `M = 0`, the program will incorrectly return a non-zero value instead of 0.
