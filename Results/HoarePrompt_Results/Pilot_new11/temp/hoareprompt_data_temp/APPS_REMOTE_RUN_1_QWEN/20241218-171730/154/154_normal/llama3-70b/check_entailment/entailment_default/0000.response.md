Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint `M`. The main issue lies in how the dynamic programming table `dp` is used to calculate the maximum points.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Initialization and Update of DP Table:**
   - The current implementation initializes `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]` by default, which means it assumes no new subtask is added unless it fits within the remaining time `j`. This approach does not account for the possibility of completing a full task and earning the extra point.

2. **Misunderstanding of Task Completion:**
   - The logic should consider the possibility of completing a full task (all `k` subtasks) and the additional point earned. The current implementation only considers partial completion and does not correctly account for the scenario where a full task can be completed within the remaining time.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```
- For the first task, the time required to solve all 4 subtasks is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` minutes. Polycarp can complete the first task and still have 1 minute left.
- In the second task, the time required to solve the first subtask is 1 minute. With 1 minute left, Polycarp can solve the first subtask of the second task.
- Therefore, the total points Polycarp can earn are 5 (from the first task) + 1 (from the second task) = 6 points.

However, the provided code would not correctly handle this scenario because it does not properly account for the possibility of completing a full task and earning the extra point.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the logic required to maximize the number of points, particularly in scenarios where a full task can be completed within the remaining time. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
