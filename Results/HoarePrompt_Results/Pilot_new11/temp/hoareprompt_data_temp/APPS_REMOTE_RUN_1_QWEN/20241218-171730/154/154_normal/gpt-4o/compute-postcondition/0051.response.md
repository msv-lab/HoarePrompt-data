Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `max_points`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, `t`, and `subtask_time` are integers. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, `num_processed` is increased by the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the current remaining time (`remaining_time // subtask_time`), and `subtasks_solved` is increased by this value. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, no changes are made to the variables.***
