The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]`

Since `i` is 1, the term `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` simplifies to `dp[0][j - t[0]]`. However, since `i` starts from 1, there is no `dp[0][j]` in the initial state, which implies that the expression `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is undefined in this context. Nonetheless, the operation will be considered as comparing `dp[1][j]` (which is `dp[1][j - 1]`) with `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`.

Given the absence of `dp[0][j]` in the initial state, `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is essentially undefined or can be considered as 0 for the purpose of calculation. Thus, the code simplifies to updating `dp[1][j]` as follows:

- `dp[1][j]` is updated to `max(dp[1][j], 0 + 1)`.

Therefore, `dp[1][j]` is updated to `max(dp[1][j], 1)`, meaning `dp[1][j]` will be 1 if it was less than 1, and will remain `dp[1][j - 1]` if it was already 1 or greater.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `max(dp[1][j - 1], 1)`**
