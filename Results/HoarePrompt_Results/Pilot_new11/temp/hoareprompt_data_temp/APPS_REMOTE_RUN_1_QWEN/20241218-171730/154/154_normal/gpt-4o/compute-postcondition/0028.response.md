The code updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. Since `max_points` is updated based on the current values of `points` and `subtasks_solved`, we need to know these values to determine the new value of `max_points`.

Given:
- `subtasks_solved` is defined as `min(initial_subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

Let's denote:
- `subtasks_solved` as `min(initial_subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

After executing the line `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, the value of `max_points` will be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

The other variables (`total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `max_points`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\);
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\);
- `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(0 \leq complete_tasks \leq k\);
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of `initial_subtasks_solved` and \((n - complete_tasks) * k`);
- `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`;
- `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed` remain as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(0 \leq complete_tasks \leq k\); `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of `initial_subtasks_solved` and \((n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`; `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed` remain as per their initial conditions.**
