Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\); `t` is a list of `k` integers where each `t_j` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\); `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`; `time_used` is greater than `M`; `max_points` is 0; `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`; if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time` plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `num_processed` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k`; otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.***
