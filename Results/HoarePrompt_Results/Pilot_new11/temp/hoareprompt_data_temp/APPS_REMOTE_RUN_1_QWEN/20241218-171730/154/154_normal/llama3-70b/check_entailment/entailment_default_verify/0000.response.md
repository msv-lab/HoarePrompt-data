Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). The program reads the necessary inputs, initializes a DP table, and fills it according to the problem's requirements. After populating the DP table, the program calculates the sum of the last row of the DP table plus the count of indices where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`, which correctly represents the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The output hints confirm that the program functions as expected, handling all cases within the given constraints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
