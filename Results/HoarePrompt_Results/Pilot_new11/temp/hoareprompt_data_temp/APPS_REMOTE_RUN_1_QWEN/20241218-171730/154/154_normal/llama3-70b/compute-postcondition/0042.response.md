The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the condition involving `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
2. If `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, the value of `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged, as the assignment statement does not affect it.

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`.
- `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.
- `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.

After running the code snippet:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.
- The value of `dp[i][j]` will remain unchanged if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
