Postcondition: ***`dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j + 1]` are updated according to the conditions specified. If `j >= t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` and `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 2 - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged and equals `dp[i][j - 1]`.***
