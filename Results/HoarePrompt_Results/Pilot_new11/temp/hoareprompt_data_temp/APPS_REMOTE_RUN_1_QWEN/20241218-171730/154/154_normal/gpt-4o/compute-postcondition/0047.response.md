To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following variables are integers within their specified ranges:
   - \( n \)
   - \( k \)
   - \( complete_tasks \)
   - \( max_points \)
   - \( total_time_per_task \)
   - \( time_used \)
   - \( points \)
   - \( remaining_time \)
   - \( num_processed \)
   - \( t \)

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `t` (which is presumably a list of subtask times).

3. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then:
     - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`
     - `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`
     - `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume `subtask_time` from the current iteration has already been processed and the corresponding changes to the variables have been made.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the `subtask_time` will be the next element in the list `t`.
   - The loop condition will check if the new `remaining_time` (after any potential changes from the previous iteration) is greater than or equal to the new `subtask_time`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - If the loop proceeds to the next iteration, `subtask_time` will be the next value in the list `t`.
   - The variables `remaining_time` and others might have changed based on the previous iteration's logic.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:

- **Remaining Time (`remaining_time`)**: This will be the updated value after the previous iteration's logic, which could be reduced based on the division and subtraction performed.
- **Subtask Time (`subtask_time`)**: This will be the next element in the list `t`.

Given the above, we can state the required adjustments as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `complete_tasks` is an integer, `max_points` is an integer, `total_time_per_task` is an integer, `time_used` is an integer, `points` is an integer, `remaining_time` is an integer, `num_processed` is an integer, `t` is a list of integers, and `subtask_time` is the next integer in the list `t`.**

Since we don't know the exact values, we represent the next `subtask_time` as the next element in the list `t` without specifying its value explicitly. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `complete_tasks` is an integer, `max_points` is an integer, `total_time_per_task` is an integer, `time_used` is an integer, `points` is an integer, `remaining_time` is an integer, `num_processed` is an integer, `t` is a list of integers, and `subtask_time` is the next integer in the list `t`.**
