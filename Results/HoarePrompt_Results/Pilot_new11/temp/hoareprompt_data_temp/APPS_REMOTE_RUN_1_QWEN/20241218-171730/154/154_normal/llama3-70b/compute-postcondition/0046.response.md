The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the condition involving `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`. Let's break it down:

1. The initial state specifies that `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j + 1` is less than `t[i - 1]`; otherwise, it is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 2 - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
2. The code snippet updates `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of itself and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

Given the initial conditions, let's consider a specific case to illustrate the impact:

- Assume `i = 2`, `j = 3`, `t[1] = 2`, `dp[1][2] = 5`, and `dp[1][1] = 3`.

The initial state is:
- `dp[2][3]` is equal to `dp[2][2]`.
- `dp[2][4]` is equal to `dp[2][3]` if `3 + 1 < t[1]`; otherwise, it is updated to the maximum of `dp[2][3]` and `dp[1][1 + 2 - t[1]] + 1`.

Since `3 + 1 = 4` and `t[1] = 2`, `4 >= t[1]` is true, so:
- `dp[2][4]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[2][3]` and `dp[1][1 + 2 - 2] + 1 = dp[1][1] + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.

Now, updating `dp[2][3]`:
- `dp[2][3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[2][3]` (which is initially equal to `dp[2][2]`) and `dp[1][1 - 2] + 1 = dp[1][-1] + 1`.

Since `dp[1][-1]` is not defined in the context (assuming it is 0 for undefined indices), we use `0`:
- `dp[2][3]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[2][2]` and `0 + 1 = 1`.

Assuming `dp[2][2]` is not specified, we can consider the general case where `dp[2][2]` is some value, say `k`. Then:
- `dp[2][3]` is updated to the maximum of `k` and `1`.

Therefore, the new value of `dp[2][3]` depends on the initial value of `dp[2][2]`.

Given this analysis, the specific values are:
- `dp[2][3]` is now the maximum of its original value and `1`.
- `dp[2][4]` is now `4`.

Output State: **`dp[2][3]` is the maximum of its original value and 1; `dp[2][4]` is 4; `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j + 1` is less than `t[i - 1]`; if `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 2 - t[i - 1]] + 1`. If `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
