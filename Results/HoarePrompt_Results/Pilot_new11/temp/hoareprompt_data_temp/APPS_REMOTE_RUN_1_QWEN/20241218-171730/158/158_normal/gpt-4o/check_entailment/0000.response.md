Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). It determines the limiting factor by finding the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. This ensures that the number of each type of fruit used is proportional to the required ratio. The calculation of the total number of fruits used is also correct. Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
