Functionality: **The function takes three non-negative integer inputs \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\)), calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be taken under the given conditions (\(a\) lemons, \(\frac{b}{2}\) lemons, and \(\frac{c}{4}\) lemons), and then computes the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and oranges) that can be obtained based on the maximum number of lemons. It prints the total number of fruits. If any of the inputs are invalid (not integers or outside the specified range), the function will behave unpredictably since it relies on user input and no validation is performed.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(b\) or \(c\) is odd, \(\frac{b}{2}\) and \(\frac{c}{4}\) will result in a non-integer value, which will be truncated when converted to an integer. This might lead to incorrect calculations.
- If \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is zero, the maximum number of lemons will be zero, resulting in a total fruit count of zero.
- If \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is outside the range \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\), the behavior of the function is undefined since the input is not validated.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- Input validation is missing to ensure that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are within the specified range and are integers. Without this, the function may produce incorrect results or raise exceptions if invalid inputs are provided.
