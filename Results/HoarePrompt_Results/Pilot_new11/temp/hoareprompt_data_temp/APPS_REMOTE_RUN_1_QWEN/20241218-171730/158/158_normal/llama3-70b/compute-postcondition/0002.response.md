`c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the integer input converted to an integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the integer input converted to an integer**
