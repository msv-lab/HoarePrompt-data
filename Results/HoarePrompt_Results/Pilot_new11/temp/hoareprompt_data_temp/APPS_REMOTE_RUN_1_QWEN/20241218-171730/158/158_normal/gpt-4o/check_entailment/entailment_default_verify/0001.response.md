Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be used to maintain the required ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used by taking the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits used and prints it. The output hints confirm that the program functions as expected, calculating the total number of fruits based on the given constraints. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the final assessment remains **True**.
