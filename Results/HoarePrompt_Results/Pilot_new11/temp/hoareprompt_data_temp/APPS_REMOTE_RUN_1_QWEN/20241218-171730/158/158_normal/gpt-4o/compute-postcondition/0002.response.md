`c` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `c` now holds an integer input from the user. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user**
