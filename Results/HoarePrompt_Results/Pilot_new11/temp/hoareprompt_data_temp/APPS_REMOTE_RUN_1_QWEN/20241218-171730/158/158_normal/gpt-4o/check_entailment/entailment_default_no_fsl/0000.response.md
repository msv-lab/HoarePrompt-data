Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio (1:2:4) and prints the total number of fruits that can be used. The program handles the input constraints appropriately and provides the correct output for all given examples:

- In the first example, the program outputs 7, which is the correct total number of fruits that can be used (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).
- In the second example, the program outputs 21, which is the correct total number of fruits that can be used (3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears).
- In the third example, the program outputs 0, which is the correct output since there are not enough pears to use any lemons.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints, the correctness is **True**.
