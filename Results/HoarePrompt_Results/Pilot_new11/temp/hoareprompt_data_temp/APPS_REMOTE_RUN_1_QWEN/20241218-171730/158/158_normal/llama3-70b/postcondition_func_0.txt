The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input where each integer is between 1 and 1000. It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function prints the result of adding the minimum value to itself twice and four times, which is equivalent to printing `8 * min_lemon`, where `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function does not return any value explicitly.
