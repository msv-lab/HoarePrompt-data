Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio (1:2:4) and the minimum quantity among the three types of fruits. The code handles the input as specified and computes the total number of fruits accordingly. For each set of inputs, the code determines the limiting factor (the minimum value of \(a\), \(b//2\), and \(c//4\)) and multiplies it by the respective coefficients (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears) to get the total number of fruits that can be used. This ensures that the code works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints.
