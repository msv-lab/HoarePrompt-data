`a1` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], the value of `a1` will be calculated based on these specific values.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `a1` is `x ** (y ** z)`**
