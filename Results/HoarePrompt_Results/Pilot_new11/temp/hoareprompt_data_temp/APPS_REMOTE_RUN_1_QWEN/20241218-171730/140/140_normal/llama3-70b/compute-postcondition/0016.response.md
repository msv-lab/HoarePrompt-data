Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`, the function returns `True`. There is no else part specified, so the function returns `True` under the if condition and does not execute any other operations if the condition is not met.***
