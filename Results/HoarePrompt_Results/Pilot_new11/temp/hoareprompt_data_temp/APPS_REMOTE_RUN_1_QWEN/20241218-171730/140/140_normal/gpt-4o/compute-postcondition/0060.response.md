Postcondition: ***`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` includes the neighbors whose in-degree has become 0 and also includes the `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. Since there is no else part, these conditions apply regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
