You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here’s why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, which is appropriate for this problem.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function uses topological sorting via in-degree counting to detect cycles. This is a standard method to check for cycles in directed graphs.
3. **Edge Removal Check**: The main function `func_1` iterates through each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If it does, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it re-adds the edge and continues checking other edges.
4. **Boundary Cases**: The code handles the boundary cases correctly by checking if the graph is already acyclic before attempting to remove any edge. If the graph is already acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'.

Since the program follows the problem description and handles all cases appropriately, it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges in the graph, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each vertex `u`, `graph[u]` includes `v` as an additional element, and the graph does not contain any cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

The function constructs a directed graph using the provided edges. It then checks if the graph contains a cycle using the `has_cycle(graph)` function. If the graph contains no cycle initially, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iterates over each edge in the graph, temporarily removing the edge and checking if the graph still contains a cycle. If removing an edge breaks the cycle, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found and the graph remains cyclic, it returns 'NO'.

This function effectively determines whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing a single directed edge. The final state of the program after executing the function is either 'YES', indicating that a single edge can be removed to break all cycles, or 'NO', indicating that no single edge can be removed to break all cycles.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex. The graph represents a directed graph with n vertices and m edges.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex; `u` is a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0, `node` is the last node dequeued from the queue, `in_degree` dictionary is updated such that each neighbor's in-degree has been decremented by the number of times they became 0.
    return count != n
    #`The program returns count != n where 'count' is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 and 'n' is the total number of nodes in the graph`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a directed graph represented as a dictionary and returns whether the graph contains a cycle. Specifically, it performs a topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm (also known as the in-degree zero queue method). The function first calculates the in-degree of each node. Then, it initializes a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0 and counts these nodes. It processes each node in the queue by decrementing the in-degrees of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0 during this process, it is added to the queue. After processing all nodes, if the count of nodes with an in-degree of 0 is not equal to the total number of nodes (`n`), then the graph contains a cycle, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function can handle graphs with cycles and graphs without cycles, including edge cases where the graph might have multiple components or nodes with the same in-degrees.
