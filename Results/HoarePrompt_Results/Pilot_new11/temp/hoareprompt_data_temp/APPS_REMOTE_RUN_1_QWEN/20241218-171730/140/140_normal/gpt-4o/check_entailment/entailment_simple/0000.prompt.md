You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges in the graph, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each vertex `u`, `graph[u]` includes `v` as an additional element, and the graph does not contain any cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex. The graph represents a directed graph with n vertices and m edges.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex; `u` is a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0, `node` is the last node dequeued from the queue, `in_degree` dictionary is updated such that each neighbor's in-degree has been decremented by the number of times they became 0.
    return count != n
    #`The program returns count != n where 'count' is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 and 'n' is the total number of nodes in the graph`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
