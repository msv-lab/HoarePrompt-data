`queue` appends the value of `neighbor` to its right end. The other variables (`count`, `node`, and `in_degree[neighbor]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`queue` includes the original elements plus `neighbor` on the right end, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the next node to be dequeued from the left side of the queue, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of the new `node`.**
