The code snippet appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `neighbor` is already included in the queue based on the initial state description, but this line ensures it is present.

- `node` remains the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.
- `queue` now contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element, plus the `neighbor` whose in-degree became 0.
- `count` is increased by 1.
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 from its original value.

Output State: **`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element and includes the neighbor whose in-degree became 0, `count` is increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 from its original value**
