`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1 for the specified neighbor. The values of the other variables (`node`, `queue`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the node that was dequeued, `queue` is the updated queue, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, and `count` is increased by the number of neighbors whose in_degree becomes 0.**
