Postcondition: ***`queue` includes the original elements plus `neighbor` on the right end, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the next node to be dequeued from the left side of the queue, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of the new `node`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0, then `neighbor` is dequeued and processed accordingly.***
