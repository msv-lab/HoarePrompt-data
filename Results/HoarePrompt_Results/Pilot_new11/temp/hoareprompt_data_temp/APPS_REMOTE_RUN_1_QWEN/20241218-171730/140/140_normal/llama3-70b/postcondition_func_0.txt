The function `func_1` takes a `node`, a `graph` represented as a dictionary, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack` as inputs. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal starting from the given `node`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function uses the `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes and the `rec_stack` list to detect cycles. If a node is encountered that is already in the recursion stack (`rec_stack`), a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`. If no cycle is detected and the DFS completes, the function returns `False`. This function can handle graphs with cycles and acyclic graphs.
