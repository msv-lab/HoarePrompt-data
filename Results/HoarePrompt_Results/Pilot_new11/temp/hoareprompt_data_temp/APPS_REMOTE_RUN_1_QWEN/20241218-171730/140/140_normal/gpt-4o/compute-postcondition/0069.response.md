Postcondition: ***`queue` is not empty, and it now includes the neighbor node if the in-degree of `neighbor` is 0. `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1. `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`. If the in-degree of `neighbor` is 0, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and `queue` includes the neighbor node. Otherwise, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 but `queue` does not include the neighbor node.***
