Postcondition: ***`node` is the node that was dequeued, `queue` is the updated queue, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, and `count` is increased by the number of neighbors whose in_degree becomes 0. This holds true whether `in_degree[neighbor]` was already 0 or not, as there is no else part that changes these conditions.***
