Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program uses an adjacency list representation (`graph`) to store the directed edges. It reads the input and constructs this list appropriately.

2. **Cycle Detection with DFS**: The program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. Specifically, it checks for cycles using a recursive function `func_1` which keeps track of visited nodes (`visited`) and nodes currently in the recursion stack (`rec_stack`). If a back edge is detected (i.e., a node is found in the recursion stack), it indicates a cycle.

3. **Cycle Removal Logic**: The program iterates through all nodes and attempts to detect cycles starting from each node. If a cycle is found, it checks if removing the edge that caused the cycle would make the graph acyclic. Since the problem allows removing at most one edge, the program stops after finding the first cycle and sets `has_cycle` to `True`.

4. **Output Determination**: Based on the value of `has_cycle`, the program outputs `YES` if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, otherwise it outputs `NO`.

The program handles all cases correctly as per the problem statement:
- It considers all directed edges.
- It correctly identifies cycles using DFS.
- It checks if removing the identified edge makes the graph acyclic.
- It outputs `YES` or `NO` based on the result of the above checks.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
