Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, none of the changes mentioned in the else part occur since there is no specific action described in the else section.***
