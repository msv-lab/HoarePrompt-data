The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `count` is now 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex; `u` is a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once; `queue` is a deque containing all vertices with an in-degree of 0; `count` is 0.**
