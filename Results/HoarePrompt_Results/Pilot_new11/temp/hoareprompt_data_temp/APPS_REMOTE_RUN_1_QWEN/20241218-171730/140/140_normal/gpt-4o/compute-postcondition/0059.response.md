The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the list `queue`. Based on the initial state, `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` is updated to include the neighbors whose in-degree has become 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. After executing this line of code, the `queue` will include the `neighbor`.

Output State: **`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` includes the neighbors whose in-degree has become 0 and also includes the `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
