Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If `visited[neighbor]` is `False`, the function returns `True` if either `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True` or `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`. If `visited[neighbor]` is `True`, no changes are made to the variables and the function returns `False`.***
