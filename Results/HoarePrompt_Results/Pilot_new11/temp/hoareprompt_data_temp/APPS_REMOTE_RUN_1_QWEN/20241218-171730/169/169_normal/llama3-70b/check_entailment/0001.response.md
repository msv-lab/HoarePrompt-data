Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the initial number of stones in the pile. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations but does not consider the initial number of stones.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
+-
```

The program's output would be:
```
1
```

However, the correct minimal possible number of stones after the operations should be `2` if we assume Vasya started with `1` stone initially. The sequence of operations is as follows:
1. Add 1 stone (pile size: 2)
2. Take 1 stone (pile size: 1)

Since the program does not consider the initial number of stones, it cannot provide the correct minimal possible number of stones for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
