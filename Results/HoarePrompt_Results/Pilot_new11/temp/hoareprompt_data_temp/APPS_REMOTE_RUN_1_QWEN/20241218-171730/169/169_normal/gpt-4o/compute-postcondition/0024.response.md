Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "-" and "+". It then iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each '+', it increments the counter `stones` by 1. For each '-', it decrements `stones` by 1. After processing all characters in `s`, it prints the final value of `stones`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations, such as invalid input types or lengths outside the specified range. However, since the function reads inputs directly from the user, it implicitly relies on valid input.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the user provides an input for `n` that is not within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), the function will still process the input string `s` up to the limit of `n` and may print an incorrect result if `n` is larger than the length of `s`.
- If the user provides an input for `s` that is shorter than `n`, the function will process all characters in `s` and ignore the remaining characters that do not exist.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no validation to ensure that the input `s` consists only of "-" and "+". If the user provides a string with other characters, the function will still process those characters, which could lead to unexpected results.
