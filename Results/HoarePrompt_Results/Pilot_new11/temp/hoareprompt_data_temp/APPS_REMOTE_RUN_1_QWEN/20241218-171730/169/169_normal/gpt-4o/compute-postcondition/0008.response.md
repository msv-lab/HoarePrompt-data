`stones` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and `stones - 1`. Since `stones` is initially 0, `stones - 1` would be -1. However, `max(0, -1)` returns 0. Therefore, `stones` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `operation`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-'**
