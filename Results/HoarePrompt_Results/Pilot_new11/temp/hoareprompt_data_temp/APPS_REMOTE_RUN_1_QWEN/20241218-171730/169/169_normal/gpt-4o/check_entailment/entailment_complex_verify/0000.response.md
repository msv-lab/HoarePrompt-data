Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. The annotated version further clarifies the state transitions within the program, which align with the problem description. Specifically, the program correctly handles the operations:
- Incrementing `stones` by 1 for each '+'.
- Decrementing `stones` by 1 for each '-', ensuring the pile never becomes empty.
- The use of `max(0, stones - 1)` ensures that the number of stones never goes below 0, which is consistent with the problem constraints. 

Given that the annotated version supports the correctness of the program and matches the requirements of the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
