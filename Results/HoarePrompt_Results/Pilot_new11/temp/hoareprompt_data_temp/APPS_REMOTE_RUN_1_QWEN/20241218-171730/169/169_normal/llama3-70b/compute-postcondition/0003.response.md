`s` is a string entered by the user; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`. The code counts the number of plus signs (`+`) in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `plus_count`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `minus_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`; `plus_count` is the number of plus signs in the string `s`.**
