Postcondition: ***`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`, `plus_count` is the number of plus signs in the string `s`. If the number of hyphens is greater than the number of plus signs, the function does not return anything (implying the value of `minus_count` remains unchanged). Otherwise, the value of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed.***
