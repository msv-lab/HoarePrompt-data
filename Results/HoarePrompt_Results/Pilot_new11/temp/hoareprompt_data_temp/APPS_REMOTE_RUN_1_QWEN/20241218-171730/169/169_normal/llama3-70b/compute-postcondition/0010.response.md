Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of '-' and '+' characters. It then counts the number of hyphens and plus signs in the string. If the number of hyphens is greater than the number of plus signs, the function does not return anything. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the number of plus signs and the number of hyphens. The function accepts no parameters and does not modify the input string \( s \). Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is 1, where the function will either print 0 (if the character is '-'), or 1 (if the character is '+'). The function also ensures that \( n \) is within the range 1 to 100.**
