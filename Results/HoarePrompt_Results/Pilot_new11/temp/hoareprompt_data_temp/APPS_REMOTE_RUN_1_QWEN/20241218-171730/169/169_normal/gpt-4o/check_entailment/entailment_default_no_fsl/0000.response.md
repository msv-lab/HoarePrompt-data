Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the string `s`, incrementing the `stones` count for each '+' and decrementing it for each '-', ensuring that the pile never becomes empty during the subtraction operations. The final value of `stones` after processing all operations is printed, which is the minimal possible number of stones in the pile. Since the code handles all described cases correctly and follows the problem description, the program is correct.
