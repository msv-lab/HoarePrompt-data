Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function then returns the result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. This means the function returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the GCD will be 1, and the result will be `a * b`, since \(1 * n // 1 = n\) for any integer `n`.
- If both `a` and `b` are the same, the GCD will be `a` (or `b`), and the result will be `a^2 // a = a`.
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `a * b // func_1(a, b)` would involve division by zero, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, leading to a division by the number when `a` or `b` is 0. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately to avoid errors.**
