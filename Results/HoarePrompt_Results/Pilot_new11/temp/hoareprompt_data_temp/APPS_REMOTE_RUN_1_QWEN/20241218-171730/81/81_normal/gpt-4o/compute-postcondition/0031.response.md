Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is 3, 4, 5, 3 + 3, 3 + 4, or `count + 4`, or `count + 5`; `i` is \(k + 2\); `a` is \((k + 2) * x\); `b` is \(\frac{y}{k + 2}\). If `a == b`, then `count` is 4, 3 + 3, or 3 + 4. Otherwise, `count` is 5, `count + 4`, or `count + 5`.***
