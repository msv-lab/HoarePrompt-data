Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where `y % x != 0`, which would indeed lead to incorrect results. However, upon reviewing the updated program, it includes a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to ensure `y % x == 0`. If this condition is not met, the function immediately returns 0. This ensures that the program does not proceed with invalid inputs, which aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior based on the output hints.

The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles the case where `y % x != 0` by returning 0. The revised code now explicitly checks for divisibility before performing the subsequent calculations, addressing the issue mentioned in the original assessment.

Therefore, the program is now correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
