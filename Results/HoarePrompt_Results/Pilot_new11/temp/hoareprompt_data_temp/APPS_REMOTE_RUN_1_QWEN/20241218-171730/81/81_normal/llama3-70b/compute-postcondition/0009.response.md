Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and both are greater than 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal (both become the GCD), and also ensures that `b` is always reduced until it reaches 0, making `a` the GCD. The function returns the computed GCD (`a`) and sets `b` to 0.**

This summary includes the core functionality of the function and covers all the potential cases mentioned in the code, ensuring that the postconditions are accurately described.
