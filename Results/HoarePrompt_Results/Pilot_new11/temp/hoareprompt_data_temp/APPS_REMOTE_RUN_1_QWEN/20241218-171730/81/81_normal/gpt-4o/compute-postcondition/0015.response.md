Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is either 1 or `count + 2` depending on the condition `a == b`; `b` is `z // i * x`; `a` is an integer such that `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y` if `a == b`, otherwise `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) != y` and the condition `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y` is satisfied.***
