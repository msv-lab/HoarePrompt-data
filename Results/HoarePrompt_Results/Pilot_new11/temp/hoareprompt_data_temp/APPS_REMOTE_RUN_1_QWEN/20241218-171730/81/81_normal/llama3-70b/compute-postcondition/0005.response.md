`a` and `b` are swapped such that `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is non-zero, `a % b` will be `0` because `a` is exactly divisible by `b`.

Therefore, after executing the code:

- `a` will be equal to `b`.
- `b` will be equal to `0` (since `a % b` is `0` when `a` is equal to `b`).

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `b` is 0**
