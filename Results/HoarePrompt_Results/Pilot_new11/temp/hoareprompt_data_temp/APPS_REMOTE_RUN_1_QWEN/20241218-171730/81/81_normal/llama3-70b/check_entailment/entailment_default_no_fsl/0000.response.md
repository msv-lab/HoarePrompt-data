Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is 0. According to the problem description, the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, which would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError` in the `func_2` function. Specifically, if `a` or `b` is 0, the `func_1` function will compute the GCD as 0, and `func_2` will attempt to perform a division by 0, resulting in an error. 

To fix this, the code needs to handle the case where either `a` or `b` is 0 by returning 0 immediately if either value is 0, since the LCM of any number and 0 is 0.
