The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, which are all integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to find pairs `(a, b)` such that \(a = i \times x\) and \(b = \frac{z}{i} \times x\) for each `i` in the range \(1 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor\), where \(z = \frac{y}{x}\), and both `a` and `b` satisfy the conditions \(l \leq a \leq r\) and \(l \leq b \leq r\). Additionally, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` must be `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD must equal `y`.

The function returns the count of such valid pairs `(a, b)`. If no valid pairs are found, the function also returns 0.
