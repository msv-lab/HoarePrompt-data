The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. An edge case to consider is when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function still correctly computes the GCD.
