You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to calculate \( f(i) \). Specifically, the logic to update the `dp` array does not ensure that all reachable positions within the interval \([0, m]\) are accurately counted.

For instance, consider the input \( m = 6, a = 4, b = 5 \). According to the problem description, the frog can reach the following positions:

- Starting at 0, the frog can reach 4 (by jumping +4).
- From 4, the frog can reach 9 (by jumping +5, but 9 is out of bounds, so it stays at 4).
- From 4, the frog can also reach -1 (by jumping -5, but -1 is out of bounds, so it stays at 4).

The correct values for \( f(i) \) for \( i = 0 \) to \( 6 \) should be:
- \( f(0) = 1 \) (only 0)
- \( f(1) = 1 \) (only 1)
- \( f(2) = 1 \) (only 2)
- \( f(3) = 1 \) (only 3)
- \( f(4) = 2 \) (0, 4)
- \( f(5) = 2 \) (1, 5)
- \( f(6) = 3 \) (2, 6, 0+4-5)

However, the provided program incorrectly calculates these values, leading to an incorrect sum. For example, for \( i = 4 \), the program incorrectly updates `dp[4]` and `dp[9]`, but since 9 is out of bounds, it should only update `dp[4]`.

Thus, the program does not handle the logic correctly for all cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes three integer inputs \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(m+1\) where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, starting with `dp[0] = 1`. After the for loop, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which indicates the total number of ways to reach any index up to `m` using the given operations. If `a > m` or `b > m`, the corresponding operations are not performed, and the initial `dp` values remain unchanged. If `b > m`, the subtraction operation is effectively ignored for indices less than `b`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
