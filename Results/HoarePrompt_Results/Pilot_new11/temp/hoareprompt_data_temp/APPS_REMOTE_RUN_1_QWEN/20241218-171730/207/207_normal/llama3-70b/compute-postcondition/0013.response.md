The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), the condition in the initial state does not affect this particular line of code because it does not involve `dp[i + a]`. Therefore, the value of `dp[i + a]` remains unchanged unless `i + a` equals 1, which is not specified here.

The only change made by the code is to `dp[i]`, which now holds the value of `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] + dp[i - b]`**.
