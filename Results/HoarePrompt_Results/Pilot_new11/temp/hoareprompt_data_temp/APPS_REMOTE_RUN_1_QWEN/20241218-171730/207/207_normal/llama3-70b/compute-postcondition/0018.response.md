The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and the condition `if i + a <= m` increments `dp[i + a]` by `dp[2]`, the value of `dp[i]` changes from its initial state. However, since `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. We know that `dp[i]` is now `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`**
