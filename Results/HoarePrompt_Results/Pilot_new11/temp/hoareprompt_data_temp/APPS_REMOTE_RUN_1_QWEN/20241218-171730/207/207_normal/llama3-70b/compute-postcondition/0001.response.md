The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `m + 1`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0**
