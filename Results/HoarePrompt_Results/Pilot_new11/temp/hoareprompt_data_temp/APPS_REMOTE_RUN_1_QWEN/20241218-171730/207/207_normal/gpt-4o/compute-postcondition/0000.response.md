The function `func_1(a, b)` is called with parameters `a` and `b`. However, the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `g`. We know that `g` will be assigned the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and the values of `m` and the initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
