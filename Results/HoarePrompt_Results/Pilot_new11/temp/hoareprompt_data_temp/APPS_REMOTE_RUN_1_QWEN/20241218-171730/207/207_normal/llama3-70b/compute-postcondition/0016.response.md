The code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` increments the value of `dp[i + a]` by the value of `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `dp[i + a]` will be incremented by `dp[2]`.

Since `a` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet, we can only express `dp[i + a]` in terms of `dp[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[2]`**
