Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the case when `k` is very large, specifically when `k` exceeds the total number of pupils in the class. The current implementation uses a simplified formula to calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions a pupil is asked, which does not accurately reflect the actual distribution of questions in such cases. The annotated version highlights that the program does not account for the number of complete cycles and the remaining questions after those cycles, leading to potential inaccuracies in the results. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
