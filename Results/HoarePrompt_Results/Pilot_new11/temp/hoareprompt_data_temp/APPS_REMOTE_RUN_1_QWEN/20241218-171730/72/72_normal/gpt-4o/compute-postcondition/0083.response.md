`row` is incremented by `direction`. The value of `remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged if the row is not equal to `x` or the column is not equal to `y`, otherwise `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `row` is increased by `direction`.
