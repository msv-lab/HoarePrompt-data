The code changes the value of `direction` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, or `row`. However, since the condition `row == n` was true before this line of code, it implies that `row` was already equal to `n`. Changing `direction` to `-1` will not alter this fact because the value of `row` itself is not being updated here.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if the row is equal to `x` and the column is equal to `y`, otherwise the state remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is equal to `n`; `direction` is `-1`.**
