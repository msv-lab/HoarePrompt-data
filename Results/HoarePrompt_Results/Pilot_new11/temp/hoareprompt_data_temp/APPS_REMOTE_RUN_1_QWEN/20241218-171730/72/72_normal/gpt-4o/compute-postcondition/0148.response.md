The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`max_questions`, `col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `row`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`max_questions` is decreased by 1, `col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `row` is 1 + `direction`, `direction` is 1**
