`y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was an integer between 1 and `m`. After decrementing by 1, the new value of `y` will be an integer between 0 and `m-1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`**
