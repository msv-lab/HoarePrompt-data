Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of questions asked to each pupil. Specifically, the code calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked and the number of times Sergei was asked using a simplified formula that does not accurately reflect the actual polling order.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Polling Order Calculation**: The polling order is more complex than the current implementation suggests. The teacher alternates between asking rows in ascending and descending order. This requires a more detailed calculation based on the position of `x` and `y` in the grid and the total number of questions `k`.

2. **Maximum and Minimum Calculations**: The current formulas for calculating the maximum and minimum number of questions asked do not account for the alternating nature of the polling order. For example, the maximum number of questions a pupil can be asked would depend on whether they are in the middle of a row or near the end, and the specific value of `k`.

3. **Sergei's Questions**: The calculation for how many times Sergei was asked is also incorrect. It assumes a linear progression without considering the alternating pattern of the polling order.

To correctly solve this problem, a more detailed simulation or mathematical approach is required to accurately determine the number of questions asked to each pupil based on their position and the total number of questions `k`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
