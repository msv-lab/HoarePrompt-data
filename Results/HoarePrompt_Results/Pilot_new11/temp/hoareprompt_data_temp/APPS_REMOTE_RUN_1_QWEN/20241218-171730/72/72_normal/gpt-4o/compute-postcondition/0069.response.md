To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Statement**: The given for loop is `for _ in range(remaining_questions):`. This loop runs from 0 to `remaining_questions - 1`.

2. **Identify Variables and Their Current States**: We need to know the current state of `remaining_questions` and how it changes during each iteration.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs from 0 to `remaining_questions - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since `_` is an underscore (a throwaway variable), we don't need to track its value. However, we need to ensure that `remaining_questions` is greater than 0 for the loop to run again.

Given the information that the loop has just completed an iteration, we know that `remaining_questions` was decremented by 1 during the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Since the problem doesn't provide the exact value of `remaining_questions` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only state the condition for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0**
