Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is very large, specifically when `k` is greater than the total number of pupils in the class. The current implementation calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions a pupil is asked using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` and `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, which may not accurately reflect the actual distribution of questions when `k` exceeds the number of pupils.

To illustrate, consider the following case:
- Input: `100 100 1000000000000000000 1 1`
- Expected output: The maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked would be 101010101010101 (since each row is asked twice, except the last one), the minimum number of questions would be 50505050505051, and Sergei would be asked 50505050505051 times.
- Actual output: The program might not produce the correct result due to the large value of `k`.

The correct approach should involve calculating the number of complete cycles and the remaining questions after those cycles. This way, the program can accurately determine the number of questions each pupil is asked.
