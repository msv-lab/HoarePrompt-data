Postcondition: ***`col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1. Depending on whether `row` equals `n`, either `max_questions` remains `max_questions - 1` and `row` is 5, or `row` is set to -1 and `direction` is set to -1. In both cases, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is adjusted accordingly.***
