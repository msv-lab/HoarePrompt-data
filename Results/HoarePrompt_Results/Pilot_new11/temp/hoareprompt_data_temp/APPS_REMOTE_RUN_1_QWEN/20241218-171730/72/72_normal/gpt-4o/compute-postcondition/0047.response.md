Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is either `prev_row - 3` (if `row == n`), `row` is the previous value of `row` plus `direction` (otherwise), `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`, `x` remains unchanged, and `direction` remains unchanged.***
