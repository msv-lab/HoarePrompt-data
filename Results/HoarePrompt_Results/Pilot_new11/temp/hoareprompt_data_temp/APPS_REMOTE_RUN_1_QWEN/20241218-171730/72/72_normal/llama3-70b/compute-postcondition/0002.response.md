The code `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` impacts the value of `min_asked`. Initially, `max_asked` is \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\). After the code executes, `min_asked` is set to the maximum of 1 and \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1)\).

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\), which is the initial value of `max_asked`.
2. Subtract \((n - 1)\) from `max_asked`.
3. Take the maximum of 1 and the result from step 2.

Since the exact value of `k` is not given, we can represent the calculation in terms of `k`, `n`, and `m`.

So, the new value of `min_asked` is \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `max_asked` is \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\), `min_asked` is \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))\)**
