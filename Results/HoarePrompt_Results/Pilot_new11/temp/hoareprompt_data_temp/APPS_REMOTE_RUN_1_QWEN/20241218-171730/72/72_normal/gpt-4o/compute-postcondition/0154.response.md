Postcondition: ***`col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` remains unchanged, and `row` is `direction + 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not present, the postcondition directly follows the `if` part. The `if` condition checks whether `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If true, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `row` is updated to `1 + direction`. Given the preconditions and the lack of an `else` part, these changes apply regardless of the outcome of the `if` condition.
