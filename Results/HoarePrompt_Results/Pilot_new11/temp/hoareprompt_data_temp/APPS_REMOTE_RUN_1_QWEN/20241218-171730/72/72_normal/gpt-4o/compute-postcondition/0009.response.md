The code `min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` calculates `min_questions` by performing integer division of `full_cycles` by `2 * n - 2`. Given the initial state, `full_cycles` is defined as `k // (2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1`, and since `n > 1` is true, this is the formula used.

Therefore, the calculation for `min_questions` is:

\[ \text{min\_questions} = \left(\frac{k}{2 * n - 2} * m\right) // (2 * n - 2) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{min\_questions} = \frac{k * m}{(2 * n - 2)^2} \]

Since we are dealing with integer division in Python, the exact value of `min_questions` depends on the values of `k`, `m`, and `n`. However, we can express it in terms of these values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is `k // (2 * n - 2) * m`, `max_questions` is `full_cycles`, and `min_questions` is `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`.**
