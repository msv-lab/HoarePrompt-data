Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum, minimum, and specific number of questions asked to a student. The annotations clearly show that the program maintains the correct states throughout its execution, handling both full cycles and remaining questions appropriately. The program correctly updates the counts for maximum, minimum, and Sergei's specific count of questions. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.
