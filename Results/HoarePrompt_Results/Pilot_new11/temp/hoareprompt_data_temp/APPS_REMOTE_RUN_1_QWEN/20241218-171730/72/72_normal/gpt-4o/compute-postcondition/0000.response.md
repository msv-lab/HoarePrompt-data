`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The original conditions for these variables are preserved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`.**
