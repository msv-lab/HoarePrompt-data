`max_questions` is incremented by 1, which means its value increases by 1. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `row`, `x`, `col`, `y`, `sergei_questions`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1.**
