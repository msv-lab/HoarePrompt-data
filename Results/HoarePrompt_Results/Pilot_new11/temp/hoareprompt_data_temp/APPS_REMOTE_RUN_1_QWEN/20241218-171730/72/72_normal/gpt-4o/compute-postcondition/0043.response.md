The code snippet `max_questions += 1` increments the value of `max_questions` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is either `n - 2` or `n` or increased by `direction` (if `row != -1`) or set to 1 (if `row == -1`), `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`, `x` remains unchanged, and `direction` remains unchanged.**
