The code sets the value of `direction` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `max_questions`, `row`, `x`, `y`, or `sergei_questions`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `direction`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `direction` is -1.**
