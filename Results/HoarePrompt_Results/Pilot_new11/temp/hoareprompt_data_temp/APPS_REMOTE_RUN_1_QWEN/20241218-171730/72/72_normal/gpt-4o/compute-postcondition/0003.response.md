The code calculates the value of `full_cycle_length` based on the condition involving `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value `(2 * n - 2) * m`. Otherwise, `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value of `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18
- `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`
- `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`

The variables `k`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the value of `full_cycle_length` depends on whether `n` is greater than 1:
- If `n > 1`, then `full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m`
- If `n <= 1`, then `full_cycle_length = m`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`; `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`; `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`.**
