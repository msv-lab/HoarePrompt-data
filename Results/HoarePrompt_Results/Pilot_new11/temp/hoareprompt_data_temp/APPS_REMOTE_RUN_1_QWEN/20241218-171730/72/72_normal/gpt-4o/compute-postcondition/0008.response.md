Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is `k // (2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `k // m`, `max_questions` is `full_cycles`, and the current value of `n` is greater than 1**
