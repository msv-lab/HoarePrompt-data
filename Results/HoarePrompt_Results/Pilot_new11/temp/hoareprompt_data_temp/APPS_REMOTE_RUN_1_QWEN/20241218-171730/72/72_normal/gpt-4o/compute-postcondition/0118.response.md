To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions given:

1. **`remaining_questions`**: This variable determines how many iterations the loop can execute. At the end of the previous iteration, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, meaning there are still questions left to process.

2. **`col`**: The current column index is `m - 1`.

3. **`m`**: The value of `m` is greater than 0.

4. **`sergei_questions`**: This variable keeps track of the number of times a specific condition is met during the loop execution.

5. **`max_questions`**: This variable stores the maximum value that `sergei_questions` has reached during the loop execution.

6. **`direction`**: This variable can either be 1 or -1, indicating the direction of movement in the grid (up or down).

7. **`row`**: The current row index depends on `direction`:
   - If `direction == 1`, then `row = row_initial - 2*m`.
   - If `direction == -1`, then `row = row_initial + 2*m - 2`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. For this to happen, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, as it is the primary condition determining the number of loop iterations.

Since `remaining_questions` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs adjustment is to decrement `remaining_questions` by 1 to allow for another iteration.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:
- `remaining_questions` should be decreased by 1.
- All other states remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop condition itself.

So, the new state is:
State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is the number of times the condition `row == x and col == y` is met, `max_questions` is the maximum value it reached during the loop execution, `direction` is either 1 or -1 depending on its last update, `row` is either `row_initial - 2*m` (if `direction == 1`) or `row_initial + 2*m - 2` (if `direction == -1`)**.
