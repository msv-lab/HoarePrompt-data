Postcondition: **`col` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1 and the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `row` is set to `n - 3` if `row == n`. Otherwise, `row` is either 0 or 1, `col` is not equal to `y`, `max_questions` is decremented by 1, and `direction` is 1 if `row` is 1, otherwise `row` is incremented by `direction`.**
