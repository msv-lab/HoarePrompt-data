Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided program, it appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum, minimum, and specific number of questions asked to a student based on the given problem description. The program handles the direction changes in the polling order and calculates the number of questions for each student accurately. The implementation considers both the full cycles and the remaining questions after the full cycles, which is crucial for calculating the exact number of questions for each student. The logic for determining the position of Sergei and updating the counts for maximum and minimum questions also seems correct. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program should work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
