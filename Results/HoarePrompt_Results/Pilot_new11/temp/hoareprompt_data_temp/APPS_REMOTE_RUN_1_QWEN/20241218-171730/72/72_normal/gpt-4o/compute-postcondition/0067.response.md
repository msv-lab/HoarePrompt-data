Postcondition: ***`sergei_questions` is incremented by 3, `max_questions` either increases by 1 or decreases by 1, and `col` is incremented by 3. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `col` is incremented by 1, with `row` adjusted as specified. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `col` is incremented by 1, with `row` incremented by 2 if `row == -1`. Otherwise, the values of `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `col`, and `row` remain as they were after the initial increments/decrements.***
