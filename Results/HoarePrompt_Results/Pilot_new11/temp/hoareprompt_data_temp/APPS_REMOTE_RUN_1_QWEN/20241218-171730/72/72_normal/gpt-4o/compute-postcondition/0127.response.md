The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect the values of `col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, or `row` directly. However, the value of `row` was previously updated to `row + direction`, which means `row` was incremented (or decremented) by the previous value of `direction`.

Given that the initial value of `row` was `n`, and now `direction` is `-1`, the value of `row` is now `n - 1`.

The states of the other variables (`col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`, `row` is `n - 1`**
