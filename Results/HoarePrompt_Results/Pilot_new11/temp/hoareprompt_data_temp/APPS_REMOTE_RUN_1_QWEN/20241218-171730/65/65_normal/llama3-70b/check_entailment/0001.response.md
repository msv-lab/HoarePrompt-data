Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if Kefa can distribute all the balloons such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. It counts the occurrences of each color using a dictionary and then checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. This ensures that each friend can receive at most one balloon of the most common color without any friend getting two balloons of the same color. Since the program handles all described cases correctly, it meets the problem requirements.
