Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with one less character than before, and `color_count` is a dictionary. If `c` is already a key in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1. If `c` is not a key in `color_count`, it is added with a count of 1.***
