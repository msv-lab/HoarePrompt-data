Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string input from the user, and `color_count` is a dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is either `color_count[color] + 1` if `color` is already in `color_count`, or 1 if `color` is not in `color_count`. `color` must be one of the characters in the string `s`.***
