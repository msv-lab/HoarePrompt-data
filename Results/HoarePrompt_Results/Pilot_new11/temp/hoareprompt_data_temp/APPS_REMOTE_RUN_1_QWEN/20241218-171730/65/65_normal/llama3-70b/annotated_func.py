#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (possibly empty), `color_count` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in the string `s`.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (possibly empty), `color_count` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in the string `s`, `max_color_count` is the maximum value among the counts of characters in `s`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 100), `k` (a positive integer between 1 and 100), and `s` (a string of lowercase Latin letters). The function processes the string `s` to count the occurrences of each character and determine if the maximum count of any character in the string is less than or equal to `k`.

After processing the string, the function checks the following:
1. If `n` and `k` are outside the range 1 to 100, it should raise an error, but the provided code does not handle this case. Therefore, the function implicitly assumes that `n` and `k` are valid.
2. It calculates the maximum count of any character in the string `s`.
3. If the maximum count is less than or equal to `k`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input string `s` is empty, the function still correctly identifies that no character count exceeds `k` (since the maximum count would be 0, which is always less than or equal to `k`).

Missing functionality:
- The function does not validate whether `n` and `k` are within the specified range 1 to 100. If `n` or `k` are outside this range, the function does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
