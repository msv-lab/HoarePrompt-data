The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 100), `k` (a positive integer between 1 and 100), and `s` (a string of lowercase Latin letters). The function processes the string `s` to count the occurrences of each character and determine if the maximum count of any character in the string is less than or equal to `k`.

After processing the string, the function checks the following:
1. If `n` and `k` are outside the range 1 to 100, it should raise an error, but the provided code does not handle this case. Therefore, the function implicitly assumes that `n` and `k` are valid.
2. It calculates the maximum count of any character in the string `s`.
3. If the maximum count is less than or equal to `k`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input string `s` is empty, the function still correctly identifies that no character count exceeds `k` (since the maximum count would be 0, which is always less than or equal to `k`).

Missing functionality:
- The function does not validate whether `n` and `k` are within the specified range 1 to 100. If `n` or `k` are outside this range, the function does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
