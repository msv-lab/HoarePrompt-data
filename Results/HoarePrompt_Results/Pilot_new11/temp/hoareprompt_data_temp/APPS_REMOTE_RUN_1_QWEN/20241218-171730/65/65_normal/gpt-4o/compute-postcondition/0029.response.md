The code sets `can_distribute` to `False`, which was already its initial value. Therefore, the only change is that `can_distribute` is explicitly set to `False`. The value of `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is an integer from `color_count.values()`, and `can_distribute` is `False`**
