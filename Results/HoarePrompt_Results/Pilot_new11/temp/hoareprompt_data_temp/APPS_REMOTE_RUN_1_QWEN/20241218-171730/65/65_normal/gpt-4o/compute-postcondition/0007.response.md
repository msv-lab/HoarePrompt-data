`color_count` is an empty dictionary before the code runs. After the code `color_count[color] = 1` runs, `color_count` will have the key `color` with the value `1`. The value of `color` is one of the characters in the string `s`, and since `color` was not previously in `color_count`, the dictionary now contains this new key-value pair. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `color`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string input from the user, `color_count` is a dictionary containing `{color: 1}`, `color` is one of the characters in the string `s`**
