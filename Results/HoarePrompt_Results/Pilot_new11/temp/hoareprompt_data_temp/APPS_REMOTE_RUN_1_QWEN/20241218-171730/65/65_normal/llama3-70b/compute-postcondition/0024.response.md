The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons. 

Case_1: If `n` and `k` do not satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` and `k` must be within the specified range.
Case_2: The function returns a value based on the string `s` and the integers `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to 100, and `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters. Depending on the constraints and the string `s`, the function returns a specific value or an error message.
