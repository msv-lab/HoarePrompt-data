Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string input from the user, and `color_count` is a dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is either incremented by 1 if `color` is already in `color_count`, or set to 1 if `color` is not in `color_count`. The next character in `s` must be a valid color.***
