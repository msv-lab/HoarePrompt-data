You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (possibly empty), `color_count` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in the string `s`.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (possibly empty), `color_count` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in the string `s`, `max_color_count` is the maximum value among the counts of characters in `s`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
