The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is not provided in this context, the values of `n` and `k` will be specific integers within the range 1 to 100, and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons.**
