Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the program appears to work correctly based on the problem description and the given examples, the original assessment overlooked a critical aspect: the program does not validate whether the values of `n` and `k` are within the specified range of 1 to 100. As mentioned in the potential edge cases of the annotated code, if `n` or `k` are outside this range, the program does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this oversight. The program is not fully correct according to the problem description because it fails to check the constraints on `n` and `k`.
