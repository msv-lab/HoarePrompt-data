Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of balloons `n` and the number of friends `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.

2. **Color Counting**:
   - A dictionary `color_count` is used to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`.
   - The for loop iterates over each character in `s`, updating the count in `color_count`.

3. **Distributing Balloons**:
   - After counting the colors, the program checks if there is any color with a count greater than `k`.
   - If any color count exceeds `k`, the variable `can_distribute` is set to `False`.
   - If no color count exceeds `k`, `can_distribute` remains `True`.

4. **Output**:
   - Based on the value of `can_distribute`, the program prints either "YES" or "NO".

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no friend gets more than one balloon of the same color. This matches the problem description perfectly. Specifically:

- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\).
- It ensures that if a color count exceeds `k`, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`, indicating that the distribution is not possible.
- If all color counts are within the limit, it prints "YES", and otherwise prints "NO".

Therefore, the program always follows the requirements specified in the problem description.
