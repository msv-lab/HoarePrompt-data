Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose numbers in such a way that the game is fair. The code assumes that there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. However, this assumption is too restrictive. The correct approach would be to check if there are any two distinct integers such that their counts sum up to \( n \) and both counts are non-zero.

Here is an example where the code fails:

- Input:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  2
  2
  3
  3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  1 2
  ```

In this case, the code incorrectly determines that the game is fair by choosing numbers 1 and 2, but it should determine that the game is not fair because no two distinct integers can be chosen such that their counts sum up to 6.

To fix this, the code should check all pairs of distinct integers and verify if their counts sum up to \( n \). Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    for i in d:
        for j in d:
            if i != j and d[i] + d[j] == n:
                print('YES')
                print(i, j)
                return
    print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected code checks all pairs of distinct integers and ensures that the counts of the chosen integers sum up to \( n \), thus correctly determining whether the game is fair.
