You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input

10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no two distinct numbers appear exactly `n//2` times. This is evident in the third example provided:

- Input:
```
6
10
20
30
20
10
20
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
10 20
```

This happens because the program checks if there exists a number that appears exactly `n//2` times and considers it valid if found, without ensuring that the other number also appears exactly `n//2` times. Therefore, it fails to correctly identify cases where no such pair of numbers exists, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even number and is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each integer a_i is written on a card and is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of length `n` containing integers entered via input(), `i` is `n`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the last element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `total` is undefined, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `i` is the last integer checked in the dictionary, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or the second integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `i` is the last integer checked in the dictionary, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or the second integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`. If both `a1` and `a2` are not equal to -1, then both `a1` and `a2` are printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
