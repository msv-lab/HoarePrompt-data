The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. However, based on the problem description, the function seems to operate on a sequence of integers read from input. The functionality involves processing a sequence of `n` integers, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, and each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Given the lack of a return statement in the provided function definition, we can infer that the function might print or process the sequence of integers in some way, but since the problem specifies the output, we should focus on that.

Output: Case_1: The function processes a sequence of `n` integers, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, and each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Case_2: Based on the provided output cases, the function does not return any value but instead produces an output based on the sequence of integers.

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of `n` integers, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, and each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
