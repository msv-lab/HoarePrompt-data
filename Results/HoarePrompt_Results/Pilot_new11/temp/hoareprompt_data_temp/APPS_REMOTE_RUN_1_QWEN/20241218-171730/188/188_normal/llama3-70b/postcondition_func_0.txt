The function processes a sequence of \( n \) integers, where \( n \) is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, and each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It constructs a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the sequence. Then, it checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If such integers exist, the function prints 'YES' followed by these two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases such as when \( n \) is even and no integers appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times.
