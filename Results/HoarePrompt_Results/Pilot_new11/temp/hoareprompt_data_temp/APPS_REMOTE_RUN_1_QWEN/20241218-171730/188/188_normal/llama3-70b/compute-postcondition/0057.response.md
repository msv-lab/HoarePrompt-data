Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `i` is the last integer checked in the dictionary, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or the second integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`. If both `a1` and `a2` are not equal to -1, then both `a1` and `a2` are printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.***
