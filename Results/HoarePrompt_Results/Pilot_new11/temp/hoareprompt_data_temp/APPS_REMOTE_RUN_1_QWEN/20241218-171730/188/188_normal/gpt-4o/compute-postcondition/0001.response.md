The code creates a list `cards` by taking `n` inputs and converting them to integers. Each input corresponds to an integer between 1 and 100, as specified. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but it is now known to be an integer between 2 and 100. All elements of the `cards` list are the integer inputs provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
