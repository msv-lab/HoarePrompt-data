Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each unique number using `Counter` and then checking if there are at least two unique numbers that each occur exactly `n // 2` times. However, this logic is flawed.

Consider the following input:
```
Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

According to the problem description, a fair game is possible if there are at least two different numbers and each can be chosen by Petya and Vasya respectively to take exactly `n // 2` cards. In this case, both `1` and `2` appear twice, which should allow a fair game where Petya and Vasya can each take 3 cards.

However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this input because it checks if the last two unique numbers have counts of `n // 2`. Since `3` is the last unique number and its count is also `3`, the condition `count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2` fails.

To fix this, the program should check if any two unique numbers have counts of `n // 2` without relying on their positions in the sorted list. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = list(count.keys())
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        for num1 in unique_numbers:
            for num2 in unique_numbers:
                if num1 != num2 and count[num1] == n // 2 and count[num2] == n // 2:
                    print('YES')
                    print(num1, num2)
                    return
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of unique numbers to check if they can form a fair game, thus ensuring the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
