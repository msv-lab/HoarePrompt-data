State before the loop starts: `n` is an even number and is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an empty list.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the `for` loop and the conditions under which the loop will start executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter in the `range(n)` function.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to a value that fits within the range defined by `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` is given as an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - The loop will start if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` is even and between 2 and 100, it will always be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is initially empty.
   - The state of the list `a` does not affect the execution of the loop directly since the loop only uses the `range(n)` construct and initializes `i` from 0 up to `n-1`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, the loop will start executing as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (which it is). Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`, which should start at 0.

### Final State:

State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 0, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an empty list**

Note: The value of `total` is not relevant to the loop execution and remains undefined.
