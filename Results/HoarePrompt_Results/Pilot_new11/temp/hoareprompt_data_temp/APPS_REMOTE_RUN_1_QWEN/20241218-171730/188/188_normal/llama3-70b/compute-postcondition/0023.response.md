Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is already a key in `d`, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added as a key in `d` with the value of 1. `total` is undefined, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.**
