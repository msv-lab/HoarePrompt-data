Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) (the number of cards) and a sequence of \( n \) integers, each representing a card's value. This is done using the `input()` function and storing the values in a list `a`.

2. **Dictionary Construction**: The program constructs a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This ensures that we can easily check how many times each number appears.

3. **Fair Game Condition Check**: The program checks if there are exactly two distinct integers in the list that each appear \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If such integers exist, it prints "YES" followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition that \( n \) is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - If no integers appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - The program does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., not an integer, not of the expected format) because the problem statement specifies that the input will be valid.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" followed by the two integers if the game can be fair, or "NO" otherwise, which matches the problem description’s output format.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
