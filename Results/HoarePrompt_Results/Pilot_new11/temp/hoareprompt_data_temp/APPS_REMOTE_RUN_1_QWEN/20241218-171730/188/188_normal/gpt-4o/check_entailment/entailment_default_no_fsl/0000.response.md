Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple unique numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. According to the problem description, the game is fair if Petya and Vasya can choose two different numbers such that each player ends up with exactly `n // 2` cards. However, the current implementation only checks if the last two unique numbers in the sorted list appear exactly `n // 2` times, which may not cover all valid cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the unique numbers are 1, 2, and 3, each appearing exactly 3 times (`n // 2`). The code should identify this and print "YES" with any pair of these numbers, but it incorrectly prints "NO" because it only checks the last two unique numbers.

To fix this, the code should check all pairs of unique numbers to see if they both appear exactly `n // 2` times. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the code that handles this correctly:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])

    for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
            if count[unique_numbers[i]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[j]] == n // 2:
                print("YES")
                print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                return
    print("NO")

func()
```

This version iterates through all pairs of unique numbers and checks if they both appear exactly `n // 2` times, ensuring that all possible valid cases are covered.
