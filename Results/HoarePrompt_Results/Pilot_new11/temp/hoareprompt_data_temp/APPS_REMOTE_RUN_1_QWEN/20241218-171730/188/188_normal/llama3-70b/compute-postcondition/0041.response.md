The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the current context. In this case, since `i` is now `i + 1`, and assuming the code was inside a loop or conditional statement where `i` was being incremented, the loop or context is exited. However, the values of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `c`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` and `a2` are as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
