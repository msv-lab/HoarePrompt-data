`count` is assigned the value of a `Counter` object which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `cards`. The `Counter` object is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. Each key is an integer from the list `cards`, and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `count` is a Counter object where each key is an integer from the list `cards` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `cards`.**
