Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- `total` is undefined.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `a` contains an integer entered via input().

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `a` is an integer input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, `i` must still be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `total` remains undefined as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is determined by the condition `n` being an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is only defined once before the loop starts.

### Updated State:
- `total` is undefined.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `a` contains an integer entered via input().

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 1, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` contains an integer entered via input()**
