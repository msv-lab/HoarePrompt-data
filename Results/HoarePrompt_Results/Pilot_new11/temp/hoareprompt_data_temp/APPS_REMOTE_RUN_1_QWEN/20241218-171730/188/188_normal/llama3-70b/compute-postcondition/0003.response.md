`a.append(int(input()))` appends the value entered via `input()` to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the integer input, `a` will contain one element which is the integer entered. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `total` is also undefined since no operation has been performed on it. The value of `i` remains 0 as no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `i` is 0, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` contains an integer entered via input()**
