The code `a1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `a1`. The previous value of `i` was `i_old` (denoted by `a2`). Thus, `a1` now holds the current value of `i`, which is `i_old + 1` (since `i` was previously `i_old + 1`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_old + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is `i_old + 1`, `a2` is as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
