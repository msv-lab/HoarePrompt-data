The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is derived from other parameters `a`, `b`, and `n` where `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The function returns the result of \((a // x + b // x)\), which is greater than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept an integer `x` and return \((a // x + b // x)\) which is greater than or equal to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, and returns \((a // x + b // x)\) which is greater than or equal to `n`.**
