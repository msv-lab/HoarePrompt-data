Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise `can_distribute(mid)` returns False, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`**
