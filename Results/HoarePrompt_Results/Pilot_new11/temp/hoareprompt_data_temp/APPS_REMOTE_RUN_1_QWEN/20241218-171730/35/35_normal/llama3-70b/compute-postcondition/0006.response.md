`x` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and that `a` ≥ `x`, `b` ≥ `x`, and `(a - x + (b - x)) ≥ x` are met. Since `x` is decremented by 1, the new value of `x` will still meet the condition that it is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, as well as the other conditions. Therefore, the new value of `x` is `x - 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer with 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer with 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` and `x` is decreased by 1, and the conditions `a` ≥ `x`, `b` ≥ `x`, and `(a - x + (b - x)) ≥ x` are met.**
