The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`, and `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`.

After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `low` minus 1. However, since no variable `low` is mentioned in the given information, we infer that the function should return `low - 1` where `low` is presumably defined within the function's logic.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and return the value of `low` minus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and returns the value of `low` minus 1.**
