The code `x = min(n, a, b)` assigns the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` to `x`. Given the initial state and the constraints, `n`, `a`, and `b` are all within their specified ranges, and `x` is now the minimum of these three values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, and `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
