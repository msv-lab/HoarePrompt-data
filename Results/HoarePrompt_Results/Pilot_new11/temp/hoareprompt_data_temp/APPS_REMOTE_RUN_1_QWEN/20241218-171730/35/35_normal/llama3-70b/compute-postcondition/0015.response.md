To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and understand its behavior based on the conditions given.

### Initial Conditions
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).
- `a` and `b` are integers with \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\).
- `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
\[ a \geq x \]
\[ b \geq x \]
\[ a - x + (b - x) \geq x \]

This simplifies to:
\[ a \geq x \]
\[ b \geq x \]
\[ a + b \geq 3x \]

### Analysis
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `x` is initialized to the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The loop checks the conditions. If the conditions are met, the loop breaks.
   - If the conditions are not met, `x` is decreased by 1 and the loop continues.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Each iteration decreases `x` by 1 and re-evaluates the conditions.
   - The loop will continue until one of the conditions fails, i.e., \(a < x\), \(b < x\), or \(a + b < 3x\).

3. **Final Value of `x`:**
   - The loop terminates when \(a < x\), \(b < x\), or \(a + b < 3x\).
   - Since `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, the loop will eventually reduce `x` until one of these conditions is met.

4. **Conditions at Termination:**
   - If \(a < x\), \(b < x\), or \(a + b < 3x\) at the start, the loop does not execute and `x` remains the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If the loop does execute, it will continue decreasing `x` until one of the conditions fails.

### Conclusion
After the loop has executed, `x` will be the largest value that satisfies all the conditions \(a \geq x\), \(b \geq x\), and \(a + b \geq 3x\). If no such `x` exists (i.e., \(a < x\), \(b < x\), or \(a + b < 3x\)), then `x` remains the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Output State
The final state of the variables after the loop has executed is:
- `x` is the largest value that satisfies \(a \geq x\), \(b \geq x\), and \(a + b \geq 3x\), or it remains the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` if no such value exists.
- `a` and `b` retain their original values.
- `n` retains its original value.

Thus, the output state is:
**Output State: **`x` is the largest value that satisfies \(a \geq x\), \(b \geq x\), and \(a + b \geq 3x\), or it remains the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` if no such value exists; `a` and `b` retain their original values; `n` retains its original value.**
