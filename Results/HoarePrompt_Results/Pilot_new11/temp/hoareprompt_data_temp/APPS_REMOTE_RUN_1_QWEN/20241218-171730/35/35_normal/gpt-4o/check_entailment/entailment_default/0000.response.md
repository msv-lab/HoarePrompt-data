Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. The issue lies in the way the binary search is used in `func_1` and the distribution check in `can_distribute`.

1. **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for the binary search is set between 1 and the minimum of \( a \) and \( b \) plus one. This is too restrictive because it assumes that the solution will always be within this range, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the case where \( n = 4 \), \( a = 10 \), and \( b = 3 \). The correct answer should be 2, but the binary search range is limited to 4 (the minimum of 10 and 3 plus one), which does not capture the possibility of a higher solution.

2. **Distribution Check**: The `can_distribute` function checks if the sum of the integer divisions of \( a \) and \( b \) by \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( n \). This works correctly for ensuring that the pieces can be distributed, but it does not account for the scenario where the pieces can be distributed with a higher minimum value of \( x \).

To fix this, the binary search range should be between 1 and the total number of pieces \( a + b \), and the check should ensure that the distribution can be done with the minimum number of pieces per plate being at least \( x \). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, a + b)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return (a + 1) // x + (b + 1) // x >= n + 1

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))
```

In this corrected version:
- The binary search range is now between 1 and \( a + b \).
- The `can_distribute` function checks if the distribution can be done with a minimum of \( x \) pieces per plate by considering the ceiling division of \( a \) and \( b \) by \( x \).

This ensures that the code correctly finds the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake.
