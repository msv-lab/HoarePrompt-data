Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; `low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is the maximum value of `low` and `high` when the loop terminates.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `low < high`.
- Each iteration of the loop updates either `low` or `high` based on the result of `can_distribute(mid)`.
- Eventually, the loop will terminate when `low` equals `high`.
- At the termination, `mid` will be the last value calculated using `(low + high) // 2`.
- Since `low` equals `high`, `high` will also be this value.
- The final values of `low` and `high` represent the point at which `can_distribute(mid)` transitions from being `False` to `True` (or vice versa), ensuring that `can_distribute(high)` (or `can_distribute(low)`) returns the correct boolean value indicating whether `n` can be distributed starting from this midpoint.
