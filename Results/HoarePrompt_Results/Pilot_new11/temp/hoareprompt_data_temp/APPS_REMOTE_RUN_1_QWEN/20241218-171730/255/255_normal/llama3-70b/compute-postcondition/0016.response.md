Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then counts the number of transitions (changes) between consecutive characters in the string `s`. A transition is defined as a change in character from one position to the next. If the string starts with a transition (i.e., the first and second characters are different), it is counted as well. The function prints the total count of these transitions.**

This summary includes the following key points:
- The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` as inputs.
- The string `s` is of length `n`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).
- The function counts transitions between consecutive characters in `s`.
- Transitions include changes between the first and second characters as well as between any other consecutive characters.
- The function prints the total count of transitions.

Edge cases and missing functionality considered:
- The function correctly handles the case where the string starts with a transition.
- There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
