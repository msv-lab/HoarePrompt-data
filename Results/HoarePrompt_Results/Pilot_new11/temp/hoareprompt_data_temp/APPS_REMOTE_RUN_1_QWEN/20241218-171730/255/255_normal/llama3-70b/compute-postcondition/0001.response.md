The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it was defined before this line of code and only represents the expected length of the string `s`. The output state should reflect that `n` retains its original value, and `s` now holds the newly input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input value (1 <= n <= 500), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters**
