Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings where all characters are the same. However, the current implementation only counts the number of transitions between different characters, which does not account for removing substrings of the same character.

For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The current code would output 4 (one transition between each pair of adjacent characters), but the correct answer should be 1 (removing the entire substring "aaaaa").

Similarly, for the string "abaca", the current code outputs 3 (transitions at positions 2, 4, and 5), but the correct answer should be 3 operations: remove "b", then "aca".

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
