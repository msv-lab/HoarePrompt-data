Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It calculates and prints the number of transitions in the string `s`, where a transition is defined as a character at index `i` (for `i` in range 1 to `n-1`) being different from the previous character `s[i-1]`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the total number of transitions found in the string `s`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the string `s` consists of only one unique character repeated throughout, there will be no transitions, and the function will output `0`.
- If the string `s` starts with a different character than the rest of the string, the first comparison in the loop (at `i=1`) will count as a transition even though the string might have consecutive identical characters later.
- The function assumes valid inputs where `n` is within the specified range and `s` is a string of the correct length and containing only lowercase Latin letters. If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior is undefined.
