The code initializes `ans` to 1. The value of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is updated to 1, while `n` and `s` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input value (1 <= n <= 500), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 1**
