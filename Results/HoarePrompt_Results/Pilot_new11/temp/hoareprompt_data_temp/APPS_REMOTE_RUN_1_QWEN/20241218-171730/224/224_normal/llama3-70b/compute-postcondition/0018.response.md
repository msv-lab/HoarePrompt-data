According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `f_max_n` down to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j] % MOD`, and `dp[j - 1]` retains its original value.

To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **Identify the current value of `j`**: Since the loop is in reverse order, the current `j` value at the end of the previous iteration would be 1 if `f_max_n` was greater than or equal to 2. However, without knowing the exact initial value of `j`, we assume the loop just started with `j = f_max_n` and is now moving towards 1.

2. **Determine the new value of `j`**: The loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration. Therefore, if `j` was at `f_max_n` before the first iteration, it will now be `f_max_n - 1`.

3. **Adjust `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`**: Since the loop just finished updating `dp[j]` to include the value of `dp[j] % MOD`, for the next iteration, `dp[j]` should retain its updated value (which is `dp[j] % MOD`). Meanwhile, `dp[j - 1]` will now need to be updated similarly.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j] % MOD`.
- `dp[j - 1]` retains its original value but will be updated in the next iteration to include the value of `dp[j - 1] % MOD`.

Since the loop is reversing from `f_max_n` to 1, and assuming `f_max_n` is greater than 1, the next `j` value will be `f_max_n - 1`.

State: **`dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to include the value of `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value**
