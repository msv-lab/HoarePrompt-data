According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `f_max_n` to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `f_max_n` must be at least 2
- `dp[j]` is the remainder of its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]` divided by `MOD`

To determine the states needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to identify what values of `j` are allowed to enter the loop and what changes occur within the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just finished with some value of `j`. Since the loop iterates in reverse order, the next value of `j` would be the current `j` minus 1. Given that the loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to 1, the next `j` must be `f_max_n - 1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `f_max_n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `dp[j]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[j - 1]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `dp[j]` is the remainder of its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]` divided by `MOD`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
