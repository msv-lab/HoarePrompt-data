The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments the value of `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. According to the initial state, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to include the value of `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, which means `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is now equal to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`. The value of `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value. The variable `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value, but the operation is performed for `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`.

After the operation, `dp[j]` is updated, and `dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged. The value of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is adjusted to be `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**
