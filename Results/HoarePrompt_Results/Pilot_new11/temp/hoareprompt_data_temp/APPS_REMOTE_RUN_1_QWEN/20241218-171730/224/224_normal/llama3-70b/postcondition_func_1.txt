The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and iterates through the range [1, n + 1]. For each integer `i` in this range, it computes `func_1(res, i)` where `res` starts at 0 and is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the result of `func_1(res, i)`. After completing the iteration, the function returns the maximum value obtained during these computations. This means that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the highest value produced by applying `func_1(res, i)` for every `i` in the specified range. Potential edge cases include the minimum allowed value of `n` (2), as well as the maximum allowed value (10^6). If `n` is less than 2, the function should still start with `res = 0` and iterate from 1 up to the given `n`, ensuring that the computation is performed correctly even for the smallest valid input.
