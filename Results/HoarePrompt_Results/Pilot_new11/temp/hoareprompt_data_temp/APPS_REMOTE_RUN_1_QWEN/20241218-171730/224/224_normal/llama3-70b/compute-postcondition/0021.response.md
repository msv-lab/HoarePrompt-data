Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`.
   - `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value.
   - `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.

2. **Identify the Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analyze the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `f_max_n` and decrements `j` until `j` reaches `1`.
   - During each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[j-1]`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `2` (since `dp[f_max_n - 1]` and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` were already updated).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `1`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `dp[j]` for `j` from `f_max_n - 2` down to `2` would have been updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.
   - The state `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is already updated.
   - `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `dp[1]` will be updated next, so it is not yet known what its value is.
   - All other `dp[j]` values from `2` to `f_max_n - 2` have been updated.
   - `dp[f_max_n - 1]` has been updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value, `dp[1]` is updated to `(dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`**
