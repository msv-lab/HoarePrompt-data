Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- The variable `i` should start at 1.
- The variable `n` must be at least 2.

The for loop statement is:
```
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the `range` function**: 
   - The `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `f_max_n` and going down to 1 (since the loop stops at 0, but does not include 0).
   - For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be a positive integer because the loop starts from `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Initial conditions**:
   - We know that `i` should start at 1.
   - We know that `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Loop requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to 0.
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, we can infer that `f_max_n` should be at least 2 to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.

4. **State adjustments**:
   - We need to adjust `f_max_n` to be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.
   - We do not need to adjust `i` or `n` further since they already meet their respective initial conditions.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2**

This ensures that the loop condition `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)` will generate a valid sequence of numbers for the loop to iterate over.
