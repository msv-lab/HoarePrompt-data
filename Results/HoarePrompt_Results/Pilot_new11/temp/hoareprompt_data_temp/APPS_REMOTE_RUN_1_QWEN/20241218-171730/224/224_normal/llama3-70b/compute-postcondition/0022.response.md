The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. 

- `dp[f_max_n - 1]` was previously updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`.
- `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value.
- `dp[1]` was updated to `(dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.

Since the code snippet does not specify the exact value of `j`, we consider the general case where `j` is within the bounds of the array `dp` and is not equal to `f_max_n - 1` (since that index is already handled) or `0` (as there is no `dp[-1]`). For the sake of this example, let's assume `j` is a valid index between `0` and `f_max_n - 2` (inclusive).

The impact of the code on `dp[j]` is that it is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`. The values of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` remain unchanged, and `dp[1]` remains updated to `(dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value, `dp[1]` is updated to `(dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`, and for all other indices `j` in the range `[0, f_max_n - 2]`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.**
