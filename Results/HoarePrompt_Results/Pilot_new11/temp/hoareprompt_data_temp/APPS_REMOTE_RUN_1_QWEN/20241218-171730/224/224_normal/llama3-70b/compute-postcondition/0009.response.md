`dp[j]` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[j]` was `dp[j]` plus `dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`, and now it is further reduced modulo `MOD`. The value of `i`, `n`, `f_max_n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]`) % `MOD`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
