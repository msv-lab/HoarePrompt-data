Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `mod` (the integer 10^9 + 7). It calculates the product of all integers from 2 to `n` and then takes this product modulo `mod`. The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each integer to the `result` variable and applying the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow. After completing the loop, the function returns the computed value. The overall postcondition is that the program returns the product of all integers from 2 to `n` modulo 10^9 + 7. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately performs the described operations without any missing functionality.**
