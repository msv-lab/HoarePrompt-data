To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `f_max_n` retains its original value.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = f_max_n` and decrements `j` until `j` reaches `1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be at least `1` (since the loop runs backwards from `f_max_n` to `1`).

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `k + 1` outside the loop.
   - The value of `i` does not affect the loop's execution condition.

3. **Variables `dp[j]` and `dp[0]`:**
   - These arrays are precomputed and their values are fixed based on the initial conditions.
   - They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **Variable `f_max_n`:**
   - This variable controls the upper limit of the loop and must be at least `1` for the loop to run.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `f_max_n`, which must be greater than or equal to `1`.

### Final State:
State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
