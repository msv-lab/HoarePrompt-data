The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j] % MOD`, `dp[j - 1]` retains its original value.

Output State: **`dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j] % MOD`, `dp[j - 1]` retains its original value**
