The code initializes a list `dp` with length `L + 1` where each element is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). The variable `costs` and `L` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers read from input, `L` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`.**
