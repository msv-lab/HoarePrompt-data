The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9.

The function calculates a current_cost based on some unspecified logic involving `n`, `L`, and the `costs` list. It then finds the minimum value between max_cost (presumably a pre-defined or previously calculated maximum cost) and the current_cost. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs`, and return the minimum value of max_cost and the calculated current_cost.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs`, and returns the minimum value of max_cost and the calculated current_cost.**
