The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `dp[0]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`

After executing the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])`, the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[1]` since `i` is 1) is updated to be the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `dp[0]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`**
