The code `current_cost += dp[i]` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 29, so `dp[i]` is effectively `dp[29]`. The state of `L` and the condition checking whether `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\) are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the updated state is that `current_cost` is increased by `dp[29]`.

Output State: **`i` is 29, `current_cost` is increased by `dp[29]`**
