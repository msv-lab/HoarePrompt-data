Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\)
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `cost_i` satisfies \(1 \leq cost_i \leq 10^9\)
- `max_cost` is 10
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is 10
- `c` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first `n` integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, inclusive. To ensure the loop can execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` starts from 0 and ends at `n-1`.
2. The value of `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `n` is an integer and \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
- `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n-1`, so it should be set to 0 initially.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
