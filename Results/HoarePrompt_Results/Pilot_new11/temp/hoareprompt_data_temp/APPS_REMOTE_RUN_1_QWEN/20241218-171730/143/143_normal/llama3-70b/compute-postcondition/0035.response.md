Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `costs` is a list of integers.
- `L` is an integer greater than 0.
- `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element from 1 to `L` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[i - 1]`.
- `i` is incremented to `L`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**: The loop involves the variable `j` which is the iterator of the loop. The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).

2. **Initial State of `j`**: At the start of the loop, the value of `j` should be 0 because the range `range(n)` starts from 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, `j` must be initialized to 0 and `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be set to 0 to start the loop.
   - `n` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` being 0 and `n` being a positive integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
