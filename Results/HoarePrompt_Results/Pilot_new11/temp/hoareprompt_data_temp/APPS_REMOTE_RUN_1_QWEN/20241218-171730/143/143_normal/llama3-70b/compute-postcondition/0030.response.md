The value of `j` is increased by 1. The variable `vol` is then assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`, which is `2 ** (j + 1) - 1` given that `j` was previously `j`. The states of the other variables (`costs`, `L`, `dp`) are not affected.

Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1`; `j` is increased by 1; `vol` is `2 ** (j + 1) - 1`**
