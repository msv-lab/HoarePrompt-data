Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`, `L` is updated to `L - 805306368` if `L >= 2^{28}`, otherwise `L` remains unchanged, and `answer` is updated to the minimum value between `answer` and `current_cost_new + (L_new > 0) * dp[28]` if `L >= 2^{28}`, otherwise `answer` remains unchanged.***
