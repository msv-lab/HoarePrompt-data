`L` is decremented by `1` left-shifted by `i`. Given that `i` is 29, `1 << i` results in a very large number (specifically, \(2^{29}\)). However, since the exact value of `L` is not provided, we cannot simplify further without additional context. The initial state shows that `i` is 29, and `current_cost` is increased by `dp[29]`, but these do not change due to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 29, `current_cost` is increased by `dp[29]`, `L` is decreased by \(2^{29}\)**
