Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `cost_i` satisfies \(1 \leq cost_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_cost` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum of its original value (10) and the corresponding element in `c`.
- `c` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first `n` integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, 31):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 30` (inclusive), so `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is given to be between 1 and 30.
   - `L` is given to be between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - `max_cost` is 10.
   - `dp` is a list of 31 integers, each initialized to the minimum of its original value (10) and the corresponding element in `c`.
   - `c` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first `n` integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range from 1 to 30 inclusive. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 initially.
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, the loop will naturally run from 1 to 30 if `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration.

### Final State Before the Loop:
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be set to 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1**
