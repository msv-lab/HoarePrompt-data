`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`. Since `i` is initially 2, `dp[2]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[2]` (which is initially undefined) and `dp[1] * 2`. However, since `dp[1]` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be some initial value, but the exact value does not affect the outcome because the code snippet only provides the logic for updating `dp[2]`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated based on the logic provided. Since `dp[1]` is not specified, it is treated as an undefined value in this context, but the operation will set `dp[2]` to `dp[1] * 2` if `dp[1]` exists.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp[2]` is `dp[1] * 2`**
