First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: 
  - `answer` is `max_cost`
  - `i` is 30
  - `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), and `L` is updated to `L - 2^{30}`.

The code snippet is:
```python
answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
```

This line of code updates the value of `answer`. It compares the current value of `answer` with the value of `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`. Here, `(L > 0)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if `L` is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, `(L > 0) * dp[i]` will add `dp[i]` to `current_cost` only if `L` is greater than 0. 

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `dp`, `current_cost`, and `L`, we will assume the general case. However, we know that `i` is 30, and if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), then `current_cost` will be updated accordingly.

Let's consider two cases for `L`:
1. If `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\):
   - `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]`.
   - `L` is updated to `L - 2^{30}`.
   - The expression `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]` simplifies to `current_cost + dp[30]` because `L` will be reduced to a value less than \(2^{30}\) or 0, making `(L > 0) * dp[i]` zero.

2. If `L` is less than \(2^{30}\):
   - `current_cost` remains unchanged.
   - `L` remains unchanged.
   - The expression `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]` simplifies to `current_cost`.

In both cases, `answer` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the new value of `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.

Given this, the updated states of the variables are:
- `answer` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), or just `current_cost` if `L` is less than \(2^{30}\).
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), and `L` is updated to `L - 2^{30}` in that case.
- `i` remains 30.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`answer` is the minimum of `max_cost` and `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), or `current_cost` if `L` is less than \(2^{30}\); `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\), and `L` is updated to `L - 2^{30}` in that case; `i` is 30.**
