The code `L -= 1 << i` modifies the value of `L`. Given that `i` is 28, `1 << i` calculates `2^28`. Since `L` is initially `L - 2^29`, the code subtracts another `2^28` from `L`. 

To determine the new value of `L`:
- Initially, `L` is reduced by `2^29` (which is `536870912`).
- The code further reduces `L` by `2^28` (which is `268435456`).

Thus, `L` is now reduced by `536870912 + 268435456 = 805306368`.

The initial state was:
- `i` is 28
- `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`
- `L` is `L - 2^29` (which means `L` is reduced by `536870912`)
- `answer` is updated to the minimum value between `answer` and `current_cost_new + (L_new > 0) * dp[29]`

After the code `L -= 1 << i` is executed:
- The value of `L` is updated to `L - 2^28`, which means `L` is now `L - 805306368`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 28; `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`; `L` is `L - 805306368`; `answer` is updated to the minimum value between `answer` and `current_cost_new + (L_new > 0) * dp[29]`**.
