Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[0]`, and `n` is a positive integer.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and is effectively absent, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The condition `vol <= i` is always true given the initial precondition where `vol` is 1, ensuring that the update to `dp[i]` is performed as specified in the if part.
