You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required amount of lemonade \( L \) is exactly 1 liter. Let's consider this specific case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  2 1
  10 100
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  The minimum cost to buy at least 1 liter of lemonade is 10 roubles (since the smallest bottle is 1 liter and costs 10 roubles).

- **Actual Output:**
  The program will incorrectly output the cost of the largest bottle, which is 100 roubles, because it assumes the cost of the next largest bottle (which is 2 liters and costs 100 roubles) is the minimum cost for 1 liter of lemonade.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the exact amount of lemonade needed is the smallest possible bottle size. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum of its original value (10) and the corresponding element in `c`, `c` is a list of n+1 integers where the first n integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 29 to 0 where `L >= 2^i`, `L` is the remainder after subtracting all possible `2^i` from the original `L`, `answer` is the minimum value of `max_cost` and the calculated `current_cost`.
    return answer
    #The program returns answer which is the minimum value of max_cost and the calculated current_cost
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. It calculates the minimum cost required to satisfy the given length `L` using the provided costs. Here’s the detailed functionality:

1. Initializes `dp` as a list of size 31, where each element is set to a very large value (`10

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
