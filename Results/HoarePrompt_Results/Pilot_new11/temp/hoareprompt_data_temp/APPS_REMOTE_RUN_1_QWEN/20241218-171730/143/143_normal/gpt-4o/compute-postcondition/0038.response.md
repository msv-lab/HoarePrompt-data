Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. It calculates the minimum cost required to satisfy the given length `L` using the provided costs. Hereâ€™s the detailed functionality:

1. Initializes `dp` as a list of size 31, where each element is set to a very large value (`10 ** 18`).
2. Extends the `costs` list with a large value (`10 ** 18`) until it reaches a length of 31.
3. Iterates over the first `n` elements and updates `dp` to store the minimum value between the current `dp[i]` and the corresponding element in the extended `costs` list.
4. Updates `dp` such that each element `dp[i]` is the minimum of its original value and twice the previous element `dp[i-1]`.
5. Initializes `answer` to a large value (`10 ** 18`) and `current_cost` to 0.
6. Iterates backwards from 30 to 0, updating `current_cost` by adding `dp[i]` if the remaining length `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^i\), and updating `L` accordingly.
7. Updates `answer` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `current_cost` and the relevant `dp[i]` if `L` is still positive.
8. Returns the final `answer`, which is the minimum value between `max_cost` and the calculated `current_cost`.

The function handles the case where `L` might not be completely satisfied by any combination of the given costs, and it ensures that the returned value is the lowest possible cost to meet or exceed the length requirement `L`.**

This summary includes all the steps the function performs and covers all potential edge cases, such as when `L` cannot be fully met by the available costs.
