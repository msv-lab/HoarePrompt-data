`current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. The value of `i` is 30, so `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`answer` is `max_cost`, `i` is 30, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[30]`, and the value of `L` is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 30 bits.**
