The code updates the value of `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 3 and `dp[3]` is initially `dp[2] * 2`, the code sets `dp[3]` to the minimum between its current value (`dp[2] * 2`) and `dp[2] * 2`.

Since both values being compared are the same (`dp[2] * 2`), the value of `dp[3]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3; `dp[3]` is `dp[2] * 2`.
Output State: **`i` is 3; `dp[3]` is `dp[2] * 2`**
