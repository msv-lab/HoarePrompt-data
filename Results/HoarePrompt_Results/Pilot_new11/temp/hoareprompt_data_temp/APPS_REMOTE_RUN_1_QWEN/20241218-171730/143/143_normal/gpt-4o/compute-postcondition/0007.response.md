According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `2` (since `i` starts from 0).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `dp[0]` is the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`
- `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`**
