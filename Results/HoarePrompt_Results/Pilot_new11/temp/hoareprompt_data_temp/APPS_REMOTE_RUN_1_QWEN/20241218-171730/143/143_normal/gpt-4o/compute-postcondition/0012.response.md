Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] * 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i` starting at 1 up to but not including 31.
   - Therefore, the loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (when `i` is 2).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `i` will change to 2.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how it might affect other variables like `dp`.

5. **Assumptions about Loop Body:**
   - The loop body might involve updating `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i-1]` and possibly `dp[i-2]`.
   - Given that `dp[1]` is already set as the minimum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] * 2`, we don't have explicit details on what happens in the loop body for `i=2`.

Since the problem does not provide the exact loop body, we assume the general behavior of the loop, which typically involves some form of dynamic programming update. However, based on the provided information, we only need to explicitly adjust the state of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 2**.

Note: The state for `dp` remains unspecified because the problem doesn't give us enough information about the loop body to determine its exact value at the next iteration.
