Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.
   - `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - `current_lcm` remains unchanged.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on certain conditions:
     - If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then:
       - `min_lcm` is set to `current_lcm`.
       - `min_k` is set to `candidate`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next Candidate:**
   - The loop iterates over two values: `k` and `diff // k`.

4. **Check the Current State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the value of `candidate` for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`, the next `candidate` will be either `k` or `diff // k` depending on which one was used in the current iteration.

5. **Determine the Next Values:**
   - If `k` was used in the current iteration, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
   - If `diff // k` was used in the current iteration, the next `candidate` will be `k`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged until the next iteration.
   - `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated based on the new `candidate`.
   - `current_lcm` remains unchanged.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be checked against the new `candidate` to see if they should be updated.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:

Since we don't know which `candidate` was used in the previous iteration, we'll consider both possibilities:

- **If `k` was used:**
  - The next `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
  - `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated with `diff // k`.
  - `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be checked against `diff // k`.

- **If `diff // k` was used:**
  - The next `candidate` will be `k`.
  - `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated with `k`.
  - `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be checked against `k`.

To generalize, the next `candidate` will be the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the new `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`).**

Since the exact `candidate` used in the previous iteration is not specified, we can only state the general form:

State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the new `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`).**
