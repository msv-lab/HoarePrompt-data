Postcondition: ***`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated as follows: if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is set to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is set to `candidate`***
