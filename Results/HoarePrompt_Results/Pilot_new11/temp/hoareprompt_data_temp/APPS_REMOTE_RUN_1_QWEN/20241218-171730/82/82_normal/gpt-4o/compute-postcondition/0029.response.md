Postcondition: ***`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is now the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and `current_lcm`, `min_k` is now `candidate`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is `lcm_value`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly.***
