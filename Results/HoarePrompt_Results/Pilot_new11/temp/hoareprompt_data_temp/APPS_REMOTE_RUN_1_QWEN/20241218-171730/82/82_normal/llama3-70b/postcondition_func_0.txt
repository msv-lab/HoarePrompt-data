The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where both are within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the computation, the function returns the GCD as the new value of `a` and 0 as the new value of `b`. 

This process handles the following scenarios:
- If either `a` or `b` is zero initially, the function correctly computes the GCD based on the non-zero value.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `a` (or `b`) as the GCD.
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is a multiple of the other.
- The function iteratively reduces the problem size until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original inputs.
