The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then divides the result by the output of `func_1(x, y)` using integer division. The function returns the final result. Potential edge cases include when `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error. However, no handling for this specific case is present in the given code, so it is up to the caller to ensure `func_1(x, y)` does not return 0.
