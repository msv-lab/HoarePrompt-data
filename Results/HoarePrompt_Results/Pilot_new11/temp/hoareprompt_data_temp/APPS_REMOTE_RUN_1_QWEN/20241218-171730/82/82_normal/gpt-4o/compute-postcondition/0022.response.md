Postcondition: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is now `candidate`, `candidate` is now `k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is set to `candidate`.**
