Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implementing the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, respectively. However, these functions are not used to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. The key insight is that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized when \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) share the maximum common factor possible, which is essentially finding the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Here's a correct approach:

1. Calculate the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).
2. If \( a \leq b \), then the optimal \( k \) is 0 because \( \text{LCM}(a, b) \) will be smaller than \( \text{LCM}(a+1, b+1) \).
3. If \( a > b \), then the optimal \( k \) is \( a - b \) because \( \text{LCM}(a+(a-b), b+(a-b)) = \text{LCM}(2a-b, a) \) which is smaller than \( \text{LCM}(a+1+(a-b), b+1+(a-b)) \).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    if a <= b:
        return 0
    else:
        return a - b

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(find_smallest_k(a, b))
```

This program correctly finds the smallest \( k \) such that the least common multiple of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.
