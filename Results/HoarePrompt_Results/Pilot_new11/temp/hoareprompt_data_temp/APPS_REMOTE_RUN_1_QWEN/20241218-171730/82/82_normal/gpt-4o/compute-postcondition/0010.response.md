The code updates the value of `b` using the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This formula essentially rounds up `b` to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. Let's denote the new value of `b` as `new_b`.

Given that `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, and considering the formula used, `new_b` will be the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` remains a positive integer and is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `b` is updated to `new_b`, which is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `diff` remains a positive integer.
- `min_lcm` remains infinity.
- `min_k` remains 0.
- The current value of `k` satisfies `diff % k == 0`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer and is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is updated to the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, and the current value of `k` satisfies `diff % k == 0`**.
