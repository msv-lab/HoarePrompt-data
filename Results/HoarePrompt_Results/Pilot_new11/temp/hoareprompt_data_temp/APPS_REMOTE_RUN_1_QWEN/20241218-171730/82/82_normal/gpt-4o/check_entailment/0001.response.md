Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. According to the problem description, if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, the optimal \(k\) should be \(0\). However, the program incorrectly computes the smallest \(k\) for such cases, leading to a wrong output.

For example, in the third input case where \(a = 5\) and \(b = 10\), the correct output should be \(0\) because the least common multiple of \(5+0\) and \(10+0\) (i.e., 5 and 10) is 10, which is the smallest possible LCM for these values. However, the program incorrectly computes a non-zero \(k\).

To fix this, the program should directly check if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal and return \(0\) in that case. Here's a modified version of `func_3` to address this issue:

```python
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    # Rest of the original code remains the same
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, thus making the program correct for all potential cases.
