Step 1: Analyze the initial state and the given code snippet.

- Initial State: 
  - `a` is a value
  - `b` is a value
  - `diff` is a value
  - `min_lcm` is a value
  - `min_k` is a value
  - `k` is set to `diff // 2`
  - `new_a` is calculated as `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`
  - `new_b` is calculated as `(b + (k - 1) - 1) // (k - 1) * (k - 1)`
  - `current_lcm` is recalculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`

- Code Snippet:
  - `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`

Step 2: Determine the impact of the code on the program.

- The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. This means `current_lcm` is now dependent on the function `func_2` and the values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Step 3: Calculate the result based on the updated values.

- `k` remains as `diff // 2`.
- `new_a` remains as `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`.
- `new_b` remains as `(b + (k - 1) - 1) // (k - 1) * (k - 1)`.
- `current_lcm` is now the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `new_b` is `(b + (k - 1) - 1) // (k - 1) * (k - 1)`, `current_lcm` is the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
