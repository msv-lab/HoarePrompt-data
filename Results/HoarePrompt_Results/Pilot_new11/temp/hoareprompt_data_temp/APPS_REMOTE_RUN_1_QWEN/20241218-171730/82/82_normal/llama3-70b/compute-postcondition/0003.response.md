The code updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is non-zero. The code performs the following operation:

1. `b` is assigned to `a`.
2. `a % b` (which is now `b % b`) is assigned to `b`.

Since `b % b` is always 0 for any non-zero `b`, `b` will become 0 after the second assignment.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`.
- `b` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 0**
