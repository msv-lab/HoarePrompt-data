The code updates `new_b` by setting it to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). This does not affect the values of `new_a`, `a`, `candidate`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, or `min_k`. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the new `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`).**
