Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_3` appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: When \( a = b \), the function correctly returns 0, as the LCM of \( a + 0 \) and \( b + 0 \) is simply \( a \).

2. **Search Strategy**: The function searches for the smallest \( k \) by iterating over possible values up to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This ensures that the search space is efficient and covers all necessary cases.

3. **Candidate Calculation**: For each \( k \), the function calculates the adjusted values of \( a \) and \( b \) to the nearest multiples of \( k \) and computes their LCM using `func_2`.

4. **Optimal \( k \) Selection**: The function keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \), ensuring that the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM is returned.

5. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers, which is used in calculating the LCM in `func_2`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
