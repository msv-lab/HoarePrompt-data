To determine the states needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues and how the variables change at each iteration.

1. **Initial Conditions**: The loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `k` is within the specified range.
3. **Variable Changes**:
   - `k` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The loop body is omitted, but it is implied that certain operations are performed inside the loop, such as checking the condition `diff % k == 0` and updating `min_lcm` and `min_k`.

Given these points, let's analyze the state at the start of the next iteration:

- **Current State**: 
  - `a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`.
  - `diff % k == 0` has not been satisfied for the current `k` (since there is no else part, `diff % k != 0`).
  - `diff` remains the same.
  - `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
  - `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`.

- **Next Iteration**:
  - `k` will be `k + 1`.
  - The condition `diff % k == 0` will be checked again with the updated `k`.
  - If the condition is still not satisfied, `diff`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` will retain their current states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` remains the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`, and `k` is `k + 1`.**

To express this in the required format:

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` remains the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`, and `k` is `k + 1`.**
