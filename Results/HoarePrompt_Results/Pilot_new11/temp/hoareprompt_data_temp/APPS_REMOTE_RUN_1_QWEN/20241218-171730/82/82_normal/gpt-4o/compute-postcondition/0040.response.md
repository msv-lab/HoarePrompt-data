Postcondition: ***`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`).***
