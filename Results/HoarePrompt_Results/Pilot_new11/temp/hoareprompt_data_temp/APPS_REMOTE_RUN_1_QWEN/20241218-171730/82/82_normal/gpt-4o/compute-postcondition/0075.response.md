The code assigns the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` to `new_b`. The initial state shows that `new_a` is defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which means `new_a` and `new_b` will have the same value because they both follow the same formula using the same `candidate`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `k`, `current_lcm`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `new_a` and `new_b` are equal to each other and to the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `min_lcm` is `min_lcm`, `min_k` is `min_k`, `k` is `k`, `current_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `new_a` and `new_b` are equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate**
