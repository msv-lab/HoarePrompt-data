Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop, `min_k` is the corresponding minimum k, `k` is `\(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\), `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` where `candidate` is the last value checked by the loop.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` are initialized to their respective starting values. The variable `k` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\).

3. **Candidate Calculation**: For each value of `k`, the candidates are `[k, diff // k]`. These candidates are checked to find the minimum least common multiple (`min_lcm`) and the corresponding `min_k`.

4. **New Values Calculation**: For each candidate, the values `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated using the formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate` that are closest to `a` and `b` respectively.

5. **LCM Calculation**: The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` computes the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

6. **Update Minimum LCM and K**: If the computed `current_lcm` is smaller than the current `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` but `candidate` is smaller than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated.

7. **Final Iteration**: After the loop completes, the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` will reflect the state after the last iteration of the loop. The final `k` will be \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\).

8. **No Execution Case**: If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` never satisfies the condition `k <= \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\)`, the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` will remain their initial values (which are typically set to some default values, possibly `min_lcm = inf` and `min_k = -1`).

This output state describes the values of all relevant variables after the loop has completed its iterations, reflecting the minimum least common multiple found and the corresponding minimum k.
