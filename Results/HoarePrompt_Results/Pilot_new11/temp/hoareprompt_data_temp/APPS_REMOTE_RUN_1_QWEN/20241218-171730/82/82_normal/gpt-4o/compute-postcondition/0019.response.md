The code updates the variable `current_lcm` to the value returned by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.
- `diff` is a positive integer.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved.
- `candidate` is now `k`.

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `candidate` is now `k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
