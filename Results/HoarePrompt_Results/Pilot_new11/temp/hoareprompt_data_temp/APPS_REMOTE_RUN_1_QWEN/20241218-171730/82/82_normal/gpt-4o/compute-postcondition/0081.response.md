Postcondition: ***`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop, `min_k` is the corresponding minimum k, `k` is incremented by 1, and `k` is less than or equal to \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\). If `diff % k == 0`, then `new_a` is \((a + k - 1) // k * k\), `new_b` is \((b + k - 1) // k * k\), and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Otherwise, the values of `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged.***
