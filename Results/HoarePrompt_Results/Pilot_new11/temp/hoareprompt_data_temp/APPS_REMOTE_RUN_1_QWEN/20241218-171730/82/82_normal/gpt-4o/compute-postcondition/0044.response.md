`current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can only say that `current_lcm` now holds the result of this function call. The values of `new_a`, `a`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged.**
