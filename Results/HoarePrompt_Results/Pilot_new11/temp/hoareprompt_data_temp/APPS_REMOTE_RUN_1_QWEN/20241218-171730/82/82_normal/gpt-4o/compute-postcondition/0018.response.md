The code updates the value of `new_b` based on the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This calculation ensures that `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `diff` is a positive integer.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved.
- `candidate` is now `k`.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.

After executing the line `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, the value of `new_b` is updated according to the formula. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `new_b` is updated to the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.
- `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `candidate`, and `new_a` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `candidate` is now `k`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`**.
