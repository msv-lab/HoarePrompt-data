`new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. However, the value of `candidate` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `new_a` without knowing `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `candidate` is not given, we can only express `new_a` in terms of `a` and `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
