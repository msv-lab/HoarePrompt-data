Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is now `diff // k`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
