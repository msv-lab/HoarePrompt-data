To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- `diff` is a positive integer.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_k` is now `candidate`.
- `candidate` is now `k`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.
- `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

The loop updates the following based on the condition:
- If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then:
  - `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`.
  - `min_k` is set to `candidate`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.

### Analysis:
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `candidate` is now `k`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (which is `k`) that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `candidate` should be either `k` or `diff // k`. 

Since the loop condition is `for candidate in [k, diff // k]`, the loop will execute again if either `candidate` is still `k` or it transitions to `diff // k`.

### State Adjustments:
1. **Candidate Update**: The value of `candidate` will change from `k` to `diff // k` for the next iteration.
2. **New Values for `a` and `b`**: Since `candidate` changes to `diff // k`, we need to recalculate `a` and `b` as the smallest multiples of `diff // k`.
3. **Recalculate `new_b`**: `new_b` will be the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is now `diff // k`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**

However, since `current_lcm` and `min_lcm` will be recalculated, we will keep them as placeholders until the loop body computes their actual values.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is now `diff // k`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
