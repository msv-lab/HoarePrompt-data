Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only includes two helper functions for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM). However, these functions alone do not address the main logic required to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. The LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a+k, b+k) = \frac{(a+k)(b+k)}{\gcd(a+k, b+k)}
   \]
2. We need to find the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM is minimized. This involves iterating over possible values of \( k \) and calculating the LCM until we find the minimum.

The provided code does not include the logic to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and calculate the LCM for each pair \( (a+k, b+k) \). Therefore, the program will not work correctly for all potential cases.

For example, consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \). The correct solution involves checking different values of \( k \) to find the minimum LCM, which the current code does not do. The correct answer is \( k = 2 \), but the provided code cannot determine this.
