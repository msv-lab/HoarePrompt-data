`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. However, the function `func_2` and the definitions of `new_a` and `new_b` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. We know that `a` and `b` are updated to the smallest multiples of `candidate` that are greater than or equal to their original values, and `diff` and `k` satisfy certain conditions.

The Output State is: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
