You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where both are within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the computation, the function returns the GCD as the new value of `a` and 0 as the new value of `b`. 

This process handles the following scenarios:
- If either `a` or `b` is zero initially, the function correctly computes the GCD based on the non-zero value.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `a` (or `b`) as the GCD.
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is a multiple of the other.
- The function iteratively reduces the problem size until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original inputs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\)) and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. This means the function computes `(a * b) // func_1(a, b)` and ensures that the result is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled separately, but the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-negative value. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a negative value, the behavior of the integer division operation is defined by Python, which will treat the negative value as a non-zero divisor.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
