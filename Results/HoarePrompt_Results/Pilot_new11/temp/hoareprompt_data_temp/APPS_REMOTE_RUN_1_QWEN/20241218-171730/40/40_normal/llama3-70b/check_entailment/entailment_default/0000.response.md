Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the longest non-palindromic substring in a given string. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s`, checks if each substring is a palindrome, and keeps track of the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings. If no non-palindromic substring is found, it returns 0. This matches the problem description perfectly and handles all potential cases as described. The output hints also align with the code, confirming its correctness.
