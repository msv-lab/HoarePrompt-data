According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is within this range. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `i` is an integer such that `i < n`.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to an undefined index `j`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` if `substr` is not a palindrome.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `j` in the next iteration would be `i + 2`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, the updated state will be:

- `i` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.
- `s` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.
- `j` is now `i + 2`.
- `substr` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.
- `max_len` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.

State: **`i` is an integer such that `i < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` if `substr` is not a palindrome.**
