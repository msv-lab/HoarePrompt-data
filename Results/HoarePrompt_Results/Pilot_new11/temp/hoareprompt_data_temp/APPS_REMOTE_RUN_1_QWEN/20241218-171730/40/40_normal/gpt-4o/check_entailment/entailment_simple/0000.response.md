Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the string `s` has a length less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints `0`. This part is correct because a string of length 1 or less cannot contain a non-palindrome substring.

2. **Checking for Longest Non-Palindrome Substring:**
   - The main logic relies on three conditions:
     - `func_1(s)` checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome.
     - `func_1(s[1:])` checks if the substring starting from the second character to the end is a palindrome.
     - `func_1(s[:-1])` checks if the substring from the start to the second last character is a palindrome.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic assumes that if the whole string or any of its initial or final substrings are not palindromes, then the longest non-palindrome substring can be found using these checks. However, this logic is flawed because:
     - It only considers the entire string and its two immediate substrings (excluding the first and last characters).
     - It doesn't check all possible substrings of `s` to find the longest non-palindrome substring.

4. **Example Counter-Case:**
   - Consider the input `"bcb"`:
     - The entire string `"bcb"` is a palindrome.
     - `func_1(s[1:])` checks `"cb"` which is not a palindrome.
     - `func_1(s[:-1])` checks `"bc"` which is not a palindrome.
   - According to the logic, the program would print `2` because either `"cb"` or `"bc"` is non-palindromic. However, the longest non-palindrome substring is `"bcb"` itself, which should result in printing `3`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, one needs to iterate through all possible substrings of `s` and keep track of the longest non-palindrome substring. This requires nested loops or dynamic programming to efficiently find the longest non-palindrome substring.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly find the longest non-palindrome substring of the input string `s`. Therefore, the program is **incorrect** according to the problem description.
