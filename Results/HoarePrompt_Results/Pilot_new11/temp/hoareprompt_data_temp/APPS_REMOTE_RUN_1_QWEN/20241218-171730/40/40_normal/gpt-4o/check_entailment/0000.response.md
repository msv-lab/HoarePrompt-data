Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not properly check for the longest non-palindrome substring. The program instead checks if the entire string, a substring starting from the second character, and a substring ending before the last character are not palindromes, which is not sufficient to find the longest non-palindrome substring.

For example, consider the input "aaabaaa". The longest non-palindrome substring here is "aab" with a length of 3. However, the program will incorrectly return 0 because `func_1(s[1:])` will evaluate to `True` since "aaba" is not a palindrome, and it does not check for other possible non-palindrome substrings of longer lengths.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as iterating through all possible substrings and checking if they are palindromes, and keeping track of the longest non-palindrome substring found.
