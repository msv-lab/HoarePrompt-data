Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code checks for non-palindromic substrings in the input string by slicing the string in different ways and checking them against the `func_1` function. However, this approach is incomplete and does not guarantee finding the longest non-palindromic substring.

For instance, consider the input `"aabb"`. The code would check slices like `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`, but it does not check all possible substrings. The correct approach would involve iterating through all possible substrings of the input string and determining which one is the longest non-palindromic substring.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
s = input().strip()

def is_palindrome(sub):
    return sub == sub[::-1]

max_length = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not is_palindrome(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```

This version correctly checks all possible substrings and finds the longest non-palindromic substring, ensuring the program works for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
