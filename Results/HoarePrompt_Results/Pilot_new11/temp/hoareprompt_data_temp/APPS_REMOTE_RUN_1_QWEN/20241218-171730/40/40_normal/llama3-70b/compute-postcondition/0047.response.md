Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible substrings starting from index `i` up to index `n`.
- For each substring `s[i:j]`, it checks if the substring is not a palindrome.
- If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring.
- After the loop completes, `max_len` will hold the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`.

The loop ensures that all possible substrings starting from `i` up to `n` are checked, and the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings is recorded. If no such substrings are found, `max_len` remains as its initial value.
