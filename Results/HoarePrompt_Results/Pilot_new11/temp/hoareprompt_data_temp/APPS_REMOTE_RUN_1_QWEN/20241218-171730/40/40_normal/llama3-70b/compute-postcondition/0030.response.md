The code updates the `max_len` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring `substr`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1` and is not equal to its reverse).
- `j` is `j_prev + 2`.
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.

After executing the line `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))`, the `max_len` variable is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the `substr` substring.

Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring `substr` from index `i` to index `j - 1`; `j` is `j_prev + 2`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.**
