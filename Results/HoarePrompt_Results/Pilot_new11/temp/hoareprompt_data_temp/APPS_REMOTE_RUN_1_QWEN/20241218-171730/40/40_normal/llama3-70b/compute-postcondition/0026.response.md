The code snippet updates the value of `max_len` by comparing it with the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is already determined by the previous state, and it is not equal to its reverse. The code does not change the values of `i`, `s`, `n`, `j`, or `j_prev`. Therefore, the length of `substr` remains the same, and `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse); `j` is `j_prev + 1`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1`; `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.**
