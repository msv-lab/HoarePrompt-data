Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i < n`, `j` is an integer such that `i + 1 <= j <= n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i` to `n - 1` and `j` to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible starting indices `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `i`, it iterates over all possible ending indices `j` from `i+1` to `n`.
- It extracts the substring `substr` from `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`.
- If `substr` is not a palindrome (`substr != substr[::-1]`), it updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

Since the loop runs for all valid pairs `(i, j)` where `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`, and `j` starts from `i+1` and goes up to `n`, it ensures that every possible substring of `s` is checked for being a palindrome and the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring is recorded.

In the worst-case scenario, if the loop does not execute (i.e., `s` is an empty string), the initial state remains unchanged:
- `s` is an empty string.
- `n` is 0.
- `max_len` is still 0.

However, since the initial condition specifies that `s` is a non-empty string, we do not need to consider the case where `s` is empty. Therefore, the final output state captures the behavior after all iterations of the loop.
