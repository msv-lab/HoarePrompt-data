Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i \) is an integer such that \( i < n \)
- \( s \) is a non-empty string
- \( n \) must be greater than 0
- \( \text{substr} \) is a single character from \( s \) starting at index \( i \)
- \( \text{max\_len} \) is the maximum of its current value and 1, regardless of whether \( \text{substr} \) is a palindrome or not

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable \( i \):**
   - The loop starts with \( j = i + 1 \).
   - After each iteration, \( j \) increases by 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, \( j \) must be less than \( n + 1 \).

2. **Variable \( n \):**
   - The loop condition checks if \( j < n + 1 \).
   - Since \( n \) is fixed and does not change within the loop, it remains as it was.

3. **Variable \( s \):**
   - The string \( s \) is unchanged by the loop and remains the same.

4. **Variable \( \text{substr} \):**
   - The substring \( \text{substr} \) is derived from \( s \) starting at index \( i \).
   - Since \( i \) does not change within the loop, \( \text{substr} \) remains the same.

5. **Variable \( \text{max\_len} \):**
   - The value of \( \text{max\_len} \) is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.
   - This update is independent of the loop and happens only once per iteration based on the condition involving \( \text{substr} \).

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- \( i \) will increment by 1 to \( i + 1 \).
- \( j \) will start from \( i + 2 \) (since \( j = i + 1 \) at the end of the previous iteration).
- \( j \) must still be less than \( n + 1 \) for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- \( i \) becomes \( i + 1 \)
- \( j \) is set to \( i + 2 \) (though this is not explicitly stated in the state, it is implied by the loop starting condition)

### Final State:
State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a single character from `s` starting at index `i + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 1, regardless of whether `substr` is a palindrome or not.**
