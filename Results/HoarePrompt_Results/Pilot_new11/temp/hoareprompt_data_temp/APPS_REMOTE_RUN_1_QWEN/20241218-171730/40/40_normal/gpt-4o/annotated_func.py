#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string with a length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) or False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks whether it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string reads the same backward as forward, and `False` otherwise. The function handles strings of maximum length 50, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function correctly checks for palindromes by comparing the original string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases as described in the annotations, and it accurately reflects the intended behavior as stated in the return postconditions.
