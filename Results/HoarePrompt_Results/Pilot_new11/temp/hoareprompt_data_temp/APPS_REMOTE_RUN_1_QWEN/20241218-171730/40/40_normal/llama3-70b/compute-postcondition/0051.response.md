Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 50 characters. It then iterates through all possible substrings of `s` to find the longest non-palindromic substring. If no non-palindromic substring is found, it returns 0. The function prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found or 0 if none exists.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:
- The function handles the case where the input string `s` is non-empty and consists only of lowercase English letters.
- It correctly identifies and compares substrings to check if they are palindromes.
- If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, the function correctly identifies that no non-palindromic substring exists and returns 0.
