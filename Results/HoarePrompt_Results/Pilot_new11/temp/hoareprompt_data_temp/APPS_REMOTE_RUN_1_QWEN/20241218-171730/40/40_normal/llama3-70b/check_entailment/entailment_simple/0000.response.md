Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes a single input string `s` of length at most 50 characters, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Longest Non-Palindromic Substring Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops. For each substring, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).
   - If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the length of this substring if it is greater than the current `max_len`.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - After iterating through all possible substrings, the program prints the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring found. If no non-palindromic substring exists, it prints `0`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1**: `s = "mew"`
  - Possible substrings: "m", "e", "w", "me", "ew", "mew"
  - "mew" is the longest non-palindromic substring, so the output is `3`.

- **Example 2**: `s = "wuffuw"`
  - Possible substrings include "uffuw".
  - "uffuw" is the longest non-palindromic substring, so the output is `5`.

- **Example 3**: `s = "qqqqqqqq"`
  - All substrings are palindromes, so the output is `0`.

The program correctly identifies the longest non-palindromic substring and outputs the appropriate length, adhering to the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
