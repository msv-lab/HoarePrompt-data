According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` (the length of `s`) is at least 1. The variable `max_len` being 0 does not affect whether the loop can execute since the loop depends on the value of `n`.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `max_len` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `n`. If `n` is 0, the range function will generate an empty sequence, and the loop will not execute.

So, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 0 while keeping the other states as given.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0**
