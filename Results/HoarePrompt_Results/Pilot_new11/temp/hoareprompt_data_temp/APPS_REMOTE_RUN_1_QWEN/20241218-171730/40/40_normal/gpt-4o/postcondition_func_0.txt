The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks whether it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string reads the same backward as forward, and `False` otherwise. The function handles strings of maximum length 50, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function correctly checks for palindromes by comparing the original string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases as described in the annotations, and it accurately reflects the intended behavior as stated in the return postconditions.
