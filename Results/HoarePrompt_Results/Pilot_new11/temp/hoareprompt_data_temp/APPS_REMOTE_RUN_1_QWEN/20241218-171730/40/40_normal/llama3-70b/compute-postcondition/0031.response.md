Postcondition: ***`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring `substr` from index `i` to index `j - 1`; `j` is `j_prev + 2`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to the length of `substr`.***
