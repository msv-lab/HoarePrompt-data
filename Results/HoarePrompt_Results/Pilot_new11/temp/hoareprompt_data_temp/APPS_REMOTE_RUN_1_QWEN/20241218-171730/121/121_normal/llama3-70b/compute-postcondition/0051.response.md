Postcondition: **`nc` is now the next character in the set `{'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}`, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`, `count` is updated based on the current character `nc`, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `nc` is not `'?'` and `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is a string with `nc` concatenated with itself and `count[nc]` is 1 less than its initial value. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty string.**
