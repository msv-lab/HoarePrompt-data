Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the code has the following issues:

1. **Handling of '?' Characters**: The code attempts to replace each `'?'` with the character that has the smallest count. However, it does not ensure that after replacing all `'?'`, the count of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') will be exactly `n // 4`. This means that even if the initial counts are within the required range, the final genome might still have unequal counts of nucleotides.

2. **Edge Case Not Handled**: Consider the input `6 ????G?`. The code will attempt to replace the `'?'` characters but might not achieve the required balance of nucleotides. For example, if the code replaces all `'?'` with 'A', the resulting string would be `AAAAAG?`, which is invalid because the counts of 'A' and 'G' are not equal.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that after replacing all `'?'`, the count of each nucleotide is exactly `n // 4`. This requires a more sophisticated approach to check and balance the counts after replacements.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]

    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return

    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1

    if any(count > target_count for count in counts.values()):
        print('===')
        return

    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in 'ACGT':
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
            else:
                print('===')
                return

    print(''.join(result))

func_1()
```

This version ensures that after replacing all `'?'`, the count of each nucleotide is exactly `n // 4`, thus meeting the problem description for every potential case.
