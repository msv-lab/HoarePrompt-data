`target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`. The value of `n` is such that `n % 4 == 0`, so `n` is a multiple of 4, and `target_count` will be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`], `s` is the string from `data[1]`, `n % 4 == 0`, `target_count` is `n // 4`**
