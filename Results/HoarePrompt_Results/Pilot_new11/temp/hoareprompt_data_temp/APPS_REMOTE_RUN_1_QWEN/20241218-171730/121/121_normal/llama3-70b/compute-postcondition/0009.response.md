Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and their values incremented by 1 for the key corresponding to the character `c` if `c` is not '?'. If `c` is not '?', the count of the character `c` in `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is '?', no change occurs in `count`.***
