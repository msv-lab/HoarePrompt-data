Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. If `result[i]` equals '?', then `i` is set to `n` and `result[i-1]` is either `char` (if the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count + 1`), and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
