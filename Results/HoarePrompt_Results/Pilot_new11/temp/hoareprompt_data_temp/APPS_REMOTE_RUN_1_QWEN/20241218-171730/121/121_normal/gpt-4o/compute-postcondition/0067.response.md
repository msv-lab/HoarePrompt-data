Postcondition: ***`counts` is a list with at least one element. If the value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1 and an additional assignment is made at index `i` in `result` with the value `char`. Otherwise, the list `result` remains unchanged and `counts[char]` remains as it was before the if statement.***
