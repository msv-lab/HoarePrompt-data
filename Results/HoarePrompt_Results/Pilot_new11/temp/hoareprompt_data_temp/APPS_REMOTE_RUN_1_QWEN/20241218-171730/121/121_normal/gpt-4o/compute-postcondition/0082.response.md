Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `counts` is a non-empty list
   - If the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, then `result[2]` is updated to be `'?'`. Otherwise, `result[2]` remains unchanged.

2. **Understand the loop structure:**
   ```python
   for char in counts:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop iterates over each character in the `counts` list.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `counts` to iterate over.
   - After each iteration, `char` is set to the current character being processed.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop structure:**
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop is iterating over each character in `counts`, `i` will increment by 1 for each character processed.
   - For the loop to continue, there must still be characters left in `counts` to process.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value (2), so it will be 3.
   - `counts` must still contain characters to be processed for the loop to continue.

Thus, the new state for the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `counts` is a non-empty list**
