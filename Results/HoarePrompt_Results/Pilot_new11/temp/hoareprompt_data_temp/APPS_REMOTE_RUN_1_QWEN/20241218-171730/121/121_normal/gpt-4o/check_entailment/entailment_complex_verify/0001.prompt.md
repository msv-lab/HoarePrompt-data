You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a flaw in how it handles the case where the number of question marks is more than the target count for any nucleotide type. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes exactly equal after replacements. Here is a counterexample:

For the input:
```
8
GGGGGGGG
```

The program will output:
```
GGGGGGGG
```

However, the correct output should be something like:
```
AGACGTCT
```

or any other combination where each nucleotide type appears exactly twice. The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it only ensures that the number of each nucleotide is less than or equal to the target count but does not enforce equality. This can lead to invalid outputs where the counts are not perfectly balanced.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, representing the length of the genome string. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', representing the coded genome.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`], `s` is the string from `data[1]`, and `n % 4 == 0`
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, an empty string], `n % 4 == 0`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with values where the count of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is the number of times that character appears in the string `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary where the count of each key (character) is less than or equal to `target_count`, `data` remains as `[integer value of `data[0]`, an empty string]`, `n` % 4 == 0, and `target_count` remains as `n // 4`. If the loop does not execute, the function does not return anything (i.e., it returns None implicitly). If the loop executes at least once, the function returns None.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `result` is a list where every occurrence of `'?'` is replaced by a character from `counts` such that the count of that character in `counts` is less than `target_count`, `counts` is a dictionary where the count of each character that replaced `'?'` is incremented by 1, `data` remains as `[integer value of `data[0]`, an empty string]`, `n` % 4 == 0, and `target_count` remains as `n // 4`.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a genome string \(s\) and determines if replacing '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' results in each character having a count less than or equal to \(n/4\), where \(n\) is the length of the genome string. If any character count exceeds \(n/4\), the function prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it replaces each '?' in the string with the character that has the smallest count and increments its count until all '?' are replaced. Finally, it prints the modified genome string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
