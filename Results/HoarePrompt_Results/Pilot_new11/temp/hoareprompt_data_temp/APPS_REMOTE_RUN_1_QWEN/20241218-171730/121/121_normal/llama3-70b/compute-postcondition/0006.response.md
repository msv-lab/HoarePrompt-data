Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and their values incremented by 1 for the key corresponding to the character `c`, provided that `c` is not '?'. If `c` is '?', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
