Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `result[1]` is either `char` (if the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count + 1`), and `counts[char]` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, these conditions apply unconditionally.***
