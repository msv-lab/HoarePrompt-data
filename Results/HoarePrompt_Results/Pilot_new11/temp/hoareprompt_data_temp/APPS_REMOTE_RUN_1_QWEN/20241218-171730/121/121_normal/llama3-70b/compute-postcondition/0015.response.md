Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `c`, which iterates over the characters `'ACGT'`.
   - For the loop to execute, there is no specific condition related to `c` since the loop will iterate over all four characters regardless of their presence or value in the initial state.

2. **Examine the Given State**:
   - `n` is an integer between 4 and 255.
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'`.
   - `count` is a dictionary with keys `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and their values incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding character in `s` (excluding `'?'` characters).
   - `avg` is `n // 4`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop will always iterate over `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that these characters are present in the string `s` such that the dictionary `count` is correctly updated.
   - However, since the loop itself does not depend on the specific values of `n` or `avg`, and the loop will always execute as long as the string `s` contains valid characters, we don't need to adjust `n` or `avg`.
   - The string `s` must contain at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` to ensure that the dictionary `count` is updated properly during the loop iterations.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`, `count` is a dictionary with keys `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and their values incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding character in `s` (excluding `'?'` characters), `avg` is `n // 4`.**
