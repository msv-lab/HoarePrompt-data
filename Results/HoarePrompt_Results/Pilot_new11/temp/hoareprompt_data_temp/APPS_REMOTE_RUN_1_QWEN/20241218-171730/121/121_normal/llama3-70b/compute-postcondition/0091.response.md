The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res` without changing its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `res` is now being printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and possibly `'?'`, `count` is a dictionary with keys `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and their values all equal to `0`, `avg` is `n // 4`, and `res` is a string formed by replacing each `'?'` in `s` with one of `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` while respecting the count constraints, or appending the corresponding character from `s` if it is not `'?'`. The value of `res` is printed.**
