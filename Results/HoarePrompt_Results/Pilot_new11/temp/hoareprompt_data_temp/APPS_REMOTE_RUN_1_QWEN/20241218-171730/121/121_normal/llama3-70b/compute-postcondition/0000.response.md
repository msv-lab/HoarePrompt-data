`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user, which is expected to be within the range 4 to 255. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the input statement only affects `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user (within 4 to 255), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
