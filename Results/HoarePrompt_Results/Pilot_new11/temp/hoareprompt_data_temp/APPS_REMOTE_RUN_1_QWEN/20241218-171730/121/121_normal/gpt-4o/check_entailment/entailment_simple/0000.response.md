Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input as specified, with the first line containing an integer \( n \) and the second line containing the string \( s \).
   - It checks if \( n \% 4 \neq 0 \), which ensures that the total number of nucleotides is divisible by 4. If this condition is not met, it prints `"==="` and exits, correctly handling the case where it's impossible to evenly distribute the nucleotides.

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the target count of each type of nucleotide (`A`, `C`, `G`, `T`) as \( \frac{n}{4} \).
   - It iterates through the string \( s \) and counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (`A`, `C`, `G`, `T`), storing these counts in the dictionary `counts`.

3. **Validation of Current Counts**:
   - After counting, it verifies that no current nucleotide count exceeds the target count. If any count exceeds \( \frac{n}{4} \), it prints `"==="` and exits, ensuring that the problem constraints are not violated.

4. **Decoding Process**:
   - If the validation passes, it proceeds to replace all `?` characters in the string \( s \) with the appropriate nucleotide.
   - For each `?`, it chooses the first available nucleotide (in the order `A`, `C`, `G`, `T`) whose count is less than the target count and increments the corresponding count in the `counts` dictionary.
   - This ensures that the final string has an equal number of each nucleotide type.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the decoded string.

Given the above steps, the program adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
