Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 4 and 255.
   - `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`.
   - `count` is updated based on the current character `c`.
   - `avg` is `n // 4`.
   - If `c` is `'?'`, `res` remains an empty string; otherwise, `res` is a string with `c` appended to it.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **State Changes**:
   - The variable `count` is updated based on the current character `c`.
   - The variable `res` is updated based on the value of `c`:
     - If `c` is `'?'`, `res` remains unchanged (an empty string).
     - Otherwise, `res` is updated by appending `c` to the existing string.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will iterate over the next character in the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, there will always be at least one more character to process unless `s` is exhausted.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` loses its first character since the loop processes one character per iteration.
   - `count` is updated based on the new character `c`.
   - `res` is updated based on the new character `c`:
     - If the new `c` is `'?'`, `res` remains unchanged.
     - Otherwise, `res` appends the new `c`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` loses its first character.
- `count` is updated based on the new character.
- `res` is updated based on the new character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string obtained by removing the first character from the original string, `count` is updated based on the new first character of `s`, and if the new first character of `s` is `'?'`, `res` remains an empty string; otherwise, `res` is a string with the new first character of `s` appended to it.**
