The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user or an external source, specifically:

1. The first line contains an integer `n` where `4 ≤ n ≤ 255`, representing the length of the genome string.
2. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

Based on the conditions provided, the function returns:

- Case_2: The value of `counts[char]` which is greater than `target_count`.
- Case_3: None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read a genome string and a target count, then return the count of a specific character if it exceeds the target count, otherwise return None.
Functionality: **The function reads a genome string and a target count, and returns the count of a specific character if it exceeds the target count, otherwise returns None.**
