Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`], `s` must be a non-empty string, `n % 4 == 0`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with values {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char` is in `counts` and `counts[char]` is 1, then nothing changes. Since there is no else part, the condition for the else part does not apply.***
