`count[c]` is incremented by 1 for the key corresponding to the character `c` if `c` is not '?'. The value of `c` is the next character in `s` (if it exists), and the previous value of `count` is such that its values are incremented by 1 for the key corresponding to each character in `s` that is not '?'. The states of `n` and `s` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and their values incremented by 1 for the key corresponding to the character `c` if `c` is not '?', and the next character `c` in `s` (if it exists) is processed; count[c] is incremented by 1**
