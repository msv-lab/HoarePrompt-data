`n` is the integer entered by the user within the range 4 to 255, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The code `s = input()` changes the value of `s` to the string entered by the user. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the input operation because the input operation overwrites the value of `s`, not `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and `s` is the string entered by the user consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
