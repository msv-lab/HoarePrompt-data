The function `func()` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It processes the string `s` to replace all '?' characters with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the resulting string are as close to equal as possible. If the original string `s` contains characters other than '?', these characters are appended to the result as-is. After processing, the function prints '===' if any count of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the resulting string `res`.
