Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with at least two keys, and the count of `char` in `counts` is less than or equal to `target_count`. If the count of `char` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., it returns None implicitly).***
