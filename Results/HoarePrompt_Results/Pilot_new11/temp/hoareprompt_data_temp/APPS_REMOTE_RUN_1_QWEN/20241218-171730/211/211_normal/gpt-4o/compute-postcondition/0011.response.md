The code `print('2')` prints the string '2' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or the console output. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES'**
