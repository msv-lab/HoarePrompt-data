Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw that makes it incorrect for certain cases. Specifically, the code fails to handle arrays where the sum is zero, but no single element is non-zero. For example, consider the input:

```
4
-1 1 -1 1
```

According to the problem description, this input should result in a "NO" output because it's not possible to split the array into subarrays where each subarray's sum is non-zero. However, the current implementation will incorrectly return a "YES" output with two subarrays, which is not allowed.

To fix this, the code needs to check if the entire array consists of zeros before printing "NO". Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    
    if total_sum == 0 and all(a == 0 for a in A):
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = len([i for i in range(n) if A[i] != 0])
        print(k)
        start = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print(start + 1, i + 1)
                start = i
        print(start + 2, n)

func()
```

This version correctly handles the case where the entire array is zeros, ensuring the program returns "NO" in such scenarios.
