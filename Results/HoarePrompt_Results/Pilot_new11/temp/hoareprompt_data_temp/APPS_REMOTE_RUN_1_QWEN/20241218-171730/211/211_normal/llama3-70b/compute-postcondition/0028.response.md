The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. It does not change the values of these variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` remain the same as their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is the previous value + 1, and `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r`.**
