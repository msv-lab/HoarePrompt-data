`A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` to the input split by spaces. The input is a series of integers provided by the user, and the length of this list is equal to the value of `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3.**
