Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`; if `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the console outputs '1' followed by the value of `n`; if `total_sum` is 0, the console outputs 'NO'.***
