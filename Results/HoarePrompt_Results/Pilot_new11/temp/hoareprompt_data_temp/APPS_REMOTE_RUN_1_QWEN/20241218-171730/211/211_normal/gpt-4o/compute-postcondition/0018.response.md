The code prints the string `'2'`. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `total_sum`, or `i`. The console output changes to include `'2'` following the existing output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2'**
