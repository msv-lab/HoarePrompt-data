The code prints '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 3, `i + 1` is 4. The print statement outputs '1 4' to the console. The variables `n`, `total_sum`, and the console outputs are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 4'.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 4'**
