According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, and `a` is a list of integers based on the input `n`. The initial state of `A` remains unchanged, but since the problem statement does not mention `A` being used inside the loop, we can focus on `n`, `a`, and `prefix_sum`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`n`**: The loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

2. **`prefix_sum`**: The `prefix_sum` list is already initialized with all elements set to 0. This initialization is independent of the loop and is given as part of the initial state.

3. **`a`**: The list `a` is based on the input `n`. The exact content of `a` does not affect whether the loop executes, as long as `n` is valid (i.e., greater than 0).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
