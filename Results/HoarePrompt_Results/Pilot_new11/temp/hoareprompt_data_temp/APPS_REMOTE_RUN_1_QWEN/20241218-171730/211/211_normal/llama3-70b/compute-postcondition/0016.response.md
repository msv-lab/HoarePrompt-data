Let's break down the given information and the for loop to understand what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- Each element of `prefix_sum` is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`.
- `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0.
- `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`.
- `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0.
- `k` is 1.
- `l` is 1.

### For Loop:
```python
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `r`:**
   - The loop starts with `r = 1` and goes up to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `r` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since `r` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `k` and `l` are both set to 1, and their values don't directly affect the loop condition but may influence the loop body. Therefore, they don't need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **List `prefix_sum`:**
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The elements of `prefix_sum` are already defined and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute, the primary concern is ensuring that `n` is at least 1, since `r` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0 (or at least 1)**. 

The other variables (`k`, `l`, and `prefix_sum`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
