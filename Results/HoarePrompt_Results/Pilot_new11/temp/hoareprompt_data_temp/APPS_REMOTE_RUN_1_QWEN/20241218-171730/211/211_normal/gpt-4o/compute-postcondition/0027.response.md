`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 4'. The code `print(i + 2, n)` updates the console output and calculates the value of `i + 2`, which is 6. Since `n` must be greater than 3 and no specific value is provided for `n`, the output state will keep `n` as greater than 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 6', '1 4'**
