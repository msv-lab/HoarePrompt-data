According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and the values of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` and `prefix_sum[i + 2]` have been updated based on the current value of `i`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` is now `previous_i + 1` and it must be less than `n`.
4. Since `i` was incremented, the new value of `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

Given this reasoning:

- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
- The updated values of `prefix_sum` will depend on the new value of `i`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1, we can deduce that `i` is now `previous_i + 1` and `n` must still be greater than `previous_i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]; prefix_sum[i + 2]` is updated to the new value of `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]`, where `i` is now `previous_i + 1`**.
