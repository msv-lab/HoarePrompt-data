`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The initial values of the list `A` and the variable `n` are not specified further in the code, so they remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list of integers represents the array A with length n, where each element a_{i} satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3. The variable `n` now holds the integer input from the user.**
