The function reads an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (-10^3 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^3), calculates the prefix sums of the array \( A \), and checks if there is a subarray whose sum is zero. If such a subarray exists, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the subarray. If no such subarray exists, it prints "NO". The function handles the case where the entire array sums to zero by printing "NO". Additionally, if multiple subarrays with zero sum exist, it only prints one such subarray.
