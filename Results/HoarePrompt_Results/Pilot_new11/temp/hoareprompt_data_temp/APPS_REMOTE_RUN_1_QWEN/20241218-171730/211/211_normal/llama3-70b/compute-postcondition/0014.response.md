The code `k = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `k`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `k` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1**
