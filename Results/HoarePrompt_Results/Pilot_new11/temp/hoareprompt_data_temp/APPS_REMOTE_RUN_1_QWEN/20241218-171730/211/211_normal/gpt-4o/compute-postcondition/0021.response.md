The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or the most nested block it is in. In this case, there is no loop or nested block to exit, but the `break` statement indicates that we exit some kind of loop or conditional structure. However, since no loop or conditional structure is provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3' `n'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
