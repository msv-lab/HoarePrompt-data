The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or block it is inside. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the provided code, the only effect is that the execution will exit the context it was in, which in this case is implied to be a loop or block that was previously active. However, since no further actions are specified, the values of `n`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

The console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2 before the code snippet is executed, and these outputs continue unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2.**
