The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of elements in the array A, which is specified in the initial state but is not read by this piece of code. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, and the input itself is not stored anywhere.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the initial state of the array A remains unchanged**
