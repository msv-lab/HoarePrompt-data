Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program fails to correctly handle the case where the entire array has a sum of zero. According to the problem description, the array should be split into parts where the sum of elements in each part is non-zero. However, the current implementation incorrectly prints "NO" for such cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
-1 -1 -1
```

The sum of the entire array is -3, which is not zero, so the array should be split into individual elements. The program should print "YES" and the indices of these individual elements, but instead, it prints "NO". Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
