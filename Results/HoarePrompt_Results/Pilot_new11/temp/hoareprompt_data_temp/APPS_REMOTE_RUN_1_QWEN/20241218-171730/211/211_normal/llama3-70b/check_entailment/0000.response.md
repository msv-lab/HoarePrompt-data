Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program fails to handle the case where the entire array has a sum of zero. Specifically, consider the input:

```
3
-1 -1 -1
```

In this case, the sum of the entire array is -3, which is not zero, so the array should be split into individual elements since each element's sum is non-zero. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because `prefix_sum[n]` is -3, not zero. To fix this, the program should check if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and handle this case appropriately by splitting the array into individual elements if necessary.
