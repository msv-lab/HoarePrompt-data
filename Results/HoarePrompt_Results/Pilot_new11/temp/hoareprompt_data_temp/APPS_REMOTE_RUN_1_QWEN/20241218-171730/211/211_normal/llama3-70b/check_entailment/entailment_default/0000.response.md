Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly split the array into subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero. Instead, it checks if the entire array sums to zero and prints "NO" if it does. If the array does not sum to zero, it incorrectly prints "YES" and tries to find a subarray with a non-zero sum, but it does not ensure that the subarrays meet the required conditions.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -2 2 -1
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```

However, the given code would print:
```
YES
1 1
2 4
```

This is incorrect because it does not split the array into multiple subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum. The code only prints the start and end indices of the entire array as a single subarray.

Therefore, the code does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
