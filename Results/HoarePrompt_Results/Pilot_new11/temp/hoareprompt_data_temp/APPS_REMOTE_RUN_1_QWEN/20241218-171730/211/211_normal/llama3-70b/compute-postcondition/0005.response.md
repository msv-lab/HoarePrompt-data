According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue (`n > 0`) must still hold true.

Given that the loop continues as long as `i < n`, and since `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the new state is:
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum[i + 2]` will be updated to `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]` because `i` will now be `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[i + 2]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]`**
