The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES'**
