Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the array contains only zeros. For example, consider the input:

```
1
0
```

The program will output "NO", which is incorrect because we can split the array into individual elements, each having a non-zero sum. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
