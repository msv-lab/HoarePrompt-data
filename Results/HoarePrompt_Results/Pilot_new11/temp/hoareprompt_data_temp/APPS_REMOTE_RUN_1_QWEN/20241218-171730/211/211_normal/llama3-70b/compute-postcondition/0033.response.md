The given code simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. These variables are not modified by the print statement; therefore, their values remain the same after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `k` is the number of times the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was met plus 1, `l` is the last value of `r` that satisfied the condition, or 1 if no such `r` exists, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, k, l, n are printed.**
