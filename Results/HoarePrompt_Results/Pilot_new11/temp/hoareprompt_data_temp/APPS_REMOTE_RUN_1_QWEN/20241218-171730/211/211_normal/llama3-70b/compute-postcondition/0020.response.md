The code `l = r` assigns the value of `r` to `l`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `prefix_sum`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `k` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to `r`.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `k` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to `r`**
