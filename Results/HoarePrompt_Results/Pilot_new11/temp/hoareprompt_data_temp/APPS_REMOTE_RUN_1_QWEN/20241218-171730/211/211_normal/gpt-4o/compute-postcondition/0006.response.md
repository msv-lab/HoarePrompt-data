The code `print('1', n)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `n`. Since the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it remains unchanged. The printed value does not affect the variables, but it does provide additional information. The output state includes the updated print statement but does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is not equal to 0; printed output is '1' followed by the value of `n`.**
