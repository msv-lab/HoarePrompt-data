According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0.
- `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- `k` is increased by 1.
- `l` is equal to `r + 1` if the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` is true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `r` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `r` will be `r + 1`.

Let's update the states step by step:

1. The current value of `r` is some integer value, say `x` (where `x` is the value of `r` at the end of the previous iteration).
2. For the loop to execute again, `r` should now be `x + 1`.
3. `n` must still be greater than 0.
4. `prefix_sum[r + 1]` must be not equal to 0.
5. `prefix_sum[r + 1]` must not be equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
6. `k` is increased by 1, so the new value of `k` is the previous value of `k` plus 1.
7. `l` is set to `r + 1` if the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` holds true. For the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `l`, but we know it will be updated based on the new value of `r`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0.
- `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- `k` is increased by 1, so the new value of `k` is the previous value of `k` plus 1.
- `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is increased by 1 (previous value + 1), and `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r`**.
