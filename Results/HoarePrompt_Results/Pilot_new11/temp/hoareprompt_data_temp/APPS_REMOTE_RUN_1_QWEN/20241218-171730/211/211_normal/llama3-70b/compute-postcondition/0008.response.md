`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. According to the initial state, `i` is now `previous_i + 1`, and `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `prefix_sum[previous_i + 2]` is updated to the new value of `prefix_sum[previous_i + 1] + a[previous_i + 1]; prefix_sum[previous_i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[previous_i] + a[previous_i]`**
