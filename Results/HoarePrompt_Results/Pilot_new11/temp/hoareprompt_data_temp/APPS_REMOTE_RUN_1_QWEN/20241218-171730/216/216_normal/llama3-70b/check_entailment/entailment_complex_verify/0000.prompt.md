You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. The program simply returns the count of lowercase letters in the string, regardless of their positions or the presence of uppercase letters between them. This approach fails to consider the constraints specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```
The program outputs `4`, which is incorrect because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions is `2` (positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8).

Another example:
```
12
zACaAbbaazzC
```
The program outputs `9`, which is incorrect because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions is `3` (positions 7, 8, and 11).

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to maintain a running count of distinct lowercase letters while iterating through the string and skipping over any uppercase letters that would violate the pretty set conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the string s. The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. It then enumerates through the string `s` to find all indices where the character is lowercase and prints the count of such indices. The function does not modify the input string `s`. If the input string `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, the output will be `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
