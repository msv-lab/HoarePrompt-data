The code `current_count += 1` increments the value of `current_count` by 1. Given the initial state, `current_count` was either 0 (if the current character was lowercase and not in `current_set`) or 1 (if the current character was lowercase and already in `current_set`). After the increment, `current_count` will be either 1 or 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is still a non-empty string, `max_count` remains the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` still contains the character `char`, and `current_count` is updated to either 1 or 2 based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` contains the character `char`, and `current_count` is either 1 or 2.**
