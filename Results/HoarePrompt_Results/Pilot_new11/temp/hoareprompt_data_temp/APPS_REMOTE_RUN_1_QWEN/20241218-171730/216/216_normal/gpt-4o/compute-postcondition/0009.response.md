The code `current_count += 1` increments the value of `current_count` by 1. The initial value of `current_count` is 0, so it will become 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing one character (the current character of `s`), the current character of `s` is lowercase, the current character of `s` is in `current_set`, `current_count` is 1.
