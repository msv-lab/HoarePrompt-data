Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. It then enumerates through the string `s` to find all indices where the character is lowercase and prints the count of such indices. The function does not modify the input string `s`. If the input string `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, the output will be `0`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string `s` is empty, the list `lowercase` will be empty, and the output will be `0`.
- If the input string `s` contains no lowercase letters, the list `lowercase` will also be empty, and the output will be `0`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle any error conditions, such as if the first input is not a valid integer. In practice, additional error handling should be included to manage such cases.
