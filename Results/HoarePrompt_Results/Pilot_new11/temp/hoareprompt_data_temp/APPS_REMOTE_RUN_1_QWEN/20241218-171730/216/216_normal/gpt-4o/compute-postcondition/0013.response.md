The code `current_set.clear()` clears the contents of the `current_set` set, making it an empty set again. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is max(0, `current_count`), `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
