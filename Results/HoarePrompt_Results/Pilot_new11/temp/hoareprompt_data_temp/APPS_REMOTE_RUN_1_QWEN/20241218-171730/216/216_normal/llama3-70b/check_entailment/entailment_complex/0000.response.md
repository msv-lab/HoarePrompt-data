Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string `s`, which does not ensure that the selected positions form a "pretty set" as defined in the problem statement.

To satisfy the problem description, the program should:
1. Identify all lowercase letters in the string.
2. Ensure that no uppercase letters are between the selected lowercase letters.
3. Determine the maximum number of such positions that can form a "pretty set".

The current implementation only counts the number of lowercase letters without considering the constraints about uppercase letters and the distinctness of characters within the set of positions. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
