Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` may contain the character `char` if it is a lowercase character, and `current_count` is either 1 or 2 if `char` was a lowercase character not previously in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` remains 0.***
