`current_count` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string with at least one more character, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, considering the new character, `current_set` may contain the new character if it was not already present, and `current_count` is the original value of `current_count` + 1.**
