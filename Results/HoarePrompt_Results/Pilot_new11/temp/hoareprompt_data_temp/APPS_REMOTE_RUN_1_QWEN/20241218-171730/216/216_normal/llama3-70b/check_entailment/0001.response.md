Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. For example, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the program would output 4 because it only checks for distinct lowercase letters without considering the presence of uppercase letters between them. The correct output should be 2, as the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions is 2 (positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8). The program needs to filter out the positions with uppercase letters before considering the distinct lowercase letters.
