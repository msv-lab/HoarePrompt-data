The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the string `s`, and the second line contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. 

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function does not perform any operation internally since the problem description does not specify any processing or transformation of the input string `s`. Therefore, the function's primary role appears to be reading the input rather than performing operations.

Given the lack of internal logic, we can conclude that the function simply reads the specified input and does not return anything explicitly described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters as input.**
