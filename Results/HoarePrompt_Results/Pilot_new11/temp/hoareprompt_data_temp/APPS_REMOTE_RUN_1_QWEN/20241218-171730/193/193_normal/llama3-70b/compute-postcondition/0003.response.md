Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the standard input, where \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). It then calculates the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \), and prints this value to the standard output. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output. Potential edge cases include inputs that do not meet the specified constraints, which would result in unexpected behavior since no validation is performed within the function.**
