Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \(x\) into an equilateral triangle of side length \(y\), where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). Each operation consists of changing the length of a single side to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).

However, the provided program simply calculates and prints \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\). This expression does not account for the constraints of forming a non-degenerate triangle during the transformations. Specifically, it does not consider the necessary steps to maintain the triangle inequality throughout the process.

For instance, consider the following examples:

- For input `6 3`, the expected output should be `4` as shown in the problem description, but the program incorrectly outputs `1` because \((6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

- For input `8 5`, the expected output is `3`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1` because \((8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

- For input `22 4`, the expected output is `6`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1` because \((22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) \% 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 \% 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`.

The program fails to implement the logic required to ensure that each intermediate step forms a valid triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
