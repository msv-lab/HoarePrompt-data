Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into an equilateral triangle of side length \( y \) by modifying one side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides remain integers and form a valid triangle).

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \) and prints it, which is incorrect because it does not account for the constraints of forming a valid triangle during the transformation process. For example, consider the input:

- Input: `6 3`
- Expected Output: `4` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `3`

The program output `3` because \(|6 - 3| = 3\), but the correct transformation sequence involves more steps to ensure the triangle remains valid at each step. The correct transformation sequence for `6 3` would be:

1. Start with (6, 6, 6)
2. Change one side to 5: (6, 6, 5)
3. Change another side to 4: (6, 5, 5)
4. Change the last side to 3: (5, 5, 3)
5. Final valid triangle: (3, 3, 3)

This requires 4 steps, not 3. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
