The code snippet calculates and prints `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. Let's break it down:

1. `(x - y) // 2` performs integer division, which gives the quotient of the subtraction without considering the remainder.
2. `(x - y) % 2` gives the remainder when `(x - y)` is divided by 2.

Adding these two results together gives us the output. Since both operations involve the difference between `x` and `y`, the final result is simply the absolute value of `(x - y)` when divided by 2 and rounded up.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `abs(x - y) // 2 + abs(x - y) % 2`, which is equivalent to `abs(x - y)`.

The output of the print statement will be the absolute value of the difference between `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, the output is abs(x - y)**
