The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Since the input is not provided in this scenario, let's denote the input integers as `a` and `b` respectively. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be the integers `a` and `b`.

The initial conditions are that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. After the code executes, these conditions are no longer applicable since the values of `x` and `y` are now determined by the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input**
