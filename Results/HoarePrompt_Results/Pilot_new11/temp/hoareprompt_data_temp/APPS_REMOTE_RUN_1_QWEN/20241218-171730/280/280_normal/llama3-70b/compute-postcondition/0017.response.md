The initial state includes:
- `v1` is an integer input
- `v2` is an integer input
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
- `max_speed` is \(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d\)
- `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\)
- `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`
- `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`
- `i` is 1

The code snippet changes the value of `max_speed`:
```python
max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
```

Let's analyze the impact:

1. The value of `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_speed - d`) and `min_speed`.
2. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, `max_length`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Thus, the new value of `max_speed` is:
\[ \text{max\_speed} = \max(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)) \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ \text{max\_speed} = \max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)) \]

The other variables remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\), `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`, `i` is 1**
