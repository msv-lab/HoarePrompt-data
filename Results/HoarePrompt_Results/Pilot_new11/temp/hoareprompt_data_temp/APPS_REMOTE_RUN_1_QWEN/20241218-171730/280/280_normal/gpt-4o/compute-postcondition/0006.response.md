The code updates the `speeds` list at index `i` based on the formula `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. Given the initial state:

- `v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros
- `i` is 1

Since `i` is 1, the code updates `speeds[1]`:
- `speeds[1]` was initially 0 (since the rest of the list is filled with zeros).
- `speeds[0]` is `v1`.
- The updated value of `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 1 - 1) * d)` which simplifies to `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.

Therefore, the updated `speeds` list is `[v1, min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), 0, 0, ..., 0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**
