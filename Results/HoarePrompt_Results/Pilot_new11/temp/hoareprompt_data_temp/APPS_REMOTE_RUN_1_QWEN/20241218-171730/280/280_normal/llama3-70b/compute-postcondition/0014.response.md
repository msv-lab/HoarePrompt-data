Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `v1` is an integer input
   - `v2` is an integer input
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
   - `max_speed` is \(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d\)
   - `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\)
   - `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`
   - `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`
   - `i` is 2

2. The code snippet given is:
   ```python
   max_length += max_speed
   ```

3. The line `max_length += max_speed` increments `max_length` by the value of `max_speed`.

Given this, let's update the values:
- `max_length` is initially `max_length + max_speed`, but now it is updated to `max_length + max_speed + max_speed`, which simplifies to `max_length + 2 * max_speed`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, we only need to update the value of `max_length`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d\), `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`, `i` is 2**
