The code updates the value of `speeds[3]` using the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `i` is 3
- `speeds[0]` is `v1`
- `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`
- `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`

Let's substitute these into the formula for `speeds[3]`:

\[ \text{speeds}[3] = \min(\text{speeds}[2] + d, v2 + (t - 3 - 1) \cdot d) = \min(\text{speeds}[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) \cdot d) \]

Given that `speeds[2]` is defined as:

\[ \text{speeds}[2] = \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) \cdot d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) \cdot d) \]

So, the final value of `speeds[3]` depends on the minimum of `speeds[2] + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[3]` is `\min(\text{speeds}[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) \cdot d)`, `speeds[4]` to `speeds[t-1]` are zeros, and `i` is 3**
