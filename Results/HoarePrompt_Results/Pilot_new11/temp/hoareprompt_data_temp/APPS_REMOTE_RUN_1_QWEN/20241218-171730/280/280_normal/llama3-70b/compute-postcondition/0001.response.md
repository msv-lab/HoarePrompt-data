`v1` and `v2` remain as inputs, but `t` and `d` are reassigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The original values of `v1` and `v2` are not affected, and the constraints for `t` and `d` (2 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ d ≤ 10) still apply.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `t` is the first integer from the input, `d` is the second integer from the input**
