`min_length` is assigned the value `min_speed * t`. Since `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `min_length` is updated accordingly. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is max(`v1`, `v2`), `min_speed` is min(`v1`, `v2`), `min_length` is min_speed * t**
