The code initializes a list `speeds` with `t` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not change the values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, or `d`. Therefore, the values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `t` remains an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` remains an integer between 0 and 10.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `v2` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros.**
