The code prints the value of `total_distance`. The value of `total_distance` is the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list. The `speeds` list is defined such that `speeds[0]` is `v1`, and each subsequent speed is calculated using the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.

Given the range constraints for the initial values, let's denote the values as follows for clarity:
- `v1` is an integer in the range [1, 100]
- `v2` is an integer in the range [1, 100]
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10

After calculating the `speeds` list, the value of `total_distance` will be printed. However, since the exact values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not specified, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`total_distance` is the sum of the list `speeds`, which is calculated as described; `v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, and `speeds[i]` for `i` from 1 to `t-1` is `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d); the value of `total_distance` is printed.**
