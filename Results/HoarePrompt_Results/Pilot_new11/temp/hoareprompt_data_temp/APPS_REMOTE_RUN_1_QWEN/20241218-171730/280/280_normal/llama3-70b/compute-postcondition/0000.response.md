The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t` and `d` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `v1` and `v2` based on user input, while `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10**
