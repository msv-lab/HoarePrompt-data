`t` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The input is in the form of two integers separated by a space, which are then assigned to `t` and `d` respectively. The variables `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `v2` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers.**
