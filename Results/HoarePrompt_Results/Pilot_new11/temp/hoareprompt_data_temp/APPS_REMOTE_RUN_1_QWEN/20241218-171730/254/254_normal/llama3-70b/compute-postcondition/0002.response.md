According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. After the previous iteration, we know that `b` has taken the value of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still be non-zero.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is not zero.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500.

2. **After Execution**:
   - `a` takes the value of `b` from the previous iteration.
   - `b` takes the value of `a % b`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is not zero.
   - `b` is `a % b`.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `b` is non-zero.
   - Since `b` is now `a % b`, for the loop to execute one more time, `a % b` must be non-zero.

Given this information, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `b` is non-zero after the previous operation.

Therefore, the updated state should be:
- `a` is not zero.
- `b` must be non-zero (i.e., `a % b` must be non-zero).
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`a` is not zero, `b` must be non-zero (i.e., `a % b` must be non-zero), `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500**.
