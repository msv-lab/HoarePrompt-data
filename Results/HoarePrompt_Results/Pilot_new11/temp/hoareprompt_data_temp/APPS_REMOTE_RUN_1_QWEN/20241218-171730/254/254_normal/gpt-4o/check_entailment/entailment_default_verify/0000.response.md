Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to light at least one garland every second after they are turned on. The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from standard input, calculates the GCD of these values, and prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, indicating that it is possible to light at least one garland every second. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the output hints provided. The program handles all valid inputs within the specified range correctly, as confirmed by the output hints and the problem constraints.
