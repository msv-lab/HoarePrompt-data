Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of LCM**: 
   - The program attempts to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{lcm}(k1, k2, k3) = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)} \).
   - However, the GCD calculation is implemented incorrectly. The function `func_1` only computes the GCD of two numbers, not the LCM as required. The LCM should be calculated as \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \), and this needs to be applied iteratively for three numbers.

2. **Logic for Checking LCM**:
   - Even if the LCM were correctly computed, the logic for checking if the LCM is divisible by `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is flawed. The condition `lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` is unnecessary and does not solve the problem as stated.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves finding a set of starting times for each garland such that their states overlap sufficiently. Specifically, Mishka can achieve the desired outcome if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three periods is 1. This means that the periods should be relatively prime (no common divisors other than 1).

4. **Implementation**:
   - To check if the periods are relatively prime, compute the GCD of all three periods:
     ```python
     import math

     def are_gcd_one(k1, k2, k3):
         gcd1 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
         gcd2 = math.gcd(gcd1, k3)
         return gcd2 == 1

     (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
     if are_gcd_one(k1, k2, k3):
         print('YES')
     else:
         print('NO')
     ```

In summary, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the garlands can be turned on such that they are lit at every second. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
