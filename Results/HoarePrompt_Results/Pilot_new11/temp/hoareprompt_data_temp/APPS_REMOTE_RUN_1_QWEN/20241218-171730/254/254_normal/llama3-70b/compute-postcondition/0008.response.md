The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq 1500\) for \(i = 1, 2\). If `b` is 0, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is `a` if `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is `a` if `b` is 0.**
