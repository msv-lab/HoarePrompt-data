Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to determine if it is possible to light at least one garland every second does not accurately reflect the requirements. The code attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{lcm} = \frac{k_1 \times k_2 \times k_3}{\text{gcd}(k_1, k_2) \times \text{gcd}(k_2, k_3) \times \text{gcd}(k_1, k_3)} \), but this is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to light at least one garland every second.

For example, consider the input `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 3`, and `k3 = 4`. The LCM calculation would fail because the formula does not guarantee that the calculated LCM will ensure that at least one garland is lit every second. Instead, a more accurate approach would be to check if the maximum of the individual intervals is less than or equal to 1, or if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two intervals plus the third interval is greater than 1.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample:
- Input: `2 2 3`
- Expected output: `YES`
- Actual output: The provided code would incorrectly return `NO` because the LCM calculation fails to capture the correct logic.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the solution for all potential cases, making the program incorrect.
