`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which splits the input string into individual components and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the input values for `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not specified in the initial state, they remain as placeholders for the actual input values. The original values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are replaced by the input values, but their constraints (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500) still apply.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are the integer values obtained from the input split, and they satisfy 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i in {1, 2, 3}.**
