Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to check if the states of the garlands will eventually overlap to cover all seconds is sound. The program handles all valid inputs within the specified range correctly, as confirmed by the output hints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
