The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (with constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively reduces the problem of finding the GCD by replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns this GCD. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is 0; in such cases, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD.
