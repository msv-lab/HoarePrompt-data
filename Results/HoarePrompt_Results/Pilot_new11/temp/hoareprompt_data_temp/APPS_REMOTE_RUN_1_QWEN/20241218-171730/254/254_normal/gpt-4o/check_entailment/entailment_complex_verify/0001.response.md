Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from standard input, where each integer is constrained to be between 1 and 1500 inclusive. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit.

The logic in the code is sound:
- If the GCD of the three integers is 1, it means that the states of the garlands will eventually overlap to cover all seconds, allowing at least one garland to be lit at any given second.
- If the GCD is greater than 1, it means there will be gaps where no garland is lit, making it impossible to satisfy the condition.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The annotated version supports the correctness of the original assessment, and there are no issues identified that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description.
