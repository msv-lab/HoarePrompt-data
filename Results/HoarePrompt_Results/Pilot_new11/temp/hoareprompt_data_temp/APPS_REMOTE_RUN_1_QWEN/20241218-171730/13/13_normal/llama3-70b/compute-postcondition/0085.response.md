`beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `beauty` was initially the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` plus (1 or 2), which means it is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 5, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + 2, `left` remains the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` remains `n`, `max_beauty` remains the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, and `golden` remains a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
