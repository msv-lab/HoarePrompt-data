Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is less than `right`, and `right` is equal to the length of `s`. The character at `s[right]` is not 'G'.***
