According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i-1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `i-1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is at least 2.
- `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters.
- `beauty` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `j` at the end of the last iteration.
2. The condition for the loop to continue.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - `i` is at least 2.
   - `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters.
   - `beauty` is incremented or remains unchanged based on the character at index `j`.

2. **End of Last Iteration:**
   - The loop will end when `j` becomes less than 0, i.e., `j < 0`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be at least 0 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` should be 0.

Given that the loop starts at `i-1` and decrements `j` until it reaches 0, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be 0.

4. **Other States:**
   - `i` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `beauty` may have been incremented depending on the character at index `j`, but we do not know the exact value unless specified. However, we know the condition for incrementing.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is at least 2.
- `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters.
- `beauty` may have been incremented by 1, but its exact value is not known without further information.
- `j` is 0.

State: **`i` is at least 2, `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged, and `j` is 0.**
