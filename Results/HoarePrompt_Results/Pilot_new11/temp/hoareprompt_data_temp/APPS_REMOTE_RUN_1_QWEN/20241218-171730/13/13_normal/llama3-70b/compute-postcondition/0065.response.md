According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of the character at the current index in the string `s`. The loop iterates backward from `i-1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 1. Otherwise, the loop breaks out and no change is made to `beauty`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Value of `j`**: The loop starts from `i-1` (which is 0) and goes down to `-1`. Since `j` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, the loop will continue to the next iteration only if `j` is decreased to `-1` and the loop condition (`j >= -1`) still holds true.

2. **Value of `beauty`**: If the character at index `j` in string `s` was 'G' during the last iteration, `beauty` would be 1. However, since the loop breaks out if the character is not 'G', the value of `beauty` remains unchanged unless the character at index `j` is 'G'.

Given that `j` starts from 0 and decreases to `-1`, the loop will execute one more time only if `j` is decreased to `-1`. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `-1`, and the loop will check if the character at index `-1` in string `s` is 'G'. If it is 'G', `beauty` will be 1; otherwise, it will remain 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 1. Otherwise, `beauty` is 0.**
