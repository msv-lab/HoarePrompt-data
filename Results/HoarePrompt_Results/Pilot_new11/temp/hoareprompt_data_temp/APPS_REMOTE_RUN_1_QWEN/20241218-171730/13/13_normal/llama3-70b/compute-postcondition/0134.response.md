`beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` and `s` remains unchanged, and the loop or if-else block condition ensures that if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the value of `beauty` remains the same as before the increment.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters, `beauty` is incremented by 1**
