The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Initially, `beauty` is not specified, but since no initial value for `beauty` is given, we assume it is 0 (as it is a common starting point for such variables). After the line `beauty += 1` is executed, `beauty` becomes 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, the loop will continue executing because `j` starts from 0 and decrements to -1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'; `beauty` is 1**
