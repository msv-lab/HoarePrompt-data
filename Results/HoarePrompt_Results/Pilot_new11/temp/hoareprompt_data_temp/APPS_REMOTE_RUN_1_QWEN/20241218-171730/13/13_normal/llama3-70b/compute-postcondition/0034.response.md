Postcondition: **\( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', \( golden \) is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G', \( max_beauty \) is the maximum of its current value and \( curr_beauty \), \( left \) is the index of the first 'G' in the string \( s \) if there is at least one 'G', otherwise \( left = n \), \( right = 1 \), and \( curr_beauty = 0 \), and the current value of \( left \) is less than \( right \)**
