Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'. After executing the if-else block, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. If `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not 'G', `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the old value of `curr_beauty`. The values of `left` and `right` remain as 0 unless otherwise specified within the block, and no other variables are modified outside the specified conditions.***
