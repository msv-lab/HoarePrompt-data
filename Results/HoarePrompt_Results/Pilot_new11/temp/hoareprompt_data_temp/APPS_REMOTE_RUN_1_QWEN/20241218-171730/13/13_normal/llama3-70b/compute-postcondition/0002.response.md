The code creates a list `golden` that contains the indices of all characters in the string `s` that are equal to 'G'. The length of `golden` will be the number of times 'G' appears in `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and `s` remains unchanged. 

So, the updated state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', and `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
