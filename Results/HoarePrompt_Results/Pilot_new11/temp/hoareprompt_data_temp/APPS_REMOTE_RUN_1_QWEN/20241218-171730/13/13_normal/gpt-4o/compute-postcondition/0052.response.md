The code `curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]` assigns the values from the tuple at index `i` in the `segments` list to the variables `curr_start` and `curr_end`. This means `curr_start` will take the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, and `curr_end` will take the value of the second element of the same tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S',
- `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string,
- `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found,
- `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`,
- `len(segments)` must be greater than 1,
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`;
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.

After executing the line of code, the following changes occur:
- `curr_start` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
- `curr_end` is assigned the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `len(segments)` must be greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.**
