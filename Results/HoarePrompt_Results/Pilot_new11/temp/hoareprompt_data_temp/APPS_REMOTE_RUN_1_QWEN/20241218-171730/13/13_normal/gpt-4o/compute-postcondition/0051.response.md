The code assigns the values from the tuple `segments[i - 1]` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`. Since `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's, and `i - 1` refers to the previous segment, `prev_start` and `prev_end` will take the values from the tuple at index `i - 1` in the `segments` list. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated values for `prev_start` and `prev_end`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, and `len(segments)` must be greater than 1; `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.**
