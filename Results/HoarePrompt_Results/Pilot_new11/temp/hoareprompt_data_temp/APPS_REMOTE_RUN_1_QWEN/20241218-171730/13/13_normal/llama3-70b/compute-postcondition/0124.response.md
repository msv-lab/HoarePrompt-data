Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is either `i + 2` (if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is false) or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1` (if the condition is true). `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, incremented by 1 for each 'G' encountered within the range, and unchanged otherwise. `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged; `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its original value and `beauty`.***
