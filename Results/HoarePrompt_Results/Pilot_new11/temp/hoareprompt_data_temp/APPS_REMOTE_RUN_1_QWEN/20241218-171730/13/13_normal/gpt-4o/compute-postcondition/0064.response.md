The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable by taking the maximum value between its current value and the computed value `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. This computation involves the differences between the start and end points of two consecutive segments plus one for each segment.

Given the initial state:
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
- `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.

After executing the code, the `max_length` variable is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new computed value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the computed value as `computed_value`:
\[ \text{computed\_value} = curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1 \]
\[ \text{computed\_value} = curr_end - curr_start + prev_end - prev_start + 3 \]

The `max_length` variable is now set to the maximum of its current value and this `computed_value`.

Output State: **`max_length` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_end - curr_start + prev_end - prev_start + 3`, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.**
