Postcondition: ***`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and (curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1). Otherwise, the values of `max_length`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged.***
