Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `j` is `i + 3`
   - `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = i + 2` to `j = n - 1`.
   - The loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `i + 4`.
   - The conditions for `beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`j` is `i + 4`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged. `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.**
