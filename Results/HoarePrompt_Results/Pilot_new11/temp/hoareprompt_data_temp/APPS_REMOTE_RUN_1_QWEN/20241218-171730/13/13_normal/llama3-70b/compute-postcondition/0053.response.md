Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all possible iterations.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
- \( golden \) is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G'.
- \( max\_beauty \) is 0.
- \( curr\_beauty \) is 0.
- \( left \) is 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `right`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the operations inside the loop:
1. If `s[right] == 'G'`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
2. If `s[right] != 'G'`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the old value of `curr_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` is reset to 0. Additionally, `left` is adjusted to point to the next 'G' in the string, or to `n` if no more 'G's are found.

### Final Iterations Analysis
- After the loop finishes, `curr_beauty` will be the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in the string `s`.
- `max_beauty` will be the maximum value of `curr_beauty` seen during the loop.
- `left` will be the index of the last 'G' in the string, or `n` if there are no 'G's in the string.
- `right` will be `n` because the loop terminates after processing the last character.

### Final Values
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `golden` remains unchanged.
- `max_beauty` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in the string `s`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0 because the loop has finished.
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's.
- `right` is `n`.

### Output State
The final state of the loop after all iterations will be:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, and `right` is `n`.**
