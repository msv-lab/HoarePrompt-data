`beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered. After the increment, `beauty` becomes the count of 'G' characters in that same substring plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer; `s` is a string; `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered plus 1; `j` is `i + 4`; `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.**
