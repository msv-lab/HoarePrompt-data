Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states should be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- **Initial States:**
  - \( i \) is 1
  - \( j \) is 4
  - \( beauty \) is the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + (1 or 2)
  - \( left \) is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's
  - \( right \) is `n`
  - \( max_beauty \) is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
  - \( curr_beauty \) is incremented by 1
  - \( max_beauty_one_swap \) is 0
  - \( golden \) is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
  - The current value of `s[j]` is 'G'

- **Loop:**
  ```
  for j in range(i + 2, n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:

1. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) is 4.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as \( j \) is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, \( j \) needs to be incremented by 1 (since \( j \) starts from \( i + 2 \)).

3. **Incrementing `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments \( j \) by 1 each time it runs, the new value of \( j \) will be \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).

4. **Other States:**
   - \( i \) remains unchanged at 1.
   - \( s[j] \) (where \( j \) is now 5) will be checked in the next iteration.
   - All other states (`beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `golden`) remain the same unless the loop body changes them.

### Updated States for Next Iteration:
- **`i` is 1**
- **`j` is 5**
- **`beauty` remains the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + (1 or 2)**
- **`left` remains the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's**
- **`right` remains `n`**
- **`max_beauty` remains the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`**
- **`curr_beauty` remains incremented by 1**
- **`max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0**
- **`golden` remains a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'**

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 5, `beauty` remains the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + (1 or 2), `left` remains the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` remains `n`, `max_beauty` remains the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` remains incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, and `golden` remains a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
