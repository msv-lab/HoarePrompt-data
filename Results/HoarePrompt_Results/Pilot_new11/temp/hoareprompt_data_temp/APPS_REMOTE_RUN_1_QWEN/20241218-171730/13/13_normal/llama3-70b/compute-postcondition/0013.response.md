The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1 (since it was originally 0 and incremented by 1), `right` is at least 1 and `s[right]` is not 'G'.**
