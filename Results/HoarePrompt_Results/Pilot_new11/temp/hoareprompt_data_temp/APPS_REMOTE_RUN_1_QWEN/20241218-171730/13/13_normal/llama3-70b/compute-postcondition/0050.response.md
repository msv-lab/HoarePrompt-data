`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `curr_beauty` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`left` is the original value of `left` + `n` (since the loop continues until `left` is equal to `right`), `right` is `k + 1`, `s[left]` is 'G' (if there is at least one 'G' in the string `s`), `golden` is unchanged, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 1, and `left` is less than `right`**
