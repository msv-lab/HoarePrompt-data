Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 5, `beauty` remains the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + (1 or 2), `left` remains the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` remains `n`, `max_beauty` remains the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, and `golden` remains a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'. If `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 and the index `j` is added to the list `golden`. Otherwise, the loop or statement is exited.**
