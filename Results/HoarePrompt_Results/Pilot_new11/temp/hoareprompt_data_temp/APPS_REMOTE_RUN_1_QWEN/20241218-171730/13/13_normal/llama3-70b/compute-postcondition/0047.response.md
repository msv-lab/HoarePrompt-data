The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Given the precondition that `left` must still be less than `right` and `s[left]` must not be 'G', the new value of `left` must also satisfy these conditions.

Let's assume the original state was `left = k` (where `k` is some integer such that `k < right` and `s[k] != 'G'`). After executing `left += 1`, the new value of `left` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, this new value must still be less than `right` and not equal to 'G'.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `left` is now `left + 1`
- The condition `left < right` must still hold
- The condition `s[left] != 'G'` must still hold

Output State: **`left` is `left + 1`; `left < right`; `s[left] != 'G'`**
