To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

Given state before the for loop:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is -1
- `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's
- `right` is `n`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0
- `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'

The loop statement:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 2`.
   - Given `i = 1`, the initial value of `j` should be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - Since the initial value of `j` is `-1`, we need to adjust it to `3`.

2. **Loop condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
   - For the loop to run, `j` must eventually become less than `n`.
   - Given `i = 1` and `j` starting at `-1`, `j` will eventually reach `3` (as calculated above), but we need to ensure it continues to increase and eventually becomes less than `n`.

3. **Variables that remain unchanged within the loop:**
   - `i`, `beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly.
   - However, `j` needs to be adjusted to start from `3` and continue increasing until it is less than `n`.

Conclusion:
The key adjustment needed is ensuring that `j` starts from the correct value and continues to satisfy the loop condition `j < n`.

Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
