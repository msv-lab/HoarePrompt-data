Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates backward from `i-1` to `-1` in the string `s`.
- It increments `beauty` each time it encounters a 'G'.
- Once it encounters an 'S' or reaches the start of the string, it breaks out of the loop.
- After the loop completes, `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `i-1` up to the first 'S' or the end of the string.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged from their initial or previous values because they are not modified within the loop.
