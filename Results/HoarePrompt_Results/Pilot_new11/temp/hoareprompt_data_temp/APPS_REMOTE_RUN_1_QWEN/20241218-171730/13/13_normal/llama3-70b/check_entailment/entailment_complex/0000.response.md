Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum possible beauty after at most one swap is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Initial Calculation (`max_beauty`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the initial maximum beauty by iterating through the string and counting consecutive 'G's. However, this calculation alone does not account for the possibility of improving the beauty by swapping a 'S' to a 'G'.

2. **Calculation of `max_beauty_one_swap`**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum beauty possible after one swap by looking at each occurrence of 'G' followed by 'S' and checking the lengths of consecutive 'G's on both sides of this pair. However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all possible cases.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Logic for `max_beauty_one_swap`**:
  - The current implementation checks for pairs of 'G' followed by 'S' and extends the count of consecutive 'G's on both sides. However, this does not cover all possible scenarios where a swap could improve the maximum beauty. For instance, consider a string like "GGSGG". Swapping the 'S' between the two 'G's would increase the maximum beauty from 3 to 5, but the current logic does not detect this.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the input:
```
GGSGG
```
- The initial `max_beauty` is 3.
- The `max_beauty_one_swap` logic only checks the 'G' at index 1 and does not consider the optimal swap between the 'G's at indices 1 and 3.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible swaps of 'S' to 'G' and calculate the new maximum beauty for each swap, keeping track of the best result. Hereâ€™s a more comprehensive approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    left, right = 0, 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, right - left + 1)
        else:
            left = right + 1
    
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(len(golden_indices)):
        if i > 0:
            start = golden_indices[i - 1] + 1
            end = golden_indices[i]
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, end - start + 1)
        
        if i < len(golden_indices) - 1:
            start = golden_indices[i]
            end = golden_indices[i + 1] - 1
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, end - start + 1)
    
    # Consider the case where a 'S' can be swapped to extend the segment
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'S':
            for j in range(n):
                if s[j] == 'G' and i < j:
                    temp_s = list(s)
                    temp_s[i] = 'G'
                    temp_s[j] = 'S'
                    new_beauty = 0
                    left, right = 0, 0
                    for right in range(n):
                        if temp_s[right] == 'G':
                            new_beauty = max(new_beauty, right - left + 1)
                        else:
                            left = right + 1
                    max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, new_beauty)
    
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))
```

This updated code ensures that all possible swaps are considered and the maximum beauty is accurately calculated.
