The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Given that the initial state includes `j` being `i + 3`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged, the `break` statement simply breaks out of the loop without altering these conditions.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise unchanged, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
