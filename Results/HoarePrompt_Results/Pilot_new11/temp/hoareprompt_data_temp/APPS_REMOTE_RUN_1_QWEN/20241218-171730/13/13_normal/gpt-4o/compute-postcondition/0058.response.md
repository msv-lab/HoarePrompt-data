The code assigns the tuple at index `i` in `segments` to the variables `curr_start` and `curr_end`. This means that `curr_start` will take the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, and `curr_end` will take the value of the second element of the same tuple.

The initial states are:
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`

After executing the code, the new states are:
- `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`
- `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`

The previous states (`prev_start` and `prev_end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`**
