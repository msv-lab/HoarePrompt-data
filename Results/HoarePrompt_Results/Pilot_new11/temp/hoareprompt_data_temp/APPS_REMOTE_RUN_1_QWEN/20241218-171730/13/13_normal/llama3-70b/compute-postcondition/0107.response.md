To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given code and the initial state of the variables.

### Initial State:
- \( i \) is a non-negative integer.
- \( j \) is \( n \).
- \( beauty \) is 1.
- \( left \) is the index of the last 'G' in the string \( s \), or \( n \) if there are no 'G's.
- \( right \) is \( n \).
- \( max\_beauty \) is the maximum of its current value and \( curr\_beauty \).
- \( max\_beauty\_one\_swap \) is \( beauty \) if \( beauty > 0 \), else 0.
- \( golden \) is a list of indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G'.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop starts from \( j = i - 1 \) and decrements \( j \) until it reaches 0 or finds a non-'G' character.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - If \( s[j] == 'G' \), \( beauty \) is incremented by 1.
   - If \( s[j] != 'G' \), the loop breaks immediately.

### After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- From the given output states, we can infer that the loop will continue to decrement \( j \) and increment \( beauty \) as long as \( s[j] \) is 'G'.
- Once a non-'G' character is encountered, the loop exits.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when \( j \) becomes less than 0 (i.e., \( j \) is -1).
- At this point, \( beauty \) will be the count of consecutive 'G's starting from \( i - 1 \) and going backwards to the first non-'G' character or the start of the string.

### Final Values:
- \( j \) will be -1 (or equivalently, the loop will have exited without further decrementation).
- \( beauty \) will be the count of consecutive 'G's from \( i - 1 \) to the first non-'G' character.
- \( left \) remains unchanged unless modified elsewhere in the program.
- \( right \) remains unchanged unless modified elsewhere in the program.
- \( max\_beauty \) and \( max\_beauty\_one\_swap \) are not directly affected by this loop but might be updated elsewhere.
- \( golden \) remains unchanged unless modified elsewhere in the program.

### Output State:
Output State: **`j` is -1, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` are unchanged.**

This state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
