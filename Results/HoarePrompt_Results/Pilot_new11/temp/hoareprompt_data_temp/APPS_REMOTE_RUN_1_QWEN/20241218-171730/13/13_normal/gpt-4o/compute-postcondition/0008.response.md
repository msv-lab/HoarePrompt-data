The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 2 and `trophies[2]` must be 'G', these conditions remain unchanged. The only affected variable is `i`, which is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `trophies[2]` is 'G', `i` is increased by 1**
