`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so it is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is less than `right`, and `right` is equal to the length of `s`. The character at `s[right]` is not 'G'.**
