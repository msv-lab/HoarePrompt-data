The code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` updates `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since the exact value of `curr_beauty` is not specified, we can only say that `max_beauty` will be updated to be the larger of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at `s[right]` is not 'G'.**
