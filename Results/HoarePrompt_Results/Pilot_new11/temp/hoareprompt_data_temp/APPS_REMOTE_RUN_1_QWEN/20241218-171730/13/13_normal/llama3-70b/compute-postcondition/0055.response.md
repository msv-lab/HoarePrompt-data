The code initializes `max_beauty_one_swap` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.**
