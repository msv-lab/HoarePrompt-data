Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered. If `s[j]` (where `j = i + 3`) is 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `beauty` remains unchanged. `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.***
