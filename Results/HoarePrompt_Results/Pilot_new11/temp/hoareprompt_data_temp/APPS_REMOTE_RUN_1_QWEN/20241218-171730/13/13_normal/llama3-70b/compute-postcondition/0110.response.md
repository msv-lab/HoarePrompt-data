The `beauty` variable is incremented by 1 because the code `beauty += 1` increases the value of `beauty` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state includes the following details: `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, and `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` are unchanged. After the code execution, `beauty` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character plus 1, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` are unchanged, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'**
