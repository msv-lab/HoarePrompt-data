The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the current loop or block. Since there is no loop or block context in the given initial state, the break statement simply indicates that we exit the current loop or block structure if one exists. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `s` is a string with at least `i - 1` characters, and `s[j]` is not equal to 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
