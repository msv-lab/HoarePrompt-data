`curr_beauty` is initialized to 0, which means it replaces its current value (if any) with 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `curr_beauty` is 0.**
