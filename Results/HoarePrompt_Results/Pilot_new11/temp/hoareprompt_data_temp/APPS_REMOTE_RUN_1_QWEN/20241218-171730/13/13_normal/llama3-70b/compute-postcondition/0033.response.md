Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'
- \( golden \) is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G'
- \( max_beauty \) is the maximum of its current value and \( curr_beauty \)
- \( left \) is 0
- \( right \) is 1
- \( curr_beauty \) is 0

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as \( left < right \) and \( s[left] \neq 'G' \).

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - \( left = 0 \)
   - \( right = 1 \)
   - Since \( s[0] \neq 'G' \), the loop executes.
   - \( left \) is incremented by 1, so \( left = 1 \).
   - \( right \) remains unchanged, so \( right = 1 \).
   - \( curr_beauty \) remains unchanged, so \( curr_beauty = 0 \).

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - \( left = 1 \)
   - \( right = 1 \)
   - Since \( left < right \) is false and \( s[1] \neq 'G' \) is irrelevant, the loop does not execute.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - \( left = 1 \)
   - \( right = 1 \)
   - The loop condition \( left < right \) is false, so the loop does not execute.

From the above steps, we can see that the loop will continue to increment \( left \) until it finds a character 'G' in the string \( s \). Once a 'G' is found, the loop stops executing.

### Final Output State:
- \( n \) remains unchanged, so \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( s \) remains unchanged, so it is a string of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'
- \( golden \) is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G'
- \( max_beauty \) remains unchanged, so it is the maximum of its current value and \( curr_beauty \)
- \( left \) will be the index of the first 'G' in the string \( s \) if there is at least one 'G'. If there are no 'G's, \( left \) will be equal to \( n \).
- \( right \) remains unchanged, so \( right = 1 \)
- \( curr_beauty \) remains unchanged, so \( curr_beauty = 0 \)

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
Output State: **\( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', \( golden \) is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in \( s \) that are equal to 'G', \( max_beauty \) is the maximum of its current value and \( curr_beauty \), \( left \) is the index of the first 'G' in the string \( s \) if there is at least one 'G', otherwise \( left = n \), \( right = 1 \), and \( curr_beauty = 0 \)**
