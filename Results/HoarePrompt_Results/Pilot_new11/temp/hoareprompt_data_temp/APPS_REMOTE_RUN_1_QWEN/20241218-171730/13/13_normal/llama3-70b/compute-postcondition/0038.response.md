Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's).
- `right` is 1 initially.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `right` from 1 to `n-1`.

### Loop Body Adjustments:
- If `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `curr_beauty` is set to 1.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's).
- `right` is the index of the character that was checked in the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `right` starts at 1.
   - The loop increments `right` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume `right` was at position `k` in the previous iteration.
   - If `s[k]` was 'G', `curr_beauty` was increased by 1.
   - If `s[k]` was 'S', `curr_beauty` was reset to 1.
   - `max_beauty` was updated if necessary.
   - `left` remains unchanged unless `s[k]` was 'G' and it became the new `left`.

3. **Start of Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `right` will be `k + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `golden` remains the same.
- `max_beauty` remains the same unless `s[k+1]` is 'G' and `curr_beauty` is increased.
- `left` remains the same unless `s[k+1]` is 'G' and it becomes the new `left`.
- `right` changes to `k + 1`.

### Final State:
- `right` is now `k + 1`.
- `max_beauty` may be the same or updated based on the value of `s[k+1]`.
- `left` may be the same or updated based on the value of `s[k+1]`.

### Example Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's), and `right` is `k + 1`.**

Note: The exact value of `k` would depend on the specific string `s` and the previous iterations, but the state format should reflect the updated `right` and potential updates to `max_beauty` and `left`.
