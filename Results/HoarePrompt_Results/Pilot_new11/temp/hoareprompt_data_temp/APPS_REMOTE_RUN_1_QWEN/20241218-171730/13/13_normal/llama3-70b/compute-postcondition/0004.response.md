`curr_beauty` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `max_beauty` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0.**
