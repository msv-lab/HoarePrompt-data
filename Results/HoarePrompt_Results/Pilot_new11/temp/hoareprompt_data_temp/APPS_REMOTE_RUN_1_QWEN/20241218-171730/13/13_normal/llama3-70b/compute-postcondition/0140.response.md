Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 2, `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged, and `j` is 0. The overall postcondition does not change whether the if condition is true or false due to the else part ensuring the same behavior in both cases.***
