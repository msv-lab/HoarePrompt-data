The code snippet updates the value of `max_length` by calculating the maximum length of consecutive 'G's considering the current segment and the previous segment. Given that `curr_start` is 2 more than `prev_end`, the formula calculates the combined length of the two segments plus one.

Let's denote the previous segment as `(prev_start, prev_end)` and the current segment as `(curr_start, curr_end)`. We know that `curr_start = prev_end + 2`.

The updated `max_length` is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{curr\_start} + 1 + (\text{prev\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 1) + 1) \]

Since `curr_start = prev_end + 2`, we can substitute `curr_start` with `prev_end + 2` in the formula:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - (\text{prev\_end} + 2) + 1 + (\text{prev\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 1) + 1) \]
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{prev\_end} - 2 + 1 + \text{prev\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 1 + 1) \]
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 2) \]

Therefore, the updated value of `max_length` depends on the current and previous segments. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `max_length` is updated to \(\max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 2)\), `len(segments)` must be greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.**
