The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was previously undefined in the initial state, it is now assigned to 1. The conditions involving `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The current value of `s[j]` being 'G' also remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `beauty` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'**
