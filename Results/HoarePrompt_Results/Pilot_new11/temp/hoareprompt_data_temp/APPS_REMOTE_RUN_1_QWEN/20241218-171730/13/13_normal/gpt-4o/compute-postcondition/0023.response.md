The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` is initially set to `start + 3`. After the increment, `i` will become `(start + 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `start + 4`.

The other conditions and variables remain unchanged:
- `trophies[start + 2] == 'G'`
- `n` must be greater than `start + 4`
- `trophies[start + 4] == 'G'`

Output State: **`i` is `start + 4`, `trophies[start + 2] == 'G'`, `n` must be greater than `start + 4`, and `trophies[start + 4] == 'G'`**
