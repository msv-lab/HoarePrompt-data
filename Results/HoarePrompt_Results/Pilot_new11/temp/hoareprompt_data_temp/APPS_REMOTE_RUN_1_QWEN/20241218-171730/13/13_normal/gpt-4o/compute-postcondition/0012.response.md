The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple `(start, i - 1)` to the list `segments`. From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `segments` is a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G']
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `start` is 1
- For all `j` where `1 \leq j < i`, `trophies[j]` is 'G'

After executing the code, the value of `segments` will include the new tuple `(1, n)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and now includes the tuple (1, n), `i` is `n + 1`, `start` is 1**
