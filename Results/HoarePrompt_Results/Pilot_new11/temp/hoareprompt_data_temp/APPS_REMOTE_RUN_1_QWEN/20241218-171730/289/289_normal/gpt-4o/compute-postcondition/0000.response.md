The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^18`, this value will be taken directly. The input function will replace the initial value of `n` with the integer entered by the user. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that 2 <= n <= 10^18**
