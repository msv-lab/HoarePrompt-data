The code simply prints the value of `max_games`. Since `max_games` is defined as `n.bit_length() - 1`, the value of `max_games` does not change after the print statement. The variable `n` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that 2 <= n <= 10^18; `max_games` is `n.bit_length() - 1`; the value of `max_games` is printed**
