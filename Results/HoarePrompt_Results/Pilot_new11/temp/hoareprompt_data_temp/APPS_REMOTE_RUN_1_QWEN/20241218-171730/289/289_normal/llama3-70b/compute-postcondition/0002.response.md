The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the integer `n` which is constrained such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. However, since no specific logic or return conditions are provided in the problem statement, we can only describe what the parameter constraint is.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`.**
