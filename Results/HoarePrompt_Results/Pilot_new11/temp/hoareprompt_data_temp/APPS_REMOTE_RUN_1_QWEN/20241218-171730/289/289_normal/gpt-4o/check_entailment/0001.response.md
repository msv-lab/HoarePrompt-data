Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and rules of the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `max_games` using `n.bit_length() - 1`, which does not account for the rule that two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they have played is at most 1.

For example, consider `n = 10`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of games the winner can play is 4. However, the program outputs `3` because `10.bit_length() - 1 == 4 - 1 == 3`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to ensure that the winner can play up to the maximum number of games while respecting the rule about the difference in the number of games played. This typically involves breaking down the participants into pairs and ensuring that the winner can advance through the tournament under these constraints.
