The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect any variable values or the state of the program. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining part of the current iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0, and the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true**
