Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach combined with a helper function to check if a certain time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be cooked. However, there are several issues:

1. **Helper Function Logic**: The `func_1` function is designed to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be cooked by considering pairs of meat pieces. This function has a logical flaw in how it calculates the new position `(mx, my)` for the heat source and counts the number of pieces that can be cooked within time `T`. Specifically, the calculation of `(mx, my)` and the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` are incorrect and do not ensure the heat source is optimally placed to cook the maximum number of pieces of meat.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function implements the binary search correctly, but relies on the `func_1` function, which is flawed. Even if `func_1` were correct, the binary search implementation itself might not converge to the optimal solution due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

To demonstrate a case where the program fails, consider the following input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```
The expected output is approximately `2.4` seconds, as mentioned in the sample output. However, the current implementation might fail to find this optimal time due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

A corrected version would involve a more robust method to calculate the optimal position of the heat source, possibly using a different approach such as a brute-force method to check all possible positions on a fine grid or using a more sophisticated optimization algorithm.
