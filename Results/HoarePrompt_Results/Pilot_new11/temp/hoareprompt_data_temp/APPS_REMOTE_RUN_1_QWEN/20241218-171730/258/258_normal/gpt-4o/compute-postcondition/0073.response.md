In the provided code snippet, the variables `x2, y2, c2` are assigned values from the tuple `meats[j]`. The values of `x1, y1, c1` from `meats[i]` remain unchanged, and the values of `i` and `N` also remain unchanged because no operation modifies them.

- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- `N` must be greater than `k + 2`.
- `x1, y1, c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`.
- `x2, y2, c2` are now assigned from `meats[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1, y1, c1` are the values from `meats[i]`, `x2, y2, c2` are the values from `meats[j]`**
