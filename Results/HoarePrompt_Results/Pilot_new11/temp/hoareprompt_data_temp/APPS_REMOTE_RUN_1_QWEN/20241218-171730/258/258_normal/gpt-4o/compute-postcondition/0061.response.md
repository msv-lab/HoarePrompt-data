The code `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` calculates the value of `d2` as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `dx` and `dy`:

- `dx` is \((meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\)

Thus, the value of `d2` is:

\[ d2 = \left(\frac{meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2}\right)^2 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `meats` is unchanged, `K` is unchanged, `T` is unchanged, `N` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j + 1` is unchanged, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[j][2]`, `cx` is \((meats[j][0] + meats[i][0]) / 2\), `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is unchanged, `my` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2\)**
