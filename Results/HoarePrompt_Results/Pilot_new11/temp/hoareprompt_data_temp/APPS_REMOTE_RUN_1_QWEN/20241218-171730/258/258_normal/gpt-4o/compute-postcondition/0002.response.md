`K` is initially an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N\) and \(1 \leq N \leq 60\). The value of `K` is reassigned to the integer obtained from `data[1]` using `int()`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, with -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100; `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`**
