Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` has some logical issues that prevent it from accurately determining the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Swap Logic**: The swap logic in `func_1` is intended to ensure that the hardness of the first meat piece is greater than or equal to the hardness of the second meat piece. However, the logic inside the swap is incorrect. The lines:
   ```python
   if c1 * T < c2 * T:
       (x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2) = (x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1)
   ```
   This logic only swaps the hardness values but not the coordinates, which can lead to incorrect calculations of distances and readiness times.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance calculation in the function is not directly related to finding the optimal point to place the heat source. The function seems to be checking if a line segment between two points can satisfy the readiness condition, which is not the correct approach for finding the minimum time.

3. **Optimization Approach**: The overall approach of using a combination of points to find the optimal time is flawed. The function should aim to find a single point that minimizes the maximum readiness time for K or more pieces, rather than checking combinations of points.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all pieces of meat have the same hardness or when the hardness values are very different.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The correct solution involves placing the heat source optimally to minimize the maximum readiness time for 3 or more pieces. The given code does not correctly identify this optimal placement, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
