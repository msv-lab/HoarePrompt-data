The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables directly and simply moves to the next iteration of whatever loop it was in. Given the initial state, the variables listed will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `meats` is unchanged, `K` is unchanged, `T` is unchanged, `N` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j + 1` is unchanged, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[j][2]`, `cx` is \((meats[j][0] + meats[i][0]) / 2\), `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is unchanged, `my` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2\)**
