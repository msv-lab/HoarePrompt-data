The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to the variable `c`. Given that `index` is 5, `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[7]`. The value of `data[7]` is a string that needs to be converted to an integer using `int()`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, integer value of `data[6]`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[7]`**
