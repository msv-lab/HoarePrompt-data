`cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The values of `x1` and `x2` are known from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

From the initial state:
- `x1` is `meats[j][0]`
- `x2` is `meats[i][0]`

So, the value of `cx` is \((meats[j][0] + meats[i][0]) / 2\).

Output State: **`d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `meats` is unchanged, `K` is unchanged, `T` is unchanged, `N` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j + 1` is unchanged, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[j][2]`, `cx` is \((meats[j][0] + meats[i][0]) / 2\), `dy` is unchanged, `d2` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `my` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `cy` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged.
