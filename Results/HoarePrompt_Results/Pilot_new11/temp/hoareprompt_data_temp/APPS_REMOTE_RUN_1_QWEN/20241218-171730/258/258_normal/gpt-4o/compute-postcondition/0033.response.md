The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no explicit loop, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables outside of the loop context. The values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables also stay the same.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq \text{len(meats)}\), `T` is a non-negative float representing the time threshold, `N` is the length of the `meats` list and must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are now the first three elements of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the first three elements of the tuple at index `j` in `meats`, `d` is now `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is an integer representing the number of tuples in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`.**
