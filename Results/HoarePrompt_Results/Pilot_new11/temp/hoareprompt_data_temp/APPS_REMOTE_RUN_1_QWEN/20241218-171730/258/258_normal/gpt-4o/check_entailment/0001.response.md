Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to check if placing the heat source between two pieces of meat can achieve the desired outcome. However, this approach is overly simplistic and may miss optimal placements that do not involve only two points.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 10
```

The optimal placement of the heat source should be somewhere along the line connecting the first three points (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1) to minimize the cooking time for at least 3 pieces of meat. The program's current implementation might fail to find such an optimal placement, as it only checks pairs of points.

To properly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach would be needed, such as using a geometric algorithm to find the smallest enclosing circle that includes at least K pieces of meat, or employing a more sophisticated optimization method. The current implementation may not cover all possible optimal placements, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
