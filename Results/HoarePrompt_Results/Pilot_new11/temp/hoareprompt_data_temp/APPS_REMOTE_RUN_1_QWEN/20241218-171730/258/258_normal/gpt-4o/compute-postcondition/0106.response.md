`cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are unchanged from their initial values. Therefore, the value of `cy` is updated based on these values.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, `cx`, and `cy` remains unchanged except that `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
