The given code calculates `my` using the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. The value of `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
2. The value of `dx` is 0.
3. The value of `d2` is 0.

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ my = \frac{(x1 + x2)}{2} - 0 \cdot \mathsqrt(0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0) / 0 \]

Since `d2` is 0, the denominator of the fraction part of the equation becomes 0, making the entire term undefined (division by zero). However, since `dx` is 0, the whole multiplication term also becomes 0. Thus, the formula simplifies to:
\[ my = \frac{(x1 + x2)}{2} - 0 \]

Therefore, `my` is simply equal to `cy`, which is \(\frac{(x1 + x2)}{2}\).

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0, `my` is `(x1 + x2) / 2**
