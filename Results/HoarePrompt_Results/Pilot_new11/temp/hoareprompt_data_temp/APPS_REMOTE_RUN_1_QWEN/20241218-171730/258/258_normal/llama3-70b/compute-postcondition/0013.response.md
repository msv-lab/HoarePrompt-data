The code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` compares the last element of the `times` list (`times[3]`) with the corresponding element in the `ans` list (`ans[3]`). Given that `K` is not explicitly defined, it is assumed to be the length of `times` minus one, which is 3 in this case.

Initially:
- `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`
- `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`

The comparison is between `ans[3]` (which is 1000) and `times[3]` (which is also 1000). Since they are equal, `ans[3]` remains unchanged, which is 1000.

Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`**
