Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `x` is -999
   - `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
   - `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range from \(-1000\) to \(1000\).

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop has just finished iterating over some value of `y`.
   - The next value of `y` that the loop would use would be the next integer in the range.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `y` in a sequential manner, the next value of `y` would be the current value of `y` plus 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `y`.

Given these points, we can determine the new state at the start of the next iteration:

- `x` remains `-999`.
- `y` needs to be set to the next value in the range, which would be `current_y + 1`.
- `times` and `ans` remain unchanged since they do not depend on the loop variable `y` directly but on the function calls `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`, which will be recalculated for the new `y`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is the next integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\) (i.e., current_y + 1), `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list**.
