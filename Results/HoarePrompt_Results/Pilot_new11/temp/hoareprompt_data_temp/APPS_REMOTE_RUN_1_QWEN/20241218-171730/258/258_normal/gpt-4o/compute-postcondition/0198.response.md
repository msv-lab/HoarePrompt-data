In the initial state, the following variables are defined:
- `x1` is `meats[j][0]`
- `y1` is `meats[j][1]`
- `c1` is `meats[j][2]`
- `x2` is `meats[N][0]`
- `y2` is `meats[N][1]`
- `c2` is `meats[N][2]`
- `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`
- `d` is \(\frac{(c1 - c2) \cdot T}{c1 \cdot c2}\)
- `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\)
- `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\)
- `d2` is \(\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\)
- `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\)
- `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\)

The code snippet changes the value of `dy` as follows:
```python
dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
```

This line simply reassigns the value of `dy` using the previously defined formula for `dy`. Therefore, the value of `dy` remains consistent with its previous definition.
