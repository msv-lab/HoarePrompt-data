The code `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` assigns the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T` to the variable `d`. Given the initial state, `c1` is equal to `c2`, so `c1 * T - c2 * T` simplifies to `c2 * T - c2 * T`, which is `0`. Thus, `d` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0**
