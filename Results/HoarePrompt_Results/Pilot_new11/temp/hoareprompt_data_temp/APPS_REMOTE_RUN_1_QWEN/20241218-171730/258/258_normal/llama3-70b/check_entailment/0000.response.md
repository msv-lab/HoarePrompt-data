Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it attempts to discretize the coordinates to integers ranging from -1000 to 1000, which may miss the optimal solution. The constraints allow for real numbers, and the program does not explore all possible real-number coordinates to find the minimum time required. Therefore, the solution provided by the program might not be accurate for all inputs, leading to incorrect results.
