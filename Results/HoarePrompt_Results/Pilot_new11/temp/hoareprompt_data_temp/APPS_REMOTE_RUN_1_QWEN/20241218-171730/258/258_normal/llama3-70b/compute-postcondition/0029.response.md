Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is -999.
   - `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` for each `y`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in range(-1000, 1001):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` from -1000 to 1000 inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is -999.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `x` will be -998.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that the variables `y`, `times`, and `ans` do not change unless explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since no modifications are mentioned, these variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that changes is `x`, which is now -998.
   - The ranges and conditions for `y` and `times` remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` for each `y`.**
