`times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. However, the initial value of `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`, where `y` is an integer within the range [-1000, 1000]. Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, `times` could be a list containing two elements: `-1000` and `y`. Sorting this list will result in `[-1000, y]` if `y` is greater than `-1000`, or `[y, -1000]` if `y` is less than `-1000`. But since `y` is within the range [-1000, 1000], `y` can never be less than `-1000`, so the sorted list will always be `[-1000, y]`.

The other variables (`ans`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`ans` is float('inf'), `x` is -1000, `y` is an integer within the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is [-1000, y]**
