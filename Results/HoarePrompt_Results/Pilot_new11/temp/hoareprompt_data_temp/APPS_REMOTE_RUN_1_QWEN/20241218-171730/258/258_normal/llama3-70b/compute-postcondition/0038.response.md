According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 for the variable `y`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `x` is -998
- `y` is -997
- `times` is [-998, -998, -997, -997]
- `ans` is -998 if `K` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ans` is -997

To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration.

1. The loop starts iterating from `y = -1000` up to `y = 1000`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was -997.
3. For the loop to execute again, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it -996.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `x` remains -998
- `y` becomes -996
- `times` remains [-998, -998, -997, -997]
- `ans` remains -998 if `K` is 1 or 2, otherwise remains -997

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -998, -997, -997]; `ans` is -998 if `K` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ans` is -997**
