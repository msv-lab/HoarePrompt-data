Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j + 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cy`, `dx` are as defined. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is set to `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is set to `meats[i][1]`, and `c1` is set to `meats[i][2]`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged.***
