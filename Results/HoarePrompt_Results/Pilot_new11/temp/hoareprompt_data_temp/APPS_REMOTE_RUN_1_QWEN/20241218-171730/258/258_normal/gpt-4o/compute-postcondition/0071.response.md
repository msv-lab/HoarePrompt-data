Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The initial state before the loop: `i` is `k + 1`, `N` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.
- The for loop: `for j in range(i + 1, N):`

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `N` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`.

2. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `N - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i + 1` should be less than `N`.

3. **Check the Condition:**
   - Since `i` is `k + 1`, the starting value of `j` would be `(k + 1) + 1 = k + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k + 2` must be less than `N`.

4. **Determine the Final State:**
   - `i` remains `k + 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `N` must be greater than or equal to `k + 2` for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `N` to be greater than `k + 1` (which it already is) but more specifically, it must be greater than `k + 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` must be greater than `k + 2`**
