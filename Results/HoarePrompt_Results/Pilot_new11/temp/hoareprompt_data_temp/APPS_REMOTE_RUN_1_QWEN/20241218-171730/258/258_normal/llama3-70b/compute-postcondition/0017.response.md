The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with `x = -999` and `y` being an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). The function call `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` returns a value which is stored in the variable `times`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value returned by `func_2`, but we know that `times` is now populated with the return value of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

The initial state of `x` is -999, and `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). After the code execution, `times` contains the results of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the specified range.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is populated with values from `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)**
