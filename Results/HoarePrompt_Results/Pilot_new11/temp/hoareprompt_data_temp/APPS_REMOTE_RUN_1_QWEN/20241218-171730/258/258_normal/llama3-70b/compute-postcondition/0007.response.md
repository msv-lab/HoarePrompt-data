The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since `x` is `-1000` and `y` is `1000`, the function `func_2` is called with the same arguments. However, the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `times`. 

Given the initial state where `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is `-1000`, and `y` is `1000`, and assuming that `func_2` returns a value for `times`, the value of `ans` will be updated to the value returned by `func_2`.

Output State: **`ans` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
