Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the code assumes that the coordinates `x` and `y` passed to `func_2` are the same, which means it only evaluates the cooking time at integer coordinates. However, the problem description allows for real number coordinates for the heat source, not just integers. 

To properly solve the problem, the code should evaluate the cooking times at all possible real number coordinates within the given range (-1000 to 1000) and then find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. The current implementation only considers integer coordinates, which might lead to suboptimal solutions.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The correct solution would involve evaluating the cooking times at all real number coordinates, not just integer ones. The current implementation only evaluates at integer coordinates, which might miss the optimal solution. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
