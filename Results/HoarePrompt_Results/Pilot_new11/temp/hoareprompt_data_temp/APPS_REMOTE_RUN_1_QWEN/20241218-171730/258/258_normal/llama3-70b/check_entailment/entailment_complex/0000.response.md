Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the K-th largest cooking time might not exist for a particular (x, y) pair. Specifically, if the length of the list returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is less than K, the code will still attempt to access `times[K - 1]`, leading to an index error. According to the problem description, if there are fewer than K pieces of meat, the cooking time for those few pieces should be considered as the final result. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

For example, consider a scenario where:
- N = 3, K = 4
- Meat coordinates and hardness are: (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 1)

When the heat source is placed at (0, 0), the cooking times for the three pieces of meat would be [1, 1, 1]. Since K = 4, accessing `times[K - 1]` would lead to an index error because `times` only has 3 elements. The code should handle this case by returning the maximum cooking time instead of accessing an out-of-bound index.
