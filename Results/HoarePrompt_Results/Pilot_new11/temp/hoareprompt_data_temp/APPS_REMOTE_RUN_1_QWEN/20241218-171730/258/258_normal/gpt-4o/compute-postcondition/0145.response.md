Postcondition: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`. If the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true, then `x1` is updated to `meats[N][0]`, `y1` is updated to `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is updated to `meats[N][2]`, `x2` is updated to `meats[N-1][0]`, `y2` is updated to `meats[N-1][1]`, `c2` is updated to `meats[N-1][2]`.**
