The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `times`. However, we know that `times` will be a list containing at least `K` elements for each `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `-998`
- `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements
- `ans` is not yet defined but will be computed after the loop based on the K-th largest elements of `times` for each `y`

After the line `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the value of `times` is assigned the result of `func_2`, but the specific values within `times` are not known. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements, `ans` is not yet defined**
