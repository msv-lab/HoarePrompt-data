The `times.sort()` function sorts the list `times`. Given the initial state where `x` is -999, `y` is -997, `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -997, -999, -997)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, after sorting `times`, the order of elements in `times` changes, but no new values are assigned to any variables. 

Since no specific values for `times` are given before sorting, we cannot determine the exact values of `times` after sorting, but we know that `times` is now sorted. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -997, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
