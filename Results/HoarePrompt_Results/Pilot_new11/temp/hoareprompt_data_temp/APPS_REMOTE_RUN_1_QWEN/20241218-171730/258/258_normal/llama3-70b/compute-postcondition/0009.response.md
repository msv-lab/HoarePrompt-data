The code updates `ans` to be the minimum value between `ans` and `times[K - 1]`. Since `K` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine `times[K - 1]` directly. However, since `K` is not specified, we assume it refers to the last element of `times`, which is `1000`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`
- `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`

We calculate `times[K - 1]` as `times[3]`, which is `1000`.

Since `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]` and `times[K - 1]` is `1000`, the minimum value between them is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]` because `1000` is not less than any element in `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`**
