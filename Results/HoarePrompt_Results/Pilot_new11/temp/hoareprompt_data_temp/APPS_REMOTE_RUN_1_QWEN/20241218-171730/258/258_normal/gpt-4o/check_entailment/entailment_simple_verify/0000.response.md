Final: **False**

### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program's logic. Let's review the key points based on the annotated version and the problem description:

1. **Helper Function Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The function aims to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be cooked by considering pairs of meat pieces. However, the logic for calculating the new position `(mx, my)` for the heat source and the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` are incorrect.
   - Specifically, the calculation of `(mx, my)` and the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` do not ensure the heat source is optimally placed to cook the maximum number of pieces of meat. This means the function cannot correctly determine if a given time `T` allows cooking `K` pieces of meat.

2. **Binary Search Implementation (`func_2`)**:
   - The binary search implementation relies on the `func_1` function, which is flawed. Even if `func_1` were correct, the binary search might not converge to the optimal solution due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

Given these points, even with the annotated version, the core issue remains: the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the optimal time `T` to cook `K` pieces of meat. Therefore, the program as a whole cannot correctly solve the problem as described.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal time `T` for cooking `K` pieces of meat, the final assessment remains:

Final: **False**
