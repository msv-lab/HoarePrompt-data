The code snippet assigns the values of `meats[j]` to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. Specifically, `x2` gets the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y2` gets the value of `meats[j][1]`, and `c2` gets the value of `meats[j][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j + 1`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `cy`, `dx` are as defined.**
