Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_3` attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible integer coordinates (-1000 to 1000) for the heat source. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of the optimal heat source being at a non-integer coordinate. The problem statement specifies that \(X\) and \(Y\) can be real numbers, but the current implementation only considers integer coordinates.

To illustrate the issue, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal heat source position calculated manually is approximately \((-0.2, 0)\), as mentioned in the problem description. The current implementation will not find this position because it only checks integer coordinates. Therefore, the solution provided by the code might not be accurate for all cases.

A more appropriate approach would be to use a numerical optimization method (e.g., gradient descent or a similar algorithm) to find the optimal position for the heat source.
