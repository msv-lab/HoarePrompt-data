The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables or perform any operations. It simply skips to the next iteration of the enclosing loop. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` (a negative value), `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
