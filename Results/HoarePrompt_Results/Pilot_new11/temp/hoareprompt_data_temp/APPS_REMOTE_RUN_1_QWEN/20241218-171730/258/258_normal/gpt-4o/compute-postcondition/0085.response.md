The code `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` calculates the value of `dy` based on the difference between `y1` and `y2`, divided by 2. Given the initial state, `y1` is equal to `x1` and `y2` is also equal to `x1`. Therefore, the calculation simplifies to:

\[ dy = \frac{x1 - x1}{2} = \frac{0}{2} = 0 \]

So, `dy` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0**
