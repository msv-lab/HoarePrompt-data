Postcondition: ***`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j + 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, otherwise `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, and `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cy`, `dx` are as defined. If `d < 0`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
