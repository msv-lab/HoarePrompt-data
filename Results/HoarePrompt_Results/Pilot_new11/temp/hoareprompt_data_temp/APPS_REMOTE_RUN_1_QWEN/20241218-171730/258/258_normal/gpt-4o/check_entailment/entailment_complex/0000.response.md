Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when the list `meats` is empty. According to the problem description, `N` and `K` satisfy `1 <= K <= N <= 60`, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct. However, the code does not explicitly check if `N` is zero, which would imply an empty list `meats`. 

In the `func_2` function, the binary search relies on the existence of at least one meat piece to perform the necessary comparisons and calculations. If `N` is zero, the list `meats` is empty, and the function will not work as intended because `func_1` will not be called with valid arguments.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of `func_2` to return an appropriate value (e.g., a large negative number indicating an impossible time) if the list `meats` is empty:

```python
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    if N == 0:
        return -1  # Return an impossible value for an empty list

    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
```

With this addition, the code would correctly handle the case when the list `meats` is empty, ensuring that it follows the problem description for every potential case.
