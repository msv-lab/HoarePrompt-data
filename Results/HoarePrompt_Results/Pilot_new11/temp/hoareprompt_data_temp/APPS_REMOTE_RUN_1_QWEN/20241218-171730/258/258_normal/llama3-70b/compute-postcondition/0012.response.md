The `sort()` method sorts the list `times` in ascending order. Since `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`, and no specific details about `func_2` are provided, we assume `times` retains its original values after the function call. Given the initial state, `times` is the same as `ans`, which is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`. After sorting, the list becomes `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`**
