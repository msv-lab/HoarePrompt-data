The code snippet assigns values to `x2` and `y2` from the list `meats` at index `j`. This does not affect the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `y2`, `c2`, `count`, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, and `my`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only variables that are updated are `x2` and `y2`, which now take the values from `meats[j][0]` and `meats[j][1]` respectively.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `x1` is `meats[N][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N][2]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is \(\left(\frac{c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T}{c1 \cdot c2}\right)\), `dx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)\), `dy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)\), `d2` is \(\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\), `cx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\right)\), `cy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\right)\), `my` is \(cy - dx \cdot \sqrt{\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right) \cdot d - d^2} / \left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\).
