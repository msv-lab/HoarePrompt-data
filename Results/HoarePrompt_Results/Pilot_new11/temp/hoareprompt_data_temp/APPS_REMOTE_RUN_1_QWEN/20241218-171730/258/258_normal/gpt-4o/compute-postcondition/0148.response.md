The `continue` statement in the given code does not change any variable values but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, the values of all variables remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`, and `d` is less than 0**
