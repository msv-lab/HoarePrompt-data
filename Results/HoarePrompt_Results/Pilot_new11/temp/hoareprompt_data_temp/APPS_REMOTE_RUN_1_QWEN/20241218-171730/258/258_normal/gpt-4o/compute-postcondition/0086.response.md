The code calculates \( d2 \) as \( dx^2 + dy^2 \). Initially, \( dx \) and \( dy \) are both 0. Therefore, \( d2 \) will be \( 0^2 + 0^2 = 0 \).

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0**
