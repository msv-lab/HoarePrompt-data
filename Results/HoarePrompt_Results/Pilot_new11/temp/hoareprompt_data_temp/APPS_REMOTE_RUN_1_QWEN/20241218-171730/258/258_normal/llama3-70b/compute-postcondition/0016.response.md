Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times`.
   - `times` is a list of sorted values returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000.
   - `x` is -999.
   - `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, and its return value is appended to the list `times`.
   - The list `times` is then sorted.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `y` must iterate through all values in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that `times` is updated correctly after each iteration of `y`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `x` is fixed at -999 and `y` is iterated over the full range, we need to ensure that `times` is populated correctly.
   - We need to adjust the initial state to reflect that `times` is a list that will be updated during the loop iterations.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments are:

- `x` is -999 (fixed and does not change).
- `y` must iterate through all values in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `times` must be a list that will be populated during the loop iterations, with each element being the result of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop should be:

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is an empty list that will be populated with values from `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)**.
