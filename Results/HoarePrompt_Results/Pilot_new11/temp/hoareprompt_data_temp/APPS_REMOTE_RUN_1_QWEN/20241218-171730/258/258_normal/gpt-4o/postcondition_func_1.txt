The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) of the i-th piece of meat and its hardness \(c_i\) such that -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` that satisfies the condition `high - low < 1e-07`.

After the function concludes, the program state is as follows:
- The function calls another function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` within a loop, adjusting the range between `low` and `high` based on the return value of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
- The loop continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than 1e-07.
- The final value returned by the function is `high`, which is very close to `low` and `mid`, ensuring that `high - low < 1e-07`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `N` or `K` are out of the specified bounds (i.e., `K > N` or `N > 60`), the function should ideally raise an error or handle it appropriately, although the current code does not explicitly check these conditions.
- If the list `meats` is empty, the function would still execute but would need to handle this case, possibly raising an error or returning a default value.
- If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` does not return a boolean value or behaves unexpectedly, the function may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.
