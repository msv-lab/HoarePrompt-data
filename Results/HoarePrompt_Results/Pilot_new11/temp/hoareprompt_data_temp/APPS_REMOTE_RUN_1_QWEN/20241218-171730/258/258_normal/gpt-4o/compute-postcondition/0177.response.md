The code updates the value of `dy` to \((y1 - y2) / 2\), which is the same as the previous calculation. Since this is just an assignment without any additional conditions or changes to other variables, the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `N`; `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`; `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`; `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`; `y2` is `meats[j][1]`; `c2` is `meats[j][2]`; `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\); `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\); `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\)**.
