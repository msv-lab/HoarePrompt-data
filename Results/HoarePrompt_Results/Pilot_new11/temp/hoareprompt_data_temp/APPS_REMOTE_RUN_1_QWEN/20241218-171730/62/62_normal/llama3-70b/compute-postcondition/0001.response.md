According to the given for loop statement, the loop will iterate over each digit in the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one element.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Variable `base`:** The value of `base` (2 ≤ base ≤ 40) does not directly affect whether the loop executes. It specifies the base of the number system but does not determine the presence or length of the `digits` list.

2. **Variable `result`:** The initial value of `result` (which is 0) is not relevant to determining if the loop can execute. The loop can run regardless of the initial value of `result`.

3. **Variable `digits`:** The loop will only execute if the `digits` list contains at least one element. If `digits` is empty, the loop will not run.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `digits` list must have at least one element.

**State:** **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base and must have at least one element, `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40), `result` is 0**
