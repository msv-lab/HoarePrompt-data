Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly converts the given numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` processes each digit in the list according to the specified base and accumulates the correct decimal value. After converting both numbers to decimal, the program correctly compares them and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '='). The annotations confirm that the function handles the conversion accurately and the main part of the program uses this function correctly to perform the required comparison. There are no issues or potential edge cases that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description and the provided input constraints.
