According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit`. The loop iterates over each `digit` in the `digits` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus the current `digit`, `base` remains unchanged, and `digit` is the next value in the `digits` list.

To proceed to the next iteration, `digit` needs to be the next value in the `digits` list. Let's denote the next value in the `digits` list as `next_digit`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the state as follows:

- `result` is updated to its previous value * `base` + `next_digit`.
- `base` remains unchanged.
- `digit` becomes `next_digit`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `next_digit` from the given information, we'll refer to it as `next_digit`.

State: **`result` is its previous value * `base` + `next_digit`, `base` is unchanged, `digit` is `next_digit`**
