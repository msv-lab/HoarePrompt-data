The code updates the value of `result` to be the current `result` multiplied by `base` plus `digit`. The values of `base` and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `result` is the previous value of `result` * `base` + `digit`.

Output State: **`result` is its previous value * `base` + `digit`, `base` is unchanged, `digit` is `next_digit`**
