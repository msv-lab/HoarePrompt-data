Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal and compares them. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from any given base to decimal by iterating through its digits and applying the positional value. The main part of the program reads the inputs, converts the numbers using `func_1`, and compares the results, outputting the correct symbol ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison.

Since the program handles all the described cases and examples provided, and there are no edge cases or potential scenarios found where the program fails, the program is correct.
