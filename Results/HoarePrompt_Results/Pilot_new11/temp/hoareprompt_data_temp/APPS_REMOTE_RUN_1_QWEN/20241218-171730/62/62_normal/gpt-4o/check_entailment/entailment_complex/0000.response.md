Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program accurately follows the problem description and correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for both numbers \( X \) and \( Y \).
   - It reads the number of digits \( n \) and the base \( b_x \) for \( X \) and the number of digits \( m \) and the base \( b_y \) for \( Y \).
   - It then reads the digits of \( X \) and \( Y \) as lists of integers.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal form.
   - It iterates through each digit, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit to it.
   - The function handles all digits correctly without leading zeros and ensures that each digit is within the valid range for the given base (0 to \( base-1 \)).

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to decimal form, the program compares them.
   - Based on the comparison result, it prints the appropriate character ('<' if \( X < Y \), '>' if \( X > Y \), and '=' if \( X = Y \)).

4. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` handles all valid inputs and behaves as expected, converting the number correctly without any leading zeros.
   - It does not handle invalid inputs such as a base less than 2 or greater than 40, or non-integer values for `digits` or `base`, which aligns with the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided.

Given the above points, the program consistently adheres to the problem description and performs the required operations correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
