According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will execute if the `digits` list is non-empty. Additionally, the variable `digit` will take on each value from the `digits` list during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state where `digits` is a list of integers and `decimal_value` is 0, we need to ensure that the loop can start by having at least one element in the `digits` list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `decimal_value` is 0**
