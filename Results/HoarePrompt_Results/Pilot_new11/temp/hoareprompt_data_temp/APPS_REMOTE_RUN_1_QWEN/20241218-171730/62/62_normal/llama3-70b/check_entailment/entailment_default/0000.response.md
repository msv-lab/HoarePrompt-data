Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when either `x_digits` or `y_digits` is an empty list. Although the function `func_1` correctly processes non-empty lists, it does not explicitly handle the scenario where the input list is empty. If either `x_digits` or `y_digits` is an empty list, the function would return 0, which could lead to incorrect comparisons. For example, if `x_digits` is an empty list, the function would return 0, and if `y_digits` is a valid list representing a non-zero number, the comparison `x < y` would be incorrect. Similarly, if `y_digits` is an empty list, the function would return 0, and if `x_digits` is a valid list representing a non-zero number, the comparison `x > y` would be incorrect.

To fix this issue, the function `func_1` should explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty by returning 0. Here is an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(digits, base):
    if not digits:
        return 0
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result
```

With this update, the function will correctly handle empty input lists, ensuring that the comparisons are accurate for all potential cases.
