The `decimal_value` is updated by multiplying it with `base` and adding `digit`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `base` and `digit`, we will keep them as symbols in our calculation.

The initial state is:
- `decimal_value` is the second element of the list `digits`.

After executing the code:
- `decimal_value` is updated to `decimal_value * base + digit`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`decimal_value` is `digits[1] * base + digit`, `digits` is a list of integers**
