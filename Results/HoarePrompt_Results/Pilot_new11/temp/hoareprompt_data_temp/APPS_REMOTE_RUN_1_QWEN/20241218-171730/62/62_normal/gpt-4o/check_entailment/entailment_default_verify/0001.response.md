Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the output hints, the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. The main part of the program reads the inputs, converts both numbers to decimal, and compares them correctly. The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function handles all digits correctly within the specified range for the base and does not handle invalid inputs, which is not necessary as per the problem statement (inputs are assumed to be valid). The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the output hints further validate this correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
