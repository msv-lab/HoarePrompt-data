The code updates `result` to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus `digit`. This means the current value of `result` is changed, but the values of `base` and `digit` remain the same as they were before the operation. Since the initial state is that `result` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus `digit`, the new value of `result` will be the previous value of `result` multiplied by `base` plus the current value of `digit`.

Output State: **`result` is its previous value * `base` + `digit`, `base` is unchanged, `digit` is the next value in the `digits` list**
