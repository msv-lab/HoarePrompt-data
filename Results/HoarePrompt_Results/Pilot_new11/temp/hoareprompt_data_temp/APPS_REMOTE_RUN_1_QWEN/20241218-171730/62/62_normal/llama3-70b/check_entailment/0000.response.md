Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the numbers have different lengths but start with the same digits. Specifically, if `X` has more leading zeros than `Y` when converted to the same base, the program might incorrectly compare them. For example:

Consider the inputs:
```
Input
4 2
1 0 0 1
2 10
1 0
```
Here, `X = 1001_2 = 9_{10}` and `Y = 10_{10}`. Although `X` has more digits, the value of `X` is less than `Y`. However, the program will incorrectly output `>` because it does not account for the difference in length properly.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where the lengths of the numbers differ and convert them to the same base before comparison.
