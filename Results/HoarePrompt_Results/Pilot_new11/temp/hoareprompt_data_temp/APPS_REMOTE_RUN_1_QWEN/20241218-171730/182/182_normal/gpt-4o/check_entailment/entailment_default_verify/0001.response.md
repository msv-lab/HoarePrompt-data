Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The program fails to correctly handle negative angles, which is a critical requirement given the problem description. Specifically, the program uses the modulo operation `% 360` to normalize the angle, but this approach does not account for the fact that a negative angle should wrap around correctly to produce the smallest deviation from vertical. For instance, as demonstrated in the note, for an input of `-75` degrees, the program incorrectly calculates the number of turns needed without considering the full circle rotation.

The correct approach would involve adjusting the normalized angle to ensure it is in the range `[0, 360)` and then calculating the minimum number of 90-degree turns accordingly. The original assessment correctly identifies this flaw in the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is justified.
