Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The normalization step ensures that the angle is within the range of 0 to 359 degrees, and the calculation of the number of turns takes into account the periodic nature of the rotations. The annotations also highlight that the function does not explicitly check if the input is within the specified range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\), but since the problem statement assumes valid input, this omission does not affect the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
