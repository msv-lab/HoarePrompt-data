Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `x` from the user, which is within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\). It then uses the modulo operation `% 360` to ensure that `x` falls within the range \([0, 359]\). This step is crucial because it normalizes the input angle to a manageable range that corresponds to a full circle (360 degrees).

2. **Calculation and Output**:
   - If `x` is `0`, the program correctly prints `0`, indicating no additional rotations are needed.
   - For any other value of `x`, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical.
     - `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` effectively rounds `x` to the nearest multiple of 90 in the direction of the closest 90-degree increment.
     - Taking the result modulo 4 (`% 4`) ensures the result is within the range \([0, 3]\), which represents the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of 90-degree turns is sound. For example:
     - If `x` is between `0` and `90` (inclusive), the optimal solution is `0` turns.
     - If `x` is between `90` and `180` (inclusive), the optimal solution is `1` turn.
     - If `x` is between `180` and `270` (inclusive), the optimal solution is `2` turns.
     - If `x` is between `270` and `360` (inclusive), the optimal solution is `3` turns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately. For instance, if `x` is exactly `0`, `360`, `-360`, etc., the output is `0`, which is correct.
   - The modulo operation ensures that negative angles are handled correctly, mapping them to the equivalent positive angle within the range \([0, 359]\).

Given that the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all inputs within the specified range, the program is correct.
