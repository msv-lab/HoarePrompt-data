Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative input values within the given constraints. The logic of taking the modulo 360 ensures that the angle is within the range of a full circle, and then adjusting based on the nearest 90-degree interval ensures the minimal number of turns. For instance, for an input of 60 degrees (clockwise), the program correctly calculates the deviation and prints the appropriate number of turns (3 turns in this case). Similarly, for -60 degrees (counter-clockwise), the program also correctly calculates the deviation and prints the appropriate number of turns (3 turns). This logic handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
