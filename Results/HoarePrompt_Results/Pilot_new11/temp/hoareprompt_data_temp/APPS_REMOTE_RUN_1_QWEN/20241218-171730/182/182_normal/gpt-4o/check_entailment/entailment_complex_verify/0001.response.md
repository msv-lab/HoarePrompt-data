Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle negative angles, which is a critical aspect of the problem. As demonstrated in the example with the input `-75`, the program calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns incorrectly. The correct approach should account for the fact that a 75-degree clockwise rotation (which corresponds to a -75-degree counter-clockwise rotation) should ideally result in 3 turns (since `-75 + 3*90 = 285 - 270 = 15` degrees deviation), not 0 turns as the current implementation suggests.

The annotated version highlights that the modulo operation does not handle negative angles correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
