Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `z` is greater than `max_upvotes - min_downvotes` or `max_downvotes - min_upvotes`. This means that there can be multiple possible outcomes based on how the `z` unknown votes are distributed, leading to an uncertain result.

For example, consider the input `(1, 1, 2)`:
- If the two unknown votes both upvote, the result is `+`.
- If the two unknown votes both downvote, the result is `-`.
- If one unknown vote upvotes and one downvotes, the result is `0`.

Since the program does not account for these scenarios, it will not correctly identify that the result is uncertain for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
