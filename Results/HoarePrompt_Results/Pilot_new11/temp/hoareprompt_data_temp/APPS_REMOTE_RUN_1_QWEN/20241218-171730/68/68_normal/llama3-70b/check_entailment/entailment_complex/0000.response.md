Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic to ensure it matches the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the input. These integers represent the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, and are unsure respectively. The range is \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\).

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if \(x > y + z\). If true, it prints `+`.
   - If false, it checks if \(x < y\). If true, it prints `-`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it further checks if \(x == y\):
     - If \(x == y\) and \(z == 0\), it prints `0`.
     - If \(x == y\) and \(z != 0\), it prints `?`.
   - If none of the above conditions hold, it prints `?`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases specified in the problem description:
     - If \(x > y + z\), the result is certain and will be `+`.
     - If \(x < y\), the result is certain and will be `-`.
     - If \(x == y\) and \(z == 0\), the result is certain and will be `0`.
     - If \(x == y\) and \(z != 0\), the result is uncertain and will be `?`.
     - All other cases (when the result could be either `+` or `-` due to the unknown votes) are reported as `?`.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The program strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the problem statement and prints the correct output for each scenario without any assumptions about invalid inputs, which are assumed to be handled externally.

Since the program correctly implements all the logic required by the problem statement and covers all possible scenarios, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
