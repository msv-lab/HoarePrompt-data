The function does not accept any parameters and returns a string ('+', '-', or '?') based on the comparison of maximum upvotes and minimum downvotes. It takes three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, where \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). After processing, the function checks if the maximum possible upvotes (\(x + z\)) are greater than or equal to the minimum possible downvotes (\(y\)). If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints a '-'. If the minimum downvotes are less than the maximum upvotes, it prints a '+'. If neither condition is met, it prints a '?'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the console will display one of these characters ('+', '-', '?').
