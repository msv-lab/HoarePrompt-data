The function takes three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, each ranging from 0 to 100. It then evaluates these inputs according to specific conditions and prints one of four possible outputs: '+', '-', '0', or '?'. The function does not return a value but modifies the console output based on the conditions met. If \(x\) is greater than \(y + z\), it prints '+'. If \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints '-'. If \(x\) equals \(y\) and \(z\) is 0, it prints '0'. In all other cases, it prints '?'. The values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) remain unchanged after the function executes.
