The code prints a question mark (`?`). Since printing does not affect any variables, the only change is that the output includes a question mark. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input(), `y` is an integer from input(), `z` is an integer from input(); print(`?`)**
