Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) using `input().split()`. This handles the input correctly as specified.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - **Case 1: More Upvotes than Downvotes and Unknown Votes**:
     ```python
     if (x > y + z):
         print('+')
     ```
     If \(x\) (upvotes) is greater than the sum of \(y\) (downvotes) and \(z\) (unknown votes), the program prints `+`.

   - **Case 2: More Downvotes than Upvotes and Unknown Votes**:
     ```python
     else:
         if (x < y):
             print('-')
     ```
     If \(x\) is less than \(y\), the program prints `-`.

   - **Case 3: Equal Number of Upvotes and Downvotes and Unknown Votes**:
     ```python
     else:
         if (x == y):
             if (z == 0):
                 print('0')
             else:
                 print('?')
     ```
     If \(x\) is equal to \(y\), the program checks if \(z\) is 0:
     - If \(z\) is 0, it prints `0`.
     - If \(z\) is not 0, it prints `?` because the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

   - **Case 4: No Clear Majority**:
     ```python
     else:
         print('?')
     ```
     If none of the above conditions hold, it means there is no clear majority, and the program prints `?`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program ensures that it handles all possible outcomes as specified in the problem statement:
     - `+` if \(x > y + z\)
     - `-` if \(x < y\)
     - `0` if \(x = y\) and \(z = 0\)
     - `?` if \(x = y\) and \(z \neq 0\)

Given these points, the annotated program correctly follows the problem description for all valid inputs, ensuring that it prints the correct result or indicates uncertainty appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
