Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's verify this:

1. The function takes three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and have an unknown vote, respectively.
2. The function calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes:
   - Minimum upvotes: \(x\)
   - Maximum upvotes: \(x + z\)
   - Minimum downvotes: \(y\)
   - Maximum downvotes: \(y + z\)
3. Based on the calculated values, the function determines the result:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes (\(x + z\)) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (\(y\)), the result is '-'.
   - If the minimum possible downvotes (\(y\)) are less than the maximum possible upvotes (\(x + z\)), the result is '+'.
   - If neither condition is met, the result is '?' indicating uncertainty.

This logic covers all potential cases described in the problem statement. For example:
- If \(x = 3\), \(y = 7\), and \(z = 0\), the function correctly outputs '-'.
- If \(x = 2\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 1\), the function correctly outputs '+'.
- If \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 0\), the function correctly outputs '0'.
- If \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 1\), the function correctly outputs '?'.

Since the function handles all specified cases correctly, the program is correct.
