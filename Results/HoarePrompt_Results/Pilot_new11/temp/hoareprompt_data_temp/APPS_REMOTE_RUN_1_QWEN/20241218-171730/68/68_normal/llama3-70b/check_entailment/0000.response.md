Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem:

1. **Case where \(x > y + z\):**
   - The program prints '+', which is correct since there will always be more upvotes than downvotes.

2. **Case where \(x < y\):**
   - The program prints '-', which is correct since there will always be more downvotes than upvotes.

3. **Case where \(x = y\):**
   - The program checks if \(z = 0\). If \(z = 0\), it prints '0', which is correct since the number of upvotes and downvotes will be equal. If \(z > 0\), it prints '?', which is correct because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are distributed.

4. **Case where \(x = y\) and \(z > 0\):**
   - The program correctly identifies this as an uncertain case and prints '?'.

5. **Edge cases:**
   - When \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z > 0\), the program correctly prints '?' because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are distributed.
   - When \(x > 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z > 0\), the program correctly prints '+' because the additional unknown votes cannot change the fact that there are more upvotes.
   - When \(x = 0\), \(y > 0\), and \(z > 0\), the program correctly prints '-' because the additional unknown votes cannot change the fact that there are more downvotes.

Since the program handles all described cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
