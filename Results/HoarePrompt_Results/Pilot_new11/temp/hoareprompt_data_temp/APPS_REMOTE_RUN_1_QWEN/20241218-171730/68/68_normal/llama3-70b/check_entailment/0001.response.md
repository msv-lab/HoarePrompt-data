Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all the described scenarios:

1. If \( x > y + z \), it prints `+`.
2. If \( x < y \), it prints `-`.
3. If \( x == y \):
   - If \( z == 0 \), it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `?` because the outcome depends on the votes of the unknown voters.

The program accounts for all edge cases and outputs the correct result or uncertainty indicator based on the problem description. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem statement.
