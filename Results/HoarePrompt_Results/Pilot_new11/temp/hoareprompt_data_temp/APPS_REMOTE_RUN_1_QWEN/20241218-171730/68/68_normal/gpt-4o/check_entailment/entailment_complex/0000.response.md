Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why the program meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the standard input. This matches the problem description which states that the input consists of three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) where \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\).

2. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum Upvotes and Downvotes**:
   - The variable `min_upvotes` is initialized to \(x\), representing the minimum number of upvotes regardless of the votes of the \(z\) unknown voters.
   - The variable `max_upvotes` is set to \(x + z\), representing the maximum possible number of upvotes considering the \(z\) unknown voters could all upvote.
   - Similarly, `min_downvotes` is set to \(y\) and `max_downvotes` is set to \(y + z\).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it means the maximum possible upvotes are still less than the minimum possible downvotes. In this case, the program prints `-`, indicating that there will always be more downvotes than upvotes, no matter how the \(z\) unknown voters vote.
   - If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it means the maximum possible downvotes are fewer than the minimum possible upvotes. Here, the program prints `+`, indicating that there will always be more upvotes than downvotes, regardless of the votes of the \(z\) unknown voters.
   - If neither condition is met, i.e., `max_upvotes >= min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes >= min_upvotes`, it means the result is uncertain because the outcome can vary depending on the votes of the \(z\) unknown voters. Therefore, the program prints `?`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program produces the correct output based on the conditions described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the appropriate result (`+`, `-`, `?`) as required.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description for all valid inputs. Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
