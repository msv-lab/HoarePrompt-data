The code `print('?')` prints the string `?` to the console. Since the code does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and the values of the variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input() with the value equal to `y`, `y` is an integer from input(), `z` is an integer from input(). The value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `z` is not equal to 0; printed string: '?'**
