The code `print('+')` simply prints the character '+'. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input(), `y` is an integer from input(), `z` is an integer from input(), x is an integer greater than the sum of y and z.**
