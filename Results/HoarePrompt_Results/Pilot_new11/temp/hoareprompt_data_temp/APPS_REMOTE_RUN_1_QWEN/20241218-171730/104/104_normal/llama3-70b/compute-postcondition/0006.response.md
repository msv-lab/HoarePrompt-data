The code snippet updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. However, the values of `j`, `i`, and `a` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_erase`. We only know that `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `j - i - 1`.

The states of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, `max_erase`, and `n`) are affected as follows:
- `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`.
- `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is unspecified, `max_erase` is the maximum of 0 and `j - i - 1`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
