The code `print(max_erase)` simply prints the value of `max_erase` without changing its value or assigning it a new one. Therefore, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid sublists `[i:j]` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n+1` and satisfies the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, and `n` must be greater than 0; `max_erase` is printed.**
