The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a string input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state because the number of elements in the list `a` is determined by the number of integers entered but not the initial value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer input, and the list `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input, and the list `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
