Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. If all elements in the sublist `a[0:3]` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for `k` in range from `i` to `j`, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains as the precondition since there is no change specified in the else part.***
