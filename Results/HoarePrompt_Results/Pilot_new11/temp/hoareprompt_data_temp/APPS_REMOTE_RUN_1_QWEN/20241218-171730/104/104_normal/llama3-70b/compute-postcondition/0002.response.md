The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_erase`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input, and the list `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `max_erase` is 0**
