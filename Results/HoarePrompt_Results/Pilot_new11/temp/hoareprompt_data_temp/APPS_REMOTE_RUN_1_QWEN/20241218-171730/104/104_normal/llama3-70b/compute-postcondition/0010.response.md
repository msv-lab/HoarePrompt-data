Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum of 0 and `j - i - 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. If all elements in the sublist `a[i:j]` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for every `k` in the range `[i, j)`, then `max_erase` remains 0. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially described before the if-else block.***
