The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state is that `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers representing the array where \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3\). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be set to the integer input, but the list of integers representing the array is not yet defined.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input, and the list of integers representing the array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is not yet defined.**
