According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list containing `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3
- `max_erase` is 0

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list containing `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is 0**
