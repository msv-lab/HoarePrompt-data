Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \(n\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\). It calculates and prints the maximum value of \(a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). The function does not handle cases where \(n\) is less than 2 or when the input list does not strictly increase. If \(n = 1\), the function will print 0 because there are no pairs to compare.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(n = 1\), the function should output 0 since there are no valid differences to calculate.
- The function assumes that the input list is already sorted and strictly increasing. If the input list is not in the correct order, the function may produce incorrect results.
