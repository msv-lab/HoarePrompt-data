The code updates the variable `max_erase` by taking the maximum value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. This means that `max_erase` is now at least as large as `j - i - 1`. The values of `i`, `j`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `j - i - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
