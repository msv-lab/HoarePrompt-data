Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid sublists `[i:j]` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n+1` and satisfies the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - Since `i` is now 1, we need to check if `i` is still less than `n`.

5. **Final States**:
   - `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `j` remains `n + 1`.
   - `max_erase` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

So, the updated states are:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid sublists `[i:j]` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n+1` and satisfies the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
