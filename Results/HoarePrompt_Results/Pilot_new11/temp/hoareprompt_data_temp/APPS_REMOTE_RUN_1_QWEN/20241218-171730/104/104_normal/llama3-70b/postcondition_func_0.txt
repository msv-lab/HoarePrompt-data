The function accepts a list of integers representing an increasing sequence of length between 1 and 100. It then iterates over all possible sublists of the given list, checking if the elements in each sublist satisfy the condition \(a[k] - a[i] == k - i\) for all \(k\) in the range \([i, j)\). The function calculates the maximum length of such sublists and returns this maximum length as the output. If no valid sublist is found, the function returns 0.
