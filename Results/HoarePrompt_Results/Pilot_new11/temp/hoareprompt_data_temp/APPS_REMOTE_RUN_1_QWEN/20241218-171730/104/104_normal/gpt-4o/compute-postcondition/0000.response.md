The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The other conditions and variables (`a_i`) remain unaffected and are still as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of the input contains n integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3.**
