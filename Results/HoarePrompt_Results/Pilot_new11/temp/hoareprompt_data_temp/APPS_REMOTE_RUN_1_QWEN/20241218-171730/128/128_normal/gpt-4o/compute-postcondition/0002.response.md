According to the provided code and initial state, the loop will iterate over each tuple `(k, l)` in the `days` list. For the loop to execute, the `days` list must contain at least one tuple.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Days List**: The `days` list must contain at least one tuple. Since `n` represents the length of the `days` list and `f` represents the number of elements already in the `days` list, we need to ensure that `f` is at least 1 because `n` must be at least 1 (as per the constraints given).

2. **Tuples in Days**: Each tuple `(k, l)` in `days` must contain two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). This is already guaranteed by the problem statement.

3. **Loop Variables**: The loop variables `k` and `l` will be set to the values from each tuple in the `days` list during each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `k` and `l` should be undefined or irrelevant as they will be assigned inside the loop.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure that `f` (the number of elements in `days`) is at least 1.
- Ensure that `days` is a list containing at least one tuple.

The final state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` and `f` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` such that 0 ≤ `k_i`, `l_i` ≤ 10^9, `regular_sales` is an empty list, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list, and `f` must be at least 1**.
