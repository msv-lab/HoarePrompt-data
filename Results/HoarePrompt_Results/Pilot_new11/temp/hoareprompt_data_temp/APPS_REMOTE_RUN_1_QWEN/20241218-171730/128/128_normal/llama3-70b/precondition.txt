n and f are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. Each line of the following n lines contains two integers k_{i} and l_{i} such that 0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on the i-th day, respectively.
