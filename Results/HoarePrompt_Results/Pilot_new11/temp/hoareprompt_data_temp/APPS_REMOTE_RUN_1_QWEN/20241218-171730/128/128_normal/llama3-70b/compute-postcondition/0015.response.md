Postcondition: **`total` is irrelevant, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an integer within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple consists of two integers `k` and `l` where 0 ≤ `k`, `l` ≤ 10^9, the list `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in descending order; `sold` is 0, and the condition `i < f` is true**
