#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and f are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients that will come to the shop on the i-th day, respectively.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with `n` elements, each being the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with `n` elements, each being \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\) from the corresponding tuple in `days`.

    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of elements in regular_sales plus the sum of the first f elements in potential_sales_increase, where f is the updated value of f - n and regular_sales and potential_sales_increase are as defined in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer), `f` (a non-negative integer), and `days` (a list of `n` tuples, each containing two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i`). It calculates the total sales based on two components: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`.

1. For each tuple `(k, l)` in `days`, it calculates the regular sales for the day as the minimum of `k` and `l`, and stores these values in `regular_sales`.
2. It also calculates the potential increase in sales for each day as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, and stores these values in `potential_sales_increase`.
3. After populating `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`, it sums up the elements in `regular_sales` to get the total regular sales.
4. It then sorts `potential_sales_increase` in descending order.
5. Finally, it adds the sum of the first `f` elements in `potential_sales_increase` (where `f` is updated to `f - n`) to the total regular sales to get the final total sales.

The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of regular sales and the potential increased sales from the top `f` days, after adjusting `f` to `f - n`.

This function handles all potential edge cases within the given constraints, including when `n` is 1 or when `f` is 0. The function also ensures that `f` is non-negative by adjusting it to `f - n` if necessary.
