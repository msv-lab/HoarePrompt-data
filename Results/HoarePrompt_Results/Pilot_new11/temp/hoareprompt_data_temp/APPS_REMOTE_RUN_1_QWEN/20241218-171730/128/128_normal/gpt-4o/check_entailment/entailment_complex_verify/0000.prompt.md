You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for maximizing the number of sold products. Here’s why:

1. **Regular Sales Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of regular sales for each day (`min(k, l)`), which represents the minimum between the number of products available and the number of customers, as per the problem statement.

2. **Potential Sales Increase**: The program also correctly calculates the potential increase in sales if a day is chosen for a sell-out (`min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`). This accounts for the scenario where doubling the products for sale could result in selling twice as many products, considering the constraint that the number of customers cannot exceed the doubled number of products.

3. **Sorting and Choosing Days for Sell-Out**: The program sorts the potential sales increase in descending order and selects the top `f` days for sell-out, ensuring that the maximum possible sales are achieved.

4. **Summing Up Total Sales**: Finally, the program sums up the regular sales and the increased sales from the selected days for sell-out to get the total number of products sold.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for any valid input within the constraints specified. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and f are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients that will come to the shop on the i-th day, respectively.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with `n` elements, each being the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with `n` elements, each being \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\) from the corresponding tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of elements in regular_sales plus the sum of the first f elements in potential_sales_increase, where f is the updated value of f - n and regular_sales and potential_sales_increase are as defined in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer), `f` (a non-negative integer), and `days` (a list of `n` tuples, each containing two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i`). It calculates the total sales based on two components: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`.

1. For each tuple `(k, l)` in `days`, it calculates the regular sales for the day as the minimum of `k` and `l`, and stores these values in `regular_sales`.
2. It also calculates the potential increase in sales for each day as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, and stores these values in `potential_sales_increase`.
3. After populating `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`, it sums up the elements in `regular_sales` to get the total regular sales.
4. It then sorts `potential_sales_increase` in descending order.
5. Finally, it adds the sum of the first `f` elements in `potential_sales_increase` (where `f` is updated to `f - n`) to the total regular sales to get the final total sales.

The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of regular sales and the potential increased sales from the top `f` days, after adjusting `f` to `f - n`.

This function handles all potential edge cases within the given constraints, including when `n` is 1 or when `f` is 0. The function also ensures that `f` is non-negative by adjusting it to `f - n` if necessary.
