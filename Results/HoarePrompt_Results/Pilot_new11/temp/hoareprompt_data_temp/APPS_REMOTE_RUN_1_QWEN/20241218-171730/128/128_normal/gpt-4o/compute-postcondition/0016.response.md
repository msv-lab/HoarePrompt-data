The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n.
- `days` is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients that will come to the shop on the i-th day, respectively.

After executing the function body, the function returns `total_sales`, which is calculated as the sum of elements in `regular_sales` plus the sum of the first `f` elements in `potential_sales_increase`. Here, `f` is updated to `f - n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `f`, and `days`, and return the total sales based on the defined calculations involving `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a non-negative integer), f (a non-negative integer), and days (a list of n tuples containing two non-negative integers). It returns total_sales, which is the sum of elements in regular_sales plus the sum of the first f elements in potential_sales_increase after updating f to f - n.**
