To determine the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute, we need to consider what the loop requires to begin and continue running.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Empty List `days`:**
   - The variable `days` is an empty list at the beginning of the loop.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, the initial state of `days` as an empty list does not affect the loop execution directly. However, it remains an empty list throughout the loop.

3. **Variables `k_i` and `l_i`:**
   - For each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, there are corresponding values `k_i` and `l_i` that are integers within the range \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\).
   - The values of `k_i` and `l_i` are not specified or required to initialize the loop itself but must be defined within the loop body for each iteration.

4. **Variable `f`:**
   - The variable `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
   - While `f` does not directly control the loop, its value should be consistent with the constraints given.

Considering these points, the key state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

- Ensure `n` is at least 1.
- Maintain the initial state of `days` as an empty list.
- Ensure `f` is within the valid range \(0 \leq f \leq n\).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `days` is an empty list, `f` must be within the range 0 to `n` inclusive**.
