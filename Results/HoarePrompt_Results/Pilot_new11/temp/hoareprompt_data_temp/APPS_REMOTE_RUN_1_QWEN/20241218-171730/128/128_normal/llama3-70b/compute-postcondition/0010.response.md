`days` is a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`. The code appends another tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list `days` contains two tuples: the original one and the newly added one.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `days` is a list containing the tuples `(`k`, `l`)` and `(`k`, `l`)`, `f` is within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
