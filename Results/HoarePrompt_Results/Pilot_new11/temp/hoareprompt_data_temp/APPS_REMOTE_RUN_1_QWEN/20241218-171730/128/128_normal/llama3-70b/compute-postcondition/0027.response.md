Postcondition: ***`i` is 3 or 4, `n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an integer within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple consists of two integers `k` and `l` where \(0 \leq k, l \leq 10^9\), and the list `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in descending order; `sold` is \(\text{min}(days[0][0], days[0][1]) + \text{min}(days[2][0], days[2][1]) + \min(2 \times \text{days}[3 \text{ or } 4][0], \text{days}[3 \text{ or } 4][1])\) if `i < f`. Otherwise, `sold` is \(\text{min}(days[0][0], days[0][1]) + \text{min}(days[2][0], days[2][1]) + \text{min}(\text{days}[i][0], \text{days}[i][1])`***
