The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer), `f` (a non-negative integer), and `days` (a list of `n` tuples, each containing two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i`). It calculates the total sales based on two components: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`.

1. For each tuple `(k, l)` in `days`, it calculates the regular sales for the day as the minimum of `k` and `l`, and stores these values in `regular_sales`.
2. It also calculates the potential increase in sales for each day as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, and stores these values in `potential_sales_increase`.
3. After populating `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`, it sums up the elements in `regular_sales` to get the total regular sales.
4. It then sorts `potential_sales_increase` in descending order.
5. Finally, it adds the sum of the first `f` elements in `potential_sales_increase` (where `f` is updated to `f - n`) to the total regular sales to get the final total sales.

The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of regular sales and the potential increased sales from the top `f` days, after adjusting `f` to `f - n`.

This function handles all potential edge cases within the given constraints, including when `n` is 1 or when `f` is 0. The function also ensures that `f` is non-negative by adjusting it to `f - n` if necessary.
