`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i` is within the bounds of the string `s` because `ind + 1` is a valid index and `bind` is the last index of the string. Therefore, `i` is between `ind` and `bind`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is equal to `i`.**
