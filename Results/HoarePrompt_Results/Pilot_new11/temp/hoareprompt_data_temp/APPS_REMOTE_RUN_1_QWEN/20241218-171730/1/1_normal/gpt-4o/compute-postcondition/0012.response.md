According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length `n` of the string `s`. If `s[i]` is not `[`, then `ind` remains unchanged. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. The length of `s` is `n`, and `i` is the current index that was checked.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the bounds of the string `s` (i.e., `i < n`). Therefore, `i` should be updated to `i + 1`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `ind` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`**
