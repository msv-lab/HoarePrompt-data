Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`).
   - `bind` is the index of the last `]` character in the string `s` or -1 if there is no `]` in the string.
   - `ind` is not -1.
   - `bind` is not -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`.
   - `start_colon` is -1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `ind + 1` to `bind` (exclusive).

3. **Determine Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range defined by `ind + 1` to `bind` must be valid.
   - This means:
     - `ind + 1` should be a valid index in the string `s`.
     - `ind + 1` should be less than `bind`.

4. **Current States:**
   - We already know that `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`, ensuring the range is valid.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Since the loop starts from `ind + 1`, we need to ensure `ind + 1` is a valid index.
   - `bind` is the last index of the string, so it is always valid as long as `bind` is not -1.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - No further adjustments are needed since the initial conditions already guarantee the loop can run.

### Final Answer:

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is -1**
