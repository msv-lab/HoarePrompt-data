Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is equal to the index of the first `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind`, or remains `-1` if no `:` is found.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind`.
- It checks if the current character `s[i]` is `':'`.
- If `s[i]` is `':'`, the loop breaks and sets `start_colon` to `i`.
- If no `':'` is found in the substring, `start_colon` remains `-1`.

Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds the first `':'`, after the loop completes, `start_colon` will be set to the index of the first `':'` in the specified substring. If no `':'` is found, `start_colon` will remain `-1`.
