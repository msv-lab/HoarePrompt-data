Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is an integer value, `bind` is the index of the last `]` character in the string `s` or -1 if there is no `]` in the string. If `ind == -1` or `bind == -1` or `ind >= bind`, -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` is equal to the index of the last `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind` (or remains `-1` if no `:` is found), `i` is `-1` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is `ind + 1` if no `:` is found or `end_colon` if `s[i]` equals `':'`, and either `start_colon` is `-1` or `end_colon` is `-1` or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, and `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, `pipe_count` is its original value, and the value of `result` is printed.***
