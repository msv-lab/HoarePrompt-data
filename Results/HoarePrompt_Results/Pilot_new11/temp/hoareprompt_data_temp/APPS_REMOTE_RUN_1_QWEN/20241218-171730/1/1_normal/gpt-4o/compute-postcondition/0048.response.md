Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, and `start_colon` is equal to `i`. If `s[i]` is `:`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
