The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables `end_colon`, `ind`, and `bind` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`end_colon` is `bind - 2`, `ind` remains the same, `bind` remains the same**
