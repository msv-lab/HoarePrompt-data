The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `,`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000. It searches for the first occurrence of `[` and the first occurrence of `:` immediately following it. Similarly, it searches for the last occurrence of `]` and the first occurrence of `:` immediately preceding it. If either pair is not found, it prints `-1`. If the substring between the first `:` after `[` and the first `:` before `]` is empty or invalid, it also prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters in that substring and prints the count.
