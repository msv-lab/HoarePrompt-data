Output State: **`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` is equal to the index of the last `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind` (or remains `-1` if no `:` is found), `i` is `-1` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is `ind + 1` if no `:` is found or `end_colon` if `s[i]` equals `':'**.
