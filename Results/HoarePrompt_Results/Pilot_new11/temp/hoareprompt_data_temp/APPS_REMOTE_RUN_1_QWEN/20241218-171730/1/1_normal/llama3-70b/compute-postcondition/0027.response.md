Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is `i`, and `f` is True. If `s[i]` is equal to `:`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, this condition applies regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.***
