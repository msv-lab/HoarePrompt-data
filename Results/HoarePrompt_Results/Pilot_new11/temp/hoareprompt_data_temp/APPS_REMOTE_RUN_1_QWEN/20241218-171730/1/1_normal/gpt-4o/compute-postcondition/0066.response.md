The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1`. This does not affect any of the existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that the print statement executes, but since the task is to focus on the state of the variables, the variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` is equal to the index of the last `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind` (or remains `-1` if no `:` is found), `i` is `-1` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is `ind + 1` if no `:` is found or `end_colon` if `s[i]` equals `':'`, and either `start_colon` is `-1` or `end_colon` is `-1` or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`**
