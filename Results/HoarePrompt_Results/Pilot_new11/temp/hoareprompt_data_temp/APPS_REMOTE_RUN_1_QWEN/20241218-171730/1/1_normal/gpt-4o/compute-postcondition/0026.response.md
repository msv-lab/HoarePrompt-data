Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is `]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.***
