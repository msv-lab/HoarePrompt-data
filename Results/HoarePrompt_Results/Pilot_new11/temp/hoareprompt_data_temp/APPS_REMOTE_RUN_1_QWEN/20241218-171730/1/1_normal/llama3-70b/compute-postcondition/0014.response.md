Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is either `i` or remains `-1`, and `f` is True.***

This postcondition summarizes both cases:
- If `s[i] == '['`, then `f` becomes True.
- If the condition `s[i] == '['` is false, then `ind` remains `-1` and `f` remains True.
