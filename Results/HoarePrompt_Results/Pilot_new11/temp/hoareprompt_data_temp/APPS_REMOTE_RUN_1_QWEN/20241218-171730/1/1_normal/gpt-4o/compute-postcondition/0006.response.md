The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such context in the given code snippet, the variables `s`, `n`, and `ind` retain their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters '[', ']', ':', and '|', `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in the string `s`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
