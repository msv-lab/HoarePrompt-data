`f` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `ind`, `f`, and `bind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is `False`; `bind` is `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is `False`; `bind` is `-1`**
