Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is a boolean value indicating whether the character at position `i` in `s` (which is `n-3`) was `']'` or `':'`, and `bind` is the index of the character `':'` if found or remains `-1` if not found. If the character at position `i` was `']'`, then the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement is broken. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` was `':'`, then `f` is `True` and `bind` is set to `n-3`, and the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement is broken. If the character at position `i` was neither `']'` nor `':'`, then `f` remains `False` and `bind` remains `-1`.**
