Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string. `f` is a boolean value which becomes `True` if the character at position `i` in `s` is `':'` and `bind` is set to `i`, otherwise `f` remains `False` and `bind` remains `-1`. Additionally, if the character at position `i` in `s` is `']'`, `f` becomes `True` and `bind` remains `-1`.***
