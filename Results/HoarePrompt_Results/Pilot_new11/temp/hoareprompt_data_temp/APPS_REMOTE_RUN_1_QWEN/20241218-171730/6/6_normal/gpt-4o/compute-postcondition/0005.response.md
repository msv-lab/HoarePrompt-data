The code `print(abs(pos - r) + 1)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`, adds 1 to it, and prints the result. However, this calculation does not affect any of the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, `c`, `r`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `a`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `1`, `c` is `c`, `r` is `d`, and the output of the program is `abs(b - d) + 1`.**
