`ans` is incremented by the value of `l - pos`. The previous value of `ans` is 0, so it becomes `l - pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer, `pos` is a specific integer less than `l`, `l` is a specific integer, `r` is a specific integer, `ans` is `l - pos`**
