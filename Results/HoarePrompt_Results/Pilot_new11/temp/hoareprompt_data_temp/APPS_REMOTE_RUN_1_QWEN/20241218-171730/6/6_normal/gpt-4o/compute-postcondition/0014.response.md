Postcondition: ***`n` is `d`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, and the overall state is as follows: if `r` equals `n`, the output is `abs(b - c) + 1`. Otherwise, `r` equals `d`, `move_to_l` is `abs(b - c)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(b - d)`, and `close_both_sides` is `min(abs(b - c) + (d - c + 2), abs(b - d) + (d - c + 2))`***
