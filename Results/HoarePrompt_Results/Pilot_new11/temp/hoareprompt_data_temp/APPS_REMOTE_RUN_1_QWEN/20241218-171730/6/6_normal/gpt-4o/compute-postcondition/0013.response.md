The code prints the value of `close_both_sides`. Since printing does not change the values of variables, the values of all variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `d`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, `r` is `n`, `move_to_l` is `abs(b - c)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(b - d)`, `close_both_sides` is `min(abs(b - c) + (d - c + 2), abs(b - d) + (d - c + 2))`**
