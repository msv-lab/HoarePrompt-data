Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code attempts to move the cursor to the desired range [l, r], but it fails to account for the requirement to close tabs outside this range efficiently. The logic in the code only considers moving the cursor to the boundaries of the range [l, r] and does not handle the process of closing tabs outside this range.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
6 3 2 4
```
The expected output is 5, as per the problem description and the provided solution. However, the code given does not handle the closing of tabs outside the range [2, 4]. Instead, it only calculates the number of moves needed to bring the cursor to the range [2, 4], which does not fulfill the requirement to close all tabs outside this range.

The code needs to include logic to close all tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` after bringing the cursor to the correct position.
