You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the cursor is already within the range [l, r] but not exactly at position `l` or `r`. Let's consider the following case:

### Example Case
Input:
```
5 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Initial state: Tabs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are open. Cursor is at tab 3.
- Step 1: Move cursor to tab 2.
- Step 2: Close all tabs to the right of tab 2 (tabs 3, 4, 5).

However, the provided program will output `5` because it calculates the distance to `l` or `r` and then adds the operation to close the remaining tabs, which is not optimal in this case.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Cursor Position and Range**: The cursor is at position `3`, and the target range is `[2, 4]`.
2. **Close Operation**: Moving to tab `2` and then closing all tabs to the right of tab `2` would be more efficient than moving to `l` or `r` and then closing all tabs.

The provided program does not account for the most efficient sequence of operations in such scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts four parameters \( n \), \( pos \), \( l \), and \( r \), where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), \( 1 \leq pos \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n \). It calculates and returns the minimum number of moves required for a position \( pos \) to reach either end \( l \) or \( r \) of a sequence of length \( n \). If \( l \) is equal to \( r \), the function returns 0. If \( l \) is 1 and \( r \) is \( n \), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of two possible scenarios: moving to \( l \) and then to \( r \), or moving to \( r \) and then to \( l \), considering the additional moves needed to cover the distance between \( l \) and \( r \).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
