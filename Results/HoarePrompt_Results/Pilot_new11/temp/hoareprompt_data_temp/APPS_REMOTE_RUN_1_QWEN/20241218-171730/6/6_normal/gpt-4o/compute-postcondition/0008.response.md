The code `print(abs(pos - l) + 1)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `l` and adds 1 to the result. Given the initial state, we know that `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, and both `b` and `c` are integers within the range `[1, a]` where `a` is between 1 and 100. Since `l` is `c`, the expression simplifies to `abs(b - c) + 1`. The value of this expression will be printed.

The output of the print statement is `abs(b - c) + 1`. Since `b` and `c` are both in the range `[1, a]`, the absolute difference `abs(b - c)` will be an integer between 0 and `a-1`. Adding 1 to this will give a result between 1 and `a`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `r`, `1`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is `d`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, `r` is `d`, and the output is `abs(b - c) + 1`.**
