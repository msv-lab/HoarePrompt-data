`move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`. Given the initial state, `pos` is `b` and `r` is `n`, so `move_to_r` becomes `abs(b - n)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `d`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, `r` is `n`, `move_to_l` is `abs(b - c)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(b - n)`**
