The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The constraints are as follows: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.

Based on the given output cases, the function returns different values depending on the relationship between `l` and `r`.

- Case_1: `l` is less than `r`. In this case, the function returns `r - l + 1`.
- Case_2: `l` is equal to `r`. In this case, the function returns `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` under specified constraints, and return `r - l + 1` if `l` is less than `r`, or return `0` if `l` is equal to `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. If `l` is less than `r`, it returns `r - l + 1`; if `l` is equal to `r`, it returns `0`.**
