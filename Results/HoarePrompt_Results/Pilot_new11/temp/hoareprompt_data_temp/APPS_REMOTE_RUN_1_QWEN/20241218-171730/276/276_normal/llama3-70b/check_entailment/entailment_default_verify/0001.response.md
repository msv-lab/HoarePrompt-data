Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the conversion from the golden system to the decimal system using the formula \( q^2 = q + 1 \) where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function `func_1` iterates through each digit of the input string in reverse order, correctly calculates the decimal value, and the main part of the program accurately compares the decimal values of the two inputs. The output hints provided confirm that the function works correctly for all tested cases, including edge cases such as single-digit strings. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
