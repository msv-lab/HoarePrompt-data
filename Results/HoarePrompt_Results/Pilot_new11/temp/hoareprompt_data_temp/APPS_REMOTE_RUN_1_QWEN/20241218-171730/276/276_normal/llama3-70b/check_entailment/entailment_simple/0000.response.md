Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in the "golden system" and convert them to their decimal values. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two strings from the input, each representing a number in the golden system.
   
2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - For each input string, the program calls the `func_1` function to convert the string into its decimal value. The function iterates over each digit in reverse order, calculates the corresponding power of \( q \) (where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \)), and sums these values to get the decimal equivalent.
   - The function correctly handles the conversion using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \).

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both strings to their decimal values, the program compares these values.
   - It prints '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if the second number is larger, and '=' if they are equal.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes valid inputs, as stated in the problem description.
   - The function correctly handles non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters.

Since the program correctly performs all the necessary steps to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
