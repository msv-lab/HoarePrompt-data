Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly implements the conversion of numbers from the golden system to their decimal equivalents using the function `func_1`. The main part of the program then compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as a single-digit string, and correctly computes the decimal equivalent. There are no logical errors or missing functionalities in the provided code that would lead to incorrect comparisons or outputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
