The code `decimal += int(c) * q ** i` updates the value of `decimal`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is the second character of the reversed string `s`.
- `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.
- `decimal` is `int(s[-1])`.

Let's calculate the new value of `decimal`:
1. `int(c)` converts the second character of the reversed string `s` to its integer value.
2. `q ** i` calculates \( q \) raised to the power of `i`, where `i` is 1. So, \( q^1 = q \), which is approximately 1.618033988749895.
3. `int(c) * q ** i` multiplies the integer value of `c` by `q`.
4. `decimal += int(c) * q ** i` adds this product to the current value of `decimal`.

Since `decimal` is initially `int(s[-1])`, let's denote `int(s[-1])` as `d`.

Let's assume the second character of the reversed string `s` is '3' (for example). Then:
- `int(c) = 3`.
- `q ** i = q = 1.618033988749895`.
- `int(c) * q ** i = 3 * 1.618033988749895 â‰ˆ 4.854103966249685`.

So, the new value of `decimal` is:
\[ decimal = d + 4.854103966249685 \]

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is the second character of the reversed string `s`.
- `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.
- `decimal` is `int(s[-1]) + 4.854103966249685`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character of the reversed string `s`, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is `int(s[-1]) + 4.854103966249685`**
