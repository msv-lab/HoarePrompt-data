Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is 5.
   - `value` is updated based on certain conditions inside the loop.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is 5.
   - `value` has been updated based on the condition `s[i] == '1'`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`.
   - Therefore, `i_new = i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i_new < n` must be true.

Given these points, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `q` remains 5.
- `value` will be updated again based on the condition `s[i_new] == '1'`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `q` is 5, `value` is updated to `value + 5^(n - (i + 1) - 1)` if `s[i + 1] == '1'`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
