Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to compare two numbers in the "golden system." The core issue lies in the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a single number in the golden system but does not compare the values of two such numbers. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the decimal value of a single number represented in the golden system. It correctly uses the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}\) where \(q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\).
   - However, the function only returns the decimal value of a single number and does not perform any comparison between two such values.

2. **Comparison Logic Missing**:
   - The main program reads two numbers from the input, calculates their decimal values using `func_1`, and then compares these values. 
   - This part is logically correct in terms of the flow but fails because the `func_1` function itself does not return the necessary values to make a comparison.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To solve the problem, the program needs to compare the decimal values of the two numbers directly without intermediate steps that do not contribute to the final comparison.
   - A correct approach would involve implementing a direct comparison logic that works with the golden system representation rather than converting each number to its decimal equivalent and then comparing those values.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should include a comparison logic within the `func_1` function itself. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate implementation:

```python
def compare_golden_numbers(s1, s2):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    n1, n2 = len(s1), len(s2)
    
    # Ensure both strings are of the same length by padding the shorter one with zeros
    if n1 < n2:
        s1 = '0' * (n2 - n1) + s1
    else:
        s2 = '0' * (n1 - n2) + s2
    
    n = max(n1, n2)
    for i in range(n):
        digit1 = int(s1[i])
        digit2 = int(s2[i])
        
        if digit1 > digit2 * q ** (n - i - 1):
            return '>'
        elif digit1 < digit2 * q ** (n - i - 1):
            return '<'
    
    return '='

# Reading inputs
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()

# Comparing the two numbers
result = compare_golden_numbers(s1, s2)
print(result)
```

### Explanation of Correct Implementation:
- The function `compare_golden_numbers` directly compares the digits of the two numbers in the golden system.
- By iterating through the digits and comparing them against the scaled value of the next digit in the other number, it determines which number is larger.
- This approach avoids the unnecessary conversion to decimal values and performs the comparison in the golden system itself.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect and should be revised as shown above.
