Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n`, including `smallest - 1`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `len(bits) < k`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to adjust the states so that the condition `len(bits) < k` is satisfied for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the length of the list `bits` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `k > len(bits)` initially, the loop will definitely execute at least once more because `len(bits)` will increase in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - We don't need to change the value of `i`, `n`, or `k` since they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.
   - The only thing we need to ensure is that `len(bits)` increases by at least one in the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, no additional adjustments are required beyond ensuring that `len(bits)` is incremented in the loop body. However, to satisfy the condition for the next iteration, we can state that `len(bits)` must be incremented to meet or exceed `k` in the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` including `smallest - 1`, and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\) and `len(bits)` must be incremented to meet or exceed `k` in the next iteration.**
