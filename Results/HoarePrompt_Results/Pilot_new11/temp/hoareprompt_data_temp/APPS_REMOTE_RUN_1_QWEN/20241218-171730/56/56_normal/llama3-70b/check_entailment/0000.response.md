Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the required sequence cannot be formed with the given `k`. Specifically, the program does not properly check if it's possible to form a valid sequence of length `k` that sums up to `n`.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
13 2

Output:
No
```

This is correct according to the problem statement. However, consider another test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
13 3

Output:
No
```

But the correct output should be:
```
Output:
Yes
3 2 0
```

The program fails because it only checks if `n` is less than `k`, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It should also ensure that it can form a valid sequence of length `k` that sums up to `n`.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that includes the necessary checks:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if it's impossible to form a sequence of length k
    if n < 2 ** k:
        print('No')
        return
    
    a = []
    i = 0
    while n > 0:
        x = n.bit_length() - 1
        if x <= i:
            break
        a.append(x)
        n -= 2 ** x
        i += 1
    
    if len(a) < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = a[:k]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        print('Yes')
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
```

With this correction, the program should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
