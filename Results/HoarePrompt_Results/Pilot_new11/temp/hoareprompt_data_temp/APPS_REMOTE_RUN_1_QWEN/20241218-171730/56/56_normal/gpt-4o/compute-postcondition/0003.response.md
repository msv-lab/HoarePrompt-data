The code initializes an empty list `bits`. This means no changes are made to the existing values of `n` and `k`, and the variable `bits` is now an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `bits` and retains the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n; `bits` is an empty list**
