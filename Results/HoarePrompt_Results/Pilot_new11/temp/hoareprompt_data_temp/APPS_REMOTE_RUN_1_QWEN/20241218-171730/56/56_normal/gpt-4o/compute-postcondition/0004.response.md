Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is an empty list
- The loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 (inclusive) with a step of -1

### Analysis of the Loop:
The loop `for i in range(60, -1, -1):` iterates over the values of `i` starting from 60 down to -1. This means the loop will execute 61 times (since it includes both endpoints).

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will take on each value from 60 to -1. We don't need to explicitly set `i` to any particular value since the loop will start at 60 and decrement until -1.
- **`bits`**: The initial state of `bits` is given as an empty list. Since no modifications are made to `bits` within the loop based on the provided information, we do not need to adjust its state.
- **`n` and `k`**: While `n` and `k` are given specific ranges, they do not directly influence the loop's execution. However, we need to ensure that these variables' values are within their specified ranges to validate the overall state.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop only depends on the loop variable `i`, which will automatically start at 60 and decrement, we do not need to adjust the initial state of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `bits`) are already correctly stated according to the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` will start from 60 and decrement, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is an empty list**
