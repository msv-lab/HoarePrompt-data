Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and the bits in `bits` list are the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit where the bit is set, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the positions of all the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. The length of `bits` list is less than or equal to `k`.**
