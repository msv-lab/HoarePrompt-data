Postcondition: **`i` is 59, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the value 60. If \(n >> 59 & 1\) is true, then the value 60 is added to `bits`. Since there is no else part, the value of `bits` remains unchanged if the condition is false.**
