Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from input(), `k` is an integer obtained from input(), and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is represented as a list `a` of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0, with the length of `a` being less than `k`. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` remains unchanged, and 'Yes' is printed if the length of `a` is not less than `k`.***
