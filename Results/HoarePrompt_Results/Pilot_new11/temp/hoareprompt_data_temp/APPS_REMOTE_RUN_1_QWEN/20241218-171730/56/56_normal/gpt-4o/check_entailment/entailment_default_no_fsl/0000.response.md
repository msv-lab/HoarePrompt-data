Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is exactly 1. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle this scenario. For example, consider the input:

```
4 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
Yes
2
```

However, the current implementation of `func_1` would return 'No' because it checks if `len(bits) > k` after constructing the list of bit positions. Since `n = 4` is a power of 2 (binary representation: 100), it has only one 1-bit, but `k` is 1. The function should still return 'Yes' and output the bit position `2`.

This issue means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
