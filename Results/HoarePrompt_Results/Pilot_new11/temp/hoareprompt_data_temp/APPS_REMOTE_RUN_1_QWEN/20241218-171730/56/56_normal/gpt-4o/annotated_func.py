#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). It processes these inputs to determine if a specific condition is met, and returns one of three possible results:

1. If `k > n`, the function returns 'No'.
2. If the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` (denoted by the length of the `bits` list) is greater than `k`, the function also returns 'No'.
3. Otherwise, the function constructs a list of the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` and ensures that this list has exactly `k` elements by adding the value `smallest - 1` multiple times until the list reaches the required length. It then sorts the list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of bit positions as a space-separated string of integers.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 0, the function will still check if `k` is greater than the number of 1-bits in `n` (which would be 0), and return 'No' if `k > 0`.
- When the number of 1-bits in `n` is already less than or equal to `k`, no modifications are needed, and the function directly returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of bit positions.

Missing functionality or potential issues:
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 (i.e., only one bit is set in its binary representation) and `k` is exactly 1. In such cases, the function should still return 'Yes' without modifying the list, but it currently does so after potentially modifying the list.
