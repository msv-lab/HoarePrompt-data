Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Initial Checks**: The program first checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it immediately prints "No", adhering to the requirement that if no valid sequence exists, it should output "No".

2. **Finding Powers of 2**: The program then uses a loop to find the highest powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0. Each step, it calculates the bit length of `n` to determine the highest power of 2 (`2^x`) that can be subtracted. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 0. This ensures that the sum of the powers of 2 equals `n`.

3. **Handling Length Constraint**: After constructing the list `a` of powers of 2, the program checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "No" again, ensuring that the sequence length meets the requirement.

4. **Lexicographically Largest Sequence**: If the length of `a` is at least `k`, the program trims the list to the first `k` elements and sorts them in descending order. This guarantees that the sequence is lexicographically largest among those with the minimum maximum element.

5. **Output Format**: Finally, the program prints "Yes" followed by the elements of the sorted list `a`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including when `n` is exactly equal to \(2^k\) (which would result in a sequence of `k` identical elements), and when the exact number of required elements exceeds the number of distinct powers of 2 needed to sum up to `n`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for every valid input.
