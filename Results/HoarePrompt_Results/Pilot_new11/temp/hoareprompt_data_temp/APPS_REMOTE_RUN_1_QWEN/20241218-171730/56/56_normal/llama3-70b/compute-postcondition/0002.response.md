The code simply prints 'No', which does not affect the values of `n` or `k`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input(), `k` is an integer obtained from input(), and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. After executing the print statement, 'No' is printed.**
