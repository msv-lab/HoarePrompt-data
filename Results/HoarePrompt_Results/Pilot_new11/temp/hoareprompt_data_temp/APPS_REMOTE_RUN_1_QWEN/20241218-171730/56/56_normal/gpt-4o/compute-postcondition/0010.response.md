Postcondition: **`i` is 58, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the values 60 and 58. If \(n \gg i \& 1 = 1\), the condition holds true and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and the state of the variables does not change.**
