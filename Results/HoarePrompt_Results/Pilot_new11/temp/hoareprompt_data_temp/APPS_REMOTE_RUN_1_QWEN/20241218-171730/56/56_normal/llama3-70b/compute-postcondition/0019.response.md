The code `n -= 2 ** x` impacts the value of `n` by subtracting `2 ** x` from `n`. From the initial state, `x` is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1, so `2 ** x` is equal to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After executing this line of code, `n` will be updated to `n - 2 ** x`.

Given that `x` is the bit length of `n` minus 1, we know that `2 ** x` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` will be reduced to a value that is less than the next power of 2.

Since `x` is `bit_length(n) - 1`, we have:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x = bit_length(n) - 1`.
- `2 ** x` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

After the operation `n -= 2 ** x`, `n` will be updated to a new value which is `n - 2 ** (bit_length(n) - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2 ** (bit_length(n) - 1)`, `x` is `bit_length(n) - 1`, `a` is a list containing `[x]`**
