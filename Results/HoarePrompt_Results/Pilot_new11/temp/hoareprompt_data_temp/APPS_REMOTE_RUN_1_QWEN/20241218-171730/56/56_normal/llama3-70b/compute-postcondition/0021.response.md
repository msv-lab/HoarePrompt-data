According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 2` and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

To determine the new state:
- The previous state was `n` is `n - 2` and `i` is increased by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

No adjustment is needed for `i` since the condition only depends on `n`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
