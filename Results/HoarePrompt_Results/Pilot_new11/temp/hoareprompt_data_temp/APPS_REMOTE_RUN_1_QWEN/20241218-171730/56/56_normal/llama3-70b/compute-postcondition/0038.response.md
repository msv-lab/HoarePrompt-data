The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. 

Given the constraints, the function should handle values of `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and values of `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\), but since these are not parameters of the function, they are likely inputs that are to be considered within the function's body.

Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the input constraints and the absence of parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
