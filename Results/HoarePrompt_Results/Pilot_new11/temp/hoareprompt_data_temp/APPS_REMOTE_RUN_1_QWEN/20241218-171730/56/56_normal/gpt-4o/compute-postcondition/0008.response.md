To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop's range and the condition under which the loop continues.

Given:
- The loop iterates from `i = 59` down to `i = -1` (inclusive).
- The initial state at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is 59, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the value 60.

The loop condition for the for loop is `i in range(60, -1, -1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to -1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 59. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 58.

Since the loop does not depend on `n`, `k`, or the contents of `bits` for its continuation, these values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the value 60**.
