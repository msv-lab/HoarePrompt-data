The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Given the initial value of `current_node` is either 3 or 4, we need to calculate the new value for each case:

- If `current_node` is 3, then `current_node = 2 * 3 + 2 = 8`.
- If `current_node` is 4, then `current_node = 2 * 4 + 2 = 10`.

All other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `current_level`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 8 or 10**
