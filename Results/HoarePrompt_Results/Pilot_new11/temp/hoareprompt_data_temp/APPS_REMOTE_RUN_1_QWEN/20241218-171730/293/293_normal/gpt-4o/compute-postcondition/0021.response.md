The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` impacts the value of `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is either 3 or 4. Let's calculate the new value of `current_node` for both cases:

- If `current_node` is 3, then `current_node = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.
- If `current_node` is 4, then `current_node = 2 * 4 + 1 = 9`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, and `current_level` is 0.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 7 or 9**
