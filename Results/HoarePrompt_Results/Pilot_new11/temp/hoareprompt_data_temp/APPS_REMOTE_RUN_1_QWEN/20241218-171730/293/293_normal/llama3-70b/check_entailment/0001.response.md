Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the player needs to go back to the parent node after visiting a leaf node that is not the exit. This is evident from the test case `Input: 10 1024`, which expects an output of `2046`. However, the program does not account for the scenario where the player might need to backtrack to the parent node multiple times, leading to an incorrect result. 

To correctly implement the solution, the program would need to include logic to handle backtracking to the parent node when the current node is a leaf and not the exit.
