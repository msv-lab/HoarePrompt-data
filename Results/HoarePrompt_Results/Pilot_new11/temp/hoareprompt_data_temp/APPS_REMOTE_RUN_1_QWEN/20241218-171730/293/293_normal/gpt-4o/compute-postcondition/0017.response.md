The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Given that `current_node` is initially 1 or 2 depending on the first element of `path`, we need to consider both cases.

- If `current_node` is 1, then `current_node = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.
- If `current_node` is 2, then `current_node = 2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

Since `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, its first element determines whether `current_node` starts as 1 or 2. However, the exact value of the first element of `path` is not specified, so we consider both possibilities:

- If the first element of `path` is such that `current_node` starts as 1, then after the code is executed, `current_node` becomes 4.
- If the first element of `path` is such that `current_node` starts as 2, then after the code is executed, `current_node` becomes 6.

The values of `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, and `path` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 4 if the first element of `path` was 1 or 6 if the first element of `path` was 2**
