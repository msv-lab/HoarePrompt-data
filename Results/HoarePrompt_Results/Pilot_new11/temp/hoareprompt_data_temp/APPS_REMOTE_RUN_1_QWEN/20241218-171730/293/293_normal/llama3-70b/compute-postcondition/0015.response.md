`n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now half of its original value, and since `n // 2` must be greater than 1, the new value of `n` must be at least 2. Also, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. Since `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is now `h // 2`, the new value of `ans` is `h // 2 - 1`. The value of `h` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is \(h // 2\), and `ans` is `h // 2 - 1`**
