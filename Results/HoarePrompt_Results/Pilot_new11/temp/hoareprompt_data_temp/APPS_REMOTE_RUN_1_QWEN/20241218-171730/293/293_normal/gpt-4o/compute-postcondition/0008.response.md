`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 0, so it is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0**
