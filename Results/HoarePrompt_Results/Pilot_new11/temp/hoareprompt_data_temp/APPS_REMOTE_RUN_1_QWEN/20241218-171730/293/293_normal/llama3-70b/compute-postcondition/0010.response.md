`ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2 - 1`. Since the exact initial value of `ans` is not specified, we only know that `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\) and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and `n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n // 2 - 1`.**
