The code `ans += n // 2` increments the value of `ans` by `n // 2`. Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `ans`, it is assumed to be 0 (the default value for integers in Python). The value of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and \(n > 1\).

After executing the code, `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n // 2`. The other variables, `h` and `n`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and `n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is 0 + `n` // 2**
