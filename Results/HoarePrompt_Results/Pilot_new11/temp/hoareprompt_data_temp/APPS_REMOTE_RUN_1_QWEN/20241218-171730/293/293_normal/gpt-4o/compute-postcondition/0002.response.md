The code sets the value of `total_leaves` to `2 ** h`. Since `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `total_leaves` will be calculated as `2 ** h`. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h; `total_leaves` is 2 ** h**
