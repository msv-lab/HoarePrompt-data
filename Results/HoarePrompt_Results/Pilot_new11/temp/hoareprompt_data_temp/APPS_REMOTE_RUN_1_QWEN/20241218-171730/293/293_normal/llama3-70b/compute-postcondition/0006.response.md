The code `ans += n // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `n // 2` to its current value. Given that `ans` is initially `0`, the value of `ans` will become `n // 2`. The other variables `h` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\) and `n` is odd; `ans` is `n // 2`**
