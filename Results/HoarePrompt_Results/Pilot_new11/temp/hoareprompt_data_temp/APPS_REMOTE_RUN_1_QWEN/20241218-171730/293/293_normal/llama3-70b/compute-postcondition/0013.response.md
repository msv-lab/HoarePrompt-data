The code `n //= 2` updates the value of `n` by performing integer division of `n` by 2 and assigning the result back to `n`. Given the initial conditions:
- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\),
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and `n` must be greater than 1,
- `ans` is updated to `n // 2`.

After executing the code `n //= 2`, the new value of `n` is `n // 2`. The other variables (`h` and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is updated to `n // 2`; `ans` is updated to `n // 2`**
