Postcondition: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\) and `n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is updated to `n // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- If `n % 2 == 0`, then `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n % 2 != 0`, then `ans` is updated to `n // 2`.

In both cases, `ans` is effectively updated to `n // 2`. Therefore, the final value of `ans` is always `n // 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd.
