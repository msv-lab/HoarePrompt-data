Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the requirement that all coins gifted must be different. 

Consider the following case:
- Input: `10 15 2 3`

According to the problem description:
- There are 10 different coins (`N = 10`).
- Ivan has 2 coins in his collection (`K = 2`).
- At least 3 coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection (`L = 3`).

For 15 friends to each give at least one coin, they would need to give a total of 15 coins. Since Ivan already has 2 coins, at most 8 different coins can be duplicates (10 - 2 = 8). Therefore, to ensure at least 3 new coins, each friend must give a unique coin, which means each friend needs to give exactly 1 coin. However, the program simply checks if the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the difference between the total number of coins and the number of coins Ivan already has plus the number of new coins required (`N - K + L`). This check is insufficient because it does not guarantee that all coins are different.

The correct logic should ensure that the number of friends is at least the number of new coins required, and each friend gives a unique coin. Thus, the program should fail in this case since it does not enforce the uniqueness of the coins being gifted.
