Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case where the total number of new coins required exceeds the total number of unique coins available. Specifically, in the second example provided:

- \( N = 10 \) (total unique coins)
- \( M = 11 \) (number of friends)
- \( K = 2 \) (coins Ivan already has)
- \( L = 4 \) (new coins required)

According to the problem, there are only 10 unique coins available, but Ivan needs at least 4 new coins. Since each friend must give a different coin, and there are only 10 unique coins in total, it's impossible for 11 friends to each give a different coin. Therefore, the output should be \(-1\).

However, the current implementation calculates `min_x` as \(\lceil \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \rceil\) and checks if \(M \times \text{min\_x} \leq N - K\). In the above example, this condition is never satisfied because \(11 \times 1 > 10 - 2 = 8\), leading to an incorrect output of `1`.

To fix this, the program should directly check if the total number of new coins required can be distributed among the friends before calculating `min_x`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if it's possible to distribute L+M-1 unique coins among M friends
    if (L + M - 1) > N:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version first checks if the total number of unique coins required (\(L + M - 1\)) is greater than the total number of unique coins available (\(N\)). If it is, it prints \(-1\) immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic.
