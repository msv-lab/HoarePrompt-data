Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Variable Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum value of \(x\) such that \(M \cdot x \leq N - K\), where \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor\). This calculation ensures that the condition "Not less than \(L\) coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection" is satisfied.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if \(M \cdot x \leq N - K\). If this condition is true, it prints \(x\). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program handles the edge case where \(M \cdot x > N - K\) by printing \(-1\). This ensures that the output is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly determines the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
