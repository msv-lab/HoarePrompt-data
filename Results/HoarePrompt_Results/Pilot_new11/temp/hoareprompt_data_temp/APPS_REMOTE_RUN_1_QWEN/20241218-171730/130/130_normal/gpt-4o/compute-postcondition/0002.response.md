`min_x` is assigned the value of `(L + M - 1) // M`. This calculation determines the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(L + M - 1) / M`.

Given the initial conditions:
- \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\)
- \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\)
- \(M \cdot N \ge K + L\)

The variables \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) remain unchanged. The new value of `min_x` is calculated as follows:

\[ min_x = \left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\); `M` is an integer such that \(1 \le M \le 10^{18}\); `K` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N\); `L` is an integer such that \(1 \le L \le 10^{18}\); and `min_x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor\).**
