Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from the input, ensuring that they satisfy the constraints \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\).

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. \(M \ge N - K + 1\): This condition ensures that there are enough different types of coins among the friends' gifts such that at least one type of coin can be given to each friend without repeating the same type.
     2. \(M \ge L\): This condition ensures that at least \(L\) coins from the total gifted coins are new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints `1`, indicating that the minimum number of coins one friend can gift is `1`.
   - If either condition fails, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the terms.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description.
- It ensures that the number of unique coins gifted is sufficient to meet both the requirement of having different coins for each friend and ensuring a minimum number of new coins in Ivan's collection.
- The logic is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
