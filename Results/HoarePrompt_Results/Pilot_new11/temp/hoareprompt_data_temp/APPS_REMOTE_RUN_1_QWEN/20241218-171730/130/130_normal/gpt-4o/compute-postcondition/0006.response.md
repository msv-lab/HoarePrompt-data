The code prints `-1`, which does not assign any new values to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`, and `min_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\); `M` is an integer such that \(1 \le M \le 10^{18}\); `K` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N\); `L` is an integer such that \(1 \le L \le 10^{18}\); and `min_x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor\). Moreover, \(M \cdot min_x > N - K\). A value of -1 has been printed.**
