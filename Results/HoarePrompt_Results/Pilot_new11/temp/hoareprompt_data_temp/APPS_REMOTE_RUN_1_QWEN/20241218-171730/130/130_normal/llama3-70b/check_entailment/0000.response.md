Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

- It checks if the total number of friends (`M`) is sufficient to provide at least `N - K + 1` different coins (since Ivan already has `K` coins out of `N` possible ones).
- It also ensures that the total number of friends (`M`) is enough to provide at least `L` new coins.
- If both conditions are met, it prints `1` indicating that each friend can gift one coin.
- Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the constraints and the conditions specified in the problem, the program correctly handles all potential cases and provides the right output. Therefore, the program is correct.
