The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions involving the positive integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) which are constrained such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\).

Given the information provided, the function does not operate directly with these variables but rather implies they are used within the function. Since no specific operation or return value based on these parameters is given, we can only describe the constraints on these variables.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on conditions involving positive integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) where \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\) and \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\).**
