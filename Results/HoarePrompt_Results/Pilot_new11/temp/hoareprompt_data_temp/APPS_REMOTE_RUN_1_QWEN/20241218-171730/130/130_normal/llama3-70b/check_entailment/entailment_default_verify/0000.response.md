Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions based on the problem description. The output hints confirm that the program checks the required conditions and prints `1` if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints `-1`. The program does not perform any additional actions beyond these checks, and the conditions specified in the problem description are correctly handled. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
