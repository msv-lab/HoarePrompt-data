Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 7.
   - `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` (which is 3) up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If \(2 \times (3 + b) = n\) and \(3 \neq b\), then `ways` is updated to reflect this condition.
   - Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is the last value of `b` checked.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must increment by 1.
   - We need to ensure that the new `b` value still satisfies the loop condition, i.e., it must be within the range `[a, (n - a) // 2 + 1]`.

5. **Calculate the Next `b` Value**:
   - Since `a` is 3, the loop iterates from 3 up to \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\).
   - Let's denote the current `b` as \(b_{\text{current}}\). The next `b` value would be \(b_{\text{next}} = b_{\text{current}} + 1\).

6. **Check the Range**:
   - Ensure \(b_{\text{next}}\) is within the valid range \([3, (n - 3) // 2 + 1]\).

7. **Determine the Updated State**:
   - `ways` remains unchanged unless the new `b` satisfies the condition \(2 \times (3 + b_{\text{next}}) = n\) and \(3 \neq b_{\text{next}}\).
   - `a` remains 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 7.
   - `b` becomes \(b_{\text{next}}\).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `ways` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` remains 3.
- `n` must still be at least 7.
- `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, and `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\)**.

Final Answer:
State: **`ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, and `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\)**.
