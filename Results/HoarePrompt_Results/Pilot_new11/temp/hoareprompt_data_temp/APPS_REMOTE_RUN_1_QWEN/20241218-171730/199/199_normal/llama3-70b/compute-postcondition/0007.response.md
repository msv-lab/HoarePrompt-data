`ways` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `a`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `b` must be incremented by 1 are still valid preconditions.

Output State: **`ways` is 2, `a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 and `b` must be incremented by 1**
