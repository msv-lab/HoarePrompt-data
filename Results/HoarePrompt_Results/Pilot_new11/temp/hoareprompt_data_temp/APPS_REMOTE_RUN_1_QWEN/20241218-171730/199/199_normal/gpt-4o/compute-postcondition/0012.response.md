Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even.
   - `a` and `b` are undefined.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `a` in the range from 1 to \(n // 4 + 1\).

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that within the loop, `a` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even.
   - `a` is undefined, `b` is undefined.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be within the range from 1 to \(n // 4 + 1\).
   - Since `a` is undefined at the start, the smallest value it can take is 1.
   - After the previous iteration, `a` must be the maximum possible value within its range, which is \(n // 4\). Therefore, in the next iteration, `a` will be \(n // 4 + 1\).

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `count` remains the same unless the condition `a != rem // 2` is met, but since `a` is undefined initially and no specific value is mentioned, `count` remains unchanged.
   - `rem` remains the same because `rem` is defined as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) and neither `a` nor `b` are modified in the loop body.
   - `a` will be incremented to \(n // 4 + 1\).
   - `b` remains undefined.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 0 or 1, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even, `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\), `b` is undefined.**
