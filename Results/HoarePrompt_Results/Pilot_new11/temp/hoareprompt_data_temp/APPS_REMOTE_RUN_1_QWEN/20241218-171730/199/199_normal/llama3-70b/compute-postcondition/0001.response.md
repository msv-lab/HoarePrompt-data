Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - The variable `a` will take values from 1 up to `n // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range `range(1, n // 2 + 1)` must contain at least one value.
   - This means `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9), `n // 2 + 1` will always be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Initial Values of Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ways` is initialized to 0.

4. **State Before Loop Execution:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop will start with `a` being 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. Specifically, we need to confirm that `n` is within the specified range and that `a` starts at 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
