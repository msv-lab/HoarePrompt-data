Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even, `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\), `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\), and `rem` is recalculated as \(n - 2 \cdot (n // 2 + 2)\). The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` holds, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` remains either 1 or 2. If `a` equals `rem // 2`, `count` also remains either 1 or 2 since no other changes occur in the else part.***
