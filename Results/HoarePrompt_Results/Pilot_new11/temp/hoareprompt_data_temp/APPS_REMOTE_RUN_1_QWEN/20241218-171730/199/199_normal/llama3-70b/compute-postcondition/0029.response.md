Postcondition: **`ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop, and if \(2 \times (3 + b) = n\) and \(3 \neq b\), then `ways` is updated to reflect this condition; otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.**
