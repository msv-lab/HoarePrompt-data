Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 0 or 1, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even, `a` is undefined, `b` is undefined. If `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then `count` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
