Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the loop control variables and their initial values:**
   - The loop variable `b` starts from `a` and increments until `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions under which the loop will execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the initial value of `b` should be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - This means that `a` should be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Simplify the condition:**
   - Rearrange the inequality:
     \[
     a \leq \frac{n - a}{2} + 1
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2a \leq n - a + 2
     \]
   - Add `a` to both sides:
     \[
     3a \leq n + 2
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     a \leq \frac{n + 2}{3}
     \]

4. **Given values and constraints:**
   - `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).

5. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied:**
   - Substitute `a = 2` into the inequality:
     \[
     2 \leq \frac{n + 2}{3}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3:
     \[
     6 \leq n + 2
     \]
   - Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     4 \leq n
     \]

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4. The initial values of `ways`, `a`, and `n` need to satisfy this condition.

6. **Final state after adjusting the necessary conditions:**
   - `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 2, `n` must be at least 4**
