Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer.
- `a` is 3.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.

### Loop Code
```
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
2. **Condition inside the Loop**: For each `b`, the loop checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. If both conditions are true, `ways` is incremented by 1.
3. **Final Values**:
   - `a` remains constant at 3 throughout the loop.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `b` takes on the last value checked in the loop.

### Final State
After the loop finishes executing, `ways` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` is satisfied during an iteration of the loop. Since `a` is fixed at 3, the condition simplifies to checking if `2 * (3 + b) == n` and `3 != b`.

To summarize:
- `ways` will be incremented for each valid `b` that satisfies the condition.
- `a` remains 3.
- `n` remains the same.
- `b` will be the last value of `b` checked in the loop, which depends on the range `(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.

### Output State
Given that the loop will check all possible values of `b` in the specified range, `ways` will count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`. Therefore, the final value of `ways` will be the total number of such valid pairs.

Output State: **`ways` is the number of valid `b` values such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` and `3 != b`, `a` is 3, `n` is the same as the input value, and `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.**
