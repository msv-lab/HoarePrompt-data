Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider all valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. 

For example, consider the input `20`. According to the problem description, the valid ways to split the stick are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the program incorrectly counts only three of these cases:

- `{1, 1, 9, 9}`
- `{2, 2, 8, 8}`
- `{3, 3, 7, 7}`

It misses the case `{4, 4, 6, 6}` because the loop condition `b = a` ensures that `a` and `b` are the same, which violates the requirement for forming a rectangle (where all sides are different).

To fix this, the program needs to allow `a` and `b` to be different while ensuring that the remaining parts can form a rectangle but not a square. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, n // 2 + 1):
            rem = n - (a + b)
            if rem > 0 and rem >= b and (a != b and a != rem and b != rem):
                count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected function properly handles all valid cases, including the one missed in the original implementation.
