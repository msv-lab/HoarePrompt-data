`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` remains 2, the value of `b` does not change (it is not equal to 2), and the current value of `n` is still equal to 2 * (2 + b). The precondition that `n` must be at least 4 is still valid, but since `b` is not equal to 2, the exact value of `n` is 2 * (2 + b).

Output State: **`ways` is a positive integer + 1, `a` is 2, `n` is equal to 2 * (2 + b), `b` is not equal to 2, and `n` must be at least 4.**
