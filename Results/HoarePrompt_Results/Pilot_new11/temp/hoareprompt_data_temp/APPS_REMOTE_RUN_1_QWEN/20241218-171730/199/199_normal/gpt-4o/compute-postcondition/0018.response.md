Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
- `count` is either 1 or 2.
- `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even.
- `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\).
- `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\).
- `rem` is recalculated as \(n - 2 \cdot (n // 2 + 2)\).
- The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` holds.
- If `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` remains either 1 or 2. If `a` equals `rem // 2`, `count` also remains either 1 or 2 since no other changes occur in the else part.

### For Loop:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 4 + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `a`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` was some value within the range from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`.
3. **Next Iteration of `a`**: For the next iteration of the loop, `a` will be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop is iterating over `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`, let's determine the new state:

- If the current value of `a` is \(k\), then for the next iteration, `a` will be \(k + 1\).
- Since the loop runs until `a` reaches `n // 4 + 1`, the next value of `a` should be the next integer in this range.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `count` remains unchanged.
- `rem` is recalculated as \(n - 2 \cdot (n // 2 + 2)\).
- If the current value of `a` is \(k\), the next value of `a` will be \(k + 1\).

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (n // 2 + 2)\), `a` is \(k + 1\) where \(k\) is the current value of `a`, and `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\)**.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we represent it generally as `a` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (n // 2 + 2)\), `a` is \(a + 1\), `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\)**.
