Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider all valid combinations of lengths that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The code currently checks for pairs \((a, a)\) and sets \(b = a\), which means both \(a\) and \(b\) are the same. This limits the pairs to those where \(a = b\), thus only considering squares. To properly solve the problem, the code needs to explore different values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a \neq b\).

For example, in the second test case (input 20), the valid splits should include \(\{1, 1, 9, 9\}\), \(\{2, 2, 8, 8\}\), \(\{3, 3, 7, 7\}\), and \(\{4, 4, 6, 6\}\). However, the current implementation will miss \(\{1, 1, 9, 9\}\), \(\{2, 2, 8, 8\}\), \(\{3, 3, 7, 7\}\), and \(\{4, 4, 6, 6\}\) because it only considers \(a = b\).

A corrected approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\):

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            c = n - 2 * (a + b)
            if c > 0 and a != b and a != c and b != c:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This revised function ensures that all valid pairs \((a, b, c, d)\) are considered, ensuring the correct count of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.
