Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` aims to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square. However, the logic used in the function does not fully cover all valid cases.

Specifically, the function sets `b` to the same value as `a`, which means it only considers cases where two of the four parts have the same length. This ignores cases where the parts can have different lengths, which is necessary to form a rectangle without forming a square.

For example, consider the input `n = 10`. The valid splits to form a rectangle but not a square include `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, `{1, 3, 3, 3}`, etc. The current implementation does not account for these cases because it only considers pairs `(a, a)`.

To fix this, the function needs to iterate over all possible values for `a` and `b` such that `a <= b` and `2 * (a + b) < n`, and then calculate `c` and `d` such that `a + b + c + d = n`. Additionally, the condition `a != c` and `a != d` and `b != c` and `b != d` must be checked to ensure a rectangle is formed but not a square.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, n // 4 + 1):
            c = (n - 2 * (a + b)) // 2
            d = n - a - b - c
            if c > 0 and d > 0 and a != b and a != c and a != d and b != c and b != d:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This corrected version ensures that all valid splits are considered, and it correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square.
