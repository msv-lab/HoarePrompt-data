According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop iterates over values of `a` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is `2`, `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\), and `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the current value of `a` is still within the valid range. Since `a` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `a` is `2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `a` should be `3`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `b` is the last value of `b` checked, the value of `ways` will remain unchanged if no valid pair `(a, b)` is found.

State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\), `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.**
