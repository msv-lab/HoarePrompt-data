`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, and `b` is `((n - 4) / 2)`. The value of `b` remains unchanged since the code only modifies `ways`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ways` is now either 1 (if initially 0) or a positive integer plus 1 (if initially a positive integer), `a` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `b` is `((n - 4) / 2)`.

Output State: **`ways` is either 1 or a positive integer plus 1, `a` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `b` is `((n - 4) / 2)`**
