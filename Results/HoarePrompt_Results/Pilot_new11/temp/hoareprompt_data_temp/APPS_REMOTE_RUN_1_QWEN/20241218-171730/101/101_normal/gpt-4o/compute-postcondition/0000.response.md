The code initializes four variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to `None`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `m` or the contents of the `screen` list. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` consisting of characters "." and "w", where "w" represents a white pixel and "." represents a black pixel; at least one pixel in the screen is white; `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`.**
