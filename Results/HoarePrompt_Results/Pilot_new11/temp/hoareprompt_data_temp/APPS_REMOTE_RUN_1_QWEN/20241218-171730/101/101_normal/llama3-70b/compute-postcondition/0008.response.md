The code updates `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum values between their current values and the `x` and `y` values from the tuple in `white_pixels`. Since `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `min_x` and `min_y` will be updated to the smallest `x` and `y` values found in the `white_pixels` list.

Let's denote the tuple in `white_pixels` as `(x, y)`. After the code runs, `min_x` will be `min(min_x, x)` and `min_y` will be `min(min_y, y)`. Given that both `min_x` and `min_y` start as `float('inf')`, they will be updated to the actual `x` and `y` values from the tuple in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple**
