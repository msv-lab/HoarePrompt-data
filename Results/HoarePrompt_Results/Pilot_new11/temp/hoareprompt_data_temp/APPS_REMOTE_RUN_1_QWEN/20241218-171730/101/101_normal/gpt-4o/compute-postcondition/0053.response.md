The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `top` was previously `None`. After the code is executed, `top` and `bottom` are both set to `i`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`**
