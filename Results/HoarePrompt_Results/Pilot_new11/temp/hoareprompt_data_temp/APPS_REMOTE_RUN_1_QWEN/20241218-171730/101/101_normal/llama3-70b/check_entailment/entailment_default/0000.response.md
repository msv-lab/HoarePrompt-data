Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the bounding box of the white pixels is too large to fit within the grid dimensions. Specifically, the program checks if `frame_size > max(n, m)` but does not account for the fact that the bounding box itself needs to fit within the grid boundaries. If the bounding box is larger than the grid, the program should still attempt to find the smallest possible frame that fits within the grid, rather than immediately printing `-1`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 5
.....
w.w..
.....
```

The bounding box for the white pixels is from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 3)`, which has a size of `4`. Since the grid dimensions are `3` and `5`, the bounding box does not fit within the grid, and the program should output `-1`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly print the grid without any modifications.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the bounding box fits within the grid before attempting to draw the frame. This can be done by checking if the bounding box fits within the grid dimensions and then adjusting the coordinates if necessary to find the smallest possible frame that fits.
