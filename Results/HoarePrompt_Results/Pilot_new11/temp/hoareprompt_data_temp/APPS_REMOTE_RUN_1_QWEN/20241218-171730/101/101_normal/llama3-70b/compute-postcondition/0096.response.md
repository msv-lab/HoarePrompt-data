The code `print(''.join(row))` does not affect the value of `pixels`. It prints each row in `pixels` concatenated together without spaces. Since the exact content of `row` within `pixels` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output string. However, we know that the structure of `pixels` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`pixels` must have at least two rows**
