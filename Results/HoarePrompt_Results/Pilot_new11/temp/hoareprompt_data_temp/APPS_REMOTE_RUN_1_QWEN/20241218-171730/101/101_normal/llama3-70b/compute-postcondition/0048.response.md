The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect, and the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'` is false, and `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'**
