Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(m):
    if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
        pixels[i][j] = '+'
    elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
        continue
    else:
        pixels[i][j] = '.'
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Iteration Behavior**:
   - The loop runs `m` times for each `i`.
   - For each iteration `j` in the loop, the following checks are performed:
     - If the current position `(i, j)` meets any of the conditions `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.
     - If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the loop continues without changing anything.
     - Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

2. **Behavior After Multiple Iterations**:
   - The loop will iterate over all columns `j` from `0` to `m-1` for each row `i`.
   - If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then the pixel will be marked as `'+'`.
   - If no such condition is met, and `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then it will be set to `'.'`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'` is true for any `j`, then the corresponding pixel will be `'+'`.
     - Otherwise, the pixel will be `'.'` unless it was `'w'`, in which case it remains `'w'`.

### Output State After All Iterations of the Loop Have Finished
Given the above analysis, we can conclude that after the loop has finished executing, the state of the `pixels` array will be determined based on the conditions specified in the loop.

**Output State:**
**``n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1` and each `j` from `0` to `m-1`, if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'` is true, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`, otherwise if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, otherwise `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`.``**
