Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `result[i][j]` is a character.
   - If `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`, then `result[i][j]` is set to '+' if it does not already equal '.'.
   - Otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `left` to `right + 1`.
   - For each value of `j`, the loop body (which is omitted) will check the conditions mentioned above for setting `result[i][j]` to '+'.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there is a valid `j` value within the range `[left, right + 1]`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `j`, the key variable here is `j`. We need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the last value within the range `[left, right + 1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes `j + 1`.

5. **New State**:
   - `i` remains the same since the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - The condition for setting `result[i][j]` to '+' based on the boundary values (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remains the same.
   - The loop continues until `j` reaches `right + 1`, at which point it will stop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`result[i][j]` is a character. If `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`, then `result[i][j]` is set to '+' if it does not already equal '.', otherwise no change is made. Otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `j + 1`.**
