Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 0. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and the pixel value `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'+'`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, `pixels[i][0]` is set to `'.'`.***
