The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state where `j` is `j + 1`, `right` is `i` if `j + 1 > right`, and `bottom` is `i`, the values of `left` and `right` are updated to `j`.

- The value of `left` becomes `j`.
- The value of `right` becomes `j`.
- The values of `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and the condition for `right` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `i` if `j + 1 > i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`**
