Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be either `m-1` (updated from a previous value less than `m-1`) or will be explicitly set to `m-1`. If the pixel at `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated to `'.'`.***
