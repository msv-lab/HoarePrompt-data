The code `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element `result[i][j]`. The value of `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and the condition `left <= j_prev + 1 <= right + 1` is true, meaning that `j` falls within this range. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result[i][j]` is `+`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and `left <= j_prev + 1 <= right + 1`**
