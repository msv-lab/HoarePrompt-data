The code assigns the value of `j` to `left`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `top` remains unchanged
- `bottom` is `i`
- `left` is now `j`
- `right` remains unchanged

Output State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` remains unchanged**
