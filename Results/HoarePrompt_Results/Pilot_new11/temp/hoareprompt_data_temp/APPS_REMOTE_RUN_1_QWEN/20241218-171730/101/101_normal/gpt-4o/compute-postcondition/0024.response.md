The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since the initial state specifies that `left` and `right` are `j+1` if `j+1 > left` or `right`, otherwise they remain `None`, the new values for `left` and `right` will be `j` because the assignment overrides the previous conditions. The other variables (`top`, `bottom`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`**
