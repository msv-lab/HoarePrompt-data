The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `top` and `bottom` were previously equal to `i`, this assignment does not change their values. The value of `right` is also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only changes are in the assignment of `i` to `top` and `bottom`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, and `right` is unchanged.**
