The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values, the conditions and values of the variables from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` must be 0, and either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` or `i` is not equal to `max_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'**
