Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, then it remains unchanged. If neither condition is met, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.***
