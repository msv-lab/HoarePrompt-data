The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial values of `top` and `bottom` are both `i`, and these remain unchanged. The value of `left` and `right` are updated to `j`. The list `screen` and its properties (each string being of length `m` and consisting of characters ".", "w") remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w", `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`**
