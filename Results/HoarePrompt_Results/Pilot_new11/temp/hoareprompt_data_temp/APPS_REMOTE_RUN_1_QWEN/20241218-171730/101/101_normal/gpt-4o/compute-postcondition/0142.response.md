Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1. This is true regardless of whether the if condition (`top is None`) is met or not, as the else part ensures that these values are set to 1 when `j > right` is false, which is always the case here since `j` starts at 1 and `right` is initially 0.***
