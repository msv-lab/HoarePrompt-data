According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pixels`. For the loop to execute again, `pixels` must have at least one more row.

At the end of the last iteration, the string joined from `row` has been printed, and `pixels` must have had at least one more row. This means that before the current iteration, `pixels` had at least one row. Now, for the loop to execute one more time, `pixels` must have at least two rows.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must have had at least one row.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `pixels` must have at least two rows now.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `pixels` must have at least two rows.

State: **`pixels` must have at least two rows**
