Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j] == '+'`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, for all tuples `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '+'. If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, there exists at least one tuple `(i, j)` in `white_pixels` such that `pixels[i][j] == 'w'. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains `'.'`.**
