Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple.
   - `m` is the length of each list in `pixels`.
   - For all `(i, j)` in `pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise.
   - If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
   - If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for row in pixels:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - The loop iterates over each `row` in `pixels`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `pixels` is not empty and it contains at least one row.
   - Since `pixels` is already stated to contain at least one list (as implied by the condition about `white_pixels` containing at least one tuple), we do not need to adjust this part further.
   - The loop itself does not modify `n`, `white_pixels`, or `m`. It only processes the rows in `pixels`.

4. **States to Be Adjusted:**
   - We need to ensure that `pixels` is iterable and contains at least one row.
   - We do not need to change `n`, `white_pixels`, or `m` as they are not modified by the loop and the initial conditions already cover them.

### Conclusion:

The state before the loop should remain as provided because the loop does not depend on `n`, `white_pixels`, or `m` being modified or checked. The key is ensuring that `pixels` is a non-empty iterable containing at least one row.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is the length of each list in `pixels`, `pixels` is a non-empty iterable containing at least one row.**
