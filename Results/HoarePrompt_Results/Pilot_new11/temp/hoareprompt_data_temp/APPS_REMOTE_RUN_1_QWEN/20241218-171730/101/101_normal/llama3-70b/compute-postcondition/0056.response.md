The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` updates the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, only that `n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, this means `pixels[i][1]` is updated to `'.'`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `pixels[i][1]` is `'.'`**
