Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'` is false, and `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w'**
