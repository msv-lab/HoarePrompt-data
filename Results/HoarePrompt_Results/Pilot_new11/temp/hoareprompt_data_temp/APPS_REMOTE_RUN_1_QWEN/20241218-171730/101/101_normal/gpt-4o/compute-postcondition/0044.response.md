The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. The values of `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w"; `top` remains unchanged if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` is set to `i`; `bottom` is now equal to `i`; `left` remains unchanged if `j < left`, otherwise `left` is set to `j`; `right` is now equal to `j`.**
