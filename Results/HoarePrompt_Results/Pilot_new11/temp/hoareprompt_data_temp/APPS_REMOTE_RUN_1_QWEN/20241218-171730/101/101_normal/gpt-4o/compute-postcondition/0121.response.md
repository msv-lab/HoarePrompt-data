`top` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, `top` becomes `n + 1`. The values of the other variables (`j`, `m`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
