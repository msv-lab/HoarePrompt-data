Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`. If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is now equal to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `bottom` remain as initially defined.***
