The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` updates the value of the element in the `pixels` list at index `[i][j]` to `'.'`. Based on the initial state, the following variables are affected:

- `i` and `j` are indices used to access the specific tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is less than `m-1` and will be set to `m-1` for the next iteration.

The initial state specifies that `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, but since no specific value or tuple is given, we can only confirm that the tuple at `[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now `m-1`, and the pixel at `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`**
