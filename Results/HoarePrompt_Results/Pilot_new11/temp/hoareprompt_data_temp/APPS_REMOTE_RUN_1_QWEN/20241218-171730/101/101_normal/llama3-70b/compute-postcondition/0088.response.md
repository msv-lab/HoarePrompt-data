Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is 2. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the condition remains unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.***
