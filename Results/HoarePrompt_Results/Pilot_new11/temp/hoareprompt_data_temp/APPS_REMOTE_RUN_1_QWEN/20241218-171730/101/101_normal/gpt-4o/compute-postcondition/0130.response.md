Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. If `screen[i][j] == 'w'` and `top` is not `None` and `j <= right`, the state remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and other variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) are in specific values.
- The if part condition is `screen[i][j] == 'w'` and it specifies that if `top` is `None` or `j > right`, the state remains unchanged. However, since the else part is not present and does not introduce any changes, we only consider the if part's condition.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition will describe the state where the if condition holds (i.e., `screen[i][j] == 'w'` and `top` is not `None` and `j <= right`) and the state remains unchanged.
