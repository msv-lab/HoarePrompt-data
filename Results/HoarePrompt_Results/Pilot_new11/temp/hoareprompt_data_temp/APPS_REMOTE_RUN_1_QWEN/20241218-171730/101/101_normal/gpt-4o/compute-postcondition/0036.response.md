The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since the initial value of `i` is `i + 1` (as per the initial state), `top` and `bottom` are both set to `i + 1`. The values of `screen`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w", `top` is `i + 1`, `bottom` is `i + 1`, `left` is `0`, and `right` is `0**.
