The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1`**
