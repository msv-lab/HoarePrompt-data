Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". If `i > bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` is set to `i`; `bottom` is now equal to `i`; `left` is equal to `j` if `j < left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged.***
