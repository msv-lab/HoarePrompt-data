Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly find the smallest square frame that encloses all white pixels. The code only checks the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of white pixels and does not ensure that all white pixels are on the border of the frame. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the smallest possible frame cannot be formed due to the distribution of white pixels. For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
w..
...
..w
```

The code will incorrectly output:
```
w++w
+++w
++w+
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
w++w
+w+w
++w+
```

This is because the smallest possible frame that encloses all white pixels is of size 2x2, but the code fails to recognize this and instead forms a larger frame. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of finding the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions.
