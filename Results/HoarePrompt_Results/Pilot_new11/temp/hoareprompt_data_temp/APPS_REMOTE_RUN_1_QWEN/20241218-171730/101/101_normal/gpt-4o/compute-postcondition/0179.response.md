The code `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element at index `[i][j]` in the `result` list. Since the initial state only mentions the assignment but does not specify the initial values of `result`, `i`, or `j`, we assume that `result` is a list and `i` and `j` are indices that are valid for `result`. The output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`result[i][j]` is '+'**
