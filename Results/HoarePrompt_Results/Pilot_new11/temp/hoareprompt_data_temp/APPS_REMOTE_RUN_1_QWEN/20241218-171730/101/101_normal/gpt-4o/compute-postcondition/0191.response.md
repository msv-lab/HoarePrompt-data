The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` from `'.'` to `'+'`. Since `i` is initially set to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, and `j` can have any value, we know that `result[i][j]` will be updated to `'+'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` remains the same, `top` remains the same, `bottom` remains the same, `left` remains the same, `right` remains the same, `frame_height` remains the same, `frame_width` remains the same, `result` is updated such that `result[i][j]` is now `'+',` where `i` is `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, and `j` can have any value, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` can have any value.**
