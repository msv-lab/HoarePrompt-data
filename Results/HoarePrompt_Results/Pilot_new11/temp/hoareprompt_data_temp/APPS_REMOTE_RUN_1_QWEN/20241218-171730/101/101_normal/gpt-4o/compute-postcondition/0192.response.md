Postcondition: ***`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, and `result` remain the same. If `result[i][j]` is `.`, then `result[i][j]` is updated to `'+',` where `i` is `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, and `j` can have any value. `i` becomes `i + 1`, and `j` can have any value.***
