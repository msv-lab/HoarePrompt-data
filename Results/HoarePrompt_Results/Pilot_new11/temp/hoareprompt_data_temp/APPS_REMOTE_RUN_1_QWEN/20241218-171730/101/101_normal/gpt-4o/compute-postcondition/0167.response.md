The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to `+`. Given the initial state, this line of code specifically updates the values at the boundaries defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. The specific indices are `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]`.

The initial state of `result` is a list of `n` lists, each a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with boundary characters updated to `+`. Since the code only updates these boundary characters, the rest of the `result` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `j` is `right + 1`
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` updated to `+`

Output State: **`j` is `right + 1`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of `n` lists, each a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` updated to `+`.**
