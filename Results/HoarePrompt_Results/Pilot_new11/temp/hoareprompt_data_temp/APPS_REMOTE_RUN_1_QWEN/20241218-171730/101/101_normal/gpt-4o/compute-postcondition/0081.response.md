Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`. Additionally, if `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for and the final state of the program variables is accurately described.
