`bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial conditions state that if `i < top`, then `top` is set to `i`. However, the code only updates `bottom` and does not affect `top` unless the condition `i < top` is met. Since the condition is not explicitly checked in the given code, we assume `top` remains unchanged if `i >= top`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w"; `top` remains unchanged if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` is set to `i`; `bottom` is now equal to `i`; `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
