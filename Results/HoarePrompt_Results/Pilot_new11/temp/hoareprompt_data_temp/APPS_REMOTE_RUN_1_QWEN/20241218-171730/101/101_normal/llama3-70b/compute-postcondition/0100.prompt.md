You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m representing the dimensions of the monitor, followed by n lines of strings, where each string contains exactly m characters. Characters "." represent black pixels, and "w" represent white pixels. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel is white, and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is the length of each list in `pixels`, for all `(i, j)` in `pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the pixel matrix, and each element in the inner list is either `'w'` or `'.'`. For each `(i, j)` in `pixels`, if `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`. The loop will execute at least as many times as the number of rows in `pixels`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'). `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple. `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, then `-1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, for each `(i, j)` in `pixels`, if `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and returns information about the white pixels.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
