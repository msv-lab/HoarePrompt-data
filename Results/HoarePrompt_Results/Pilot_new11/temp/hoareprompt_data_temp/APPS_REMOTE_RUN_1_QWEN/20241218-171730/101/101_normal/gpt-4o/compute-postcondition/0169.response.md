Postcondition: ***`j` is `right + 1`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of `n` lists, each a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` updated to `+` if `result[i][j]` equals `.` for the current row index `i` being either `top` or `bottom`, and the current column index `j` being either `left` or `right`.***
