The code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. Since `i` remains unchanged and was previously equal to `i`, and `bottom` is now explicitly set to `i`, the only change is in the value of `bottom`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`. `bottom` is now equal to `i`.**
