Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `screen` remains the same.
- `top` remains the same.
- `bottom` remains the same.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.
- `frame_height` remains the same.
- `frame_width` remains the same.
- `result` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if there are values in this range. Specifically:
- The variable `j` will take on each integer value from `left` to `right`, inclusive.
- The loop will stop once `j` exceeds `right`.

### States to Adjust
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that the range `left` to `right + 1` is valid and non-empty. This means `left` should be less than or equal to `right`.

### Updated State
- `screen` remains the same.
- `top` remains the same.
- `bottom` remains the same.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.
- `frame_height` remains the same.
- `frame_width` remains the same.
- `result` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- The range `left` to `right + 1` must be valid (i.e., `left <= right`).

### Final State
State: **`screen` remains the same, `top` remains the same, `bottom` remains the same, `left` remains the same, `right` remains the same, `frame_height` remains the same, `frame_width` remains the same, `result` remains the same, `i` becomes `i + 1`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`**
