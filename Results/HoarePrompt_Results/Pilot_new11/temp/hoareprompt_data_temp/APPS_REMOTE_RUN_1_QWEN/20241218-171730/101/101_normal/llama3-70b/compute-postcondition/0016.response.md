The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. The `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`; -1 is printed to the console.**
