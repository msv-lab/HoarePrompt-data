The code assigns the value of `right - left + 1` to `frame_width`. This calculation does not affect the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `total`, `num`, or `x`. The value of `frame_height` remains unchanged and is still `bottom - top + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.**
