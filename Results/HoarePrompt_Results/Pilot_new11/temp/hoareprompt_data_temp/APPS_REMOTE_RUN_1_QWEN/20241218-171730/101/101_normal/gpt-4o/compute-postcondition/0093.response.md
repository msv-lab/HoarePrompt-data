Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, `bottom` is `i`, and `left` is either `j + 1` if `j + 1 > left`, or remains unchanged. If `j > right`, then `right` is set to `j`; otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.***
