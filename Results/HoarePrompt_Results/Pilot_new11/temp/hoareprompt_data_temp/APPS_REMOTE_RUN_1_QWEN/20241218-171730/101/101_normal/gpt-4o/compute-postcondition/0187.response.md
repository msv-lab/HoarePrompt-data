Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
   - `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
   - `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
   - `i` is the current row index being processed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate over rows from `top` to `bottom` inclusive.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `bottom + 1`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` starts from `top` and increases by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - All other variables (`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `result`) remain unchanged.

5. **New State:**
   - `screen` remains the same.
   - `top` remains the same.
   - `bottom` remains the same.
   - `left` remains the same.
   - `right` remains the same.
   - `frame_height` remains the same.
   - `frame_width` remains the same.
   - `result` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'; `i` is `i + 1`.**
