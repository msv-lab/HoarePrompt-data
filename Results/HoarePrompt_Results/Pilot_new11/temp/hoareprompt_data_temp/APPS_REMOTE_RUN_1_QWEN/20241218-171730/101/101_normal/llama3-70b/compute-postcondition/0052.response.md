Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration. After executing the if-else block, if `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is `'.'`, then the pixel is unchanged. Otherwise, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is set to `'.'`.**
