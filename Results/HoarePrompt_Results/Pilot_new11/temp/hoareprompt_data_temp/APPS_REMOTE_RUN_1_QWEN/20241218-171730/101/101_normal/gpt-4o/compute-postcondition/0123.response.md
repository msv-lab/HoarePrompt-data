The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `bottom` will be updated to `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.**
