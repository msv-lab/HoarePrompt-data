The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it takes input in the form of two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of the monitor, followed by `n` lines of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters. The characters "." represent black pixels, and "w" represents white pixels. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel is white, and `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`.

Based on the input, the function processes the grid of pixels and returns information related to the white pixels, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given output cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and returns information about the white pixels.**
