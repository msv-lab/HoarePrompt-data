State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The condition for the loop `for j in range(m)` to execute is that `j` should be within the range defined by `m`.
2. According to the given state, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. This ensures that the loop can potentially execute.
3. The initial value of `j` in the first iteration of the loop is 0.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 0.

So, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `j` is 0 while maintaining the other given conditions.
