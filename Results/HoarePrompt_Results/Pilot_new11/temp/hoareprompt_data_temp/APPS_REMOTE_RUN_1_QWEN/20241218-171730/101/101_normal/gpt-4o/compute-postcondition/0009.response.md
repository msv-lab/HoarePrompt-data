The code sets `top` to the value of `i`. The value of `i` is less than the value of `top`, which was not `None`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w", `top` is now `i`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w", `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`**
