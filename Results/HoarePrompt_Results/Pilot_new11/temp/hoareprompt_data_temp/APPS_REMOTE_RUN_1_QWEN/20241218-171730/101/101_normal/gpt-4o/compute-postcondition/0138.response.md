`left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial values of the variables are: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. Since `left` is updated to `j` and `j` is 1, `left` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 1, and `right` is 0.**
