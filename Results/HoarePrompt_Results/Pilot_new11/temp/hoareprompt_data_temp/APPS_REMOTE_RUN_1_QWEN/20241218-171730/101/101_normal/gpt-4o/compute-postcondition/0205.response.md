The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` consisting of characters "." and "w", where "w" represents a white pixel and "." represents a black pixel. At least one pixel in the screen is white.

The function has three possible return cases:
- Case_1: The program returns -1.
- Case_2: The program returns -1.
- Case_3: `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, and depending on certain conditions, return -1 or a modified version of `screen` where the border cells are updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
