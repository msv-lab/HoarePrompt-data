Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is `i` if `i > bottom`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `bottom` is now `i`; `left` is either `j` (if `j < left`) or remains `None`; `right` is now `j` if `j > right`, otherwise it remains `None`.***
