Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `m`
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(m):
    if screen[i][j] == 'w':
        if top is None:
            top = bottom = i
            left = right = j
        else:
            if i < top:
                top = i
            if i > bottom:
                bottom = i
            if j < left:
                left = j
            if j > right:
                right = j
```

### Observations from First Few Iterations

#### After 1st Execution (j=0)
- If `screen[i][0] == 'w'`:
  - `top` becomes `n + 1` (since `top` was initially `None`)
  - `bottom` becomes `n + 1`
  - `left` becomes `0`
  - `right` becomes `0`
- If `screen[i][0] != 'w'`:
  - Variables remain unchanged.

#### After 2nd Execution (j=1)
- If `screen[i][1] == 'w'`:
  - `top` remains `n + 1` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `bottom` becomes `n + 1` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `left` remains `0` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `right` becomes `1` (if `screen[i][1] > right`)

#### After 3rd Execution (j=2)
- If `screen[i][2] == 'w'`:
  - `top` remains `n + 1` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `bottom` becomes `n + 1` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `left` remains `0` (unchanged from previous iteration)
  - `right` becomes `2` (if `screen[i][2] > right`)

### General Pattern

- If no 'w' is found in the `n`-th row (`screen[i][j]` never equals 'w'):
  - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain `None`, `n + 1`, `m`, and `m` respectively.
- If 'w' is found in the `n`-th row:
  - `top` will be the minimum row index where 'w' is found.
  - `bottom` will be the maximum row index where 'w' is found.
  - `left` will be the minimum column index where 'w' is found.
  - `right` will be the maximum column index where 'w' is found.

### Final Output State

After the loop executes all `m` iterations, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will reflect the smallest and largest indices of 'w' found in the `n`-th row of `screen`. If no 'w' is found, the variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `m`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`.**
