The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is less than `left`, which means `left` was previously `None`. Therefore, `j` must be assigned to `left`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is `i` if `i > bottom`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `bottom` is now `i`; `left` is `j`; `right` is still `None`; the current value of `j` is less than `left`**
