`pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+',` which means the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list changes from `'.'` to `'+'.` The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'+'.**
