Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( j \) is \( left \)
   - \( i \) is \( k + 1 \)
   - \( screen \) is a list of \( n \) strings, each string is of length \( m \) and consists of characters ".", "w"
   - \( top \) is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
   - \( bottom \) is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
   - \( left \) is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
   - \( right \) is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
   - \( frame_height \) is \( bottom - top + 1 \)
   - \( frame_width \) is \( right - left + 1 \)
   - \( frame_height \geq 2 \)
   - \( frame_width \geq 2 \)
   - \( result \) is a list of \( n \) lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(left, right + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as \( j < right + 1 \).
   - Given that \( j \) starts from \( left \) at the beginning of the loop and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will stop when \( j = right + 1 \).

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, \( j \) was equal to \( left \). For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, \( j \) will be \( left + 1 \).
   - The other states remain unchanged because the loop only affects \( j \) and does not directly modify any other state variables within the given context.

**Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `j` is `left + 1`
- `i` remains `k + 1`
- `screen` remains unchanged
- `top` remains the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `bottom` remains the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `left` remains the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `right` remains the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`
- `frame_height` remains \( bottom - top + 1 \)
- `frame_width` remains \( right - left + 1 \)
- `frame_height \geq 2`
- `frame_width \geq 2`
- `result` remains unchanged

**State:**
**`j` is `left + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'**
