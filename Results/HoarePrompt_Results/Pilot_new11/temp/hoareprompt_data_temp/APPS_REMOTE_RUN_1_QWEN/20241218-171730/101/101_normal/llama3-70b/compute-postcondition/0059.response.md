According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will continue if `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 1

Given that `j` is currently 1, the condition `j < m` will hold true as long as `m > 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and the conditions for `n`, `white_pixels`, and `m` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
