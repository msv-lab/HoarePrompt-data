Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited` contains all nodes in the cycle marked as True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited, `x` points to the last node in the cycle, `cycles` is a list containing at least one element which is the list `cycle`. If `visited[i]` is False, `i` is incremented.***
