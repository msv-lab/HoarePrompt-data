Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `not visited[x]`. For the loop to execute, `visited[x]` must be `False`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `visited[0]` is True.
   - `cycle` is an empty list.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Currently, `visited[0]` is True. To make the loop start, we need `visited[0]` to be False.
   - The value of `x` is 1, but this alone does not determine the loop's execution because the loop checks `visited[x]`, which is `visited[1]` in this case.
   - Since `visited[1]` is not mentioned as being True or False, we assume it needs to be `False` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to set `visited[1]` to `False`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is False, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.**
