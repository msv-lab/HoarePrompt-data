`x` is assigned the value `p[x] - 1`. The `cycle` list appends the value of `x` to itself. The `visited[x]` variable remains `True` as the code does not modify its value.

Therefore, the output state is: `visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x` and `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x` and `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
