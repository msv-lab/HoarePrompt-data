The code appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. This does not change the values of `visited[x]`, `cycle`, or `x`. The `cycles` list now includes the `cycle` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains all values of `x` that were visited until the loop terminates; `x` is the final value of `x` when the loop exits; `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains all values of `x` that were visited until the loop terminates; `x` is the final value of `x` when the loop exits; `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
