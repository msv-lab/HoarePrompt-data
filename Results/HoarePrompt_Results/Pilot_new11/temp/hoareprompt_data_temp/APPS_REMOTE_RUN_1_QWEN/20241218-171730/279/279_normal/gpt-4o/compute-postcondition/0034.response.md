The code `visited[x] = True` sets the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is equal to `p[1] - 1`. Since `visited[p[1] - 1]` was initially `False`, it will now be set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is True**
