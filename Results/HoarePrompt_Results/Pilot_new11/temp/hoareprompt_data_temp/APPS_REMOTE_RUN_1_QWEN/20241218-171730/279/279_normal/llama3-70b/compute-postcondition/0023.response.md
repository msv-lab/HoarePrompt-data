The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns a specific value (the exact value is not specified in the given information).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`, and return a value based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`, and returns a value based on the specified conditions.**
