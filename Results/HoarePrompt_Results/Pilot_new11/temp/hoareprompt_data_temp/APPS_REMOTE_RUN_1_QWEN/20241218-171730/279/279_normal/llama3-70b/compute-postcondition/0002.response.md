The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, then assigns the resulting list to `b`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the initial value of `p` is lost since it is no longer referenced after the code executes.

Let's denote the input as `input_str`, which is a space-separated string of integers. After executing the code, `b` will be a list of integers obtained from `input_str`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**
