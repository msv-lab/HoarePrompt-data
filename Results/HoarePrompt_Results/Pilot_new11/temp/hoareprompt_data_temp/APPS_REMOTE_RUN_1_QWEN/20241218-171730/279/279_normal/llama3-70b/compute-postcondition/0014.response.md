The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is set to 2. Therefore, after executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 3, `i` is 3**
