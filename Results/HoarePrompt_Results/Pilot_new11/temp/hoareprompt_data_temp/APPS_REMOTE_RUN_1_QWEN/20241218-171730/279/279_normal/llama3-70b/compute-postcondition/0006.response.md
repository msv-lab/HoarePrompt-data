`ans` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `i`, and the condition about `p[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`**
