The code snippet `b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))` maps each element in the slice `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` to an integer and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The original value of `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. After executing this line of code, the new value of `b` will be the list of integers obtained from converting the elements of `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[1:n+1]` to integers
- `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input

After the code is executed, the value of `b` will be updated to the list of integers obtained from converting the elements of `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `p` is a list of n integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[1:n+1]` to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
