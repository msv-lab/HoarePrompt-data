The code assigns the value of the first element in the `data` list to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to an integer extracted from the input data. The variables `p`, `b`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `b` is a list of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
