Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to ensure each skewer visits all 2n placements. Specifically, the logic for counting changes is flawed. The program increments `ans` for each position where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and for each `b[i]` that is `0`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the skewers will visit all required placements.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 1 1 1
```
The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`. By changing the permutation to `[2, 1, 4, 3]` and leaving the sequence `b` unchanged, we can ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Thus, the program fails to find the minimum number of changes required.
