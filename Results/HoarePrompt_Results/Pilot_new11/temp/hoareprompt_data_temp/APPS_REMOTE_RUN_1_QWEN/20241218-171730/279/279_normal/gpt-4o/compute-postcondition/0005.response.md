The code initializes a list called `visited` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The values of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `data` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `visited` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `p` is a list of n integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[1:n+1]` to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `visited` is a list of n elements all set to `False`**
