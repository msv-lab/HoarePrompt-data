`x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. Given the initial state where `visited[x]` is `True` and `cycle` contains `x`, the value of `x` changes to `p[x] - 1`. The states of the other variables (`visited` and `cycle`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
