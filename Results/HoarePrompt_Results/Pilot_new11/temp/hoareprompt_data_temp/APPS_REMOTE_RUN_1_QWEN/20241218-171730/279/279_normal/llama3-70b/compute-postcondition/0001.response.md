The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The initial state of `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. After executing this line of code, the variable `p` will be updated with the new input values while `n` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.**
