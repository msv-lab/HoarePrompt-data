Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True`; `cycle` contains all values of `i` that were visited until the loop terminates; `i` is the final value of `i` when the loop exits; `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the state remains unchanged.***
