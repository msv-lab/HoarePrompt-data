According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are both empty lists, which do not affect the loop's execution directly.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**
