`is_unrated` is set to `True`. The values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and the condition about `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, and `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]`.**
