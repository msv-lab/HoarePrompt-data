The code snippet `print('rated')` simply prints the string 'rated' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. The only change is that the string 'rated' is printed.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `True`, if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n + 1`; the string 'rated' is printed to the console.**
