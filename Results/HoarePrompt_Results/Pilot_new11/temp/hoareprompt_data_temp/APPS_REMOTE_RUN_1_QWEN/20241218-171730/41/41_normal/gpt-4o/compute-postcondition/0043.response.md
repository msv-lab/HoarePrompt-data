The code `print('maybe')` simply prints the string 'maybe' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the output to the console, but this is not included in the variable states.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`, and for any `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` does not hold true**
