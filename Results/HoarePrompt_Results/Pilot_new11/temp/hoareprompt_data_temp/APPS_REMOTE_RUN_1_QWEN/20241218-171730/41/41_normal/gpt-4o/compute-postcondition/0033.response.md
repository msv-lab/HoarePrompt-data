The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or condition it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the provided code snippet, the only impact is that the program would break out of any existing loop or condition it was in. However, since no such structure is present in the given code, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`.**
