`ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The values of `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is [(`a`, `b`)], `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
