Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is `[('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` remain as they are, and `is_rated` is set to True. There is no else part in the code, so the state remains unchanged if the condition `a != b` is not met.***
