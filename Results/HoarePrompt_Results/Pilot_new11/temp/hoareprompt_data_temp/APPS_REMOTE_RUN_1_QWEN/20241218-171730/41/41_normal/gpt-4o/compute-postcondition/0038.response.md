The code `print('rated')` simply prints the string 'rated' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, for any `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, `is_unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains `True`. `is_rated` is `True`, and `is_rated` remains `False`**
