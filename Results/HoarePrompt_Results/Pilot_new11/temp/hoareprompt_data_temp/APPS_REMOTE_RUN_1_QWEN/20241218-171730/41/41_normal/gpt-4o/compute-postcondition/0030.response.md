Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains False, `is_unrated` remains True. If `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition does not hold, the program continues as is.***
