The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.**
