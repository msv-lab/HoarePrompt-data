Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`. If for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, `is_unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains `True`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`.
   - `is_rated` is `False`.
   - `is_unrated` is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n - 1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`.
   - If this condition is true, `is_unrated` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1 or less), `is_unrated` remains `True`.
   - If the loop executes at least once (i.e., `n` is greater than 1):
     - The loop will check the condition for each pair of consecutive elements in `ratings`.
     - If the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` is ever true for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `is_unrated` will be set to `False` immediately and the loop will break.
     - If the condition is never true for any `i`, `is_unrated` will remain `True`.

Given these observations, we conclude that the final state of the variables is as described above.
