Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`. If `unrated` is `True`, no changes are made. Otherwise, we print 'maybe'.***
