According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs `n` times, and if `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ratings_before` is `['a']`, `ratings_after` is `[b]`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 because it already ran once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`ratings_before` is ['a'], `ratings_after` is [b], `n` is greater than 1**
