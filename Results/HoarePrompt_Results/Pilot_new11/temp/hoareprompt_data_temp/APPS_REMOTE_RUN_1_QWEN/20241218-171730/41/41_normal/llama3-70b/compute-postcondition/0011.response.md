According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ratings_before` is `['a', a]`, `ratings_after` is `[b]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

However, since `n` was greater than 1 before the loop started, and we are considering the next iteration, `n` must be decremented by 1 to check if it is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ratings_before` is ['a', a], `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0**
