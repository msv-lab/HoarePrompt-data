Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `ratings` remains as `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b'), (a, b)]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the condition is satisfied without any change. If `a` equals `b`, the condition is not met and no change occurs.***
