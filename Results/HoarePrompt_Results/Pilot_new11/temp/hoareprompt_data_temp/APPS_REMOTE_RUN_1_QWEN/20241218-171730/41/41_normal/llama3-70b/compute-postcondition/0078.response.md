Postcondition: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is either `True` or remains `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n + 1`. If `ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, no changes are made.**
