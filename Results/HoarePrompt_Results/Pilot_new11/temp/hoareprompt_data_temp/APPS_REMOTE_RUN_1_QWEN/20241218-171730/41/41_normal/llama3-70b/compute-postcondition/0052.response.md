Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, `i` is `-1`, and the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is false for all `j` since the loop terminates when `i` becomes less than 0, and the if condition `(not unrated)` is true***
