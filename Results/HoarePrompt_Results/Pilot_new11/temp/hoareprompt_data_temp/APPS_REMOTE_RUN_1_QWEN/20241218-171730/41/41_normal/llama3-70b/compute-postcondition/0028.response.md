Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `True`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers, and the loop or if statement breaks out due to the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` being true or false.***
