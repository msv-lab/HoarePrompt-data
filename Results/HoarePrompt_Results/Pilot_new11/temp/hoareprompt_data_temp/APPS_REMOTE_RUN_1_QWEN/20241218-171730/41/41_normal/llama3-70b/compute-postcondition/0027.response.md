The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no loop or conditional statement is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of a loop or condition that was not specified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `i` is less than `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
