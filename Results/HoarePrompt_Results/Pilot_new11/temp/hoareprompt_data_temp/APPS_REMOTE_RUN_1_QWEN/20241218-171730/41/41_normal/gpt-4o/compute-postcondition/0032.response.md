The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. This assignment does not affect the value of `n` or the `ratings` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
