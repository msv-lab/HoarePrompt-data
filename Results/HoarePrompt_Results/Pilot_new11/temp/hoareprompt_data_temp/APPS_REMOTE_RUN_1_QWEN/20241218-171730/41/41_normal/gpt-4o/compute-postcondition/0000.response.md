The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will now hold the value of the integer input provided, and the number of lines (`n`) to be read from the input is determined.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, representing the number of lines to be read; each line contains two space-separated integers `a_i` and `b_i` such that 1 â‰¤ `a_i`, `b_i` â‰¤ 4126.**
