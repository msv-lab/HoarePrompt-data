The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `n`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` derived from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, the sum of elements in list `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in list `y`, and the console prints 'No'**
