The code `total_y = sum(y)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `y` and assigns it to the variable `total_y`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, or `total_x`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), with the same length as `x`, `total_x` is the sum of the elements in the list `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the elements in the list `y`**
