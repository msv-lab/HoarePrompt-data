The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all 0 ≤ i < n. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each within the range of 0 to 1000.**
