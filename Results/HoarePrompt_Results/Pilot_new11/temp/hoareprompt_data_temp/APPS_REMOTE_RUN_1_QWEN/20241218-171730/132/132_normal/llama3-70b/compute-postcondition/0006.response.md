`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, and `y` is another list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers. The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a sorted list of integers of length `n`, and `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`**
