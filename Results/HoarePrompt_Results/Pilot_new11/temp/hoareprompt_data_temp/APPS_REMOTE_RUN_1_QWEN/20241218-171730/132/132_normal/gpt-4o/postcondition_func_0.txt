The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y` from standard input, where `n` is between 1 and 50, and each element in `x` and `y` is between 0 and 1000. It calculates the sums of the elements in `x` and `y`, and prints 'Yes' if the sum of `y` is less than or equal to the sum of `x`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need special handling.
