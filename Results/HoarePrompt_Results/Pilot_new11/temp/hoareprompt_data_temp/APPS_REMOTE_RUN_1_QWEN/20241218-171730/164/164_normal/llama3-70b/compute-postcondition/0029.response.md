Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is `n`, `g` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` (or -1 if no 'G'), `t` is the index of the first 'T' in `s` (or -1 if no 'T'), and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If `abs(t - g) % k == 0` and for every integer `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', the function does not execute any additional actions beyond the existing conditions. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.***
