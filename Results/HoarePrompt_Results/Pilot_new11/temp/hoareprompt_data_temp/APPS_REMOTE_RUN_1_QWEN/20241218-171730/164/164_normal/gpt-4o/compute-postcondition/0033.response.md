Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `pos` is either `T_pos` or the last value of `pos` before the loop exits, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos` and none of the characters in the range were '#', otherwise `reachable` is `False`. If `reachable` is `True`, the printed output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the printed output is 'NO'.***
