The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`, which were specified as integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`. After executing this line, the initial conditions for `n` and `k` no longer apply, and their new values are determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`, and the second line of the input is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.**
