The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or their values. It only prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `pos` is the current value of `T_pos` since `reachable` is `True`, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos` and none of the characters in the range were '#', otherwise `reachable` is `True`, print statement outputs 'YES'**
