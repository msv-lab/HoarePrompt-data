You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump across obstacles or to positions beyond the end of the line. Specifically, the program checks if each possible position the grasshopper can land on is reachable without checking if those positions are within the bounds of the line.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input
6 2
..GT#.
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 2 ('G') and needs to jump to position 5 ('T'). However, the program will not correctly identify this as a valid path because it only checks positions up to and including the target position without ensuring the grasshopper stays within the line boundaries. 

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the grasshopper does not attempt to jump past the end of the line or land on an obstacle. A corrected version would involve checking if the next position is within the line boundaries before attempting to jump.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line of the input is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the target insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` remains unchanged and `T_pos` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `pos` is either `T_pos` or the last value of `pos` before the loop exits, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos` and none of the characters in the range were '#', otherwise `reachable` is `False`.
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `pos` is either `T_pos` or the last value of `pos` before the loop exits, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos` and none of the characters in the range were '#', otherwise `reachable` is `False`. If `reachable` is `True`, the printed output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the printed output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `line` representing the layout of cells. It determines if a grasshopper starting at a certain position can jump to a target position using jumps of size `k` without encountering obstacles ('#'). The function returns either 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the target within `k` moves, or 'NO' if it cannot. The function also checks for valid input constraints, ensuring `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`.

- The function first reads `n` and `k` from input, followed by the string `line`.
- It then swaps the positions of 'G' and 'T' if 'G' is positioned after 'T' to ensure 'G' always comes before 'T'.
- The function iterates through the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`, checking for obstacles.
- If the grasshopper encounters an obstacle ('#'), the function breaks out of the loop and returns 'NO'.
- If the grasshopper reaches the target position (`pos == T_pos`), the function sets `reachable` to `True` and returns 'YES'.
- If the loop completes without finding the target or encountering an obstacle, the function returns 'NO'.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` or `k` do not meet the specified constraints (i.e., `n < 2` or `k > n - 1`), the function should handle these cases and return an appropriate error message. However, the provided code does not explicitly check for these conditions, leading to undefined behavior for invalid inputs.

Missing functionality:
- The function should validate the input constraints for `n` and `k` before proceeding with the main logic to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
