Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` remains unchanged and `T_pos` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.***
