The code sets `reachable` to `True`. This changes the value of `reachable` from its previous state (which was `False`) to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `G_pos`, `new_pos` is `pos + k`, and `reachable` is `True`.**
