The function accepts two parameters \( n \) and \( k \), where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 100, and \( k \) is an integer between 1 and \( n-1 \). It also takes a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. The function checks if the grasshopper can jump to the insect's position following these rules: the distance between the grasshopper and the insect must be divisible by \( k \), and the path taken by the grasshopper must not contain any obstacles. If the conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles the case where either the grasshopper or the insect is not present in the string by printing 'NO'.
