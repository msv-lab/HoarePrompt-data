`line` is assigned the value of the string entered by the user, which is of length `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`, and the second line of the input is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `line` is the string of length `n` entered by the user.
