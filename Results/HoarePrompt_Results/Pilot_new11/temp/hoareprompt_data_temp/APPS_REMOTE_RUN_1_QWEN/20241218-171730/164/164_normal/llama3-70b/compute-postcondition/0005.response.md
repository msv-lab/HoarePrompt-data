The code assigns the value of `i` to `g`. Given that the current value of `s[i]` is 'G', it means `i` is the index where 'G' is located in the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `g` is now equal to `i`, which is the index where 'G' is found.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is `i`, `t` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'G'**
