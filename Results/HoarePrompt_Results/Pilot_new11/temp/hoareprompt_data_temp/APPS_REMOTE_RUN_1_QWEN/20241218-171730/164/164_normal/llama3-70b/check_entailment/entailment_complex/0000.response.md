Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the grasshopper can jump to the insect's position based on the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k` and the string `s`. It ensures that `n` is within the range [2, 100] and `k` is within the range [1, n-1], and the string `s` contains exactly one 'G' and one 'T'.

2. **Finding Initial Positions**: The program identifies the indices of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`. If either 'G' or 'T' is missing, the program immediately prints 'NO', which aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Jump Validity Check**: The program checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. This condition ensures that the distance between the grasshopper and the insect is a multiple of the jump length `k`.

4. **Obstacle-Free Path**: The program verifies that there are no obstacles (`'#'`) along the path from 'G' to 'T' by checking each potential landing spot during the jumps. The condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` ensures that none of the intermediate cells (if any) contain obstacles.

5. **Output**: Based on the above checks, the program prints 'YES' if the conditions are satisfied, and 'NO' otherwise. This output matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Since the program accurately follows the logic specified in the problem description for all possible inputs, it is correct.
