Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- `i` is 0.
- If `s[i]` is 'G', `g` is set to `i` and `t` remains -1. Otherwise, `g` is -1 and `t` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- Based on the initial conditions, `g` is either 0 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or -1 (otherwise).
- `t` is either -1 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 0 (otherwise).

### Next Iteration:
For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be 1.
- The value of `g` and `t` will depend on the character at `s[1]`. 

Let's summarize the new states:

- `n` remains the same (an integer between 2 and 100).
- `k` remains the same (an integer between 1 and `n-1`).
- `s` remains the same (a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T').
- `i` becomes 1.
- `g` is set to 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and remains -1 otherwise.
- `t` is set to -1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and remains 0 otherwise.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 1, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is -1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and 0 otherwise.**
