State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(n):` will start with `i` set to 0 and increment `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 initially (since `range(n)` starts from 0).
3. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `g`, and `t` do not directly affect the initial condition for the loop to execute. They remain as given.

Thus, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is setting `i` to 0.
