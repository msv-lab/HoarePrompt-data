Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is -1, `t` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is 'T', `t` remains 0. Since there is no else part, the value of `t` does not change in other cases.***
