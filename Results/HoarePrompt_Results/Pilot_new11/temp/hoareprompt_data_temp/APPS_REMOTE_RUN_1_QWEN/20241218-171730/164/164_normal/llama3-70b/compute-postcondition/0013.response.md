The code assigns the value of `i` to `t`. Since `i` is initially 1, `t` will also be 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 1, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is 1.**
