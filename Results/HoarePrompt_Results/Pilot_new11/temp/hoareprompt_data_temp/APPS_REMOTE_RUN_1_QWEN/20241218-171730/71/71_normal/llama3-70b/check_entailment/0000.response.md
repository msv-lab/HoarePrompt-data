Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the input number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. Specifically, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1000000005 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

However, the program will output `8`, which is incorrect. The program simply keeps dividing `n` by 10 until it is divisible by \(10^k\), but it does not account for the fact that the trailing zeros might not cover the full length of \(10^k\). To fix this, we need to count the trailing zeros and handle the case where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 == 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    if n % (10 ** k) != 0:
        w += k - (len(str(n)) - len(str(n).rstrip('0')))
    print(w)
```

This corrected version counts the trailing zeros and ensures that the remaining number after removing the necessary digits is divisible by \(10^k\).
