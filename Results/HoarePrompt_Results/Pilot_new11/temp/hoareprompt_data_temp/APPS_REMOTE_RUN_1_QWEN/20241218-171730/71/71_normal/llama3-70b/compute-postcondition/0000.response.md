The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is not provided in this scenario, the values of `n` and `k` will be determined at runtime. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` are still valid post-execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9, and the values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input.**
