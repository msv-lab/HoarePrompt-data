The function takes no explicit parameters but reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, where `0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 9`. It then repeatedly divides `n` by 10 until `n` becomes divisible by \(10^k\). During this process, it counts the number of divisions performed and stores this count in the variable `w`. After the loop terminates, the function prints the value of `w`, which represents the number of times `n` had to be divided by 10 to make it divisible by \(10^k\). The final state of the program is that `n` is now divisible by \(10^k\) and `w` holds the required count of divisions.
