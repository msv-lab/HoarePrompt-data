The code `print(to_remove)` simply prints the value of `to_remove`. This does not change the value of `to_remove`, nor does it affect any other variables. Since the condition `count_zeros == k` is true, the print statement will execute, and the value of `to_remove` will be printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where the condition `count_zeros == k` is met, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits encountered until the condition `count_zeros == k` is met, or `to_remove` is equal to the length of the remaining string if the loop does not break, and the value of `to_remove` is printed.**
