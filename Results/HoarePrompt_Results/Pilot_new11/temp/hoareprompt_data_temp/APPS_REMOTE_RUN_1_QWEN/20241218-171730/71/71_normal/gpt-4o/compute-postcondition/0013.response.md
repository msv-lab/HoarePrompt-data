Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if the current digit is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `to_remove` is set to 1 if the current digit is not '0'.
   - The loop breaks when `count_zeros` equals `k`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `count_zeros` must not equal `k`.
   - The loop iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse order.

3. **Consider the Last Iteration:**
   - Suppose we are at the end of the previous iteration (last digit processed).
   - Let's assume the last digit was not '0' (if it were '0', `count_zeros` would be incremented, but since it didn't, it stayed the same).
   - Therefore, `to_remove` was set to 1 in the last iteration.
   - Since `count_zeros` did not equal `k`, the loop continued.

4. **Prepare for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to move to the next digit in the string `n` (the next digit in reverse order).
   - The new value of `digit` will be the previous digit from the end.
   - `count_zeros` remains unchanged unless the new digit is '0'.
   - `to_remove` will be reset to 1 if the new digit is not '0'.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `n` remains the same non-empty string.
   - `k` remains the same integer.
   - `count_zeros` remains unchanged unless the next digit is '0'.
   - `to_remove` will be 1 initially for the next iteration.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` remains unchanged, `to_remove` is 1**
