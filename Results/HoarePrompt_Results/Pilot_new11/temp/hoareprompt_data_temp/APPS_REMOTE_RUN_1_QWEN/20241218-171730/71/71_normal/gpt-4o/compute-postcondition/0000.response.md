The code `n, k = map(str, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into strings, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is split and converted to strings, the integer values of `n` and `k` are lost and now they are strings.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string**
