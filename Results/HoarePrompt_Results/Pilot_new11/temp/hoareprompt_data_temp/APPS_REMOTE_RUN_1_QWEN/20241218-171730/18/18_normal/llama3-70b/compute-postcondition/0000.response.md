The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. The initial constraints are that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. After the input is taken, these constraints must still hold.

Since the actual input values are not provided, we cannot specify the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, but we know they meet the given conditions. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. Other variables are unchanged.**
