Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when `t` is exactly equal to `n` correctly. According to the problem description, when `t` is exactly `n`, the number of standing spectators should be `k`. However, the code prints `min(t, k)` which is `k` in this case, but it does not explicitly check for this scenario. Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case when `(t - n) % k` is zero. According to the problem description, when `(t - n) % k` is zero, the number of standing spectators should be `k - 1`. The current implementation does not account for this, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases.

For example, for the input `10 5 10`, the correct output should be `5`, but the code will output `4` because `(10 - 10) % 5` is `0`, and the code will subtract `0` from `k` resulting in `5 - 0 = 5`, but it should be `5 - 1 = 4`.

To fix this, the code should include explicit checks for these scenarios. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= n:
        print(min(t, k))
    else:
        standing_spectators = k - (t - n) % k
        if (t - n) % k == 0:
            standing_spectators -= 1
        print(standing_spectators)
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
