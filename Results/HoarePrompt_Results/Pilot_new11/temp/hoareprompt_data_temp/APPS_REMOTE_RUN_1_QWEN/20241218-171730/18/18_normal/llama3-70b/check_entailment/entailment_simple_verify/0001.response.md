Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of standing spectators at time \( t \). The program handles two main cases:
1. When \( t \leq n \), it prints `min(t, k)`.
2. When \( t > n \), it prints `k - (t - n) % k`.

The annotations confirm that the variables \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) are integers within the specified ranges, ensuring the logic works as intended. The provided examples and the problem description align with the program's implementation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem requirements.
