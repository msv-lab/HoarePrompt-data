Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers within the range \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), and a list `numbers` containing \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) integers where each integer \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). It iterates through the list `numbers` and checks whether the sequence of positions defined by `(a_i - 1) // y` and `(a_i - 1) % y` forms a valid path on a grid where each step must be a move of exactly one unit horizontally or vertically. If any move violates this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all moves satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`. The function does not modify the input parameters or the list `numbers`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `px` and `py` hold the coordinates of the last position in the sequence, and `numbers` remains unchanged.**

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `x` and `y` are positive integers within the specified range. If `x` or `y` are out of this range, the behavior is undefined, but the function does not check this explicitly.
- The function does not handle the case where `numbers` is an empty list. In such a scenario, the function would immediately return `True` because there are no positions to validate, which is technically correct but might not be expected behavior depending on the context.
- The function does not provide specific error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or non-positive integers for `x` and `y`.
