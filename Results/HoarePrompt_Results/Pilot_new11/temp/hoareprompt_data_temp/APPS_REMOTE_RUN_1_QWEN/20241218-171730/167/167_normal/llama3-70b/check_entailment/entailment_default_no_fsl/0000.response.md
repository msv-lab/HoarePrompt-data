Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical issue in the way it checks the validity of the path. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the starting position is always at `(0, 0)`, which is incorrect. The path should start from the cell containing `a_1`, and the coordinates should be calculated based on the value of `a_1`.

Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 6
```

For the matrix with dimensions \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\):
- \(a_1 = 1\) corresponds to the cell \((1, 1)\).
- \(a_2 = 2\) corresponds to the cell \((1, 2)\).
- \(a_3 = 3\) corresponds to the cell \((1, 3)\).
- \(a_4 = 6\) corresponds to the cell \((2, 2)\).

The path is valid if we can move from \((1, 1)\) to \((1, 2)\) to \((1, 3)\) and finally to \((2, 2)\). However, the code incorrectly assumes the starting position as \((0, 0)\), leading to incorrect coordinate calculations.

To fix this, the code should initialize the starting position based on the value of `a_1` and calculate the next coordinates accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(x, y, a):
    (px, py) = ((a[0] - 1) // y, (a[0] - 1) % y)
    for v in a[1:]:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all valid cases.
