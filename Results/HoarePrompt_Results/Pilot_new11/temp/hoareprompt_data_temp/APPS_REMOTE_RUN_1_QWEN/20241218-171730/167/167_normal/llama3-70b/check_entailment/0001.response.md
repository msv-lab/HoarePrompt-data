Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sequence of moves is invalid according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the path is valid by verifying that each move is adjacent, but it does not properly handle the edge cases where the path might involve wrapping around the boundaries of the matrix. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1 2 1 2 5 3
```

In this case, the path goes from cell 1 to cell 2, then back to cell 1, and then to cell 2 again, and finally to cell 5 and cell 3. The program incorrectly accepts this sequence because it does not account for the fact that moving from cell 2 back to cell 1 and then to cell 2 again does not conform to the allowed moves in the matrix. The correct implementation should ensure that the path strictly follows the allowed moves without revisiting cells in a way that contradicts the problem constraints.
