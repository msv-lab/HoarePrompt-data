Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is the final value of `nx`, `py` is the final value of `ny`, `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `a`.
- For each element `v`, it computes `nx` and `ny` using the formulae `nx = (v - 1) // y` and `ny = (v - 1) % y`.
- It checks whether the Manhattan distance between the current position `(px, py)` and the new position `(nx, ny)` is exactly 1. If not, the function returns `False`.
- If the condition is met, the loop updates `px` and `py` to `nx` and `ny`, respectively.
- After the loop completes, `px` and `py` will hold the final coordinates based on the last valid move.

Since the loop processes each element in the list `a` and updates `px` and `py` accordingly, the final values of `px` and `py` will be determined by the sequence of moves dictated by the elements in `a`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `px` and `py` will still be 0, as they are initialized to 0 in the initial state.
