The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the formula provided. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` is assigned the value of `(v - 1) % y`. The variables `x`, `y`, `py`, `px`, and `numbers` are not affected by this code.

Since the initial state defines `nx` as \((v_{next} - 1) // y\) and `ny` as \((v_{next} - 1) \% y\), the new values of `nx` and `ny` will be exactly these expressions. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` are now explicitly defined as the results of the division and modulo operations respectively.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is \((v_{next} - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v_{next} - 1) \% y\), `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\)**
