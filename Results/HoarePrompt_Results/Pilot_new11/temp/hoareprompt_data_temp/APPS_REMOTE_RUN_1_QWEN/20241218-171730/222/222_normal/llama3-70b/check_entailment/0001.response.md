Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers. Specifically, for the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program outputs `2` as the minimum number of actions and suggests turning skewers `1` and `6`, which is out of bounds since there are only 5 skewers.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that we cover all skewers efficiently. For \( k = 1 \), turning skewers `1` and `4` would indeed turn all skewers over, but the current implementation fails to consider such scenarios. A more detailed approach is needed to handle different values of \( n \) and \( k \) correctly.
