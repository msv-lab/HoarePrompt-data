#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n \geq 2 \cdot k + 3m\) where \(m\) is the number of times the loop has executed; `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is a list containing all integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) up to the last value of `i` which is `2 \cdot k + 1` added to the previous value of `i`; `i` is `2 \cdot k + 1` added to the last value of `i`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers with constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). The function constructs a list of integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) until the last value of `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing the list, it prints the length of the list and the list elements separated by spaces. There is no return value from the function; instead, it outputs the length and the list elements through `print` statements.
