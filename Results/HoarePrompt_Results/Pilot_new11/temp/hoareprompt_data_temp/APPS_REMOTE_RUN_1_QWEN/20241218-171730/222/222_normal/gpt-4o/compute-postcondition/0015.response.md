Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers with constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). The function constructs a list of integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) until the last value of `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing the list, it prints the length of the list and the list elements separated by spaces. There is no return value from the function; instead, it outputs the length and the list elements through `print` statements.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- The provided annotations and code do not include any return statement, meaning the function does not return any value. This is a significant omission since the annotations suggest the function should return `k` if `k < n` and `n` if `k >= n`.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is exactly equal to `1000` and `k` is close to `500`, which might lead to an infinite loop or incorrect behavior due to the increment mechanism. However, given the constraints, this scenario is unlikely to occur.
