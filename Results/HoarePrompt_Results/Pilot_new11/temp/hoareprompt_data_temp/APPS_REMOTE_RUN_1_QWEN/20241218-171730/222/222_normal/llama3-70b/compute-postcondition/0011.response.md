The code prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. The list `res` is defined as \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 \mid 0 \leq i < l]\). The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are unchanged, but the list `res` will be constructed and printed.

To construct `res`, let's break down the steps:

1. `l` is given by the formula \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\).
2. Each element in `res` is of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\).

Since the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are unchanged, we only need to compute the list `res`.

Let's denote:
- `n` as an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\).
- `k` as an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` as \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\).

The list `res` is constructed as follows:
- For each index `i` from 0 to \(l-1\), the element in `res` is \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\).

After constructing `res`, the code prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\).
- `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` is \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\).
- `res` is the list constructed as \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 \mid 0 \leq i < l]\), and its elements are printed separated by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\); `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `l` is \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\); `res` is a list containing \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 \mid 0 \leq i < l]\) and the elements of `res` are printed separated by spaces.**
