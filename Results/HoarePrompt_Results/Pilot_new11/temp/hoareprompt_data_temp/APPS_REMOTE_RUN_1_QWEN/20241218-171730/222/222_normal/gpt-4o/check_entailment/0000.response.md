Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where \( k = 0 \). When \( k = 0 \), turning a skewer only affects that skewer itself. However, the current implementation of `func_1` suggests that turning a skewer \( i \) affects skewers from \( i - 2k \) to \( i + 2k \), which simplifies to just \( i \) when \( k = 0 \). But this approach does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over with the minimum number of actions.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 0 \):

- According to the problem description, turning skewer 1 would only turn skewer 1, and similarly for other skewers.
- To turn all skewers, we would need to turn each skewer individually, which means we need 5 actions.

However, the program outputs:

```
5
1 3 5 
```

This suggests that the program incorrectly assumes that turning skewers 1, 3, and 5 will turn all skewers, which is not true for \( k = 0 \). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
