Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n \geq 2 \cdot k + 3m\) where \(m\) is the number of times the loop has executed; `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is a list containing all integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) up to the last value of `i` which is `2 \cdot k + 1` added to the previous value of `i`; `i` is `2 \cdot k + 1` added to the last value of `i`.**
