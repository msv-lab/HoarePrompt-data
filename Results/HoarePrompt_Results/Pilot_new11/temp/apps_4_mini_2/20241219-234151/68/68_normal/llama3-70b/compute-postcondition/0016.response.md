Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the program proceeds without output. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the output printed is '0', otherwise the output reflects the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the program continues without specifying output.***
