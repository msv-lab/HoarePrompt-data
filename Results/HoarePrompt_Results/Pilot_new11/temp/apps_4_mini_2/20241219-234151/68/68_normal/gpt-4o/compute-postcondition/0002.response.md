In the provided code snippet, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. Since `x` and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` will also be an integer and can range from 0 to 200 (when both `x` and `z` are at their maximum). The value of `min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`, and the states of `y` and `z` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
