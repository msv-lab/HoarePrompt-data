Functionality: **The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, with the constraints \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). It outputs a character based on the relationship between these values. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it outputs '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, it produces no output; if `x` equals `y`, it evaluates `z`: if `z` is 0, output is '0', otherwise it outputs '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, without checking the exact value of `z`, it outputs '?'. Finally, if `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, but greater than or equal to `y`, the function does not generate any output. There are situations where there might be no output produced even if conditions are met, which may not have been explicitly captured in the annotations.**
