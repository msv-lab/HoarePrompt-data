To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against all possible cases defined by the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The program logic is as follows:

1. It reads three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. Additionally, it checks:
   - If `x > y + z`, it prints `+`.
   - If `x < y`, it prints `-`.
   - If `x == y`, it checks if `z == 0`. If yes, it prints `0`. If no, it prints `?`.
   - Lastly, if none of the prior conditions apply, it prints `?`.

Now, let's analyze potential cases, particularly focusing on edge cases:

1. **Case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `0` (there are no votes at all).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true, and since `z == 0`, it should print `0`. Correct output.

2. **Case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (the vote could be an upvote or downvote, hence uncertain).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true, and `z != 0`, so it prints `?`. Correct output.

3. **Case where `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `-` (1 upvote is less than 2 downvotes).
   - Program output: It checks `x < y`, which is true, and prints `-`. Correct output.

4. **Case where `x = 2`, `y = 2`, and `z = 2`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (with two unknown votes, it could become either + or -).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true with `z != 0`, so it prints `?`. Correct output.

5. **Case where `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `-` (3 upvotes and 7 downvotes).
   - Program output: It checks `x < y`, which is true, and prints `-`. Correct output.

6. **Case where `x = 3`, `y = 4`, and `z = 2`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (3 upvotes and 4 downvotes, plus 2 unknown). The outcome can still swing to either vote direction depending on how the unknowns vote.
   - Program output: The condition `x < y` is true, and it prints `-`. Incorrect output, as it should be `?`.

From the above cases, we can see that the program fails on specific edge cases where the results could be uncertain due to the unknown votes, particularly when `x` is less than `y` but there are unknown votes.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
