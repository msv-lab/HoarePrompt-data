The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark (`?`). It does not alter the values of any existing variables. Thus, all variables in the initial state remain unchanged, retaining their respective definitions and constraints.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, currently, `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is greater than 0.**
