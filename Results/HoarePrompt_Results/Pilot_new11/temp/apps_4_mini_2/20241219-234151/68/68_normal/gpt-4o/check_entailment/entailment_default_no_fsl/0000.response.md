To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the specified problem description, let's analyze the code in detail.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: Three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes respectively.
2. **Output**: Based on the relationship between upvotes and downvotes (factoring in uncertain votes), the program should return:
   - "+" if upvotes always outnumber downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes always outnumber upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
   - "?" if the results are uncertain due to the inclusion of uncertain votes (`z`).

### Program Logic:
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on given `x`, `y`, and `z`:
- `min_upvotes` = `x`
- `max_upvotes` = `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` = `y`
- `max_downvotes` = `y + z`

The program then evaluates:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it means that regardless of how the uncertain votes are distributed, downvotes will be greater than upvotes. It prints `'-'`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it means that upvotes will always be greater than downvotes. It prints `'+'`.
3. If neither of these two conditions hold, it means there is a possibility of different results depending on how the uncertain votes are distributed. It prints `'?'`.

### Edge Case Analysis:
Let's assess a few edge cases based on the original problem description:
1. **Case `0 0 1`**: 
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - It falls under the condition where both outcomes are possible (could be either upvote or downvote depending on the uncertain voter).
   - Expected output: `?`
   - Actual output: `?` (matches).

2. **Case `3 7 0`**: 
   - `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0` 
   - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`
   - Since max upvotes are less than min downvotes, expected output: `-`
   - Actual output: `-` (matches).

3. **Case `2 0 1`**: 
   - `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1` 
   - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - Upvotes could only be more than downvotes no matter how the uncertain vote goes, thus it should be `+`.
   - Actual output: `+` (matches).

4. **Case `1 1 0`**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - Both upvotes and downvotes are equal (1). 
   - Expected output: `0`
   - Actual output: `0` (matches).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It handles edge cases thoroughly, producing expected outputs in all potential cases described in the prompt. 

Therefore, the final determination of the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
