Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, there are situations where the output is incorrect or missing. 

For example:

1. If `x < y` and `z = 0`, the correct output should be `-` since there are no unknown votes to change the outcome, but the program does not produce any output in that case, which is incorrect.
   
2. Furthermore, if `x = y + z`, the program outputs '?' even though this is a specific situation where the result should be `0` if there are `z` unknown votes. 

3. An additional edge case arises when `x > y + z` yet missing the case where exactly `x = y + 1` and `z = 0`, which should output `+` incorrectly yields '?' according to the program.

The design of the program does not account for all possibilities and fails to output the correct results for certain inputs as per the described behavior in the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for correctness across all cases.
