The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. All three parameters are non-negative integers constrained to the range from 0 to 100 (inclusive). The output of the function is not specified, so additional information about what values `x`, `y`, and `z` are expected to produce is required for a more comprehensive functionality description. Therefore, without knowing the specific operations that take place within the function and their respective outcomes based on the parameters, we cannot provide a complete functionality description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: x, y, and z, where x, y, and z are non-negative integers in the range [0, 100].**
