Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. The main requirement is to check if it is possible to switch on three garlands at specific moments such that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum of those moments. The representation of this requirement leads us to think about the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals of the garlands, rather than their greatest common divisor (GCD).

In the provided implementation, the function calculates the GCD of the three garlands' intervals (k1, k2, k3). The approach used assumes that if the GCD of the three integers is 1, the garlands are "independent enough" to cover all seconds. However, this is incorrect because even if the GCD is 1, the intervals might still fail to cover every second due to the specific timing of their lit states. 

For example, if the intervals are such that they alternate turns on without ever overlapping, there can still be gaps where no garland is lit. The function should have checked for the possibility of every second being lit after switching on the garlands, which is more appropriately checked using LCM.

Thus, the criteria used in the function do not fulfill the problem's requirement, leading to incorrect output for certain inputs where it incorrectly suggests that the garlands will cover all seconds when they will not. 

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
