Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program incorrectly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals. The method used to compute the LCM is flawed: the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) rather than any correct computation of the LCM. Therefore, the checks against the LCM to determine if it can guarantee that at least one garland is lit during every second post-activation may yield incorrect results.

The annotations support this by highlighting that, irrespective of the state immediately before and after the function call, the fundamental calculation itself is incorrect. This miscalculation can lead to several edge cases where the output does not align with the expected outcomes described in the problem statement, making the overall program faulty.
