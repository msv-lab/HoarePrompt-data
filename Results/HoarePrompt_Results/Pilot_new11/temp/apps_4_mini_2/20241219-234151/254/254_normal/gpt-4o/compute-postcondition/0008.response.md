The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the given definition. However, it operates within the constraints that integers `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are defined such that each integer must fall within the range of 1 to 1500.

Since the output of the function has not been defined, there is no specific return value to describe.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is dependent on the defined parameters `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` but does not accept any parameters directly in the function call. 

Functionality: **The function operates within the context of integers k_1, k_2, and k_3, which are integers ranging from 1 to 1500, although it does not accept any parameters directly. The return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
