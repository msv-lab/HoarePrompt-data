The variables `a` and `b` are swapped, with `a` becoming the value of `b`, and `b` becoming `a % b`. Since `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a` < `b`, we know that `a % b` will yield the value of `a`, because `a` is less than `b`. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` will take on the value of `b`, and `b` will take on the value of `a`. 

This means:
- `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
- `b` becomes the previous value of `a % b`, which is simply `a`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a` is now equal to its previous `b` value.
- `b` is now equal to its previous `a` value.

Since `b` must still be greater than `a`, this condition remains valid.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the previous value of `a`, 0 ≤ `a` < `b`, `b` is greater than `a`, and `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1500.**
