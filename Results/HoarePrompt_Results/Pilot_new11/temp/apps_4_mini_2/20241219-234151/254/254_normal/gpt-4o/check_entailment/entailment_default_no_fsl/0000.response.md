Correctness: **False**

The code provided is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The goal is to ensure that at least one garland is lit during every second starting from the maximum of the chosen moments x1, x2, and x3. 

However, the program only checks if the three intervals (k1, k2, k3) are pairwise coprime (i.e., if their greatest common divisor is 1). This does not guarantee that there will be no gaps in the coverage when the intervals are being lit.

For instance, consider the input `4 2 3`. The calculation of GCD results in `gcd_all = 1`, and the program would output 'YES', suggesting that it's possible to have them lit without any gaps. However, if we switch on the garlands at times that are multiples of `k1` (4) and `k2` (2), we will observe that there are moments, specifically second 3, when no garland is lit because the first garland would only light at multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, ...) and the second garland would light at multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6, 8, ...). The third garland (at multiples of 3) will not ensure coverage during certain seconds when the other two garlands aren't lighting.

Consequently, the program does not adequately consider the actual coverage of time after the maximum of the chosen times, thus confirming it fails to provide the correct output in at least one valid situation.
