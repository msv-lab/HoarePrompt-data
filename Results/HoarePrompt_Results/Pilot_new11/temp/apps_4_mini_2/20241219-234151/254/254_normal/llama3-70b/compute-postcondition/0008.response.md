The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers constrained to the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. The function evaluates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, specifically returning the value of `a` when `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor, using `a` when `b` equals 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, both integers, and returns the greatest common divisor a when b is 0.**
