The variable `gcd_all` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. Since `gcd_k1_k2` is already determined to be the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, it implies that `gcd_all` will also be an integer value bounded by the integers `1` and `1500`. The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` remain unchanged, but `gcd_all` is updated based on the calculation.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.**
