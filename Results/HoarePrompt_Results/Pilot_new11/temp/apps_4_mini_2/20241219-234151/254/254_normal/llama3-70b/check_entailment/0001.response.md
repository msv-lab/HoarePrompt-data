Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to determine whether it's possible to switch on three garlands such that at least one is lit for every second after the moments they are switched on. However, the logic is flawed in how it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the `func_1` function. 

Here is the major issue:
- The LCM is calculated incorrectly due to the implementation of `func_1`. The function is intended to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) instead of the LCM. The formula for LCM should be `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)`, but the program is combining GCDs in a way that does not yield the correct LCM of the three values.
- Thus, the conditions checking if `lcm % k1 == 0`, `lcm % k2 == 0`, and `lcm % k3 == 0` may yield incorrect results and therefore might falsely determine if it's possible to have at least one garland lit at all seconds after the moment the garlands are switched on.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1`:
- The expected output is "YES" since we can switch on each garland at the first second, hence all garlands will be lit sequentially.
- In the program, the GCD-based logic might incorrectly return "NO" due to the flawed LCM calculation.

This discrepancy leads to edge cases where the program can produce erroneous results, demonstrating that it does not adhere to the problem's requirements in all potential scenarios.

Thus, because there are instances where the logic fails to comply with the problem's description, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
