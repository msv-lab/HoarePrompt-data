To analyze the output state of the loop based on the provided code and the variables involved:

The loop executes based on the value of `b`. The while loop continues until `b` becomes 0. Each iteration performs the assignment `a, b = b, a % b`, which potentially changes both `a` and `b`. The `a % b` operation results in a value that is less than `b`, and as long as `b` is not zero, it will continue to be updated. 

1. The first iteration results in `a`, which becomes the previous value of `b`, and `b` becomes `a % b` (the remainder when the original `a` is divided by the original `b`). This means that after the first execution, `b` must still be greater than 0 since the loop would not have executed if it were not.

2. After two iterations, we know `b` retains the original value of `a` after the first pass and becomes progressively less than the previous value of `b` until it reaches a point where it either approaches 0 or exits once `b` becomes 0.

3. At the end of the while loop execution, `b` must be 0 since that’s the condition that will stop the loop. `a` will be the last non-zero remainder before `b` became 0, which means `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Now putting all of this together for the final output state:

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1500.**
