The variable `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2`, calculated using the `math.gcd` function. The values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, but the new variable `gcd_k1_k2` is introduced, which is dependent on the specific values of `k1` and `k2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `k1` and `k2`, while including `gcd_k1_k2` as the GCD of those two integers.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.**
