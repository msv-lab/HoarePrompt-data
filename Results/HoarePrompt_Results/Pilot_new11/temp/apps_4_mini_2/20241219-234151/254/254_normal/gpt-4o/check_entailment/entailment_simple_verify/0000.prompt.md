You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements described.

### Problem Summary
- We have three garlands, each with a time interval `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.
- Mishka needs to ensure that after a certain time, at least one garland is lit at every second.
- The solution should determine if there exists a moment (not necessarily distinct) to switch on the garlands such that there are no 'dark' seconds.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals using the following logic:

1. Calculate the GCD of the first two intervals: `gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)`.
2. Calculate the GCD of this result with the third interval: `gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.
3. If the final GCD (`gcd_all`) equals 1, the program outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

### Verification of Logic
- The logic for using the GCD suggests that if all three intervals have a common factor greater than 1, there may be moments when none of the garlands are lit. For instance, if `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` share a common divisor greater than 1, the lit states would only occur at multiples of that common divisor, creating potential 'dark' seconds.
- If `gcd_all == 1`, it indicates that the three intervals are coprime, meaning that they can cover all integers at certain moments.

### Test Cases
Let's examine a couple of test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`
   - The GCDs would yield `1` as they can indeed cover all moments:
     - Output: 'YES' (Correct)
   
2. **Test Case**: `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`
   - The GCD here would yield `1`. This suggests that they can cover all moments:
     - Output: 'YES' (but the provided example states 'NO', indicating an issue with the logic related to coverage).

### Conclusion
When running through various cases, the program does not correctly match the problem statement, as it depends solely on the computation of GCD to verify the coverage capability. The reasoning does not take into account valid configurations where multiple garlands might be lit with strategic starting times.

Therefore, we have a counterexample where the program gives 'YES' while the intended answer would be 'NO.'

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k_1, k_2, and k_3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500. If `gcd_all` is equal to 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `gcd_all` is greater than 1, 'NO' is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
