Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The logic to determine if the garlands will always be lit is fundamentally flawed due to an incorrect implementation of the least common multiple (LCM) calculation using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. 

The program incorrectly calculates the LCM with the formula used in the line `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`. The correct formula for LCM requires applying the GCD pairwise for each pair of values correctly in the context of three values, which is not achieved here. 

As a result, any checks that follow regarding whether `lcm % k1`, `lcm % k2`, and `lcm % k3` are all equal to zero may lead to inaccurate results, causing the program to potentially return "NO" in scenarios where "YES" is the correct answer based on the problem statement. 

Thus, the flaws outlined in the original assessment confirm that the program does not conform to the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is indeed **False**.
