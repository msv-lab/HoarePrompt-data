You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the associated logic.

**Problem Requirements**:
1. Miroslav has `n` skewers laid out in a row.
2. Turning skewer `i` affects `k` skewers on each side of `i`, meaning it affects skewers from `i-k` to `i+k`.
3. The goal is to determine the minimal number of skewer turns required to turn all skewers over.

The provided code functions as follows:
1. It accepts input values for `n` and `k`.
2. In the function `func_1`, it initializes an empty list called `positions` to store the skewer indices that will be turned over.
3. Using a while loop, it adds skewer indices to `positions`, incrementing `i` by `2*k + 1` each iteration until it goes beyond `n`.
4. It finally prints the total number of operations and the chosen positions.

Now, let's evaluate the effectiveness of the solution for various cases.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Example where `k = 0`**: This means turning one skewer will affect only that skewer. In this case, Miroslav has to turn each skewer individually. If `n = 6`, the function would return 6 operations which is correct since he must turn each skewer individually.
2. **Example where `k >= n/2`**: In this case, one turn is sufficient because turning a skewer in the middle will affect all skewers. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, turning skewer `4` will suffice.
3. **General cases with varying values of `k`**: For various values of `n` and `k`, we must ensure that the returned positions cover all skewers exactly once without leaving any in their initial state.

### Test Cases:
- **Case 1**: Input `(7, 2)` should yield positions `1` and `6`.
  
- **Case 2**: Input `(5, 1)` should yield positions `1` and `4`.

Now let’s analyze whether the implemented function correctly handles all potential scenarios based on the problem description.

### Critical Analysis:
The function appends skewer numbers iterating by `2*k + 1`, which might not cover all skewers in scenarios when `k` is not large enough relative to `n`. For example, consider the scenario `n = 5` and `k = 1`. The function will append `1` (affecting skewers `1`, `2`, `3`), then it will append `3` (affecting `2`, `3`, `4`), and finally append `5` (affecting `4`, `5`). This misses the skewer `2` being turned down back to initial due to overlapping affects. 

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program could miss certain skewers depending on the range of `k` and `n`, meaning it would not fulfill requirements in all cases.

Thus, the answer is:
Correctness: **False** 

The provided code does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over in the minimum number of operations for all possible configurations of `n` and `k`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the skewers turned per action. The function calculates and collects the positions of skewers based on the formula `(i = i + 2 * k + 1)`, starting from 1, until `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing a list of positions, the function prints the number of positions collected and the positions themselves. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the return postconditions as the function does not return any value in the code; it only prints the results. Furthermore, based on the posted conditions, there are some logical checks related to returning specific values based on `k`, which are not represented in the code. Consequently, the function effectively outputs the total skewers that can be positioned given `k`, but lacks the explicit return logic described in the postconditions. Therefore, it's important to note that the behavior outlined in the return postconditions is incomplete in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
