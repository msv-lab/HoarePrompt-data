The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, so after the increment, the new value of `i` becomes `(4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `6 * k + 4`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is `6 * k + 4`.
