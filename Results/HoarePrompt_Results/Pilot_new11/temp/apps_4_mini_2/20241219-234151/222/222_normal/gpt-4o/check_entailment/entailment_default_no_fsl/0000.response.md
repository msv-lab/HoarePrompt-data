The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of actions needed for Miroslav to turn over all `n` skewers, considering that each turn of skewer `i` also turns `k` skewers on either side of `i`. 

Examining the function `func_1(n, k)`:
- The function starts with the first skewer `i = 1` and continues turning skewers based on the formula `i += 2 * k + 1` until `i` exceeds `n`.
- This effectively selects skewers that are spaced apart by `2 * k + 1`, meaning it groups skewers when `k > 0`.

However, there are issues with this logic:
1. **Edge Case with `k = 0`:** The code would choose every skewer individually (as the increment would be 1, i.e., turning each skewer one by one), but the logic chosen may not be optimal since it would take `n` actions when only 1 action is needed (turn all).
  
   For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 0`, turning skewers numbered 1 through 5 separately results in 5 actions instead of the single action that could encompass all skewers.

2. **General Coverage:** Even for `k > 0`, the algorithm may not necessarily cover all skewers effectively given its current separation logic based on increments of `2 * k + 1`. This may leave some skewers unturned, particularly in situations where appropriate grouping is not achieved.

3. **Output:** The current implementation does not dynamically adjust the selection of skewers based on whether more turning actions might optimize the operation.

The output hints mention that there is "some logical checks related to returning specific values based on `k`, which are not represented in the code". This implies that there are certain procedural checks or commitments that should be considered, particularly for various `k` values, which the current logic fails to encompass.

To summarize:
- The program does not handle every scenario correctly, particularly when `k = 0` does not yield the correct minimal number of operations.
- With other values of `k`, the program can also leave skewers unturned due to the spacing logic not being optimized for the number of skewers.

Given these considerations, we conclude that the implementation is fundamentally flawed in reasoning due to its failure to ensure all skewers are turned optimally. Thus,

Correctness: **False**
