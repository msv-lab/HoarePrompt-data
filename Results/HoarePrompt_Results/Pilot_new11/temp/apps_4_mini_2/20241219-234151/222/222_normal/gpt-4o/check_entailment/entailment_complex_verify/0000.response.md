Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's correctness based on the problem description. The implementation correctly identifies the minimal steps required to turn over all skewers by leveraging the `k` parameter to ensure that skewers are efficiently turned. The annotated version of the program underscores the proper handling of variables and captures the behavior of the program correctly. 

Key points include:
- The function iterates over the skewers, correctly incrementing the position based on the formula `i += 2 * k + 1`, ensuring that all skewers are turned over.
- The initial position `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n` while correctly determining the number of operations and what skewers to turn.
- The edge cases were analyzed in the original assessment and seem to validate that all skewers are addressed sufficiently, considering both small and large values of `n` and `k`.

Thus, given the robustness of the program's structure and the supporting annotations, the conclusion drawn in the original assessment remains valid. The program indeed aligns with the requirements stipulated in the problem description.
