Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description asks for in every potential case. 

### Explanation:

1. **Logic of Turns**:
   - The problem description states that Miroslav wants to turn over all skewers using the minimum number of actions, where each action on skewer `i` turns `k` skewers on each side of `i`. Thus, turning skewer `i` affects the range from `i - k` to `i + k`.
   - The program, however, only adds indices based on the arithmetic expression `i += 2 * k + 1`. This expression matters only when `k` is greater than `0`.

2. **Handling of k=0**:
   - If `k = 0`, turning over a skewer affects only that skewer. The program identifies positions by simply jumping by `2*k + 1`, which results in incrementing by `1`, then skipping every other skewer, effectively missing many skewers. For instance, if `n` is `5`, it would only target `1`, `3`, and `5`, not `2` or `4`. This will leave some skewers unchanged (i.e., in their initial positions), which contradicts the requirement of turning all skewers over.

3. **Inefficient Skewer Selection**:
   - The selected skewer positions are based on `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), ...`, which does not necessarily cover every skewer when `k` is not zero. The required logic should consider where to start and calculate based on the overlap caused by `k`. For example, if skewers are turned at every `1 + (2 * k + 1)`, several skewers (especially in lower ranges) will be missed if `k` is too small or if the approach does not start effectively from different skewer indices.

4. **Output format and requirements**:
   - The output does not correspond accurately with the description in terms of ensuring all skewers are flipped. The description requires not only correctness in count of actions but also that all skewers must be handled, which the logic of the provided program fails to cover reliably.

Ultimately, cases like `n = 5` and `k = 0` or larger values of `k` will yield incorrect results as not every skewer will be flipped as required by the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect according to the given specifications and requirements.
