The `print` function outputs the result of `print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))`, which attempts to join the elements of `positions` converted to strings. Since `positions` is an empty list, the result of this operation will be an empty string, but it does not change the state of any variables. 

Therefore, the Output State will indicate that `positions` is still an empty list and that 0 elements were printed. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n`, `positions` is an empty list, and 0 elements were printed.**
