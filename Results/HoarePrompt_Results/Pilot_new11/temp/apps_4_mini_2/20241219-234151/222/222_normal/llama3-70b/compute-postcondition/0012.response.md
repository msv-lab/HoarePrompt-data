The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 1000, while `k` is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and 1000. The function's output behavior is not specified in the provided details. Given the constraints, a clear description of the function's functionality cannot be completed without further information on the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000). The specific return value is not provided.**
