The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer, `2 * k` will also be non-negative, and thus `i` will increase by an odd number (which is `2 * k + 1`). The exact value of `i` after execution depends on the initial value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1], `i` is `1 + 2 * k + 1`**.
