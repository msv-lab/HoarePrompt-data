To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic of the problem description and the implementation of the program.

### Problem Description:
Miroslav wishes to turn over all `n` skewers with each action impacting `k` skewers on each side of the chosen skewer. The goal is to find the minimal number of actions required to turn all skewers and to list which skewers to turn.

### Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding of `l`:**
   - The expression `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates how many turnings are needed to ensure that all skewers get turned over. This calculation looks correct as it divides the total number of skewers by the number of skewers affected per action (which is `2k + 1` for each turn).

2. **Constructing the Skewer Indices:**
   - In the loop `for i in range(l)`, the calculation `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` generates the index of the skewer to turn. This seems reasonable as it generates indices that are spaced by `2k + 1`, which means it respects the coverage provided by each turning.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - However, let's examine edge cases. Consider the case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`. The calculation of `l` will be:
     ```
     l = (1 + 0 - 1) // (0 * 2 + 1) = 1 // 1 = 1
     ```
     The expected output should be `1` and then the skewer `1`.

   - Now, consider when `n = 6` and `k = 2`. The calculation will be:
     ```
     l = (6 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 7 // 5 = 1
     ```
     The program will suggest turning skewer `1` only, resulting in only skewers `1, 2, 3` turned, while handling skewer `4, 5, 6` inadequately.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle the situation where multiple skewers could be affected significantly, such as with `n = 6` and `k = 2`, which results in turning over not all skewers, thereby failing the problemâ€™s requirement.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**. 

A counter-example is `n = 6`, `k = 2` which would yield insufficient coverage of turning skewers.
