The code `positions.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the `positions` list. The `positions` list was previously empty, so after executing this code, it will contain the value 1. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` contains the value [1], `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1], `i` is 1**
