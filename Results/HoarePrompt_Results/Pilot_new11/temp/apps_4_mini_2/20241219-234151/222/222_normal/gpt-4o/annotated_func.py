#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of skewers, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the number of skewers that are turned from each side in one action.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `positions` contains values [1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2*(2 * k + 1), ..., up to the largest value ≤ n] based on iterating until the condition `i <= n` is false
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the skewers turned per action. The function calculates and collects the positions of skewers based on the formula `(i = i + 2 * k + 1)`, starting from 1, until `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing a list of positions, the function prints the number of positions collected and the positions themselves. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the return postconditions as the function does not return any value in the code; it only prints the results. Furthermore, based on the posted conditions, there are some logical checks related to returning specific values based on `k`, which are not represented in the code. Consequently, the function effectively outputs the total skewers that can be positioned given `k`, but lacks the explicit return logic described in the postconditions. Therefore, it's important to note that the behavior outlined in the return postconditions is incomplete in the provided code.
