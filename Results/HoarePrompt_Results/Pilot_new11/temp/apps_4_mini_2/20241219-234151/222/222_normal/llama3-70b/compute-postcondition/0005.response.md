According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1) given that `n` must be at least `k + 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, making it 1, and for the loop to continue, `l` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1) which must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` has a new value 1 appended to it**
