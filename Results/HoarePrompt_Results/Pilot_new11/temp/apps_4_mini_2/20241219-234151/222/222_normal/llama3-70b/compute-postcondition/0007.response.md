According to the provided context, the loop's execution depends on the values of `i` and `l`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `l`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` must be at least `k + 2`
- `l` must be greater than 1 (as calculated by (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1))
- `i` is currently 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
2. `l` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue, since for `i` to be less than `l`, `l` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, to execute one more time, the updated states should reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `l` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `res` has a new value `k * 2 + 2` appended to it**
