The variable `i` is updated by incrementing it by the value of `2 * k + 1`. Given that the initial value of `i` is `2 * k + 2`, we can calculate the new value of `i` as follows:

New value of `i` = old value of `i` + (2 * k + 1)  
New value of `i` = (2 * k + 2) + (2 * k + 1)  
New value of `i` = 2 * k + 2 + 2 * k + 1  
New value of `i` = 4 * k + 3  

Thus, the updated value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is 4 * k + 3**.
