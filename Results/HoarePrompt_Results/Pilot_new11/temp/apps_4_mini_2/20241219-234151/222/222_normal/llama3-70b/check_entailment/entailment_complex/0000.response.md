To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionality step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires that we figure out the minimum number of actions needed for Miroslav to turn over all the skewers, where turning one skewer affects $k$ closest skewers on either side of that skewer. 

1. **Understanding `l`:** 
   - The calculation of `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` correctly computes the minimum number of turning actions needed. This formula is derived from dividing the total number of skewers `n` by the number of skewers affected by each turn which is `k * 2 + 1`.

2. **Understanding `res`:**
   - In the loop that populates `res`, the program generates the skewer numbers that should be turned over. The value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` calculates the starting skewer position for each turn, ensuring that every group of affected skewers is turned over.

3. **Coverage of All Skewers:**
   - The positions generated in `res` are spaced out by `k * 2 + 1`, which means that each action correctly targets the next set of skewers that have not yet been turned over.
   - The first turn affects skewers from `1` to `k + 1`, the second affects from `k + 2` to `2k + 2`, and so on, ensuring all skewers will eventually be covered.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `k = 0`:** 
   - Each action only turns the skewer itself, leading to `n` actions. The calculation of `l` will result in `n`, and `res` will simply be a range from `1` to `n`, which is correct.
- **When `k` is maximal:** 
   - The program still correctly computes the necessary `l` and ensures all skewers are turned in the least number of actions.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to align directly with the problem statement, correctly calculating the number of turns needed (`l`) and the specific skewers to turn over. It handles a range of inputs within the specified constraints and correctly formulates the skewer-turning sequence based on the value of `k`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
