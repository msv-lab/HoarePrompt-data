The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but breaks the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration. Therefore, while the states of `d` and `j` remain the same, it indicates that we are skipping the remainder of the loop's current iteration.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1 and we skip the remainder of the current loop iteration.**
