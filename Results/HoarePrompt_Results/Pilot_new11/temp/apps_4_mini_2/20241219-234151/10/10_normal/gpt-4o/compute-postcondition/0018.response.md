To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to evaluate the variables that influence the loop's execution:

1. The loop variable `i` will iterate from `0` to `d-1`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `d` should be at least `1`. 

2. The input indicates that `d` is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), which inherently implies it will always be at least `1`. 

3. The `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` lists all depend on `d` since they are initialized to have `d` elements. Therefore, they will all have a length of `d`.

Currently, at the start of the loop, the state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it starts at `0`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are minimal since `d` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and thus corresponding lists and variables can be properly utilized in the loop.

State: **`d` is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0**
