Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 0. If `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, then `target_sofa` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
