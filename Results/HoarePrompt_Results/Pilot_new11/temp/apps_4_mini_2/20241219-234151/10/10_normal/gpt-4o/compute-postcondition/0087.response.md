`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `left_count[i]` is unknown. The rest of the variables remain unchanged: `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[1]`. The condition regarding `right_count[i]` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[1]`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
