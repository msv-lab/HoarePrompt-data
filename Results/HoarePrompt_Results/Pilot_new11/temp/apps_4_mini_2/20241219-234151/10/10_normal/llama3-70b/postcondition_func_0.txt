The function `func_1` takes an integer `sofa` and a list of tuples `sofas`, where each tuple consists of four integers representing the coordinates of sofas. It calculates and returns four integers: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`. These integers represent the count of sofas in relation to the specified sofa's coordinates. Specifically, `left` counts the number of sofas to the left, `right` the number of sofas to the right, `top` the number of sofas above, and `bottom` the number of sofas below the designated sofa. If the given sofa is equal to any one of the sofas in the list, those sofas are ignored in the count. If there are no sofas in the list or if only the specified sofa is considered, all four counters remain at their initial value of 0. The code does not handle cases where the input lists may be empty or improperly formatted, which could result in errors or incorrect behavior. Overall, the function provides a count of the position of others in relation to the selected sofa.
