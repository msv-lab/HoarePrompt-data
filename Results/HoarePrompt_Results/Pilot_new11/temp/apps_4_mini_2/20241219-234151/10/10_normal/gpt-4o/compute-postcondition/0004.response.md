The line of code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` assigns values to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` by taking an input of four integers, which are converted from strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values assigned to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will depend on the actual input received during execution.

Since we have no information about the input values from the users for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, we interpret that they can take any value based on the provided input as long as they are integers. However, it won't change the initial state values of other variables, which remain intact.

Thus, the output state will reflect the input received, indicating that the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` is an empty list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are inputs integers from the user.**
