Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[1]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values or counts.***
