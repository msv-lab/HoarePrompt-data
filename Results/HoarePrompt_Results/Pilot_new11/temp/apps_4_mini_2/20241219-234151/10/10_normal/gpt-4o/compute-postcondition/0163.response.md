The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 2, `target_sofa` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
