Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, and if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `i` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[1]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[1]` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, all values remain unchanged.***
