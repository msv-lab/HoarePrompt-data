You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function where it checks the conditions for determining which sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa. The current implementation only checks for the position based on the top-left coordinate `(x1, y1)` of the sofas and does not consider the full extent of the sofas since they occupy two cells in the matrix.

For instance, if we have a case where two sofas occupy the following positions:
- Sofa A at (1,1) and (1,2)
- Sofa B at (2,1) and (2,2)

In this setup, Sofa B is directly below Sofa A, but the program does not correctly account for the full dimensions of the sofas when calculating relative positions. Instead, it only compares the top-left corners, which will lead to incorrect results.

Also, there is a missing recognition for when the sofas occupy two different rows or columns. This could lead to a scenario where the condition needed to determine the count of sofas in the respective orientations is incorrectly computed.

To illustrate, consider a case with the following input:
```
2
3 2
1 1 1 2  # Sofa A
2 1 2 2  # Sofa B
1 1 0 0  # Requirements: 1 to the left, 0 to the right, 0 above, and 0 below
```

The expected output should be `1`, since there is indeed 1 sofa to the left of the first sofa (the second one). 

However, if the program were to run this input, it would mistakenly think there are only sofas to the right or some incorrect placement due to its faulty logic, leading to an inappropriate response.

Thus, due to these logical flaws, the program fails to consistently meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is an integer representing the index of a sofa, sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of the sofas. Additionally, the last input line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the number of sofas around the specified sofa. The input also ensures that 1 ≤ d ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` represent the counts of sofas that are, respectively, to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa when compared to their coordinates. If there are no sofas in `sofas` that are equal to the specified sofa index, all counts are incremented based on the comparative coordinates of the sofas with respect to the specified sofa index. If no sofas exist or only the designated sofa is considered, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged from their initial state of 0.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns left, right, top, and bottom, which remain unchanged from their initial state of 0, as there are no sofas in the list 'sofas' that correspond to the specified sofa index.
