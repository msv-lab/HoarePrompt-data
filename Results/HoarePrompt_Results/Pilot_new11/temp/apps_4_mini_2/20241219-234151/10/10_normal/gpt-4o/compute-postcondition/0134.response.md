Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, while `j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged and are assigned from `sofas[1]`, and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, then the program state remains unchanged in terms of incrementing the counts and assigning from `sofas[1]`.***
