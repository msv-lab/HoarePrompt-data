Functionality: **The function collects input data to define a set of sofas through their coordinates (pairs of positions), counts how many other sofas are positioned in relation to each sofa (left, right, above, below), and checks if any sofa matches specified counts of adjacent sofas based on those directional counts. The function ultimately returns the 1-based index of the first sofa that meets the specified counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If no sofa matches these conditions, it returns -1. The function does not directly accept parameters and relies entirely on user input, which can lead to potential issues if the input does not adhere to the expected format or constraints. Additionally, while it correctly counts positions, it may not account for edge cases like overlapping sofas or invalid input that does not meet the specified coordinate ranges.**
