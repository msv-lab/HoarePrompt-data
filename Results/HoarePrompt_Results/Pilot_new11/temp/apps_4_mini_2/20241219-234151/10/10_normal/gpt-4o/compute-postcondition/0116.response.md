Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` remains 0. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned from `sofas[i]`, while `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[0]`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.***
