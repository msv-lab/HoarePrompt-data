The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is currently `(i + 1)`, which implies that the specific value of `i` is not known and depends on its previous state. The variable `j` remains 1, `d` is still greater than or equal to 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` still hold their assigned values from `sofas[1]`. 

Since the previous value of `right_count[i]` is not specified, the output will reflect the increment of this variable but without a specific numeric value offered.

Output State: **`i` is (i + 1), `j` is 1, `d` is greater than or equal to 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, and `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
