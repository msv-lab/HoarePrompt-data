Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, and `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`. If `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]`, then `top` is increased by 1 and `right` remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, then both `top` and `right` remain unchanged.***
