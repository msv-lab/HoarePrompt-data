Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `target_sofa` is either -1 (if no sofa matched the conditions) or the 1-based index of the first sofa that met the conditions determined by `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]`; if at least one sofa meets the conditions, `target_sofa` will be set to that index + 1.**
