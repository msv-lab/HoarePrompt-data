According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `d`. The loop is designed to execute a total of `d` times. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.

Since the loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration, it will increase from 0 to `d-1` with each successive iteration. Because we are looking to start the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop has executed `d` times.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `_` would have reached `d - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, we set `_` to `d`, which indicates that the loop has completed its iterations. 

State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` is a list with one element `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers from the user, `_` is d**
