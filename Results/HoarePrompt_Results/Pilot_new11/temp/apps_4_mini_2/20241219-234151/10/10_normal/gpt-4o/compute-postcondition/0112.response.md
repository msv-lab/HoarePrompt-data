Given the initial state where `d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` has been incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`:

When executing the code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]`, we evaluate the following:

1. The assignment is performed from the `sofas` list, but it refers to the index `j`, which is currently 0. Therefore, the values `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will be set to the values of `sofas[0]`.
2. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged because they were assigned values from `sofas[i]` in a previous operation.

The only changes occurring are the assignments of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` which now hold the values from `sofas[0]`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and will include the new values assigned to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`.**
