Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa; `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple; `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s`, and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`. Consequently, `left` has been incremented by 1, and `right` has been incremented by 1.***
