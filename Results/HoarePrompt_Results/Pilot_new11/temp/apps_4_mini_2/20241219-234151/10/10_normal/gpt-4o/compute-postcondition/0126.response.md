The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there are no direct changes to any of the variables `i`, `j`, or `d` in this case, the state of the variables remains the same.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is `(i + 1)` (the value of `i` is essentially a placeholder)
- `j` is `1`
- `d` must be greater than or equal to `2`

Since `continue` does not alter these variables, we maintain their preconditions. 

Output State: **`i` is (i + 1), `j` is 1, `d` must be greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
