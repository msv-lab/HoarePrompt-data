The variable `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on the input that is given as space-separated integers. The existing values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` remain unaffected by this assignment. However, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will hold the specific integer values provided during input. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not altered, and their conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` has at least two elements, one being `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`, where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers.**
