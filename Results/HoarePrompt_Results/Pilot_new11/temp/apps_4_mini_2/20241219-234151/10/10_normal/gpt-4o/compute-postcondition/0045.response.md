The variable `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated `bottom_count[i]`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`, and `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
