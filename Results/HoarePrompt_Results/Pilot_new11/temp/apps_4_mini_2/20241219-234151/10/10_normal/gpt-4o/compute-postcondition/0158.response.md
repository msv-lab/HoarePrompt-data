The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the result for `target_sofa` will be 2. The states of the other variables, `d` and `sofas`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 1, and `target_sofa` is 2.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 1, `target_sofa` is 2**
