The variable `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. The initial state indicates `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `prefix_sum[2]` will be updated to `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`. The value of `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`. Thus:

1. `prefix_sum[1]` = `a[0]`
2. New value of `prefix_sum[2]` = `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]` = `a[0] + a[1]`

The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `i` is 1.**
