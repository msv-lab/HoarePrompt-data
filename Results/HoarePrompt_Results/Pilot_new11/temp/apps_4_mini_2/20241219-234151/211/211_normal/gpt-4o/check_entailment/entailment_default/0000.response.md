Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle certain cases. For example, if the array contains all zero elements (like the input `1 \newline 0`), it fails to provide any output, which does not align with the problem requirement to print "NO" in such scenarios. Furthermore, if the input array consists of positive and negative elements that sum up to zero (like `3 \newline 1 2 -3`), the program successfully creates the expected output; however, it must also check all combinations properly for splitting, as demonstrated in the provided examples. The program can incorrectly handle situations when it encounters non-zero elements but leads to sums which may have caused a zero-sum combination overall; hence it should be more thoughtful in its checks. The logic implemented only partially accounts for non-zero sums and fails to produce correct results in specific edge cases of array compositions.
