To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the specified problem description, I will analyze its logic.

The task requires splitting an array into several contiguous parts such that the sum of the elements in each part is not zero. The program checks the total sum of the array and has two main outcomes:

1. If the sum is not zero, it outputs "YES" and claims that the whole array can be one part (from 1 to n).
2. If the sum is zero, the program then checks for any non-zero elements in the array. If it finds one, it splits the array into two parts: one part that contains the subarray up to the non-zero element and another part with the remainder of the array. If all elements are zero, it outputs "NO".

However, this program fails in some edge cases. For instance, consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
3
0 1 -1
```
In this input, the sum of the array is `0`. However, the elements can be split into two parts:
- The first part is the subarray with the element `1` (sum = `1`).
- The second part is the subarray with `-1` (sum = `-1`).

The sum of the first part is not zero, and the output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
However, the program would evaluate the total sum as `0` and subsequently assume no valid split exists (because it would not find a non-zero entry to make a split happen).

This demonstrates that the program does not handle this case correctly.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
