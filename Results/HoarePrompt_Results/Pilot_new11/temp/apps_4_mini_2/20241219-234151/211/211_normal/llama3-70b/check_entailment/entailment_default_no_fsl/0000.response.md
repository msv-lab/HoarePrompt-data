Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to split the array according to the problem description. Specifically, the way it attempts to determine the subarrays is faulty.

1. The program calculates prefix sums but incorrectly decides where to split. It tries to form subarrays based solely on the prefix sums not being zero and not equaling the total sum, which can miss valid splits.
   
2. It does not handle cases where elements can sum to non-zero values over multiple splits, particularly when the elements can cancel each other out in various arrangements.

3. The logic for identifying split points (the indices from `l` to `r`) may produce incorrect results when the sum of all elements is not zero, but intermediate prefix sums reach zero. 

For example:
- Input: `3`, `1 1 -2`
- Expected Output would be "YES" and to split as `1, 1` and `3, 3`, forming subarrays of sums `1` and `-2`. 
- The actual logic may not account for multiple small subarrays effectively.

Additionally, upon calculating splits, the program may not ensure that all segments have non-zero sums, which is a critical requirement from the problem statement. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case.
