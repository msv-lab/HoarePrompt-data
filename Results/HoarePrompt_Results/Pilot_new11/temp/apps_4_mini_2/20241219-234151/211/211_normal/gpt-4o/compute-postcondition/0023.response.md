According to the code, the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. For the loop to continue and be executed one more time, `i` will increment by 1. 

So, if the loop executes again, `i` will become 2. Given that `n` is greater than 1, it will be at least 2. Thus, for the next iteration, we need to set `i` to 2 and keep the other variables the same.

State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**
