The code `print(i + 2, n)` outputs the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The value of `i` is initially 0, so `i + 2` is 2. The value of `n` is greater than 0, but its specific value is not provided. The print statement will display `2` followed by the unspecified value of `n`.

The states of other variables, including `A`, `total_sum`, and `i`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, '1' and '1' have been printed, and `2` and `n` are printed.**
