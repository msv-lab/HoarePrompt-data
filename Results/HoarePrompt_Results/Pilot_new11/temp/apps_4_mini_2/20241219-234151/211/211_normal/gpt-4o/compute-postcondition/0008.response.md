To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the loop.

Given:
- `A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
- `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`.
- `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`.
- `total_sum` is equal to 0.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. The loop executes for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0` (meaning `A` must contain at least one element).
3. The condition that `total_sum` is `0` (which is `sum(A)`) implies that the integers in `A` perhaps sum to zero, which means we could have a mix of positive and negative integers or no integers at all. 

Since `total_sum` being zero does not contradict having at least one element in `A`, we need to ensure that:
- `n` (the length of `A`) is greater than 0. 
- The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is 0.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
