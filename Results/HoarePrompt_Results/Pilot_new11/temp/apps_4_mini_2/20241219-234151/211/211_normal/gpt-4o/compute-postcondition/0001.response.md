The value of `A` is assigned to be a list of integers converted from an input string of space-separated values. The integer list is generated from user input, and the length of the list will determine `n`. The prior value of `n` was an input positive integer, and after this line executes, `n` will now be equal to the length of the newly created list `A`. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`.**
