Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct because it fails to address specific edge cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically, if the sum of the entire array is zero, the program attempts to split it into two parts using the first non-zero element and the rest of the array. However, if the entire array consists of zeros (e.g., input `[0]` or `[0, 0]`), the program will incorrectly print "NO" when it should identify the inability to split non-zero sums, but it fails to handle scenarios such as `[0, 0, 0]` appropriately. 

Additionally, in cases where the array includes multiple non-zero sums distributed across different segments, the program may not generate the required output for splitting into valid subarrays as mandated by the problem while ensuring none of them has a sum of zero.

For example, if we consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0
```
The function does not provide an output. According to the problem description, the valid response should be "NO", which it does not output meaningfully.

In conclusion, while the function works for certain cases, it fails to cover all potential scenarios correctlyâ€”particularly where all elements are zero or improperly managing the split logic when the total sum equals zero, leading to the conclusion that the program does not meet the problem requirements in every case.
