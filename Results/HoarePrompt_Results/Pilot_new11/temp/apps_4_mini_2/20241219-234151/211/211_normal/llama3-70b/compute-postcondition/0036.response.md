Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers, computes the prefix sums for the list, and checks if the sum of the entire list is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. If not, it prints 'YES' and counts the number of indices where the prefix sums are neither zero nor equal to the total sum. It prints these valid indices along with the last evaluated index. The final output includes the count of such valid indices and the last evaluated index `n`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input might not meet the constraints (e.g., invalid integers or incorrect list length).**
