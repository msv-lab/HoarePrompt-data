Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (at least 3), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, and `r` is 3. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` increases by 1 and `l` is set to 3.***
