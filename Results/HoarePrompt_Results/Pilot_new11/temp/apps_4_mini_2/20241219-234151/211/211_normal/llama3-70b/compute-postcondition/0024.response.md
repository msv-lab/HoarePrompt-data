The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 3, `l` is 1, `r` is 2; the output is (3, 1, 2).**
