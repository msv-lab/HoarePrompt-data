The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, and '4', `n` are printed; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
