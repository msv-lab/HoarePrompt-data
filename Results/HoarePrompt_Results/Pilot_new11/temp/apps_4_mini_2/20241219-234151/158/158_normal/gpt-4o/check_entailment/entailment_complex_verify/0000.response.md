Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given 1:2:4 ratio. 

1. The program correctly calculates `max_lemons` as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which ensures the number of apples and pears is sufficient for the maximum possible lemons, adhering to the recipe's constraints.
2. The total number of fruits is computed accurately using the established ratios, resulting in the correct total output regardless of the specific values of a, b, and c provided they are valid, positive integers in the specified range.
3. The annotations confirm the correctness by explaining the inputs, the calculations performed for the maximum number of lemons, and the resulting total. 

Given that the problem description and edge cases are properly handled, we conclude that the program meets the requirements and functions correctly.
