To determine the correctness of the given program, we first analyze the problem requirements and then examine the provided code.

**Problem Analysis:**
Nikolay has lemons, apples, and pears that must be used in a specific ratio: 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears (1:2:4). The goal is to find the maximum total number of these fruits he can use to make the compote.

**Examples from the problem statement:**
1. Input: 
   ```
   2
   5
   7
   ```
   Output: 7 (can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears)
   
2. Input:
   ```
   4
   7
   13
   ```
   Output: 21 (can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears)
   
3. Input:
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   Output: 0 (not enough pears to make any compote)

**Code Review:**
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

- The program reads input values for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
- It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) based on the constraints of apples and pears.
- It computes the total number of fruits by using the formula for the correct ratio and prints it.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
- The function implements the fruit ratio calculation correctly and provides the expected results based on given examples.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that contradict the logic implemented in the code. 

**Correctness Check:**
The program seems to satisfy all requirements of the problem:
- It handles all the necessary ratios and does not allow for partial fruits, which aligns with the condition that fruits must be used whole.
- It produces correct outputs for the examples provided in the problem description. 
- There are no edge cases where the logic fails since it accurately calculates based on the input constraints.

Thus, based on the review of the problem, examples, and the code logic, the program correctly implements the specified requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
