The value of `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`, where `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The expression for `total_fruits` is determined based on the input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The actual print statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, but it does not change any variables.

Since `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` depend on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect these calculations:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and the value of `total_fruits` has been printed.**
