To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function based on the problem description.

The program's goal is to check if a ticket (represented as a sequence of digits) can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

The `func_1` function first iterates through possible segment lengths, calculates the target sum for the segment, and then tries to partition the ticket into segments with that target sum. 

### Potential Issues with the Program:

1. **Target Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `target_sum` based on the first segment of a given length. However, it does not ensure that subsequent segments can also match that target sum while considering the entire ticket correctly. It only checks from the beginning, which might not represent potential valid segmentations.
  
2. **Segment Count Condition**: The program checks if `current_sum` is zero and `segment_count > 1` to decide if it has successfully found two or more segments with the same sum. However, it would return 'NO' prematurely if no valid partition is found for the current segment length without considering other possibilities.

### Test Case:

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the potential failure of the program:

- Input:
```
n = 6
ticket = "231231"
```

In this case, the ticket can be partitioned as follows:
- Segment 1: `2 + 3` (sum = 5)
- Segment 2: `1 + 2 + 3` (sum = 5)

So, `2 + 3` can equal `1 + 2 + 3` if segmented correctly. 

However, the current program logic will not find this configuration correctly given how it derives the `target_sum` and proceeds only left to right without trying all configurations.

### Conclusion:

Since we have found an example where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one case, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
