The value of `segments` is incremented by 1. The previous value is unknown, but the rest of the variables in the program remain unchanged. Therefore, we maintain all previous valid information, noting the change to `segments`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to the value of the first digit in `ticket`, `segments` is 1 plus its previous value, and the current value of `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`.**
