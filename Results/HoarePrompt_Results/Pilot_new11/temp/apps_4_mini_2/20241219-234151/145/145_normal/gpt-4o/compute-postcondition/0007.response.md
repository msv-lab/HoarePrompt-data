The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value 0. This means that the previous value of `current_sum`, which was equal to `target_sum` (the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`), is now overwritten and set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits; `segment_length` is 1; `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 0; `i` is 0.**
