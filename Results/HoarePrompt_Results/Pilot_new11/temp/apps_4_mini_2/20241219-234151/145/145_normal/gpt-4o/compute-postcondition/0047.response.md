Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits. `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1. After all iterations of the loop, `current_sum` could be any accumulated value from the remaining digits processed. `segment_count` represents the total number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` remains 2. The final value of `i` will be `n-1`.***
