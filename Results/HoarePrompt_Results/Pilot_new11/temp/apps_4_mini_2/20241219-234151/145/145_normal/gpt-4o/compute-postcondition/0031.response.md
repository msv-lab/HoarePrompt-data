The code assigns `0` to `current_sum`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, which is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`. After running the code, `current_sum` will no longer equal `target_sum`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, and `i` is still 0.**
