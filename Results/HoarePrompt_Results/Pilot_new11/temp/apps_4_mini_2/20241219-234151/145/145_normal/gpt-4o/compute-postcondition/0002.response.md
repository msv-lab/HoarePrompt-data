Functionality: **The function `segment_sum` takes two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and computes the sum of the digits in a string variable `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. It assumes that `ticket` is a string containing n digits, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and that both indices `start` and `end` are valid according to the constraints 0 ≤ start ≤ end < n. After executing, the function returns this computed sum. Note that the function does not check if `ticket` meets the specified constraints or if `start` and `end` are within the valid range, which may lead to potential errors if the assumptions are violated.**
