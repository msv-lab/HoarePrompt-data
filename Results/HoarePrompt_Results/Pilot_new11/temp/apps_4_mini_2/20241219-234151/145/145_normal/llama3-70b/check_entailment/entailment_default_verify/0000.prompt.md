You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and check for any potential edge cases where the program might not produce the expected result.

The core idea of the program is to check if the total sum of the digits in the ticket can be evenly divided into two or more segments where the sum of each segment is equal.

Here is the breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. The function calculates the total sum of the digits in the ticket.
2. If the total sum is odd, it returns `False`, because an odd sum cannot be divided into equal segments.
3. If the total sum is even, it calculates the target segment sum (which is half of the total sum).
4. It iterates through the digits, accumulating the current segment sum.
5. If the accumulated segment sum equals the target sum, it increments the segment count and resets the current sum for the next segment.
6. Finally, it checks if at least two segments were formed and returns `True` if they were, or `False` otherwise.

Now, let's consider cases where the implemented checks might fail:

- **Test Case Input:**
  ```
  3
  123
  ```
  The total sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is even. The target sum is `6 / 2 = 3`. As we iterate:
  - At `1`, current sum is `1`.
  - At `2`, current sum is `3`, which matches the target. We reset.
  - At `3`, the current sum becomes `3`. We found only 1 segment.
  - Segments count is `1`, so output should be "NO", but the implementation would erroneously return YES because it doesn't check if segments formed are more than 1.

This indicates that the code misses a critical aspect of how many segments should be verified after checking for the target sum. The return condition only looks for segments, but one valid segment does not fulfill the requirement.

Due to the identified flaw in handling such cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `ticket` composed exclusively of digits with a length between 2 and 100. It calculates the sum of the digits in `ticket`. If this sum is odd, the function immediately returns False. If the sum is even, it checks for the existence of segments within the `ticket` string where the sum of the digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum. The function counts how many such segments are formed, and it returns True if at least two segments are found; otherwise, it returns False. Notably, the function assumes that all characters in `ticket` are numerical digits and does not explicitly handle non-digit characters or empty strings, leading to assumptions about input validity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
