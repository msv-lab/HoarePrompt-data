The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `segment_count` was 2, the new value becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected, and their states do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, `segment_length` remains 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, `segment_length` remains 2, `i` is 2**.
