Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits. After all iterations of the loop, `current_sum` is equal to 0, indicating that `current_sum` was reset to 0 at least once during the iterations. `segment_count` is greater than 1, representing the total number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`. `segment_length` remains 2, and the final value of `i` is `n - 1.***
