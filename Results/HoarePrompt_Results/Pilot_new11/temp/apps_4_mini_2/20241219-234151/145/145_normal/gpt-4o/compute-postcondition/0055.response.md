The value of `current_sum` is assigned to 0, which directly updates its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state captures the updated value of `current_sum` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1), i is 0, and the current value of `current_sum` equals `target_sum`.**
