`current_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of the `i`-th character of the `ticket` string. `i` is 1, so `current_sum` will now include the integer value of the second digit of `ticket`. Since `current_sum` equals `target_sum` before the execution and `target_sum` is set to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, the new value of `current_sum` will be the sum of the first digit of `ticket` and the second digit of `ticket` (which contributes another digit).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 1, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `i` is 1.**
