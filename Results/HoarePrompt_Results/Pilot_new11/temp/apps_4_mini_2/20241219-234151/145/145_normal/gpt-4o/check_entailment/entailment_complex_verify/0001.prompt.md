You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the code.

The problem requires us to check if a sequence of digits can be split into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The provided code attempts to do this by:

1. Looping through possible segment lengths (`segment_length` runs from 1 to `n-1`).
2. For each `segment_length`, it calculates the target sum for the segment.
3. Then it iterates through the ticket to accumulate the current sum and checks if it equals the target sum.
4. When found, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count. 
5. If the current sum is zero at the end and two or more segments were found, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

Now, let's think of potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly by this program.

### Example Consideration:

Input:  
```
5
12350
```

- The possible segments that could meet the sum when observing the partitions are:
    - Segment `1` + segment `2` + `3` + segment `5` + `0` has sums that do not match, however they can be grouped in the following way:
        - If we take the segments as `1`, `2`, `3`, and then `50`, the sums would be:
          - `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` and `50` = `5 + 0 = 5` which does not match.
          
- Since the segmenting into `2` non-intersecting segments where both should equal the same sums does not hold, the expected output should be "NO".

However, looking at the code:

- The function would attempt each segment length but not check all possible combinations of various segments properly since it uses strict segment lengths instead of dynamic partition matching. It wouldn't find `1`, `2`, `3` together because it would break them down incorrectly since the segments should not overlap.

### Conclusion:
Based on the interactions, the code seems to miss scenarios where segments can be combined in various groupings that are non-linear. Thus, the program is not comprehensive enough to determine if all possible combinations and sums yield valid results.

Therefore, we can infer:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100, and ticket is a string of exactly n digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits; `current_sum` is 0, indicating that all segments have been perfectly formed; `segment_count` is greater than or equal to 2, representing multiple segments whose sum equals their respective target sums.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and a string `ticket` consisting of exactly `n` digits (each digit being a character from '0' to '9'). It checks if the string can be divided into multiple segments such that the sum of integers in each segment is equal to a defined target sum. If such a division is possible with at least two segments, the function returns 'YES'. If not, it returns 'NO'. The function iteratively evaluates potential segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, resetting accumulation variables when the segment sum condition is met. It ensures final state conditions include `current_sum` being 0 and `segment_count` being greater than 1 for a positive outcome. If no such condition is satisfied across all iterations, the function defaults to returning 'NO'. Edge cases include scenarios where the ticket consists of the same digits or when the ticket is designed such that no valid segmentation exists, resulting in early termination without the correct conditions being met. Missing functionality could include handling non-integer characters and improper lengths of the `ticket` string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing digits from 0 to 9, start and end are integers such that 0 ≤ start ≤ end < n.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end' inclusive, where 'ticket' is a string of n digits and both 'start' and 'end' are integers within the specified range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` takes two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and computes the sum of the digits in a string variable `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. It assumes that `ticket` is a string containing n digits, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and that both indices `start` and `end` are valid according to the constraints 0 ≤ start ≤ end < n. After executing, the function returns this computed sum. Note that the function does not check if `ticket` meets the specified constraints or if `start` and `end` are within the valid range, which may lead to potential errors if the assumptions are violated.
