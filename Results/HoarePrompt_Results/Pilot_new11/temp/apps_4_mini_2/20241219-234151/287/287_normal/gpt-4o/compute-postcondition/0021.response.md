The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variables `num` and `count` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The precondition still holds that `num` is an integer greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1`. 

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1`; `count` is unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.**
