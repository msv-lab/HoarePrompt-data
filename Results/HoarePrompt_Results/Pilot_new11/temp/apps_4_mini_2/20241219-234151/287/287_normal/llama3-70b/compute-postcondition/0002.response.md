According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\), the expression `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` will compute a value that is at least 2 (when \(n=1\)). The loop variable `i` will start at 1.

For the loop to be executed, it is necessary that `n` is 1 or greater (which it is as per the provided state). At the end of the last iteration, `res` is initially 0. Therefore, just before the loop starts, the state remains valid:

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
