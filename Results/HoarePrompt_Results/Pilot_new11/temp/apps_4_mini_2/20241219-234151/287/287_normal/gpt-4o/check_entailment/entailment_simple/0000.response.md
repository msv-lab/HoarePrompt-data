Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, we need to find the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \). However, the `func_1` function is calculating the total number of divisors of the input integer \( n \).

The problem describes "weights of splits" which are based on the counts of the first element in nonincreasing sequences that sum to \( n \). The correct approach should look at all valid splits of \( n \) and count the unique weights based on the repeated elements.

Instead, the current implementation counts how many divisors \( n \) has, which is unrelated to the weights of the splits. For example, when \( n = 8 \), the correct answer is 5 (as listed in the example), but the program would return 4 as 8 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 4, 8).

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.
