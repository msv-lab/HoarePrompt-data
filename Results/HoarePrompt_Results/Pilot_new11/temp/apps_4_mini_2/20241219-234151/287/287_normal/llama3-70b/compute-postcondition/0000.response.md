In this case, the variable `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which will accept input as a string and then convert it to an integer. Since the initial state prescribes that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, the new value of `n` will also be a positive integer within that range, subject to the actual input provided.

The output state reflects that `n` has been changed to an integer from input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9.**
