To understand the output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we analyze the logic of the while loop that counts the divisors of `num`. 

### Analyzing the Loop:
1. The loop checks values of `i` starting from 1 and increases it by one after each iteration.
2. It continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `num`.
3. If `num` is divisible by `i`, it counts both `i` and `num/i` as divisors unless they are the same.
4. When the loop completes, `i` will have grown to `sqrt(num) + 1`.

### Identify Values after the Loop:
- The final value of `i` after all iterations will be `i = floor(sqrt(num)) + 1` because it increments each time until `i * i` exceeds `num`.
- The `count` variable records the total number of divisors found during the execution of the loop, based on how many applicable divisors are counted.

### Final State:
The state of the variables at the end of the loop would indicate:
- `i` is `floor(sqrt(num)) + 1`.
- `count` contains the total number of divisors of `num`.

Considering the given conditions for the loop and the nature of the counting of divisors, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **'i' is greater than or equal to the integer part of the square root of 'num' plus 1; `count` is the total number of divisors of 'num'. `i` is 'floor(sqrt(num)) + 1'.**
