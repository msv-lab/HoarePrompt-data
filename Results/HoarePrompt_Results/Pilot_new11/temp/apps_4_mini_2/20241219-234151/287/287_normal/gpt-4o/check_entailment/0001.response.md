Correctness: **False**

The provided program is attempting to count the number of distinct weights of splits of a number `n`, but it mistakenly calculates the number of divisors of `n` instead. This logic does not align with the problem description.

To elucidate why the program is incorrect:

1. The problem defines a 'weight' of a split as the number of occurrences of the first element in a valid split. However, the provided function `func_1()` simply counts the number of divisors of `n`, which does not relate to the weights of the splits.

2. For example, consider the input of `n = 8`. The program will return `4` because there are four divisors: `1, 2, 4, 8`. However, according to the problem statement, the distinct weights of the splits of `8` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which results in the answer `5`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, validating that the correctness is indeed **False**.
