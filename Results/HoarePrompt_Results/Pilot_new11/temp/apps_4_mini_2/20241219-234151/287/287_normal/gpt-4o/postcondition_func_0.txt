The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `num` (1 <= num <= 10^9) as input and calculates the total number of divisors of `num`. It iterates from 1 up to the square root of `num`, checking if each integer is a divisor. If a divisor is found, it increments a count and checks if the divisor pair (i, num // i) is distinct, incrementing the count again if so. The function returns the total count of divisors. After execution, the program's final state reflects that `count` holds the number of divisors of `num`, ensuring it handles the edge case where `num` is a perfect square correctly.
