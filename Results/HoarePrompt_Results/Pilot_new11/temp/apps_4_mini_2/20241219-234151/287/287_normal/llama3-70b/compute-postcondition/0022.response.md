Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)) from user input and calculates the total number of divisors of `n`. It iterates through all integers from 1 up to the square root of `n` to identify divisors. For each divisor found, it increases the count `res` by 2 for both the divisor and its complementary divisor. If the divisor is the square root of `n`, it adjusts the count by subtracting 1 to avoid double-counting. After completing the calculations, the function outputs the total count of divisors `res`. The function does not account for any invalid input scenarios, as it assumes proper input according to the problem statement.**
