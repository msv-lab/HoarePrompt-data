Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, which is defined based on the nonincreasing sequences of positive integers summing to `n`. The weights correspond to the frequency of the first element in these sequences.

However, the program instead computes the total number of divisors of `n`, completely unrelated to the task of finding the weights of splits. It iterates through numbers up to the square root of `n`, checks for divisibility, and counts the divisors accordingly, but this logic does not address the concept of splitting `n` into weighted sequences as per the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the task as stated. The output it provides (the number of divisors) does not align with the required outputs based on splitting and weights.
