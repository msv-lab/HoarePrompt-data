Postcondition: ***`n` is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is equal to `nx`, `py` is equal to `ny`, `v` is `a[1]`, `nx` is `(a[1] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[1] - 1) % y`, and if the condition abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If the condition is satisfied (meaning the sum of the absolute differences equals 1), no action is taken in this block.***
