The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py` respectively. The previous values of `px` and `py` are 0, and the new values will therefore be equal to `nx` and `ny`. The original state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is equal to `nx`, `py` is equal to `ny`, `v` is `a[0]`, `nx` is `(a[0] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[0] - 1) % y`, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` equals 1.**
