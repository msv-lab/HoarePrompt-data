You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the program against the explicitly described task.

The task is to find the number of good pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = x \)
- \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = y \)
- \( l \leq a, b \leq r \)
- The pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) are counted as distinct when \( a \neq b \).

### Analyzing the functions provided:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2(a, b)` calculates the LCM based on the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), which is also correct.

### Missing Logic in the Implementation:
The provided program only defines two functions for GCD and LCM calculations but doesn't implement the logic needed to find the good pairs \((a, b)\) fulfilling all the conditions of the problem:

- There is no code to enumerate potential pairs \((a, b)\) in the range \([l, r]\).
- There is no validation of whether the pairs satisfy both the GCD and LCM conditions.
- The overall structure that would compute the count of good pairs is missing.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Suppose we test with inputs:
```
l = 1, r = 3, x = 1, y = 3
```
The only good pairs that satisfy GCD = 1 and LCM = 3 would be (1, 3) and (3, 1). 

- The code, in its current form, does not produce any output or logic to find these pairs or their count, because it lacks the main implementation. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of performing the necessary steps.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not perform the computation required to find the number of good pairs of integers and lacks the logic to fulfill the task requirements, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, where the loop executes until `b` becomes 0, and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b), where a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
