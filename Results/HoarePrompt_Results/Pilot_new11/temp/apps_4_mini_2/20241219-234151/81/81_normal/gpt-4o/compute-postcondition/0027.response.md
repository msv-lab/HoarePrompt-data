To derive the output state, we will analyze the provided code snippet `b = z // i * x`, considering the given initial state conditions.

### Analysis:
1. `z` is defined as `y // x`, which means `z` is the integer division of `y` by `x`.
2. `i` is defined as `k + 2`, but the value of `k` is not provided; however, it is stated that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.
3. The variable `b` is assigned the value of `z // i * x`.
   - `z // i` computes the integer division of `z` by `i`.
   - This result is then multiplied by `x` to find the value of `b`.

No other variables are affected during this operation, so we will leave their values unchanged unless specified.

Assuming that the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `count`, and `k` are known integers, we will express the output state while following the conditions of the problem.

Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `count` is an integer, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` is equal to `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x` with `i` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))**.
