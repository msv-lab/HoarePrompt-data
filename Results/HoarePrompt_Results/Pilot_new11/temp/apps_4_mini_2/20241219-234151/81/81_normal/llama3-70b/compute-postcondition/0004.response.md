To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we review the condition `while b:`. Here, the loop will continue as long as `b` is truthy (i.e., not zero). 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states indicate:
- `a` is `b_original` (which means `a` has taken the value of `b` from the previous iteration).
- `b` is `a_original % b_original` (which is the new value of `b` after the reassignment)

For the loop to execute again, we need `b` to be non-zero. Since `b` is currently `a_original % b_original`, we must ensure that this value is greater than zero. This means `a_original` must not be a multiple of `b_original` given that `%` operator produces zero when the dividend is a multiple of the divisor.

Therefore, to guarantee the continuation of the loop, we can conclude that the initial value of `a_original` must not be a multiple of `b_original`.

State: **`a` is `b_original`, `b` is `a_original % b_original` and `a_original must not be a multiple of b_original`**
