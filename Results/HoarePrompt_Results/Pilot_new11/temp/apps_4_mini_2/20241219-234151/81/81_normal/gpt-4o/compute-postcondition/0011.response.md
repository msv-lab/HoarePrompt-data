Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `r` is an integer such that `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`; `count` is 1; `a` is equal to `i * x`; `b` is equal to `(y // x) // i * x;` the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`, and the current values of `a` and `b` are equal (i.e., `a == b`).**
