To understand the final output state after the loop has executed completely, we need to analyze the conditions for the loop execution as well as the changes in the variables throughout the iterations.

### Iteration Details:
1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100000 \)
   - `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings.
   - `examples` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `temp_counter` is initialized before entering the loop (though its initial value is not specified in your prompt, we assume it starts from a baseline value meeting loop preconditions).

2. **Loop Conditions**: 
   - The loop continues while `temp_counter` is less than or equal to \( 2n \) and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.
   - On each iteration of the loop, `temp_counter` increments by 1.

### Checkpoints on Iterations:
- After executing 1 iteration:
  - `temp_counter` has increased by 1 and is still in the range such that \( temp\_counter \leq 2n \).
  
- After executing 2 iterations:
  - `temp_counter` has increased by another 1 (total increase of 2) and is still within the limits, confirming that `str(temp_counter)` keeps being found in `files_set`.
  
- After executing 3 iterations:
  - `temp_counter` has increased by yet another increment (total increase of 3), still adhering to the loop conditions.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `temp_counter` either exceeds \( 2n \) or the string representation of `temp_counter` can no longer be found in `files_set`.
  
- Given that the loop continues to execute until one of these conditions fails, we note the maximum possible value of `temp_counter` before termination is \( 2n + 1 \) (the point at which it can't increment any further).

### Formulation of Output State:
Considering the conditions established in the loop and the maximum value of `temp_counter` that can be achieved when the loop ceases execution, we can conclude:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 2n + 1, `n` is as per the original defined limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and `files` contains at least n strings with `str(temp_counter - 1)` present in `files_set` prior to exit.**
