The `files` list is sorted in place based on the second element of each tuple (the integer `type_`) in descending order. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it only indicates the number of tuples in the list. The contents of `files` will now be ordered according to the specified criterion. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in descending order.**
