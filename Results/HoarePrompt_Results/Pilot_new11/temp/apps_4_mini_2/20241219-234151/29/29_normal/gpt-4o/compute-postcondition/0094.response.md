Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and is not in `files_set`. The original value of `temp_counter` was greater than `2 * n + 1`, meaning the loop did not execute, and its value remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `moves`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` remain the same as initially defined.**
