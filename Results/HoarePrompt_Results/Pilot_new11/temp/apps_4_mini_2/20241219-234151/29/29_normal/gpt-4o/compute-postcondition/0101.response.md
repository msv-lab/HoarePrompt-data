Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `moves` includes an additional entry formatted as 'move {regulars[1]} {temp_counter}'; otherwise, no changes occur to `temp_counter`, `moves`, or the other variables.***
