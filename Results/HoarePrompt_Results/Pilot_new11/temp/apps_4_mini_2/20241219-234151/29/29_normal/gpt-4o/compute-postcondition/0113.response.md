`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The condition states that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` will still be greater than `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `regulars[2]` is str(temp_counter), `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter}', `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`.**
