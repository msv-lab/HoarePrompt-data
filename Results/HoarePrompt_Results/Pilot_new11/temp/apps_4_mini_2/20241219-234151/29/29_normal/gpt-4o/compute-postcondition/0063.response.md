The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was already greater than `2n`, it will remain greater than `2n` after the increment. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is now greater than `2n + 1` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `examples[2]` is set to `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is greater than `2n + 1` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `examples[2]` is set to `str(temp_counter)`.**
