You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
    return moves

Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and consider edge cases that might not be handled correctly.

### Code Overview
The program reads a list of files that can be either examples (type 1) or regular tests (type 0). The desired output is to rename these files such that:
- All example files have names "1", "2", ..., "e" (where e is the total number of examples).
- All regular files follow with names "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n".

The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the required "move" commands to achieve this ordering.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Gaps in Filenames**: The program assumes it can always rename files directly to a new filename without checking if that filename already exists in the set of files at the time of renaming. This is particularly important, as it can lead to overwriting files unintentionally.
  
2. **Incrementing Temporary Filenames**: The logic for determining `temp_counter` attempts to find a new unique filename that does not already exist. This counter will continue to increment until a unique filename is found, but it could potentially keep going indefinitely if not managed properly. Moreover, it might not effectively handle cases when there are significant gaps in filenames or when filenames provided may conflict.

3. **Incorrect Moves**: In the current solution, after deciding on the target filenames, the program makes moves without thoroughly checking if the final state is as expected. For instance, if there are already files named "1", "2", ..., the program could lead to unintended conflicts when placing the renamed files.

### Edge Case
Consider the following input:
```
3
test1 0
test2 0
1 1
```
Expected behavior is to rename "1" to "1", "test1" to "2", and "test2" to "3", resulting in:
```
move 1 1
move test1 2
move test2 3
```
However, if "1" is processed first, the name will already exist when it tries to rename "test1" later. The logic should account for current and future file names, ensuring no conflicts arise.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified above, especially regarding filename conflicts that can occur due to the nesting of the `while` loop and lack of thorough checks, the program does not cover all cases appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of strings `files`, where each string is in the format "name_i type_i". It processes this list to categorize filenames into two groups: examples (type '1') and regular tests (type '0'). The function then ensures the `examples` list aligns to their respective indices, moving names to new identifiers when necessary. This process is repeated for the `regulars`, assigning them either new identifiers if they conflict with existing ones or their designated target positions. The function returns a list `moves` that contains formatted strings detailing the movements of both the example and regular test files. If neither group needs to be moved, the function still generates meaningful identifiers for all entries, while handling possible overlaps with pre-existing filenames effectively. If there are no valid identifiers available for moving either examples or regulars, the function may fail to accommodate those entries, leading to potential edge cases where returns do not capture all states.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
