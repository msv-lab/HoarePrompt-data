The statement `temp_counter += 1` increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. The preconditions indicate that `temp_counter` was previously adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` and is equal to a string in `files_set`, but no specific value is given for `temp_counter`. Thus, we will simply update its relationship based on the increment.

The value of `n` is between 1 and 100000, which ensures that `2 * n` will be between 2 and 200000. However, since `temp_counter` is adjusted to be ≤ `2 * n`, it will also remain within valid limits after being incremented.

The other variables such as `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` remain unchanged according to the given initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must still be ≤ 2 * n and equal to a string in `files_set`.**
