To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

From the provided context:
- `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be an element of `files_set`.

We know that:
- After the last iteration, `temp_counter` must be such that it is not greater than `2 * n`.
- We need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set`.

Assuming `temp_counter` was set to `2n + 2` during the last iteration (for example), then this value would exceed `2 * n`, which would cause the loop to terminate. 

In order for the loop to execute again:
1. `temp_counter` should be adjusted to a value that is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This would typically mean decrementing `temp_counter` so that it is ≤ `2 * n`.
2. We also must ensure that the new value of `temp_counter`, when converted to a string, must be present in `files_set`.

Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be set to a value that fulfills both conditions. We can suggest a specific number for `temp_counter`, keeping in mind that it should not exceed `2 * n` and is also present in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` must be adjusted to ≤ 2n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
