Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range of [1, 100000], `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string, `regulars` is updated such that `regulars[2]` equals `str(temp_counter)`, `i` is 2, `target` is equal to `n + 3`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {str(temp_counter)} {n + 3}' if `regulars[2]` is not equal to `str(target)`.***
