The code `print(len(script))` outputs the length of the `script` list. The `script` list is generated based on the `regular` list, where it contains strings that are constructed for each file in `regular`. The length of `script` is equal to `len(regular)` since we are creating one move command string for each file in `regular`.

Therefore, we can see that `i` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regular)`. The output does not change the values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`, but it confirms that the code is effectively counting the elements in `script`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing strings of length `len(regular)`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, `len(script)` is equal to `len(regular)`.**
