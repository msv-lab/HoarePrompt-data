The variables `name` and `type_` are assigned the values resulting from the `input().split()` operation. The value of `input()` will be a string entered by the user, and `split()` will divide this string into two parts based on whitespace, assigning the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. The value of `n` and the state of `files` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is an empty list, `name` is the first input string, `type_` is the second input string**.
