The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state ensures that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will still satisfy this condition as long as it starts below `2 * n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, and `temp_counter` is now one greater, still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.**
