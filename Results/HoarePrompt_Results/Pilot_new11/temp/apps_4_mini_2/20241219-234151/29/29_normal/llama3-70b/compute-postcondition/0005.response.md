According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be greater than the current iteration count, which starts at 0 and increments with each loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The loop has executed once already (assuming at least 1 iteration was completed).
  
Thus, the next iteration will require `n` to be greater than 1 (since one iteration will have occurred). 

As the loop runs with `_` as the loop variable, this does not affect any specific variable within the loop, but the loop count would go from 1 to 2 for the next execution. 

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- There are no changes to `files`, `name`, or `type_`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `files` is a list containing one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first input string, `type_` is the second input string.**
