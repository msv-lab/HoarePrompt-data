Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; if `examples[2]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)` when `examples[2]` is not equal to `str(3)`, then `temp_counter` must be greater than `2n + 1` and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.***
