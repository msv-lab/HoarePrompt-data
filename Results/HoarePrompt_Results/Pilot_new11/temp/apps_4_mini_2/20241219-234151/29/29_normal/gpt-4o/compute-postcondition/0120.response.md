The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and the parameter `files` is a list of strings where each string is in the format "name_i type_i", with `name_i` being a distinct filename consisting of digits and lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 6, and `type_i` being "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests. After executing the function body, the program returns a list `moves` containing formatted strings for each moved element in `regulars`.
