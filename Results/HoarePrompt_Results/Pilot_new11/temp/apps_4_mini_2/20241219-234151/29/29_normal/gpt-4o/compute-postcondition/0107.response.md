The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that it is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it can take the values of either 1 or 2, while still satisfying the condition of being ≤ 2 * n. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, `temp_counter` is either 2 or 3 and must be ≤ 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
