The line of code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string includes an element from the `regulars` list at index `i` (which is currently 2) and the value of `temp_counter`. The state of other variables remains unchanged, with the exception of updating the `moves` list.

Since `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `regulars[2]` references the third element in that list. 

The final state will reflect the updated `moves` list, which now includes the new string. The values of `temp_counter` and `n` remain the same as per the initial conditions (with `temp_counter` being greater than `2 * n`, and `n` being an integer in the specified range).

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter}'**
