The code appends a formatted string to the `script` list, where `{file}` is replaced with the value of the variable `file`, and `{i}` is replaced with the value of `i`, which is 3. Since `script` initially contained `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`, the operation will add the string `'move {file} 3'` to it. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a non-empty list containing at least 3 elements, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing ['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2', 'move {file} 3'], `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3**
