Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000); `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and not moved; `moves` includes formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 1; `target` is `len(examples) + 2`; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must now be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `temp_counter` must now be a value that appears in `files_set` after increment.**
