The variable `regulars[i]` is assigned the string value of `temp_counter`. Given that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and it is not in `files_set`, we do not know its specific value, but it is known that this change affects only the `regulars[i]` variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`; `moves` now includes an additional entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'; `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars[i]` is a string representation of `temp_counter`, `i`, `target` remain unchanged.**
