According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `examples` list and the value of `i`. The loop will iterate for each index in the `examples` list, starting from 0 up to (but not including) the length of the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once (for index 0). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. The loop checks `i` against the length of the `examples` list. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `i` (which will be 2) is less than `len(examples)`.

Since `examples` is a non-empty list and the current index is 1, the length of `examples` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue. Thus, the states must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; if `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(2)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2n + 2`, `files` still contains at least `n` strings including `str(2n + 1)` in `files_set`, and `moves` contains an additional entry `move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}`.
