According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string corresponding to the current value of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, which means that `temp_counter` can be equal to `2 * n + 1` or less.
- `files_set` must currently include the string corresponding to `temp_counter`, which has been increased by 1 from its previous state (meaning it needs to include `str(temp_counter)`).

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n`. Currently `temp_counter` could be at most `2 * n + 1`, so to ensure it is within bounds for one more iteration, it must be adjusted to be at most `2 * n`.
2. The new value of `temp_counter` (after increment) must still have its corresponding string in `files_set`. This corresponds to ensuring that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is included in `files_set`.

So we can conclude that:
- We need to adjust the upper bound of `temp_counter` to be at most `2 * n`.
- We also need to ensure that `files_set` includes the string corresponding to `temp_counter + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted states are given as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 0; `files_set` must include the string corresponding to the value of `temp_counter + 1`; `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n.**
