To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we consider the initial state and how the loop processes the items in `script`. The loop iterates over the `script` variable, which contains strings.

As the loop executes, `line` takes on each value in `script` and is printed. The number of iterations of the loop is equal to the length of `script`. 

Given that the length of `script` is equal to the length of `regular`, we conclude that the value of `len(script)` determines how many times the loop executes. Since the initial state mentions `regular` is derived from tuples in `files`, and considering that the loop has the potential to execute based on the content of `regular`, we establish that:

- If `regular` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, meaning `len(script)` will be 0 and consequently, `i` will be equal to `len(examples)` (the value of `len(examples)` depends on `files` which in turn depends on the number of tuples where the second element is equal to 1).

- If `regular` has elements, the loop will execute `len(regular)` times, and `line` will have printed all strings in `script`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we apply these principles to determine the output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing strings of length equal to `len(regular)`, if `regular` is empty then `line` has no value printed, if `regular` has elements, `line` has printed all strings in `script`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regular)`, and `len(script)` is equal to `len(regular)`.**
