Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 1; if `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(2)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2n + 2`, `files` still contains at least `n` strings including `str(2n + 1)` in `files_set`, and `moves` contains an additional entry `move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}`.***
