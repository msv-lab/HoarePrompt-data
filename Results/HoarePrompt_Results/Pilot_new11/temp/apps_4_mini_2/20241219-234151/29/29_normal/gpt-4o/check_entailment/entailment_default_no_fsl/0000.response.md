Correctness: **False**

The program does not ensure that every example and regular test is renamed according to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, while it checks for filename conflicts and attempts to resolve them by assigning new identifiers (using `temp_counter`), it may not correctly handle cases where valid identifiers (1 through n) are already occupied. 

For example, if there are more files with type '1' than the number of available spaces in valid identifiers (without filling gaps between them), the program could fail to assign a unique filename to every file. This situation arises if the `files_set` contains numbers from 1 to `n` already, as the program will keep incrementing `temp_counter`, potentially skipping the necessary indices. 

Furthermore, it may not appropriately map every file when several files need renaming, leading to misalignment where not all files end up with the correct numbering at the end of the process. The output hints confirm that the naming process may not lead to a valid and complete renaming as described, resulting in a failure in correctly managing the required outputs. 

Due to these issues, the program does not consistently deliver the expected output according to the problem description for all inputs.
