The code appends a new formatted string to the `moves` list. The formatted string is created using the current values of `regulars[i]` and `target`. 

In the initial state, it is given that `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 2`. We know `i` is 1, so we index into `regulars` at position 1. The condition states that `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`; hence, based on the code, `temp_counter` was previously incremented by 1.

Therefore, the code will add a string formatted as 'move {regulars[1]} {target}' to the `moves` list, where `regulars[i]` is the value at index 1 of the `regulars` list.

No other variables have their states changed in this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `moves` includes an entry formatted as 'move {regulars[1]} {len(examples) + 2}', `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`.**
