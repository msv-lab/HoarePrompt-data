Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented to a value greater than `2n` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. The loop terminates because `temp_counter` exceeds `2n` or `str(temp_counter)` is no longer in `files_set`.**
