You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the renaming of files according to the specified requirements in certain edge cases. For example:

1. Suppose we have the following input:
   ```
   3
   1 0
   2 1
   3 1
   ```
   - This input means that we have three files: "1" (regular test), "2" (example test), and "3" (example test).
   - The expected output should rename "2" to "1" and "3" to "2", resulting in: 
     ```
     move 2 1
     move 3 2
     ```
   - However, during the renaming process, if the script encounters a conflict (for example, trying to rename to a file that already exists), it should overwrite it. The current implementation does not manage this overwriting process adequately, as it may generate moves that do not lead to a unique set of filenames.
   
2. Another edge case could be when all files are examples, for instance:
   ```
   4
   a 1
   b 1
   c 1
   d 1
   ```
   - The expected output should rename "a" to "1", "b" to "2", "c" to "3", and "d" to "4". However, the ordering and move command generation might not handle it correctly due to incorrect utilization of the `temp_counter` which could lead to attempting to move to a filename already existing in the initial set.

The core logic seems to allow for "gaps" in the renaming scheme, thus failing to satisfactorily ensure that each file is named distinctly from 1 to n in a seamless manner.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and files is a list of strings where each string is in the format "name_i type_i", with name_i being a distinct filename consisting of digits and lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 6, and type_i being "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that contains at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is '1'; `regulars` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is not equal to '1'.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` is at least `2 * n + 1` if any examples were moved.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1

            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string, `regulars` is fully updated such that each element corresponds to the appropriate `temp_counter` values or target positions, `moves` contains formatted strings for each moved element in `regulars`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`.
    return moves
    #The program returns a list 'moves' containing formatted strings for each moved element in 'regulars'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of strings `files`, where each string is in the format "name_i type_i". It processes this list to categorize filenames into two groups: examples (type '1') and regular tests (type '0'). The function then ensures the `examples` list aligns to their respective indices, moving names to new identifiers when necessary. This process is repeated for the `regulars`, assigning them either new identifiers if they conflict with existing ones or their designated target positions. The function returns a list `moves` that contains formatted strings detailing the movements of both the example and regular test files. If neither group needs to be moved, the function still generates meaningful identifiers for all entries, while handling possible overlaps with pre-existing filenames effectively. If there are no valid identifiers available for moving either examples or regulars, the function may fail to accommodate those entries, leading to potential edge cases where returns do not capture all states.
