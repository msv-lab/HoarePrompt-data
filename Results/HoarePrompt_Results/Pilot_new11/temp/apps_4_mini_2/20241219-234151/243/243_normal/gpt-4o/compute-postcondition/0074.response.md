To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least one time, we need to understand the condition that controls the loop: `func_1(right) == m`. 

Right before the loop, we have the following values:
- `right` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
- We need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m` for the loop to run.

Since we don't have information about the behavior of `func_1`, we can only ensure that the current state allows for `func_1(right)` to equal `m`. This means that `right` must be set such that `func_1(right)` returns `m`. 

Given that `right` is as defined (based on `low` and `high`), we need to ensure that there is a valid scenario in which `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Therefore, we have to assume that variable adjustments need to be made based on the function, which may not be straightforward. 

Since we cannot make assumptions about the output of `func_1`, we need to at least ensure that `m` is defined and consider the values of `low` and `high` as such that `func_1(right)` can potentially equal `m`. 

Thus the state could be defined for the loop to execute one time as simply ensuring that `func_1(right)` equals `m` when evaluated.

State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`; `func_1(right) must equal m`**
