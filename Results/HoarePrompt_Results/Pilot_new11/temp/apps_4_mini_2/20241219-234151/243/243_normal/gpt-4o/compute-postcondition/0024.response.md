To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

Currently, we know that `right` has been adjusted so that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. For the loop to execute again, we need `func_1(right)` to still equal `m` after the current state. Since `right` was adjusted to fulfill the condition of `func_1(right) == m`, it suggests that no changes to `right` or `m` immediately invalidate this condition. 

However, the state specifies that `left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`. This suggests that `left` does not play a direct role in continuing the loop, so there are no adjustments needed to that state.

Thus, if `right` is currently adjusted, and since the loop's execution is determined by `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`, we can indicate that the necessary state to allow the loop to run once more is that there are no changes needed, as it can execute again by virtue of `right` ensuring `func_1(right) == m`.

State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is adjusted to be `right + 1` such that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`**
