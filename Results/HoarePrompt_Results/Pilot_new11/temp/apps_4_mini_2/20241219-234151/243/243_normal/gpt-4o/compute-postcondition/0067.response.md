Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`; func_1(left) must be equal to `m`**
