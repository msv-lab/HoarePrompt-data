Output State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is adjusted to be greater than the original value of `right` where `func_1(right)` became not equal to `m` after all iterations of the loop. If `func_1(right)` was initially equal to `m`, the loop executed until this changed.**
