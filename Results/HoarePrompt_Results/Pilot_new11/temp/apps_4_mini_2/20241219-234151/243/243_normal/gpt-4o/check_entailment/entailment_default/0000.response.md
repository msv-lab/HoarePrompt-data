The provided code and output hints offer a clear implementation for determining how many integers \( n \) have factorials that end with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by summing how many times \( n \) can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (since trailing zeroes are produced by pairs of 2 and 5 in the factorial product and multiples of 5 are limiting).
   - It correctly returns 0 for \( n < 5 \), which is accurate per the requirement.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - It correctly finds all integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes using a binary search approach. The range considered is \( [0, 5 \cdot (m + 1)] \), which should be sufficient to cover the possible values.
   - The logic for collecting integers (the range starting from the lowest \( n \) with \( m \) trailing zeroes to the highest that still has \( m \)) appears well-suited for the task.
   - The description states that if no integers are found, it returns an empty list, which aligns with the output expectations.

3. **Output Specification**:
   - The output confirms that if there are no integers \( n \) that satisfy the condition, the program will output `0`, as shown in the example for input `5`.

The output hints describe the behavior of each function correctly. The program logic and structure do match the problem description as it accurately accounts for edge cases such as low \( m \) values and employs a systematic search strategy.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the code follows the problem description and handles every specified case correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
