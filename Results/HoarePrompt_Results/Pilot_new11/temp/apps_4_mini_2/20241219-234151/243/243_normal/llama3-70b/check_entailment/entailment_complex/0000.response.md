Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**:
   The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (factorial of n) is determined by how many times the factors of 10 are present in the product, which in turn relates to the factors of 5 and 2. Specifically, the number of trailing zeroes can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   \text{zeroes}(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \ldots
   \]
   This sums up how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., fit into `n`.

2. **Program Flaws**:
   - The inner while loop that checks `if n // 5 ** count < m:` continues indefinitely as it does not actually calculate the trailing zeroes for values of `n`.
   - The program logic is not developed to find the range of `n` such that `zeroes(n) == m`. It lacks the proper implementation to ascertain the number of integers `n` whose factorial ends with exactly `m` zeroes.
   - It does not include logic to track and return the actual values of `n` for which the number of trailing zeroes equals `m`.

3. **Expected Output**:
   The function should return the count of valid `n` values that produce exactly `m` trailing zeroes followed by the values themselves in increasing order. The current implementation fails to properly derive this relationship.

### Conclusion:
Due to the mentioned flaws, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
