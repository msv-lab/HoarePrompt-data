Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + (N + 1)` where N is the number of times the loop executed, and `func_1(right)` must equal m. Additionally, `func_1(right - 1)` must not equal m.**
