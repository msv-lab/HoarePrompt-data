Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is set to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1` while keeping `low` at 0, and `result` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `low` remains 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` contains values from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `right` is adjusted according to the condition specified.***
