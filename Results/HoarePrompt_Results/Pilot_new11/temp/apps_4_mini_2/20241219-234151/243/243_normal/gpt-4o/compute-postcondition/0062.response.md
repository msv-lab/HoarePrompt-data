The code snippet updates the variable `low`. Initially, `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. After the execution of the code, `low` will be assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The values of `high`, `zeroes`, and `m` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is unchanged; and `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is unchanged; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`.**
