You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Annotated Functions:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that n >= 0.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is less than 5, `count` is equal to the sum of all integer divisions of the original value of `n` by powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, ...), and `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than the original value of `n` that caused the loop to terminate. If `n` was initially less than 5, `count` remains 0 and `power_of_5` is 5.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is equal to 0 since n is less than 5, resulting in no contributions from integer divisions by powers of 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` receives a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It does this by counting how many times `n` can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (i.e., 5, 25, 125, ...). The result, stored in the variable `count`, represents the total count of trailing zeroes in `n!`. If `n` is less than 5, the function will return 0, as there cannot be any trailing zeroes. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the number of trailing zeroes for any non-negative integer, including edge cases where `n` is less than 5, returning an accurate count based on the integer divisions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` is less than `5 * (m + 1)`, `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains integers that correspond to the original value of `m` when passed through `func_1`, where the number of zeroes returned matches `m`. If `zeroes` was less than `m` in the last iteration, then `low` would have been updated to `mid + 1`; if `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` would have been updated to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes` were equal to `m`, the loops would finalize the `result` list to include the correct range around `mid`.`
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' that contains integers corresponding to the original value of 'm' when passed through 'func_1', ensuring the number of zeroes returned matches 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000) and searches for all integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It utilizes a binary search strategy with a helper function `func_1` to count the trailing zeroes of `n!`. If it finds a range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it collects those integers into a list named `result`. If no such integers are found, the function returns an empty list. It is important to note that if `func_1` has not been adequately designed to handle the calculation of trailing zeroes for all potential `n`, this could lead to incomplete or incorrect results. Finally, the function returns the list of integers which reflect the extent of `m` trailing zeroes corresponding to their factorials.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
