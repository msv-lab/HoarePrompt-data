The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 2`, which means the updated value will be `(low + high) // 2 + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 3`; `func_1(right)` must equal m**
