Output State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m;` the loop has executed as long as `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, and when it stopped, `left` was decremented until this condition was no longer met.**
