The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Previously, `n` was equal to `n // 5`, which means `n` had a specific value based on an integer division of `n` by 5. After the code is executed, `n` will be `n // 5 + 1`. The output state reflects the updated value of `n`, while `ans` remains unchanged as its previous elements plus the current value of `n` are still valid after the code has executed.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n // 5 + 1`, `ans` includes the previous elements plus the current value of `n`.**
