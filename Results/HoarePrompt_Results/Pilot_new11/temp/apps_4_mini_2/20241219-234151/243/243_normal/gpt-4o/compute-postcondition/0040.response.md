To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(left)` must evaluate to `m`.

Given the state right before the while loop:
- `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.
- The values for `low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- The value of `mid` has already been calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is assigned the result of `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is initialized as an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid`.

The essential part is to ensure that when evaluating `func_1(left)`, it yields the value `m`. Since `func_1(mid)` (which is stored in `zeroes`) may or may not equal `m`, we should focus on its relationship to the `left` variable.

As `mid` is equal to `left`, if `func_1(left)` does not produce `m`, we need to ensure that either `left` is adjusted or that the function `func_1` behaves in a manner that it will return `m` for the value `left`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one time:
- If `func_1(left)` is currently not equal to `m`, we need to confirm that `func_1(left)` should evaluate to `m`. This means iteratively adjusting the conditions of `left` based on previous evaluations.

We can conclude that the condition for the loop's execution isn't initially met and needs to be addressed. Without specific values for `func_1` at `left`, we can consider the condition for `left` based on the values of `low` and `high`, ensuring that when `func_1` is called at `left`, it returns `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `left` must be adjusted such that func_1(left) == m**.
