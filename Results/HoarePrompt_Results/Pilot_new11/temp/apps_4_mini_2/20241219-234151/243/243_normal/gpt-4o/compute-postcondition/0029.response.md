The variable `result` is assigned the value of a list that ranges from `left + 1` to `right`. This means that `result` will now contain all integers starting from `left + 1` and ending just before `right`. The values of `left` and `right` are unchanged from their initial conditions, and the conditions surrounding them are still valid. 

Output State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is adjusted to be greater than the original value of `right` where `func_1(right)` became not equal to `m`.**
