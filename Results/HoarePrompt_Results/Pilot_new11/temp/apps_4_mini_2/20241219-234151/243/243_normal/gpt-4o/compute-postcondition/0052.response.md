According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop can only execute again if `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, but as stated in the given information, `func_1(right)` must currently equal `m` for the loop to potentially execute again. 

Since `right` is defined as `mid + 3`, we need to ensure that this condition remains valid in order for the next iteration to occur without needing any further adjustments. There are no additional adjustments needed because the conditions as stated are already satisfied. 

State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m**
