To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation involved.

The problem requests a function that finds the count of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. It also states that the function should output these integers in increasing order.

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function correctly computes the number of trailing zeros in \( n! \) by counting how many times the factors of 5 can be derived from the numbers up to \( n \) (since trailing zeros are created by pairs of factors 2 and 5, and there are typically more factors of 2 than 5).

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: 
   - The binary search is set up correctly between `low` and `high`.
   - The output is properly initialized, and when the trailing zeroes calculated with `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it looks for boundaries (the range of \( n \) for which the factorial has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros).
   - It effectively decreases to find the left boundary and increases to find the right boundary to gather all integers \( n \) for which \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros before returning them.

**Edge Cases:**
- Since the question indicates \( m \) can be as large as 100,000, it's worth checking whether the upper limit correctly handles large values. 
- One critical aspect is how `func_2(m)` behaves when there's no integer \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. The program should return a count of `0` and an empty list in this scenario, which seems to be accounted for.

**Testing Various Cases:**
- For \( m = 0 \) (though not allowed in the constraints), typical behavior must return multiple integers since trailing zeros would be created by all \( n \geq 5 \).
- For \( m = 1 \), we should get an output of \( [5] \) instead of the expected \( [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \).
- Testing other values like \( m = 5 \) which is cleverly constructed around edge cases can provide insight too.

By evaluating the behavior of the provided Python program along with the outlined examples, it becomes evident that there might be a crucial misunderstanding regarding how many integers would fulfill the requirement based on the counting boundary.

**Conclusion:**
Upon re-evaluating the case when \( m = 1 \):
The expected output states 5 integers whereas \( 5! \) generates \( 1 \) trailing zero.

Thus, this program does not behave correctly for inputs and does not strictly follow the problem description's requirement.

Correctness: **False**. 

We have identified a mismatched scenario for values \( m = 1 \), where the actual expected output does not align with the program's behavior leading to an incorrect verdict.
