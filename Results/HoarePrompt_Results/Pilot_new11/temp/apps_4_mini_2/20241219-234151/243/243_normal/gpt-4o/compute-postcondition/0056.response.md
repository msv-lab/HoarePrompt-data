The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + k` (for some integer k greater than 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
