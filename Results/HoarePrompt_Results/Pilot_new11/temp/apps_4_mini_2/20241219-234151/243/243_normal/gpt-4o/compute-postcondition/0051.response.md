The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The original conditions state that `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and it is implied that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. The values of `left`, `m`, and `func_1(right)` must also remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 3`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m.**
