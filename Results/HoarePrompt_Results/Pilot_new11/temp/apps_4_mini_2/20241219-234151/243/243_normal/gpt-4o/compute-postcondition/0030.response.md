The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is adjusted to be greater than the original value of `right` where `func_1(right)` became not equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
