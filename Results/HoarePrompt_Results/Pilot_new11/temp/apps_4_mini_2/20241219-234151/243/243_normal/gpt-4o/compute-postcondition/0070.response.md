To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `func_1(left)` yields the value of `m`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000),
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`,
- `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`,
- `zeroes` has just been assigned from `func_1(mid)`,
- `result` is an empty list `[]`,
- `left` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 - 2`,
- and we know that `func_1(left)` must currently equal `m` for the loop to continue.

As the loop will execute as long as `func_1(left)` returns `m`, we should ensure that upon the next iteration, `func_1(left)` still equals `m`. If it does not, `left` needs to be adjusted.

However, since we have no specific information about how `func_1` behaves (whether it returns `m` or not), we do not make any assumptions. Furthermore, `left` is defined as being dependent on `low` and `high`, and those bounds ensure that `left` is adequately positioned.

Thus, for the loop to run once more, we simply maintain the current state unchanged, as we do not need to adjust the defined values.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`; func_1(left) must be equal to `m`**
