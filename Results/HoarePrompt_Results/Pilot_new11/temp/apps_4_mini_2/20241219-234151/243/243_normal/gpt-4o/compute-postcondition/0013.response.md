The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we include the values of `m`, `high`, `result`, and `zeroes` as they were defined in the initial state. Since we are not modifying them in this line of code, we use their specific expressions or ranges.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the output of `func_1(mid)`; and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m.**
