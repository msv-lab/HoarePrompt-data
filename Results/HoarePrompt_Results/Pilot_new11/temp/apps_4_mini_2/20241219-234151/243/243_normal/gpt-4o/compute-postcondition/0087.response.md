The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns a list `result` that contains integers corresponding to the original value of `m` when passed through another function, `func_1`, ensuring that the number of zeroes returned matches `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `m` and return a list of integers derived from `m` as processed by `func_1`, with a specific condition on the number of zeroes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer m and returns a list of integers that correspond to m when processed by func_1, ensuring the number of zeroes matches m.**
