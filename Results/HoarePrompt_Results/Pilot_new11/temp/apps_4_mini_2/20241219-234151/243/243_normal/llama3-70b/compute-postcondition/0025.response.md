Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will inherently continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no break statements that terminate it. Therefore, there is no need to modify any variable states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If `m` is greater than 1, then `count` is the maximum such that `1 // 5`, `n` is 2, and `ans` is [1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
