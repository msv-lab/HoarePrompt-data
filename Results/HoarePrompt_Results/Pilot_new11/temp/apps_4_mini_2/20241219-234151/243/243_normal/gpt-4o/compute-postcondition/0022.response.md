According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. Currently, we know that `left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, which means that at this point, `right` must be adjusted to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to execute.

Since `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, we need to ensure that calling `func_1(right)` results in a match with `m`. We do not have specific values for `func_1`, but we must guarantee that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `right` such that `func_1(right)` returns `m`. As such, we need:

1. `right` must be adjusted to a value where `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. 

Since we do not know a specific value to set `right`, but we know `func_1(right)` must return `m`, we can state this condition generically.

State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m;` `right` must be adjusted such that func_1(right) is equal to m**
