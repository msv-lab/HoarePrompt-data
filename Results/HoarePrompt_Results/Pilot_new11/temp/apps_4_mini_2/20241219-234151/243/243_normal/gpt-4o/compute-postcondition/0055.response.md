After analyzing the code and the initial state, we see that:

- `result` is assigned the value of a list that starts from `left + 1` and goes up to, but does not include, `right`. Therefore, the `result` will contain all integers from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. 

- The initial state indicates a defined relationship where `left` is a specific value determined by the last instance that `func_1(left) = m`, and `right` is `mid + k`, ensuring that `right` is greater than `left`.

All other variables remain unchanged during this assignment. 

The exact contents of `result` depend on the specific values of `left` and `right` but can be expressed in terms of those variables.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + k` (for some integer k greater than 1); `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
