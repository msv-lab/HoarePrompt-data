Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and calculates the sum of its digits. It does this by converting the integer to a string, iterating through each character in the string, converting those characters back to integers, and summing them. The function correctly handles the specified range of `n` and returns the total sum of the digits. There are no edge cases addressed for negative integers or non-integer values since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer as per the annotations. Hence, the result is always a non-negative integer representing the digit sum.**
