To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the loop and how the variables interact with each iteration. 

The loop iterates from 1 to `x`, and during each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer `i` (denoted as `digit_sum`). The loop keeps track of the maximum digit sum encountered so far in `max_sum`, and records the corresponding integer in `max_num`. 

1. If `x` is at least 1, then the loop executes from 1 to `x`, and `max_sum` will be updated at least once, specifically for `i = 1` where `digit_sum` will be 1.
2. As `i` increases, `digit_sum` will also increase for various values of `i` up to some maximum determined by `x`. Ultimately, the maximum digit sum will be found for the largest integer that can be represented as a sum of its digits (which typically occurs at certain patterns in the numbers).
3. When `x` is greater than or equal to any number up to the largest digit sum possible from numbers in the given range, `max_sum` will eventually be updated to that maximum value.

If `x` is 1, then after the loop executes:
- `max_sum = 1`
- `max_num = 1`

If any value of `x` greater than 1 is input, `max_sum` will continue to be updated as larger digit sums are found with higher integer values within the limits defined by `x`.

Therefore, the final output state will encapsulate the final values of `max_sum`, `max_num`, and `x`:

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum digit sum of numbers from 1 to `x`, `max_num` is the number whose digits sum to `max_sum`, `x` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.**
