The provided program aims to find the positive integer that is less than or equal to \( x \) and has the maximum sum of its digits. Let's analyze the program step by step to check its correctness against the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads a positive integer \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^{18} \)), as specified in the problem description.

2. **Digit Manipulation**:
   - The program converts \( x \) into a string representation to analyze its digits.
   - It calculates \( n \), the length of the string representing \( x \).

3. **Candidate Generation**:
   - If the first digit of \( x \) is not '1', it generates a candidate by decrementing the first digit by one and appending '9's for the rest of the digits. This ensures the candidate is the largest possible number with a sum of digits that can potentially be greater than that of \( x \).
   - If the first digit is '1', it simply creates a candidate that consists of '9's of one less digit than \( x \).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer \( n \).

5. **Comparison**:
   - After generating the candidate, the program compares the sum of the digits of \( candidate \) and \( x \). If the candidate has a higher sum of digits, it prints the candidate; otherwise, it prints \( x \).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( x \) itself has the maximum sum of digits (such as when \( x \) is already a number ending with 9), the candidate will not be chosen, and it correctly returns \( x \).
   - The only change occurs when \( x \) has a first digit greater than '1', allowing the candidate to potentially have a higher sum of digits.

### Conclusion
The program correctly finds the positive integer that doesn't exceed \( x \) and has the maximum sum of digits, adhering strictly to the requirements of the problem description. It correctly handles the boundary conditions where multiple integers might yield the same digit sum, ensuring the biggest integer is returned.

Correctness: **True**
