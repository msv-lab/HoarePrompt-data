Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1. If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to 1, `max_num` is updated to 1, and `digit_sum` remains 1. Otherwise, `max_sum`, `max_num`, `i`, `x`, and `digit_sum` retain their initial values.***
