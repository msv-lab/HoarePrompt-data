The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `x`. Both `s` and `x` are positive integers, with the constraints that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. However, the output conditions or return values based on the values of `s` and `x` are not provided. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only state the accepted parameters without specifying the functionality related to the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` and `x`, where `s` is a positive integer in the range [2, 10^12] and `x` is a positive integer in the range [0, 10^12].**
