Postcondition: ***`s` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, `x` is a positive integer in the range 0 to 10^12, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^12 - 1. The current value of `x` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`, which means that (1 ^ b) equals `x`.***
