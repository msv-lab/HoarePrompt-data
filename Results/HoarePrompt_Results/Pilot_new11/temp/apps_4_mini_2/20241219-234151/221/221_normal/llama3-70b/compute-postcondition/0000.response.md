The values of `s` and `x` will be updated by reading input values through the `map(int, input().split())`. This means `s` will reflect the first input integer and `x` will reflect the second input integer. The original range constraints of `s` and `x` still hold true after the execution, but their specific values will depend on the input that is provided. 

Output State: **s is a positive integer in the range 2 to 10^12; x is a positive integer in the range 0 to 10^12, updated to the input values.**
