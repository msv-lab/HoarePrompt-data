Upon reviewing the problem description, the original program, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I find that the reasoning in the original assessment remains valid and is supported by the provided annotations.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem description is about a frog that can jump distances determined by two integers `a` and `b` and is constrained to the interval `[0, m]`. The task is to compute the sum of all distinct integers reachable by the frog within this interval.

2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` handles the computation of how many distinct integers the frog can reach by defining `g`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. This is a necessary step as it simplifies the problem when `g` is not 1, thereby preventing an inefficient computation for large values.
   - The conditions checking if `m` is less than `k` or greater than/equal to `k` determine two different calculation paths, which are correctly described in both the original assessment and the code annotations.

3. **Annotated State Evaluation**:
   - The annotations clearly state the states before and after function calls, successfully illustrating how the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g` are manipulated throughout the computation.
   - The interpretations of summing integers in various ranges also hold based on the described conditions for certain ranges of `m`.

4. **Coverage of Cases**: The original assessment points out the handling of edge cases, indicated by its verification of smaller and larger values of `m`, as well as the behavior when `a` and `b` are equal or varying greatly. 

Based on this systematic evaluation:
- The program implements logic consistent with the requirements of the problem statement.
- The annotations corroborate the correctness of the implementation, illustrating how `func_2` computes `f(i)` correctly for all allowed inputs based on the problem constraints.

Thus, I maintain the original assessment stating that the program is correct in its implementation for the specified problem.

Final: **True**
