The function reads three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b` from user input, where `m` can be as large as \(10^9\) and `a` and `b` can be up to \(10^5\). It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` with size `m + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` starting from index 0, by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`. The function iterates through the list updating the number of ways to reach each index according to the defined operations. After processing the list, it sums all the values in `dp` and prints this total, which represents the total number of ways to reach any index from 0 to `m` using the specified operations. Note that the function does not handle cases where `m` is very large since it allocates an array of size `m + 1`, which could lead to memory issues when `m` is close to its upper limit.
