The program aims to calculate the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given it can jump forward by `a` and backward by `b`, while ensuring it stays within the bounds of `[0, m]`. The function `func_2` implements this logic.

### Analyzing the Code

1. **First Function (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function is correct in its calculation of GCD, and it effectively uses recursion, which is appropriate given the integer constraints.

2. **Second Function (`func_2`)**: 
   - This function first finds `g = func_1(a, b)` and then checks if `g != 1`. If `g` is not 1, it recursively calls itself with scaled down versions of `m`, `a`, and `b`, and multiplies the result by `g`. This is an appropriate handling of cases where `a` and `b` share common factors, ensuring the logic scales down correctly.
   - If `g == 1`, it calculates `k = a + b - 1` and checks if `m < k`. If this condition holds, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers, which is correct according to the problem statement for cases where jumps can't reach `b`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates two sums: `sum_k` (the sum of the first `k` integers) and `sum_m` (the sum of integers from `k` to `m`).

### Checking Examples

1. For the input `(7, 5, 3)`, the steps suggest the frog can reach positions `0`, `3`, `5`, and combinations leading to an answer of `19`. The calculated response is consistent with the output hints indicating the correctness of the logic.
   
2. For the input `(1000000000, 1, 2019)`, the logic would determine that every integer from `0` to `m` can be reached, leading to a sum calculated correctly as `500000001500000001`.

3. For the input `(100, 100000, 1)`, the frog cannot jump effectively to other positions beyond 0, thus yielding a simple result of `101` matching our expectations.

4. For the input `(6, 4, 5)`, the output hints align correctly, capping the position evaluations effectively.

### Final Evaluation

All outputs seem correct based on the evaluation of functions for distinct values of `m`, `a`, and `b`. There are no mentioned edge cases where the frog's logic fails, nor any missed conditions that contradict the problem's statement.

Thus, after checking the implementation details and output generation for each case, the program appears to achieve what it set out to do according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
