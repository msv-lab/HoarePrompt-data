In the given code, `dp` is initialized as a list containing `m + 1` zeros. The state of other variables remains unchanged. The previous conditions of `m`, `a`, and `b` hold, but the new variable `dp` is introduced.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5`; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to zeros.**
