The variable `i` has a value equal to `m + 1`. The code snippet `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the `dp` array at index `i + a` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. 

Since `i` is `m + 1`, the index being updated becomes `m + 1 + a`. The value of `dp[i]` is the same as `dp[m + 1]`. Therefore, `dp[m + 1 + a]` will be updated to include the value from `dp[m + 1]`.

The values of variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `dp` remain unchanged in terms of their existence but the content of `dp` at the specific index will be modified. 

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m + 1`; `dp[m + 1 + a]` is updated to `dp[m + 1] + dp[m + 1 + a]`.**
