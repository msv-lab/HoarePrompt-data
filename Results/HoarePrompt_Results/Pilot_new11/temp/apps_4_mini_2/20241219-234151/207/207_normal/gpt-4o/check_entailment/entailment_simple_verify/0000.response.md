The original assessment provided an analysis indicating that the program correctly calculates the total number of distinct integers that the frog can reach, as described in the problem statement. It also discussed the logic behind the functions implemented in the program regarding the calculations of the GCD, the cases where `m` is less than or greater than `k`, and how it computes reachable integers accordingly.

Examining the annotated version of the code further confirms the logic used in the functions:

1. **Function 1 (GCD)**: The GCD function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, which is used to reduce the problem correctly if `g` (GCD) is not 1. This is critical for simplifying the inputs appropriately.

2. **Function 2 (Main Logic)**: In `func_2`, the program successfully determines the reachable integers in two distinct cases:
   - When `m` is less than `k` (correctly returns the sum of integers from 0 to `m`).
   - When `m` is large enough to exceed `k`, it computes the total reachable integers through appropriate summation, thus ensuring correct counting over the valid range.

The annotations reflect the state of arguments within the functions correctly, and the transitions between states show that the logic retains correctness through the recursive calls and the arithmetic calculations. 

Considering both the original assessment and the annotations together, I see that:
- The original assessment rightly identifies all necessary calculations that the frog must perform based on the input constraints.
- The reasoning provided in the original assessment about how the distinct integers are calculated aligns well with the inner workings of the annotated code and confirms the program handles edge cases appropriately.

Thus, the conclusion drawn in the original assessment is well-supported and remains consistent with the behavior detailed in the annotations.

Final: **True**
