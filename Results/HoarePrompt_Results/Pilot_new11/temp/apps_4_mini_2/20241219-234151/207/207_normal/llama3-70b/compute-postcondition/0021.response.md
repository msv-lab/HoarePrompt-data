Output State: **`m`, `a`, `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\); `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` using additions of `a` and subtractions of `b` from the starting index 0; the output is the sum of all elements in `dp`.**
