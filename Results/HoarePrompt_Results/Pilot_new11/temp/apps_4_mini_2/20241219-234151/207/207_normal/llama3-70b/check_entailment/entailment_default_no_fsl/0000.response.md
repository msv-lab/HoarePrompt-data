Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to compute `f(x)` efficiently for each `x` from `0` to `m`. The program uses dynamic programming with a list `dp` which has a size of `m + 1`, leading to excessive memory usage when `m` is large (close to \(10^9\)). 

Moreover, the dynamic programming logic does not align with the mathematical requirements of the problem. Specifically, if the frog is allowed to jump either `+a` or `-b`, the interpretation in `dp` is flawed since it mistakenly accumulates counts of ways to reach positions instead of calculating distinct integers reachable as described.

For example, in a scenario where `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the program should correctly identify the reachable positions. However, because it multiplies counts instead of tracking unique reachable integers, it would not yield the correct results as illustrated in the output hints.

To sum up, there are clearly cases where the program fails to meet the specified requirements of distinct reachable integers, especially in larger input cases or specific configurations of `a` and `b`, thus rendering the correctness of the implementation false.
