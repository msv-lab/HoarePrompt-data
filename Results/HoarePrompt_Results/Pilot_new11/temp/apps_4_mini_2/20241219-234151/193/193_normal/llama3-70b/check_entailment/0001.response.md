Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`, while ensuring that it remains a non-degenerate triangle and each side length must be an integer.

The logic in the program simply computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)`. This does not take into account the need to ensure non-degenerate triangles (i.e., all sides must remain positive and form a valid triangle) throughout the process. 

For example, consider the case where:
- Input: `x = 6`, `y = 3`
- Desired transition: (6, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 3) → (6, 4, 3) → (3, 4, 3) → (3, 3, 3)

The transition requires steps that consider not just the difference between `x` and `y`, but how each side can be reduced while maintaining the properties of triangles.

Thus, the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the desired triangle side length cannot simply be reduced to `abs(x - y)`; the program misses handling intermediate steps and other constraints (like non-degeneracy).

An example that illustrates this flaw:
- Input: `x = 6`, `y = 4`
- The value returned by the function would be `abs(6 - 4) = 2`, but the correct number of seconds required is actually 2 additional transformations, making it a total of 3 required seconds: (6, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 5) → (6, 5, 5) → (5, 5, 5).

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
