To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the given code:

```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to convert an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y` through modifications in integer units while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate.
- The minimum number of seconds required for this transformation is required as output.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. The code calculates the number of modifications directly as `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.
   - The first part `(x - y) // 2` represents the complete side-length modifications by 2 units.
   - The second part `(x - y) % 2` handles any leftover unit if `x - y` is odd.

### Let's check a potential failure case:
- Consider the edge case where `x` is `3` and `y` is `2`. The requirement is to go from (3, 3, 3) to (2, 2, 2):
    - The program would output `(3 - 2) // 2 + (3 - 2) % 2` which equals `0 + 1` = `1`. However, this would not represent the actual transformations needed:
        - (3, 3, 3) to (2, 3, 3) = 1 second
        - (2, 3, 3) to (2, 2, 3) = 1 second
        - (2, 2, 3) to (2, 2, 2) = 1 second
    - Therefore, it takes 3 seconds, whereas the program outputs 1 second.

### Conclusion:
The program does not accurately calculate the minimum time needed for all potential cases, as shown in the counter-example with the input (3, 2).

Correctness: **False**.
