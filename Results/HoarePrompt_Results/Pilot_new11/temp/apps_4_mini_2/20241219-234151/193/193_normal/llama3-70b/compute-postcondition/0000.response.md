In the provided code snippet, `x` and `y` are re-assigned new values based on user input. The input consists of two integers. The initial constraint specifies that `y` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100000 \), but the exact values of `x` and `y` aren't known beforehand; they will be provided as input during execution. 

Since `x` and `y` are directly reassigned with `map(int, input().split())`, their previous values are lost, and they will now hold the new integer values as input from the user.

Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect that `x` and `y` are now equal to the integers provided as input. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are the integers provided as input, satisfying the condition 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000.**
