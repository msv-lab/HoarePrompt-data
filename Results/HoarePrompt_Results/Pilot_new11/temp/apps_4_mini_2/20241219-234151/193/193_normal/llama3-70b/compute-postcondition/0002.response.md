The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The function performs some operations based on these values, which are presumably defined or available in its context, but does not directly take them as inputs. Since the specific output behavior based on `x` and `y` is not provided, the nature of the output is unspecified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the given constraints of `x` and `y`, but it does not have direct inputs. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and performs operations based on internally defined integers x and y that satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000.**
