Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The requirement is to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to reduce the side length of an equilateral triangle from `x` to `y`, while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate at all times. The only operation allowed is to change the length of one side at a time, while all sides must remain positive integers.

The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the rules of triangle modification required to obtain the desired side length. 

For example, consider the provided test case:

Input:
```
8 5
```
According to the problem description, Memory can proceed with the following steps, which are necessary to maintain the triangle's integrity:

1. From (8, 8, 8) to (8, 8, 5) — changing one side to 5 (valid).
2. From (8, 8, 5) to (8, 5, 5) — changing another side to 5 (valid).
3. From (8, 5, 5) to (5, 5, 5) — finally bringing down the last side to 5 (valid).

This process requires 3 steps, but the program outputs `3` based on the difference calculation, which is coincidentally correct for this input but does not hold for all inputs.

Another critical case is:
Input:
```
6 3
```
According to the problem processing outlined in the description, it requires 4 steps to move from (6, 6, 6) to (3, 3, 3). However, the program would output `3` based solely on computing the difference, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program fails to accurately determine the number of modifications needed in all scenarios, leading to the conclusion that the solution is incorrect.
