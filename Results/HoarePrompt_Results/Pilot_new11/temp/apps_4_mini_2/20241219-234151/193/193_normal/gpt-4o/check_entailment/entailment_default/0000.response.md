The program provided does not correctly follow the problem description. The problem requires Memory to modify the lengths of the sides of the triangle in a non-degenerate manner until all sides reach the length \( y \). The output hints indicate that the function computes the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which is intended to calculate the ceiling of half the difference between \( x \) and \( y \). 

However, this calculation does not yield the correct number of seconds required to achieve an equilateral triangle of side length \( y \) for every potential case. Specifically, the process of reducing each side length from \( x \) to \( y \) cannot simply be represented by calculating half the difference since this overlooks how many modifications are necessary for each triangle side. 

For example:
- For inputs \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \), the program outputs \( 2 \), which is incorrect. The correct series of modifications requires \( 4 \) steps as illustrated in the problem description.

Thus, the implementation does not handle the cases correctly where a direct computation based on halves does not faithfully represent the necessary operations to transition every side correctly to the target length.

Correctness: **False**.
