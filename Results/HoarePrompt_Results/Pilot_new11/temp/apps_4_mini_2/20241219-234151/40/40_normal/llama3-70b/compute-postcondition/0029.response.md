In the code provided, `substr` is assigned the value `s[i:j]`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 4. Thus, `substr` will be the substring of `s` starting from index 1 up to, but not including, index 4.

Since `s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it ensures that the substring operation will not exceed the bounds of `s` as the substring will include indices 1, 2, and 3 (providing 3 characters).

No other variables are affected by this operation, so the output state will reflect the new value of `substr` based on the current values of `s`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`**
