The original assessment correctly identifies the shortcomings of the program in meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program's annotations and the assessment further to conclude its correctness.

1. **Palindromic Check**: The function `func_1(s)` successfully checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed form. This functionality is sound.

2. **Handling Short Strings**: The program appropriately handles strings of length 1 or less by returning `0`, as expected since no non-palindromic substring can exist.

3. **Determining Non-Palindromic Substrings**: The core logic of the program checks:
   a) If the entire string is a non-palindrome, it returns its full length.
   b) It checks the substrings that exclude the first and last characters to determine if they are non-palindromic.

4. **Problematic Cases**: The assessment points out an essential flaw in the decision-making process:
   - The checks only cover the removal of the first and last character. Strings could have non-palindromic sections or substrings within but are not being assessed effectively, meaning valid outputs could be missed.
   - For example, considering a string such as "abab", where both the trimmed positions of `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` yield "ab", a palindrome, while the string as a whole is non-palindromic.

Given these factors:
- The annotations support the assessment by demonstrating that while the palindromic check is implemented correctly, the logic that determines the output may lead to ignoring possible valid non-palindromic substrings.
- There are potential scenarios where valid non-palindromic substrings exist but do not get recognized due to the constraints of only checking the edges.

Final: **False**
