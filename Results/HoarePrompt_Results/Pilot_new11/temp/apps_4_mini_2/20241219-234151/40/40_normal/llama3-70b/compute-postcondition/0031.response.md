Postcondition: ***`s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 3. If `substr` is a palindrome, no changes are made to `max_len`.***
