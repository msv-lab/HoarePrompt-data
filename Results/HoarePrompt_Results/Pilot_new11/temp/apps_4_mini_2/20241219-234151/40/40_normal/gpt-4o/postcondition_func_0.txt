The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards); otherwise, it returns `False`. The function effectively handles all valid input cases within the specified constraints, returning a boolean value based on the comparison of the string to its reverse. There are no further checks for edge cases like different character sets or empty strings, as those are explicitly excluded by the preconditions.
