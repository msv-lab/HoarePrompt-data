Postcondition: ***`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr`, the substring of `s` from index 2 to 5, is not a palindrome. In this case, `max_len` is either its previous value or 3, whichever is greater. There is no change when `substr` is a palindrome, as there is no else part in the code.***
