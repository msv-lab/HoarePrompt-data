The value of `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The initial state provides that `substr` is the first three characters of the user-input string `s`. Since `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `substr` is guaranteed to be of length 3, which is less than `n` (greater than 1). The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` do not change as a result of this code. 

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is the first three characters of `s`, and `max_len` is updated to max(max_len, 3)**.
