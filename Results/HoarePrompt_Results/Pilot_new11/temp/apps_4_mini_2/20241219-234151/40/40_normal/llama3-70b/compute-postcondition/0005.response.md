The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, `substr` becomes `s[0:1]`, which is the first character of the string `s`. This means that `substr` will be a substring consisting of the first letter of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`**
