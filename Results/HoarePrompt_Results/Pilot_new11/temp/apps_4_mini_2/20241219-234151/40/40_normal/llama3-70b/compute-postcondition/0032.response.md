Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings found in `s` starting from index 1. If all substrings starting from index 1 are palindromic, `max_len` remains as its initial value.**
