You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]


```
Original Assessment: The provided program attempts to determine the length of the longest substring of a given string that is not a palindrome. Let's analyze the code based on the problem description and the requirements to identify any potential pitfalls.

1. **Identifying Palindrome**: The function `func_1(s)` checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse.

2. **Key conditions**:
   - If the length of the string `s` is 1 or less, it correctly returns `0`, as there's no non-palindromic substring possible.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it returns the length of `s`.
   - It also checks the substrings by removing the first character (`s[1:]`) and the last character (`s[:-1]`). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it returns their respective lengths.

3. **Potential issues**: 
   - The program does not consider cases where the whole string could be a palindrome but still have a longer non-palindrome substring contained within it. 
   - For instance, if the string were "aab", the whole string is not checked directly for a non-palindromic substring of length 3, while it can have "aa" (length 2) which is a palindrome but also allows for the whole string to be counted as not a palindrome as expected. 

4. **Specific counterexample**:
   - Consider the string "abcba". The string itself is a palindrome (length 5), but if we took `s[:-1]`, which results in "abcb", we see that it has no further substrings of length 4 that would get checked, leading to a minimum case of just `0` being returned.

Because of these points, particularly the failure to cover all possibilities effectively leaving valid cases ignored when the function logic checks only the trimmed edges of the string (and possible palindromes being too strictly filtered), it will lead to incorrect outputs in examples where non-trivial non-palindromic substrings exist.

Given that there are examples where the code will return incorrect values based on the relations stated above, I determine the program is incomplete and mistakenly designed for the outlined task.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards); otherwise, it returns `False`. The function effectively handles all valid input cases within the specified constraints, returning a boolean value based on the comparison of the string to its reverse. There are no further checks for edge cases like different character sets or empty strings, as those are explicitly excluded by the preconditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
