To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the program's logic in relation to the requirements outlined:

1. **Input and Output Requirements**:
   - The input is a non-empty lowercase string of length at most 50.
   - The program should output the length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, it should output `0`.

2. **Palindromic Check**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

3. **Logic in Main Program**:
   - If the input string `s` is of length less than or equal to 1, it can't contain any non-palindromic substring, so the program correctly prints `0`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s)` returns `False`), the program prints the length of `s`, which is correct since the entire string is the longest non-palindrome substring.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program checks substrings obtained by removing one character from either end (`s[1:]` or `s[:-1]`). If either of those resulting substrings is not a palindrome, it prints that substring's length minus one, which is also valid since removing one character from a palindrome may yield a non-palindrome.
   - Finally, if both checks return `True` (indicating both substrings are palindromes), the program prints `0`.

4. **Coverage of Problem Description**:
   - The program correctly identifies when to return `0`, the length of the whole string if it is not a palindrome, and the length of smaller substrings when applicable.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program considers edge cases properly with the initial checks for string length and handles the case of strings composed entirely of the same character by correctly returning `0`.

In conclusion, the program implements the logic required by the problem description correctly, accounting for different string scenarios and properly determining whether substrings are palindromes or not.

Based on this analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
