Postcondition: ***`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `substr` is the first three characters of `s`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of `max_len` and 3. There is no change to `max_len` if `substr` is a palindrome.***
