Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here is a detailed explanation of how it meets all the requirements:

1. **Palindrome Check**: The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). This is consistent with the problem's definition of a palindrome.

2. **Length Check and Outputs**:
   - The first check in the program (`if len(s) <= 1:`) correctly identifies that any string with length 1 or less cannot have a non-palindromic substring, returning `0` in such cases.
   - The program then checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it correctly returns the length of `s` (i.e., the longest non-palindromic substring is `s` itself).
   - Next, it checks the substrings `s[1:]` (the string without the first character) and `s[:-1]` (the string without the last character). If either of these are not palindromes, it returns the length of the original string minus 1, indicating the longest non-palindromic substring by removing one character from either end.
   - If all potential non-palindromic substrings are indeed palindromes, the final `else` branch correctly returns `0`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The logic accommodates edge cases where strings may consist of identical characters (like "qqqqqqqq") by explicitly checking both the full string and its truncated forms.

4. **Correct Outputs**: The outputs for the example inputs provided in the problem description align with the expected results. 
   - For "mew": It's not a palindrome, so the output is `3`.
   - For "wuffuw": Trimming either end gives non-palindrome "uffuw", resulting in `5`.
   - For "qqqqqqqq": All substrings are palindromes, thus output is `0`.

Therefore, the program successfully follows the problem description by checking for palindromic conditions and returning the correct length of the longest non-palindromic substring or `0`. The logic flows logically and covers all possible scenarios given the constraints, confirming the correctness of the program as per the specifications.
