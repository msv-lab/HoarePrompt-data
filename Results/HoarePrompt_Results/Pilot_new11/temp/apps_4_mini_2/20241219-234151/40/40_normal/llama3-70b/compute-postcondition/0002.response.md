The variable `max_len` is initialized to 0, but the values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged. The integer `n`, which is equal to `len(s)`, reflects the length of the user-input string `s`. Therefore, the output state only changes `max_len` to 0.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the integer value equal to `len(s)`, `max_len` is 0**
