Functionality: **The function reads a non-empty string `s` of lowercase English letters from user input and calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found within `s`. After evaluating all possible substrings, it prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substringâ€”returning 0 if all substrings are palindromic. Edge cases include handling the scenario where the input string `s` is a single character (resulting in a maximum length of 0), as well as diverse configurations of characters in `s` that may lead to varying lengths of non-palindromic substrings. The function does not accept parameters, and the string must be input interactively, which could present an inconsistency with the stated parameter in the annotations.**
