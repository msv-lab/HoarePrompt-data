Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Relational Operator Implementation**: The program relies on the `func_1` function to compute the decimal value of the numbers represented as strings. However, this function only processes one string at a time and does not correctly handle the representation of the golden system for all possible binary inputs. 

2. **Power Computation**: The function computes the value using `q ** (n - i - 1)` but fails to account properly for the `value` computation reset when transferring from one binary digit to another. The current format of the calculation means that the relative positioning (0s and 1s) is improperly utilized and can produce inaccurate results. 

3. **Directness of Input/Output**: The program assumes that all comparisons between binary strings can be handled only using the computed `value` from `func_1`. If the strings represent decimal values that can lead to the same overall computed value, they should yield `=` based on the output specification clearly detailed in the problem statement, but this comparison could fail if the underlying calculation of values were to falter based on aforementioned issues with positional values.

4. **Zero Representation**: The representation of leading zeros might not be handled correctly if they do not impact the value meaningfully in terms of how the golden number is assessed. The output equality does not account for leading zeros affecting computation, which does not align with how numbers are formally represented in binary.

Overall, the main concern comes from improper handling of the binary string values and how they convert to decimal representations in the golden system using the golden ratio `q`. Thus, the program has a fundamental flaw in its logic and cannot accurately determine which of the two numbers is larger, smaller, or if they are equal in accordance with the defined problem constraints.
