You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the requirements.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two strings of '0's and '1's as input, representing numbers in the golden system.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the decimal value of the golden system number by using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \) where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. **Comparison of Values**: After computing the decimal values of the two input numbers, the program compares them and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on the comparison.

### Issues to Consider:
- I need to check whether the floating-point arithmetic might lead to issues, especially given that `q^n` can grow very large and `n` can be up to 100,000. This can lead to imprecision errors in floating-point calculations.

### Potential Test Case:
Let's consider a corner case:
- Assume inputs that would produce very close values or values that are supposed to be equal but differ slightly due to floating-point precision issues.
  
Example test case:
- Input: `1` (which represents \( q^0 = 1 \))
- Input: `01` (which represents \( q^1 = q \approx 1.618 \))

Expected output: `<`, because \( 1 < q \).

However, if due to floating-point inaccuracies, one of the numbers evaluates to a value that seems larger because of precision errors, this can produce an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for floating-point inaccuracies when computing and comparing values derived from a formula involving \( q^n \), the program could produce incorrect results for inputs that produce close values.

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness for all cases. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `s`, which is expected to be a list containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters. It computes and returns the decimal representation of the concatenated binary values of these strings, interpreted as a single binary number using the golden ratio as the base for conversion. However, it does not effectively concatenate the two strings before conversion; instead, it operates on them individually without addressing their combined binary value properly. The final state of the program will hold a decimal value based on the interpretation of the reversed binary digits from the individual strings, but it will not account for cases where both strings should be considered as a single binary input. Importantly, if `s` does not contain exactly two items, the behavior may be undefined, as the code assumes this invariant is always met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
