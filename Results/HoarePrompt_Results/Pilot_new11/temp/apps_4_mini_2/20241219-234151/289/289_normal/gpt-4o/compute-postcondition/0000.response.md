The variable `n` is reassigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts user input and converts it to an integer. Since the previous state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, this means that after this assignment, `n` will hold a new integer value given by the user, which is also expected to be in the same range unless the input constraint is violated by the user. 

Since the output does not provide specific numbers for the input, we will represent `n` as the new integer input. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18.**
