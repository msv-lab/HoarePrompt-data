Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The logic implemented for determining if the sum of the costs (i + (n - i)) has nines at the end is faulty.

### Example case where the program fails:
For `n = 14`, the expected output is `9` as outlined in the problem. However, the logic used in the check:

```python
if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
```

does not correctly determine if a number ends with a specific number of nines. This code segment will only check if the sum ends with a zero in the most significant digit + 1 position. This fails to handle cases where multiple nines might be at the end of the sum, which requires a different approach.

Moreover, for `n = 50`, the only correct pair that gives the maximum number of 9s (i.e., `49 + 50 = 99`) is not being counted accurately.

Thus, since the program does not adhere to the requirements of counting pairs correctly in all cases as specified in the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
