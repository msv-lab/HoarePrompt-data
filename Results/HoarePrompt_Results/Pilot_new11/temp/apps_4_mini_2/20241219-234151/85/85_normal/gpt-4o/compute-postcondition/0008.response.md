According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. The condition implies that `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10 for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, which means `n + 1` is 1. Since 1 is not a multiple of 10, the loop cannot execute again.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n + 1` needs to be adjusted to be equal to 10 (the next multiple of 10). Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to `n` must be 9.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
